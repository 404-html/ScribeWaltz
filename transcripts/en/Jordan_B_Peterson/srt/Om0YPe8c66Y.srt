1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,590
The first thing I already explained to
you that about the shift in our emphasis

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,760
from here on in
and I suppose in some ways where we're

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,780
switching from the part of the purse,
of course it has to do with

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:20,781
transformation into the part of the
course that has to do with stability,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,980
at least relative stability.
Now the idea behind the work that we're

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,981
going to talk about now is that
personality has stable and identifiable

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,770
features across time and I suppose it's
traits that you're referring to when you

8
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:42,540
say to yourself or to someone else,
I know that person

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,320
and when you say that you know that
person,

10
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,580
it seems to me that you're presuming
that there's something stable and

11
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,000
identifiable about them that you can
track over time.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,570
You might consider that who they are
and so trait theory

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,910
is the study
of who people are.

14
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,090
Now,
if there's 17,000 trait descriptors in

15
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:17,091
the English language,
that suggests in some way that there are

16
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:22,050
17,000 ways that people can vary or be
the same.

17
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,740
No vary from each other and be the same
across time.

18
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,340
But 17,000 seems like not an
unmanageable number and it's possible

19
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:33,654
that

20
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,740
a very large number of those words are
variance there,

21
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
synonyms in some sense,
and trait theory in some ways is an

22
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:52,011
attempt to find
the clumps of synonymous words that are

23
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,890
encapsulated within language that apply
to people.

24
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,360
The basic hypothesis is something like
this

25
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,130
because tracking the behavior of other
people is extremely important to us and

26
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,140
because we want to communicate about
that tracking and because we're studying

27
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,380
each other all the time,
there's at least a reasonable

28
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:21,381
probability that the fundamental
dimensions of personality are going to

29
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:27,171
be encapsulated within the language and
what that means in some senses that you

30
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,750
may be able to use the language as a
tool if you use the appropriate

31
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,751
statistical techniques in order to
extract out the fundamental dimensions

32
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,270
of personality.
And so you could say those are the

33
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:43,260
basic.
Imagine there's five or six canonical

34
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:48,261
words or 10 canonical words within that
collection of 17,000 and then all the

35
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:55,341
others are slight variance of the more
mixtures of them more or something like

36
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,770
that.
So perhaps there's a simple structure

37
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,780
underneath the apparent complexity.
The first people who tried this,

38
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,160
as I said,
we're all part allport and Odbert,

39
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,740
but they really didn't have the
statistical techniques that were

40
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:15,270
necessary to do a particularly good job.
So,

41
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,104
uh,

42
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,050
all port Nordberg tried to reduce their
18,000 treat terms to 4,500 descriptors

43
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,810
of what they figured we're stable
traits.

44
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,040
And then cattle came along in 1942
restricted those two,

45
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,180
171 by judgment.
And then further to 16 by factor

46
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,810
analysis.
These are cattell 16 traits.

47
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,811
The first three were the most important.
You could be reserved versus outgoing,

48
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,990
less or more intelligent,
emotional versus stable,

49
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,270
humble versus assertive,
sober versus happy,

50
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:09,910
go lucky.
Expedient versus conscientious,

51
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,410
shy versus fincher,
some tough tender minded,

52
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,540
trusting,
suspicious,

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,580
practical,
imaginative,

54
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,290
forthright,
shrewd,

55
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,120
placid,
apprehensive,

56
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,490
conservative or experimental,
group oriented yourself,

57
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,590
sufficient casual versus controlled and
relaxed versus tense.

58
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:38,130
And cattell 16 personality theory
dominated the field for,

59
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,390
for quite a long time,
really,

60
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:45,391
until the early 19 sixties.
Um,

61
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,210
now we'll go back,
tell you a little bit about how these

62
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:56,000
things are measured.
Here's some,

63
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,570
here's some definitions of what a trait
might be.

64
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,010
This is the theoretical theories or
theoretical propositions.

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,910
The trade has more than a normal
existence.

66
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,980
What does that mean?
Well,

67
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,270
it refers to something that's outside
its linguistic marker,

68
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,940
so hypothetically there's something
about a trait that that makes it real.

69
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,420
That might be physiological or
biological or at least behavioral that

70
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,850
that that can be examined.
The outside mirror subjective analysis,

71
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,050
although that's often proved more
difficult than people originally

72
00:05:33,051 --> 00:05:36,560
expected traits are more generalized in
particular habits.

73
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,200
Oh God only knows how many habits people
have.

74
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,970
You know,
when you kind of maybe you run into the

75
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:44,900
same problem with habits as you do with
with 17,000 words.

76
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,740
There's so many of them that you know
you can drown in the description and

77
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,180
again,
you have to look for something that's

78
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,870
more fundamental.
They're dynamic and determined behavior,

79
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,870
so there's something about a trait that
in some sense acts as a causal agent,

80
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,590
traits me be identified empirically.
We covered that.

81
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,380
Traits are relatively independent of
other traits.

82
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,630
They're not synonymous with moral or
social judgements and acts and even

83
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:16,631
habits that are inconsistent with a
trait or not proof of the nonexistence

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,290
of that trait.
And then the more complex one trades me

85
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,530
either be viewed video graphically in
light of the personality that contains

86
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:29,030
them or nomothetically on the basis of
their distribution in the population

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
measurement techniques.
So imagine that you collect your list of

88
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,400
adjectives and then

89
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,810
you transform them into a very simple
questionnaire.

90
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,750
And so the questionnaire would look like
a list of adjectives down the lefthand

91
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,570
side.
And then on the righthand side there'd

92
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:04,470
be maybe a scale that's yes or no or
maybe a scale from one to seven.

93
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:07,830
And so if the descriptor was
intelligent,

94
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,900
you could ask the person apply that
descriptor to yourself on a scale from

95
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,720
one to seven.
Or You could ask the person to rate

96
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:20,721
someone else and describe that person as
intelligent on a scale of one to seven.

97
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,260
And then you can have,
let's say a large group of adjectives

98
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:30,690
like that.
Three hundred or so.

99
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,900
And then you can have a large number of
people assess themselves with all those

100
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,890
adjectives and you can apply statistical
techniques that then allow you to

101
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:45,870
determine how the data is pattern.
So for example,

102
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,090
if two of the 400 words,
we're intelligent and smart,

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,040
and you might find that within the
entire population of raiders,

104
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,300
if they are rating themselves,
if they rated themselves as high on

105
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,880
intelligence,
they're also going to rate themselves as

106
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,060
high on smart and maybe high on quick
and maybe high on insightful.

107
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,920
And then you may also find,
for example,

108
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:17,460
that if they rated themselves as nice,
highly,

109
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:22,461
they might also rate themselves as kind,
highly or empathic highly.

110
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:27,890
And so by analyzing the groups of words
that clumped together in the same

111
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,230
direction across many,
many people,

112
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,770
you can start to in and you can do this
statistically,

113
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:38,550
you can start to infer what the
fundamental dimensions of variation are.

114
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,410
Now it's taken a long time for people to
get the fundamental dimensions of

115
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:46,050
variation right?
And part of the problem is,

116
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,230
well,
how do you reduce the pool of adjectives

117
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,870
to begin with to something that's
because you're not going to have,

118
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,870
you know,
a thousand people rate themselves on 17

119
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,240
adjectives,
that's just not going to go very well,

120
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,830
so you have to reduce that in some way
that's not exactly biased and then you

121
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,040
have to get enough people to fill it out
so that your sample is going to be

122
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,270
reliable across time.

123
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,350
And then you have to have statistical
techniques that are powerful enough to

124
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,620
handle those operations.
And that already didn't come together

125
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,500
until probably the early 19,
60,

126
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,590
something like that.
When,

127
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,470
when when cartels 16 factors were
finally reduced to something

128
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:26,790
approximating five.
Now I'm going to tell you a little bit

129
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,510
how you would go about making a
questionnaire because that's part of

130
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,890
what you need to know in order to do
experimental psychology,

131
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,230
especially social and personality
psychology.

132
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,210
And so we'll step into method a little
bit before we returned to the,

133
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,600
to the trait theories.
So if you want it to measure something,

134
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,740
let's see someone think of a potential
personality trait.

135
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:58,340
Don't,
don't use the standard big five how.

136
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,940
Give me a word that you might use to
describe someone

137
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,030
fun.
Okay,

138
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:09,290
good.
So now,

139
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,890
now we have to figure out.
So now we've got a problem and the

140
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:14,800
problem is,
well,

141
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,840
you can use fun as a marker in a
linguistic exchange.

142
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,240
Joe is a fun person to hang around with
and then

143
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,650
part of the meaning that you attribute
to fund is a consequence of the words

144
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,140
that you surrounded with and then of
course the context in which you uttered

145
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,060
the sentence and your determination of
whether or not the person you're talking

146
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:44,061
to knows who joe is and and so you're
always providing the person that you're

147
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,160
communicating with.
When you use a word like fun with a

148
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,890
bunch of information that sort of
surrounds the word so that they can

149
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:52,920
infer what you meet,
but if you're going to

150
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,420
use that word and infer that it actually
ref refers to something that's objective

151
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,260
outside language,
then you have to go about it in a

152
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,450
different way.
And so the first thing you try to do is

153
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:08,010
to figure out,
okay,

154
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,430
what do you mean by fun?
Exactly.

155
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,830
So let's have some characteristics of a
person who's fun.

156
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,923
What do they like?

157
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,870
We can't use big five descriptors.
That's,

158
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,860
that's okay.
But that's,

159
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,960
that's right,
by the way.

160
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,740
But
I want to stay away from that just just

161
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:31,574
for

162
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,590
funny.
Okay.

163
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,030
Okay.
So a funny,

164
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,570
a fun person is funny and so a funny
person is someone who makes you laugh,

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,340
I presume.
And who's witty?

166
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,610
And so you could start generating
associated words.

167
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:46,350
Okay.
What else makes a person fun?

168
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,800
They're interesting.
Okay.

169
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,230
So they're funny and they're
interesting.

170
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,730
What else?
Friendly.

171
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,970
Okay.
Enthusiastic,

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,140
talkative,
lighthearted,

173
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,490
lighthearted.
Alright,

174
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,230
you guys are really getting into this
now.

175
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,300
Okay.
So you're starting to surround the word

176
00:12:10,301 --> 00:12:14,230
with a cloud of additional words that
you believe in.

177
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,720
Some,
in some ways have some important

178
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,820
similarity with that underlying work.
Right?

179
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,950
They seem to belong in the same
category.

180
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,490
Okay.
What are some words that,

181
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,460
that indicate that someone's not fun.
Okay.

182
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,080
So they're boring,
miserable,

183
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,960
miserable.
What's the difference between boring and

184
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:36,961
miserable?
That's a good one.

185
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,990
Yeah.
Misery can be interesting.

186
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,153
Yeah,
yeah,

187
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,330
yeah.
Okay.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,150
So are other differences between boring
and miserable?

189
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,770
That's probably an open answer by the
way.

190
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,860
Just just so you know,
any other differences?

191
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,690
Come on.
You guys know the difference between

192
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,030
boring and miserable for God's sake.
Yeah.

193
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,783
Boring.

194
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,120
Okay.
So boring sounds like it's more neutral

195
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:07,190
in some sense.
Miserable.

196
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,160
Was that,
is that a positive thing or negative

197
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:11,330
thing?
Negative.

198
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:11,901
Okay.
So,

199
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:16,010
and what sort of emotions might it be
associated with depression?

200
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,300
Sadness,
depression.

201
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:20,540
What else?
Anxiety.

202
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,970
Hate,
hate.

203
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,600
Fear.
Cynicism.

204
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,913
Okay.
So

205
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,430
now we've got the fun person sort of
identified with regards to a positive

206
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:36,020
pole at a negative pole.
Right?

207
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,363
Alright.
So

208
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,220
you can conduct a brief statistical
investigation to determine whether or

209
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:48,200
not your characterization of fun had any
utility was,

210
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,500
was,
was valid in some sense and reliable and

211
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:54,710
valid.
So the first thing we might do is write

212
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:58,040
down all those words on a,
on a little questionnaire.

213
00:13:58,041 --> 00:14:00,110
So we probably generated about 20 of
them,

214
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:05,111
me and then we might ask everyone to
rate themselves according to that

215
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,580
questionnaire.
And then we,

216
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:13,581
we might submit the
data set to factor analysis,

217
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:16,310
which is a complicated form of
correlation analysis,

218
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:19,550
and then we could find out what words
clump together.

219
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,440
Now what we would find if we analyzed
all the words that you guys generated is

220
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:29,441
that we'd have one little clump that was
associated with interesting and we'd

221
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:33,890
have another clump that was associated
with negative emotion and we'd have

222
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,290
another clump that was associated with
positive emotion.

223
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,650
And so you guys actually define fun as a
three dimensional construct from given

224
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:45,110
what we know about personality,
because we know that there's a positive

225
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:47,330
emotion dimension at a negative emotion
dimension.

226
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,600
And then another dimension that's
associated with creativity and so from,

227
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,180
for at least in so far as you all
characterized it,

228
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:58,370
fund is not a unidimensional word.
It,

229
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,620
it crosses a variety of different
domains now.

230
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,090
So if you're,
if you're trying to get at how to

231
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,490
measure fun,
the first thing you have to do is define

232
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,720
it.
And that's what we're trying to do.

233
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,250
When we were collecting up all these
words.

234
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:15,251
I'll show you how cattle in 1965
characterized conscientiousness.

235
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,251
So he says,
well,

236
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:21,170
this thing exists,
and in its existence it manifests these

237
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,230
characteristics.
Conscientious is conscientiousness is

238
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,550
that disposition,
governing,

239
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,770
persevering,
unselfish behavior,

240
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:31,640
and impelling the individual to duty as
conceived by his or her culture.

241
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,130
A conscientious person is honest,
knows what is right and generally does

242
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,750
it even if no one is watching him or her
does not tell lies or attempt to deceive

243
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:44,900
others,
respects other's property and

244
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:47,570
unconscientious person is somewhat
unscrupulous,

245
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,610
not too careful about standards of right
and wrong,

246
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:53,240
were personal desires are concerned,
tells lies and is given a little

247
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:56,150
receipts and does not respect others'
property.

248
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,620
So you can imagine how you could
transform that definition into a

249
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:02,780
questionnaire.
You could use the adjectives that are in

250
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:05,180
it and just have people rate themselves
by the adjectives.

251
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,970
Or you could use little phrase phrases
like,

252
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,010
do you respect others?
Property one to seven,

253
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,490
I'm,
do you have a strong sense of the

254
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,190
difference between right and wrong?
If you know what's right,

255
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,810
do you generally do it?
Are you a persistent person?

256
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,640
Are you unselfish?

257
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,140
So you can extract out individual items
from your sort of global definition of

258
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:39,141
what constitutes the hypothetical trait
and there's some of the examples.

259
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,670
You usually keep emotions under control.
Are you a person who is scrupulously

260
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,520
correct and manners and social
obligations and likes others to be the

261
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:50,520
same?
Are you cautious and considerate so that

262
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,720
you do not hurt people's feelings by
unconsidered conversational remarks?

263
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,650
I liked the adjective approach in some
ways because you might notice that the

264
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:03,300
last question there plumps a number of
descriptors together and it isn't

265
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,500
absolutely certain that all those
descriptors belong in the same question.

266
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,460
And so I would say this is was
constructed quite a long time ago and I

267
00:17:11,461 --> 00:17:14,220
would say if you're going to construct
questions you should try to answer,

268
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,030
you try to ask as close to one thing as
possible because otherwise the question

269
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:21,470
gets confusing.
So I would say the,

270
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,820
you know,
the second question also has the same

271
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,890
problem.
All right?

272
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:31,670
So if you're going to make your
questionnaire and let's say you're,

273
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,170
you're trying to figure out how fun
someone is

274
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,820
and simultaneously figure out whether or
not investigating fund is actually a

275
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:41,100
reasonable thing to do.
We'd like,

276
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,100
is it,
is it a scientifically valid category?

277
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,390
Then you might want to generate whole
bunch of items and also put some in

278
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:56,391
there that don't obviously measure fun.
So let's have some descriptors that

279
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,970
don't seem to fall on the fun non-funded
dimension.

280
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,870
What's outside of that?
Okay.

281
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,464
Which one?

282
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,203
I would say.

283
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,490
Okay.
And defined.

284
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,324
STOIC.

285
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,930
Careful with your words not having an
excess of emotional.

286
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,211
Okay.
So.

287
00:18:25,211 --> 00:18:28,370
So you think you could you think you can
be fun to not have an excess of

288
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:31,520
emotional response and I'm not trying to
put you on the spot,

289
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:34,070
I'm just,
I'm just wondering if that's what you're

290
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,904
claiming

291
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,680
because just because you're a situation.

292
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,033
Okay.

293
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,133
Yeah.

294
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,240
Okay.
Okay.

295
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,440
So what,
what other,

296
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,480
what other descriptors?
Look,

297
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,000
I mean fun can't mean everything,
right?

298
00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:03,480
Because if it means and everything,
then it's not a useful word because the

299
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,240
word has to be some things and not other
things.

300
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,440
That's
convergent.

301
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,730
Divergent validity in a sense.
A word can't mean everything.

302
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,890
It has to be something specific.
So what does,

303
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,280
what's outside of the fund?
Non funded me.

304
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,590
Yeah.
So you can be fun and stupid fact,

305
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,900
fact that might even be easier.
Alright.

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,770
So intelligence might be outside of
that.

307
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,040
What else might be.
And you could be envious and fund still

308
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,180
seems least probable.
How about me?

309
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,030
Can you be mean and fun?
Yeah.

310
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,060
So that's kind of interesting.
So,

311
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:48,360
so
okay.

312
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,340
Okay.
So now we're starting to get the idea

313
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:54,330
that fun circumscribes one dimension,
but there are other potential dimensions

314
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:57,190
variation outside of that that might be
interesting to look at.

315
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,430
And so we've sort of thought about,
we thought sort of thought about.

316
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,430
I mean,
you know,

317
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,350
we thought about intelligent.
What else did we come up with?

318
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,490
What else is sort of outside of the fun
realm?

319
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,153
Patient.

320
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,670
Okay.

321
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,750
Okay.
So you can be impatient fund or patient

322
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,320
fun.
Alright.

323
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,900
Seems reasonable.
Fashionable.

324
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,430
Yeah.
Okay.

325
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,470
Is that,
do you think that's a person who said

326
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:26,200
that you think that's a personality
trait?

327
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,280
I think it means that you pay
it.

328
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:39,771
Yeah.
Okay.

329
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:40,580
So,
so you,

330
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,990
you definitely do think it's a
personality characteristic and that

331
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,270
that's fine.
It could well be,

332
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:45,450
you know,
um,

333
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,940
is there a difference between a
personality characteristic and an

334
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:49,774
emotion

335
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,630
you think?
Do you think emotion is inside

336
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:00,640
personality?
So it's nested inside it.

337
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:04,000
The personality is the larger category
of emotion is the smaller category.

338
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,253
Yeah,
it's a,

339
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,270
it's a funny thing because there's lots
of,

340
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,220
there's lots of a priority suppositions
in psychology that you have to watch out

341
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,650
for.
And one of them is that just because

342
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:17,320
there's different words for different
things,

343
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,970
that doesn't mean those different things
really exists separately as separate

344
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:25,360
things do in scientific terminology.
So for example,

345
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,230
the relationship between personality
traits and emotions and values is

346
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:32,410
relatively unclear whether those things
belong in the same or different

347
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:35,830
categories is by no means clear and
people will claim that they do.

348
00:21:35,831 --> 00:21:39,100
But um,
the overlap is substantial,

349
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,360
so.
Okay.

350
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,033
Yes.

351
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,530
We also usually think of emotions as
being more like we're all,

352
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,640
we all experienced sadness itself
doesn't mean that that's a fundamental

353
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:56,680
trait of our personality,
like we're all able to experience it

354
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,600
usually defined who we are unless we're

355
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,220
right and so and so.
Okay.

356
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:05,790
And so that's part of the definition of
a trait as something that's enduring

357
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,680
rather than transient.
Okay.

358
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,500
So you could say that's actually a
hypothesis.

359
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:15,530
Your hypothesis is that what we refer to
as emotions are brief flare ups of some

360
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,770
of the phenomena that we would consider
traits if,

361
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,630
if they were enduring.
Yeah.

362
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,610
And that's,
I mean that's a reasonable hypothesis.

363
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:26,910
Although if you,
if you describe a person as sad,

364
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,300
do you think you're describing their
personality or their emotion?

365
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,400
It could be either.
I would normally think,

366
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,271
yes.
Yeah.

367
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,104
Okay.
Okay.

368
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,370
Yeah.
Well it's a tricky.

369
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,630
It's tricky business.
Okay.

370
00:22:39,631 --> 00:22:43,920
So the reason I had you generate all
these additional words just because you

371
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,990
need to find out that your category fun
has a bunch of things that it doesn't

372
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,360
cover as well as a bunch of things that
it does.

373
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,860
And so we've hypothesized a number of
things that might constitute additional

374
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:58,200
domains of variation,
and so you might want to throw those

375
00:22:58,201 --> 00:22:59,220
into your questionnaire too.

376
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,250
Okay.
Now

377
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,681
he might say,
well,

378
00:23:07,681 --> 00:23:09,060
what are you going to do with your
scale?

379
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,530
So
you now you have a scale and you can

380
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:17,640
give it to people and you can tell the
difference between the fund people in

381
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:20,520
the not fun people.
And so what might be some practical

382
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:25,170
purposes towards which you could put
that knowledge.

383
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,070
You don't have to be too serious about
it.

384
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,080
I mean,
what are you going to.

385
00:23:32,081 --> 00:23:36,680
You could invite all the non-funded
people to a party that would seem rather

386
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:40,340
counterproductive.
You're your hypothesis would be that

387
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,640
maybe you'd have two parties,
we'd have a party with all the fun

388
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:46,760
people and you'd have another party with
all non fund people and then you could

389
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:50,810
get the attendees to rate how fun the
party was.

390
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,260
And then that would help you determine
whether or not your measurement of fund

391
00:23:54,261 --> 00:23:57,980
was actually practically useful for
something that's called criterion

392
00:23:57,981 --> 00:23:59,450
related validity,
by the way.

393
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,510
So and criterion related validity.
If a scale possesses criteria and

394
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:07,190
related to the liquidity,
you can identify something that might

395
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:12,191
predict that doesn't like completely
obviously associated with the initial

396
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,360
measure,
although you know,

397
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:17,930
fun and fun and a party probably are.
So that's a bad example,

398
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:21,650
but you can use it to predict something
that might be a value.

399
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,190
So I can give you an example of that is
that conscientiousness for which is a

400
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:30,191
trade from his is frequently used to
evaluate how good an employee might be

401
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:33,740
if you hired them or even how good a
student might be because

402
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:38,210
conscientiousness turns out to be a
pretty good predictor of academic

403
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,520
achievement.
Okay?

404
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,510
So if you're going to make us,
if you want to make a questionnaire and

405
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,540
some of you will do this when you do
your honors thesis or if you're involved

406
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,910
in research at all and people tend to
think about developing a questionnaire

407
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:54,650
or something that's relatively
straightforward.

408
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,210
Um,
it's not.

409
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,480
You need to figure out what it is that
you're after.

410
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,850
You know,
what's your central construct of

411
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,800
interest.
And then you have to figure out,

412
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,470
well how do I generate a very large
number of items that hypothetically

413
00:25:09,471 --> 00:25:11,900
measures this or it's reversed or it's
opposite,

414
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,830
it doesn't really matter.

415
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,580
And then a bunch of items that don't
measure it because again,

416
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,280
you have to show that it's good for
something and not good for everything.

417
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,500
So and then you have to demonstrate
statistically that your,

418
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,440
your concept is coherent and then you
have to show that you can use it to

419
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,110
predict something and it gets worse than
that actually.

420
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,470
Then you have to show that it predicts
something better than some other thing

421
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:38,810
that someone already invented.
So you know,

422
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:41,150
if,
if you came up with a fun scale,

423
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,850
it's probably primarily extroversion
that has,

424
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,300
as you mentioned,
that a scale like that would measure,

425
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:50,990
although it'd be a little complicated
because generally fun people also have

426
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:53,810
less negative emotion.
So what you'd end up with,

427
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:58,160
as we mentioned before,
that your fund scale would be a mangling

428
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:02,570
up of a couple of different categories.
And so it probably ended up not being a

429
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:03,950
very good questionnaire at all.

430
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,020
So it's a tricky thing to make a
questionnaire,

431
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:08,360
it takes an awful lot of work and you,
you,

432
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,400
you,
you can't start with the assumption that

433
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:14,480
just because you've been able to think
up a concept that it actually

434
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:19,481
constitutes a concept that meets the
criteria for scientific evidence

435
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,680
for scientific category.
So we should also talk maybe a little

436
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:27,740
bit about some different kinds of
categories because it's not all that

437
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:31,190
obvious to people that there are
different kinds of categories.

438
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,390
So I can,
I can name three very rapidly.

439
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,940
There are many others,
uh,

440
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,340
the first category,
and these are usually the categories

441
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:45,341
that scientists do investigate.
They are technically called proper sets

442
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:53,090
and so a proper said is like the set of
all triangles and triangles are clearly

443
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:55,830
not squares.
We'd all agree on that.

444
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,870
So what makes a triangle different than
the square?

445
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,353
Which one?

446
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:06,520
Okay,
I was just trying to trip you up there.

447
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,020
So.
Okay.

448
00:27:08,021 --> 00:27:10,420
So,
and is that true of all triangles?

449
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,280
Right,
right,

450
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,990
right.
What about a triangle that has like is

451
00:27:13,991 --> 00:27:16,990
open on one line,
does that qualify as a triangle?

452
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,630
No,
it just looks like a triangle.

453
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:21,940
It's like an imposter,
so,

454
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,840
okay,
so a proper set has this interesting

455
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:29,290
characteristic which is it has an
absolutely clear inclusion and exclusion

456
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:34,040
criteria and there are no exceptions and
so are almost no exceptions.

457
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:35,080
So you might say,
well,

458
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,460
is the set of all helium atoms a proper
set?

459
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,300
And the answer to that fundamentally is
yes.

460
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:47,680
And is it distinguishable,
say from the set of all hydrogen atoms

461
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,480
are the set of all iron atoms.
There's,

462
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,390
there's,
there's characteristics that you can

463
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:57,391
define that precisely indicate the
boundaries of the category and those

464
00:27:57,401 --> 00:28:00,040
sorts of things are,
are relatively easy to study

465
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:03,160
scientifically because they tend to
behave similarly in different

466
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:04,780
circumstances.
So here's,

467
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,940
here's another category,
um,

468
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,830
it's called a familial resemblance
category and it's a little harder to

469
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:16,831
understand,
but I'm a familial resemblance category

470
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:18,100
is a category that,

471
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,770
that imagine that

472
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,890
the prototypical example is the Smith
brothers.

473
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,520
So the Smith brothers,
here's some things that could

474
00:28:28,521 --> 00:28:31,120
characterize the Smith brothers,
um,

475
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,220
large ears,
large nose,

476
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,160
floppy lips,
a glasses,

477
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:40,670
mustache,
beard and bald.

478
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,860
So they're obviously not very
attractive.

479
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:47,180
These Smith brothers.
And then you can tell the Smith brothers

480
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:49,970
are related to each other because they
all look like each other.

481
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,890
Of course they don't look exactly like
each other.

482
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:56,630
So one Smith by the brother is bald with
glasses and floppy lips,

483
00:28:56,631 --> 00:29:00,530
but he has little ears.
And then another smith brother has hair,

484
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,890
but he's got,
you know,

485
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,100
large glasses and large ears and sloppy
lips.

486
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:08,090
And then there's another Smith's brother
that has a big nose and glasses,

487
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,590
but he has nice hair and no and no
mustache but a beard.

488
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,900
And you get the picture.
So,

489
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,480
so
what,

490
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,390
what,
uh,

491
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,960
uh,
familial resemblance category.

492
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,970
How a familial resemblance category
works is that there's a list of say 10

493
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:29,510
attributes.
And in order to be a member of that

494
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:31,760
class,
you only have to have say four of the

495
00:29:31,761 --> 00:29:34,010
attributes,
any four and,

496
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,480
or maybe five,
whatever.

497
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,850
The weird thing about a familial
resemblance category is that one person

498
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:42,880
could,
four of the attributes and another

499
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,340
person could have four different
attributes.

500
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:48,910
If there were 10 attributes that total
and they'd still be members of the same

501
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,570
set even though they don't share any
attributes in common.

502
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,620
And what familial resemblance category
works,

503
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,900
because each of the

504
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,790
members of the category related to a
central prototype and the prototype has

505
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:08,640
all the features and the prototype might
not even exist.

506
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,550
So there could be a prototypical smith
brother who would have all the

507
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:14,280
characteristics of the Smith brothers
that I described,

508
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,830
but he doesn't even exist.
He's like,

509
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,020
he's like an amalgam of all the Smith
brothers.

510
00:30:19,021 --> 00:30:22,500
And then each of the Smith brothers are
related in some way to that central

511
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:25,830
prototype so that you can tell that they
belong in a family and that's not a

512
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,740
proper set.
And one of the things you know you,

513
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,930
you might be asking,
well why should you know this?

514
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:34,860
And one reason is,
is because it's useful to know that

515
00:30:34,861 --> 00:30:39,720
there are different forms of categories,
but more particularly for psychological

516
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,840
purposes.
Psychiatric diagnostic categories are

517
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,580
familiar with that resemblance
categories.

518
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,090
They're not proper sense.
So if you go into the diagnostic and

519
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:53,091
statistical manual,
which is the sort of Apa American

520
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,630
Psychiatric Association Bible for doing
diagnosis,

521
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,530
you'll see that if you list the symptoms
of something like a personality

522
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:00,270
disorder,
there might be 10 symptoms.

523
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,490
And in order to have that personality
disorder,

524
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:07,491
you only need four of them,
and so there can be wide variation

525
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,200
within the category.
And of course then that begs the

526
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,680
question of whether or not it's actually
a category of certainly whether or not

527
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:16,560
it's actually a scientific category.
So,

528
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,413
um,

529
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,810
not guy named Barcelona talked about a
different kind of category.

530
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:27,830
He called them ad hoc categories and
these are strange things like here's,

531
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,860
here's an ad hoc category for you,
things to take out of your apartment

532
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:38,130
when it's on fire.
So what things would those be?

533
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:41,843
Pictures?
Yeah.

534
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,190
Pets.
Yes.

535
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,850
Children
forgot about that.

536
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,470
Okay.
What else?

537
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,380
What's that?
Seniors.

538
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:54,310
Yes.
Hopefully.

539
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,920
Or.
Yeah,

540
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,093
sure.

541
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,960
Insurance id.
Maybe.

542
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,300
What's that?
Anything else?

543
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay.
Now you might say,

544
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,790
well,
what are all those things have in common

545
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,380
since there apparently a category.

546
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,100
Yeah,

547
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,840
there are things you care about.
Yeah.

548
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,730
Yeah.
Id.

549
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,650
Do you care about that?
You need it?

550
00:32:18,651 --> 00:32:20,900
Yeah.
So they're necessary or

551
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,360
emotionally valuable or,
or what,

552
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,770
or valuable.
Yeah.

553
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:29,110
Are irreplaceable in some ways.
Okay.

554
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:32,350
So that's a funny category.
And one in Barcelona is claims was that

555
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,280
ad hoc categories can become automatic
categories,

556
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:38,500
perceptual categories if you practice
them enough.

557
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,870
So Bursa would say a fireman has a
better ad hoc category of what to take

558
00:32:44,241 --> 00:32:48,920
out of an apartment during a fire than
you do because he's practiced that using

559
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,910
that category frequently.
So those are categories that sort of

560
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:56,360
have pragmatic utility.
And that's another kind of category.

561
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:58,220
Okay.
So I'd mentioned family resemblance,

562
00:32:58,221 --> 00:33:01,970
proper set,
and ad hoc categories.

563
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,320
That's all I can sort of spin off and
in,

564
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,720
in real time here.
So I'm

565
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,770
generally what you're trying to do when
you extract a word out from the

566
00:33:13,771 --> 00:33:17,340
language,
you have to demonstrate it,

567
00:33:17,341 --> 00:33:20,640
that it has the characteristics of a
proper set before you can think of it as

568
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:23,160
having some genuinely objective
existence.

569
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,980
And that turns out to be a very
difficult thing to do.

570
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,310
So.
And it's one of the things that throws

571
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:32,910
psychologists for a loop constantly
because we make the presupposition that

572
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:36,360
just because the word two different
words exist for something that that

573
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,710
signifies to different things or two
things at all.

574
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,420
And so it's,
it's,

575
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,030
it's,
it's difficult to disentangle your

576
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:47,190
description of the world from the world
itself,

577
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,630
but hypothetically,
this construct validation process with

578
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:55,320
regards to questionnaires is one of the
ways that you can step forward towards

579
00:33:55,321 --> 00:34:00,321
doing that.
I mentioned convergent and discriminant

580
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:02,610
validity before,

581
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,190
once you get your scale established,
you have to demonstrate,

582
00:34:09,191 --> 00:34:12,330
as I said,
that it measures something that,

583
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,310
that,
that exists in some real way,

584
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:20,200
and that it also has to be separable for
measures of other things.

585
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,890
So for example,
if you generated up a scale that

586
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,760
measured fun and you found out that it
was highly correlated with other scales

587
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:31,090
that measure anxiety,
then that would cast some doubt on

588
00:34:31,091 --> 00:34:35,230
whether or not unit you had
appropriately extracted out your scale

589
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:40,510
for fun and other people would have been
looking at similar things over the

590
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,550
years.
And hopefully your scale would correlate

591
00:34:42,551 --> 00:34:45,970
positively with those similar things and
negatively with the things that you

592
00:34:45,971 --> 00:34:48,820
assume to be different.
And that's convergent and divergent

593
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:51,520
validity.
And then the criterion related validity,

594
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,521
we're already talked about.
Okay,

595
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:01,900
so now I want to show you a different,

596
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,290
uh,
powerpoint presentation just for them.

597
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:08,903
Yeah,

598
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,710
so this,
you might think about this as the

599
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:42,110
current arguably standard model of human
personality and it's a model that,

600
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,660
this is only half of it by the way.
There's another slide that has the other

601
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:53,661
half.
This shows the personality of a person

602
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,160
laid out in hierarchy from most general
to most specific.

603
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,350
It's sort of analogous to that little
drawing I showed you of behaviors at the

604
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:07,290
bottom and then higher order descriptors
at the top,

605
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:10,050
although they don't map onto each other
one to one.

606
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,480
And that's actually one of the things
I'm trying to figure out.

607
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,330
Um,
it's very difficult to.

608
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,470
It's very difficult to map the trait
theories directly onto the narrative and

609
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,670
the clinical theories.
All right,

610
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:32,671
so at the highest level of resolution,
here's how people can differ from one

611
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:39,151
another.
They can be industrious or orderly and

612
00:36:39,191 --> 00:36:44,191
that those two aspects
are quite highly inter correlated,

613
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:50,090
but in sufficiently differentiable so
that the differences are interesting.

614
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:53,420
Industriousness in order to dentists
seem to predict different things.

615
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,040
So for example,
industrious,

616
00:36:55,041 --> 00:36:58,250
this seems to be a better predictor of
academic achievement than orderliness

617
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:00,650
does,
even though they both both clump under

618
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:01,670
conscientiousness

619
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,050
and then there's volatility in
withdrawal for emotional stability or

620
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:11,850
neuroticism described different ways.
If it's your neurotic,

621
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,580
if you feel a lot of negative emotion
and you're emotionally stable,

622
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:18,030
if you don't negative the negative
emotions that are associated with

623
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:20,250
neuroticism,
we thought for a long time it was all

624
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,680
negative emotions that were associated
with neuroticism,

625
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,100
but it seems to be more like pain and
anxiety and and and pain is somewhat

626
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:32,970
equivalent to the emotion you feel if
you're frustrated or disappointed or

627
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:35,760
grieving.
And anxiety seems to be the emotion you

628
00:37:35,761 --> 00:37:40,470
feel when you're subject to
uncontrollable or unexpected

629
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:45,471
circumstances or when you're subject to
cues of frustration,

630
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,530
disappointment or grief.
So

631
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,410
volatile people

632
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,310
don't really seem to avoid because of
their negative emotion.

633
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,100
Although their emotion,
their,

634
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,910
their emotions bounced a lot,
especially their negative emotions.

635
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:05,560
So if you're associated with someone
who's voluntell,

636
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,420
what you would observe is that they seem
to overreact to things.

637
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,260
They get more irritated then they
circumstance might seem to indicate and

638
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,900
their emotion,
emotional response to things is on the

639
00:38:19,901 --> 00:38:23,230
negative end is relatively unpredictable
day to day,

640
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,160
so there's a lot of variability and a
lower threshold for the experience.

641
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,370
People who withdraw are people who
appear to be stopped by their

642
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:35,860
experience,
negative emotion,

643
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,280
so if they're afraid of something,
they won't do it where the volatile

644
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,570
person,
they might do it,

645
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,250
but they'll complain a lot while they're
doing it,

646
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,100
you know,
so we don't know a lot about the

647
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:48,040
difference between volatility and
withdrawal yet because those have been

648
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:52,300
recently extracted out using statistical
means and they seem stable,

649
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:56,450
but exactly what they predict yet,
apart from the few things that I tend to

650
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,510
definitely suggested to you,
isn't yet clear.

651
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,040
Agreeableness sounds like a positive
thing.

652
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,810
Politeness and compassion.
We know that liberals are more

653
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:10,960
compassionate and conservatives are more
polite,

654
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,540
but we don't know a lot more about the
distinction between politeness and

655
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,520
compassion.
Um,

656
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:25,180
and we don't know why conservatives are
more polite than liberals are more

657
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:28,090
compassionate,
but we do know that that appears to be

658
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:29,800
the case.
We also know by the way that

659
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,970
conservatives are more orderly,
they're less open as well,

660
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,760
which is the dimension we'll talk about
in a moment.

661
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,210
Those three,
those are three of the five big five

662
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,350
traits,
conscientiousness,

663
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:44,770
emotional stability and agreeableness.
They clumped together to make a super

664
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:49,771
factor called stability and stability.
Looks like it might be associated with

665
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:54,640
higher levels of Serotonin.
Serotonin is a major brain

666
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:59,440
neurotransmitter that seems to regulate
broadly speaking,

667
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,470
emotion and motivation,
and if your serotonin levels so to

668
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,430
speak,
are relatively high,

669
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,760
then you're a relatively stable person
and if your serotonin levels are low,

670
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,590
then you tend to be impulsive and prone
to negative emotion.

671
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,630
Now,
one of the things that's quite

672
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:20,890
interesting about Serotonin is that it
tracks your position in the dominance

673
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:24,760
hierarchy as well,
so the higher you are up in a given

674
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:27,490
dominance hierarchy,
the more serotonin in your brain

675
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:31,240
produces and that makes you more
confident and less unstable.

676
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,170
And the lower you are in the hierarchy,
the lower your brain serotonin levels.

677
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,820
And the reason for that seems to be that
if you're low in the dominance

678
00:40:39,821 --> 00:40:41,650
hierarchy,
while you should be afraid,

679
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:46,210
because almost anything can knock you
into oblivion because if you're right at

680
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:48,250
the bottom of the dominance hierarchy,
you're barely,

681
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,110
hey,
you're barely hanging on and you just

682
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,840
can't tolerate any more threat.
And conversely,

683
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,070
it might also be appropriate for you if
someone dangles a reward in front of you

684
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:59,410
for you to grab it because it's not
exactly clear,

685
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:01,600
it's going to be the next day or the
next day.

686
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,880
Whereas if you're up high in the
dominance hierarchy,

687
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:08,800
it's like you can take a lot of billows
and you're so well situated socially

688
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:11,590
that it's probably not going to
overwhelm you that much and you don't

689
00:41:11,591 --> 00:41:15,670
have to be impulsive because the
microenvironment that you inhabit is

690
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:18,940
very stable.
So the negative emotion dimension,

691
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:22,330
emotional stability,
is particularly associated with

692
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:25,660
serotonergic function.
But we think that the whole super factor

693
00:41:25,661 --> 00:41:28,990
of stability is associated with
serotonergic tone.

694
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,620
So some of this,
like I mentioned already,

695
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:37,250
all of these different
aspects,

696
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,250
traits and super factors role derived
statistically,

697
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,550
but evidence has continued to accrue
over the last 20 years with regards to

698
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:50,630
the biological substrate of the traits.
And so as we progress through them one

699
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:53,420
by one,
we'll also talk about hypothetically

700
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,490
what constitutes the underlying biology

701
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,820
agreeable people.
Um,

702
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,150
I think the easiest way to conceptualize
agreeableness as is,

703
00:42:03,151 --> 00:42:07,380
as I'm a negotiating strategy in some
sense.

704
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,610
So you know,
you're always attempting to divide up

705
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:16,611
resources between you and other people.
And a disagreeable person will make a

706
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,760
pretty damn strong case that the
resources should go to them.

707
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,480
Whereas an agreeable person will be much
more likely to under represent their own

708
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,360
interest and over represent the interest
of others.

709
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,493
And so,
you know,

710
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,650
in some ways people like that are very
pleasant to be around,

711
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,450
you know,
because they're always doing things for

712
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:42,210
other people on.
Unfortunately they're often not doing

713
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:44,520
enough for themselves.
In my clinical practice,

714
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:47,280
I can always tell who the agreeable
people are because when they come and

715
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,420
see me,
they bring me coffee.

716
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,000
The disagreeable people bring themselves
coffee,

717
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,100
so yeah,

718
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,193
sure.

719
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,300
Pretty sad animation.
The aspects here,

720
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,840
so openness.
Remember you guys hypothesize that

721
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:15,841
intelligence was unrelated to fund I'll
find is pretty much an extroversion sub

722
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,230
element.
And intelligence is associated with

723
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:22,450
openness and it roughly breaks down like
this.

724
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:23,990
So,
um,

725
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:29,710
Iq is probably a better measure of the
aspect.

726
00:43:29,711 --> 00:43:33,700
Intellect Iq tests are a better measure
of the subscale intellect than

727
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,670
personality measures are.
So what it means is that for,

728
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:38,590
for intellect,
for intelligence,

729
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:43,090
we have a measure that isn't merely self
report and it's a good measure.

730
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:46,510
And we'll talk a lot about intelligence.
It's actually a very easy,

731
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:50,140
it's a simple thing to conceptualize.
So,

732
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,330
um,
it's a,

733
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,610
it's a more difficult thing to try to
explain,

734
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,710
but conceptually it's fairly
straightforward.

735
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,720
Um,
the other aspect of openness is openness

736
00:44:01,721 --> 00:44:04,390
proper.
I put creativity here and what that

737
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:09,391
seems to be associated with is the
degree to which someone is a variety of

738
00:44:09,911 --> 00:44:11,680
things,
but one of them seems to be the degree

739
00:44:11,681 --> 00:44:16,681
to which a given idea.
If you throw someone an idea or you

740
00:44:16,961 --> 00:44:20,350
offer someone idea,
there's some probability that that's

741
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,880
going to make them think of other
things.

742
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:27,730
The more open someone is,
the more likely it is that any given

743
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,130
idea is gonna,
make them think of more things and also

744
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,170
the open person has a more diverse range
of things that that idea might bring

745
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:41,181
about and so often a speaking style of
someone who's open is associated is

746
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:45,020
characterized by relatively loose
associations.

747
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:45,854
I mean

748
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
that like my lectures for example,
so it's a measure of creativity,

749
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,890
but it's also a measure in some sense of
lack of constraint on,

750
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,990
on the propagation of ideas through the
idea network and I don't know exactly

751
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,230
what that means neurologically.
I do know that you can be relatively

752
00:45:06,231 --> 00:45:10,220
high and intelligence and relatively low
in openness or creativity,

753
00:45:10,221 --> 00:45:13,400
but the two things do tend to go very.
So for example,

754
00:45:13,401 --> 00:45:18,401
it's very rare for people to make any
major contribution to a creative sphere

755
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:23,060
unless they have an Iq of over least
over 120.

756
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,340
So it's a pretty.
It's pretty selective one in 20,

757
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,370
120.
That's about the 90th 91st 92nd

758
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:33,080
percentile.
So it's pretty high.

759
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:37,580
So openness is creativity and
intelligence.

760
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,570
It's a bit broader than that too though,
because open people are also more

761
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,850
capable of aesthetic experience.
So it's not only that they are more

762
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:49,880
creative,
but they also enjoy the products of

763
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:53,090
creative endeavor more than non open
people.

764
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,140
So open people are going to be
interested in dance and music and poetry

765
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:59,420
and philosophy.
Um,

766
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:03,740
they're characterized by the capacity
for aesthetic experiences,

767
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,460
you know,
so some people can listen to music and

768
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,070
the hair on the back of their neck stand
up or maybe they get the same sensation

769
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:14,870
when they're watching someone dance or.
So I'm just out of curiosity,

770
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,890
if you're inclined to answer,
how many of you have had the experience

771
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:20,600
of,
it's called [inaudible] erection

772
00:46:20,601 --> 00:46:22,820
actually,
because sometimes the hairs on your arms

773
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,960
will stand up to as a consequence of
watching something that's aesthetic

774
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,080
movie or how many.
Quite a lot of you.

775
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,930
How many haven't.
Okay.

776
00:46:32,931 --> 00:46:34,160
Okay.
So while there's a lot of,

777
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:36,320
you know,
by that measure anyways,

778
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:38,540
there's a lawful lot of open people in
this class.

779
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,050
So,
um,

780
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,210
that sense,
by the way of having your hairs on the

781
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:48,550
back of your neck stand up,
that's sort of a remnant of the pilot

782
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,260
erection reflex.

783
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,100
So you know,
let's say you,

784
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,270
you,
you're watching a cat and the cat comes

785
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,190
around a corner and all of a sudden
there's a dog there.

786
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:03,191
What happens to the cat goes right puffs
right up.

787
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:06,350
Even.
So now it's tales about this big around

788
00:47:06,351 --> 00:47:07,380
right?
And when it started,

789
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,200
but it puffs right out and it's like
that's an automatic reflex on the part

790
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:14,180
of the cat.
Now it's trying to look like it's big.

791
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,021
You know,
Chris,

792
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:17,630
the dog will do the same thing,
so it's a bit counterproductive.

793
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:19,550
But whatever the cat's trying to look
like,

794
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:22,070
it occupies a lot more space than it
actually looks like.

795
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:23,030
And,
but there's also,

796
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,760
at least in principle and emotion
associated with that,

797
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:29,200
which is one of,
it's sort of a combination of terror and

798
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:33,100
all.
And maybe that's what the cat seals.

799
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:37,360
But that's what they are experience of
awe.

800
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:40,810
Even filtered down is still associated
with that,

801
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,730
you know,
experience of pilot direction.

802
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:45,880
So that's pretty interesting.
So extroverted people,

803
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,680
or at least I think it's pretty
interesting,

804
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,130
extroverted people are assertive and
enthusiastic and so the enthusiasm

805
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:57,340
dimension seems to be associated with a
lot of overt,

806
00:47:57,341 --> 00:48:01,600
positive emotion.
And so extroverts in many ways are more

807
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:03,430
fun and they laugh more.
They talk more.

808
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,030
That is not necessarily more fun.
They're very gregarious.

809
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:09,070
They like to hang out at parties.
They planned parties,

810
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:10,570
they tell jokes,
in fact,

811
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,910
telling a joke is actually a real marker
of,

812
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,820
of extroversion.
So how many of you here tell jokes?

813
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:19,130
Yeah,
how many don't.

814
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:21,821
Okay.
Okay.

815
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:22,810
So,
um,

816
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:27,040
how many of you tell good jokes
anyways?

817
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,790
So yeah,
I'm also one of the behavioral markers

818
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:33,940
we found for extroversion was that
extroverted people also tell dirty

819
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:36,520
jokes.
So how many of you are capable of that

820
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:37,870
particular act?
Yeah.

821
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:39,510
So you in particular,
you.

822
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,530
All right?
So yeah.

823
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,310
So the assertiveness element of
extroversion.

824
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,530
That's,
I guess sometimes that's the part of

825
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:50,500
extroversion that maybe isn't so much
fun because extroverts can be very

826
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:55,450
verbally dominant.
One of the things I do in my fourth year

827
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:00,250
undergraduate personality seminar is I
split the group and take introverts.

828
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:03,820
And extroverts,
so because I often have the class do

829
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:07,450
debates and if if you put an extrovert
in with a bunch of introverts and

830
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:10,120
there's a debate,
so there's one extrovert here in three

831
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:12,400
introverts and one extrovert here at
three introverts.

832
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,870
Then the two extroverts have the debate
and the introverts don't say anything

833
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:20,440
and introverts are interesting because
it's not like they don't have anything

834
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:23,770
to say because if you pointed an
introvert and say,

835
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:25,960
do you have something to say?

836
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,970
Then they'll say something that they're
thinking,

837
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:30,820
but they'll very rarely,
especially if they're very introverted,

838
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,030
they're very rarely offered
spontaneously.

839
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,570
And so if I found that if I divide the
class into two groups of introverts in

840
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:42,790
two groups of extroverts and then I have
them do like a four way debate.

841
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,670
The introverts so talk like mad in,
in their,

842
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,560
in their own group,
you know,

843
00:49:47,561 --> 00:49:51,190
because they're not being overpowered by
an extrovert.

844
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,050
The extrovert seemed to have a much
lower threshold for,

845
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,430
for speaking.
It doesn't take much of a stimulus to

846
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:00,400
get them talking or they have a real
impulse to talk.

847
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,220
Like my daughter is super introverted or
extroverted.

848
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,890
It's impossible for her to think
something without saying it,

849
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,730
so I know which is not always to her
benefit,

850
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:10,910
but I,
but I,

851
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,810
I extroverts have a real impulse to
speech,

852
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:15,190
you know,
whereas introverts,

853
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:19,030
they have to be sort of prodded into it.
Extroverts also seemed to be sort of,

854
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,520
um,
what would you call it?

855
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:24,590
Energized by social interactions.
You know,

856
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,130
they'll go to a party and they get more
and more and more energy.

857
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,230
An introvert will go to a party and it's
like there'll be there for an hour and

858
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:33,740
then they've had enough people and they
want to go home and sit in their room

859
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:35,840
and recharge.
And it isn't exactly,

860
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,060
we really don't have any idea why that
is,

861
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,660
but it seems to be a pretty reliable
marker of the difference between the two

862
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:42,494
groups.

863
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:50,820
Here's some what?
Um,

864
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,600
let's see.
Yeah.

865
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,150
Well here's some items so you guys can
do a quick,

866
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,990
big five on yourselves and I'll tell you
the upside and downside of it.

867
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:05,030
So
if you're orderly,

868
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:08,690
you follow a schedule,
Dominique,

869
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,710
view,
follow a schedule.

870
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,340
Okay?
Now how many of you don't.

871
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,930
Okay.
So one thing I would recommend is that

872
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:22,490
you do,
and I'll tell you why,

873
00:51:22,491 --> 00:51:27,050
like intelligence is a very good
predictor of academic performance

874
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,590
and there's not a lot you can do about
your intelligence.

875
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,680
I mean you can squander it,
but it's very difficult to improve it.

876
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,250
Conscientiousness,
well it's a trait too so it's hard to

877
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:39,230
work on,
but we know that conscientious people

878
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:42,980
get better grades and it's reliable and
it's a powerful effect.

879
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,480
And so if your time use organized than
the probability that you're going to be

880
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,600
successful is very high.
So one of the things you might think

881
00:51:50,601 --> 00:51:55,601
about is make friends with a calendar
like Google calendar or something like

882
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:58,310
that.
And I can tell you some tricks about

883
00:51:58,311 --> 00:51:59,920
that because really it is important
like,

884
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:04,220
and I'm not kidding around about this.
If you're low in conscientiousness,

885
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,320
it's really going to trip you up as you
walk through life.

886
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,100
There's not very many advantages to it
that I've been able to see.

887
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,740
And I'm not assuming that just because
you don't follow a schedule,

888
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:15,980
you're low in conscientiousness,
but it is one of the items that market,

889
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:18,800
um,
the only,

890
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:22,400
the advantage I've seen so far to being
unconscientious is that if you become

891
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:24,230
unemployed it doesn't bother you as
much.

892
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:27,650
And I mean that,
that actually turns out to matter in

893
00:52:27,651 --> 00:52:28,940
some situations.
So like,

894
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,280
you know,
if a big company has to shed and 50

895
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,770
percent of its employees,
it's the conscientious people are going

896
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:38,030
to suffer themselves to death for it.
And the unconscientious people,

897
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,190
they're not going to care anyways
because they weren't working anyway.

898
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,140
So it doesn't matter if they have a job
or not.

899
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:47,120
So here's one way of thinking about
making use of a schedule.

900
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:51,440
Often people are afraid of schedules
because they think of them as a trap.

901
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,420
You know,
you make a schedule and it's like this

902
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,940
little prison that you have to live
inside and you know,

903
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:59,210
and all you're doing in your schedule is
putting down things you have to do or

904
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:00,050
should do.
And so,

905
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,610
you know,
there's not a lot of fun in that.

906
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,040
And so not only is it a trap or a
prison,

907
00:53:04,041 --> 00:53:09,041
but it's kind of an unpleasant one,
but a way to work with the schedule in a

908
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:14,000
lot more sophisticated way is to think,
well,

909
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,350
I'm going to plan the next week say
because you plan it day by day,

910
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:21,320
but we'll take the week as the unit
level of analysis and think,

911
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,230
well I'd like to plan a week I'd like to
have.

912
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,670
Then your schedule all of a sudden
becomes a tool for increasing the

913
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:33,870
quality of your life.
And that's a whole different issue,

914
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,350
you know,
because you might think what,

915
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,140
what's the emotion that you suffer
assuming you suffer one of these

916
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,110
emotions,
if you have an essay that's due and

917
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:46,230
you're not doing it,
like would you regard that as a pleasant

918
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:48,540
emotion or unpleasant?
The bullshit.

919
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:54,390
Okay.
So is there anybody who is disagreeing

920
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:59,370
with a statement that having an essay
due or overdue that you're not doing is

921
00:53:59,371 --> 00:54:01,890
unpleasant?
Everyone agrees with that.

922
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,200
Okay.
Do you think you can characterize the

923
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:07,010
unpleasantness?
Like what kind of emotion is it?

924
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,170
It's guilt.
Okay.

925
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,930
Anything else?
Frustration,

926
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,040
frustration with what

927
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,680
you feel like a failure.

928
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:19,890
Yeah.
So you're sort of frustrated with

929
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,090
yourself.
Yeah.

930
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,260
Yeah.
You need to slap right?

931
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:24,240
Do you think I need a slap?
So.

932
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:25,500
Okay.
So guilt.

933
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:28,110
Anything else?
Anxiety,

934
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:32,220
restlessness.
So that's kind of an agitation.

935
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,960
Yeah.
It's because your body knows you should

936
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:36,690
be doing something but you know,
you're not pointing it in the right

937
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:37,690
direction.
So it's

938
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:42,750
a shame.
Is that a reasonable?

939
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:43,891
So.
Okay.

940
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:46,560
So the reason I was asking you about
that is because,

941
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,930
you know,
most of the negative emotions are

942
00:54:48,931 --> 00:54:52,050
associated with neuroticism,
but some of them seem to be associated

943
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:54,750
with conscientiousness and
conscientious.

944
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:59,751
Negative emotions seem to be guilt and
shame fundamentally.

945
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,460
And so recent research and really
recent,

946
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,500
I already got this paper like a week
ago,

947
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:09,630
I think it's about four months old,
seem to indicate that conscientious

948
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,300
people feel less guilt,
but they're more guilt prone.

949
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,530
So if they don't do something that makes
them guilty,

950
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,950
but they organize their time so they are
doing the things they're supposed to do

951
00:55:19,951 --> 00:55:21,270
so then they don't feel guilty.

952
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,880
So anyways,
back to the schedule.

953
00:55:23,881 --> 00:55:24,714
So.
Alright,

954
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,630
you think about your week and you think
about your day and you think,

955
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:29,790
well,
how would you improve the quality of a

956
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,770
given day or given week?
Well,

957
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:35,310
one of the ways of improving it is to
not put yourself into the situation

958
00:55:35,311 --> 00:55:38,640
where there are things hanging over your
head that you have to feel guilty and

959
00:55:38,641 --> 00:55:41,770
ashamed about because that's a very
unpleasant way of being.

960
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:43,650
And you know,
if you have an essay,

961
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,730
it's due in a week and you're
procrastinating,

962
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,080
then the fact that you have to do that
so it can ruin the whole week.

963
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,490
And even when you're doing something
that's positive hypothetically,

964
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:59,850
it's kind of that horrible kind of
positive that you experienced when you

965
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:01,410
know that you should be doing something
else.

966
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:04,800
And so that's when you ended up watching
youtube videos about like dancing cats

967
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:05,640
or something like that.

968
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:06,730
You know,
and it's,

969
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,190
it's,
it's at best.

970
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,810
It's a guilty pleasure.
It's not a pleasure at all.

971
00:56:10,811 --> 00:56:12,240
You think like,
what the hell am I doing?

972
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:14,200
Watching videos of dancing cats,
you know,

973
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,190
but then you know that you're
procrastinating and that's low quality,

974
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,880
very low quality existence.
So if you use your schedule,

975
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:21,720
you can think,
okay,

976
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,400
well here's some times that I'm going to
do this work,

977
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:28,990
and then you can also sort of ask
yourself about that when you're

978
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:32,410
designing your schedule because you
don't want to design a schedule like

979
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:34,540
your Adolf Hitler telling yourself what
to do,

980
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,360
you know,
because you're not going to comply with

981
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:39,400
it.
Then what you have to do if you're going

982
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:41,500
to design a schedule,
so you have to ask yourself,

983
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,840
all right,
I'm going to set aside some time to

984
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:46,510
study over the next week or two,
do this essay or whatever it is.

985
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,090
How much time would I actually spend
studying?

986
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,520
And you know,
I'm going to go to the library for four

987
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,020
hours a day.
It's like,

988
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,570
how many of you go to the library for
four hours a day?

989
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,390
You do,
how much work do you do during those

990
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,400
four hours?
You do?

991
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:03,740
That's very impressive.
Is it more than four hours?

992
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,150
And so what proportion of the time
you're spending there do you think is

993
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:10,080
actually efficient?

994
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,093
Hmm.
Hmm.

995
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,240
That's good.
That's good.

996
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,310
My suspicions are that you're
conscientious.

997
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,770
So that's,
that's exceptional.

998
00:57:18,771 --> 00:57:20,720
I mean people usually don't manage that
so,

999
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:23,900
but you know,
an hour or two a day might be a

1000
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:27,770
worthwhile thing to schedule it and I
would say don't schedule in more than

1001
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:32,060
that to begin with because then you'll
fail and then you'll stop using the

1002
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:34,370
schedule.
And so the other thing you want to do is

1003
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,520
you want to schedule and things that you
want to do and then you want to look at

1004
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:39,680
the day or the week and you think you
want to think,

1005
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,980
hey that's a week I'd like to have.
If I had a week like that,

1006
00:57:42,981 --> 00:57:43,820
it would be good.
You know,

1007
00:57:43,821 --> 00:57:46,790
I'd be caught up so.
So that all that negative emotion

1008
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:49,430
doesn't have to accrue.
I don't want to down a bunch of things

1009
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:52,670
that I'm interested in doing and at the
end of the week I'd be in better shape

1010
00:57:52,671 --> 00:57:56,990
than I was at the beginning.
And if you treat a schedule like that so

1011
00:57:56,991 --> 00:58:01,070
that what you're using it is to design
the days and weeks that you want to have

1012
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,000
instead of using it as this little you
know,

1013
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,140
jail that you have to put yourself in
that you're not going to do anyways,

1014
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,100
then you can learn to use them.
And that's one thing you could do to

1015
00:58:10,101 --> 00:58:12,600
make yourself more industrious or,
or,

1016
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:13,663
or,
uh,

1017
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,950
more conscientiousness,
more conscientious follow a schedule am

1018
00:58:18,951 --> 00:58:22,130
not bothered by disorder.
So how many of you people are not

1019
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,240
bothered by disorder?

1020
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,800
Okay.
And how many of you are bothered by

1021
00:58:27,801 --> 00:58:29,600
disorder?
Yes.

1022
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,350
So some of those of you who are bothered
by disorder probably have an eating

1023
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:34,880
disorder.
That would be my guess.

1024
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:37,400
I'm not going to ask,
but that would be my guess because one

1025
00:58:37,401 --> 00:58:39,440
of the things that does characterize
people who are,

1026
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:42,880
who have eating disorders,
they tend to be very orderly and

1027
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,840
orderly.
People tend to be quite sensitive to

1028
00:58:44,841 --> 00:58:48,620
discussed and discussed.
Seems to be the driving factor behind

1029
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:53,000
eating disorders because people who have
body dysmorphia or eating disorders tend

1030
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:55,690
to be relatively disgusted by what they
see as you know,

1031
00:58:55,730 --> 00:59:00,730
inadequacies in their own body,
so orderliness can get out of hand a

1032
00:59:01,851 --> 00:59:04,880
lot.
We have some suspicions that it's maybe

1033
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:09,110
also associated with authoritarianism in
political viewpoints because

1034
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:11,870
conservatives are more conscientious
than liberals,

1035
00:59:11,871 --> 00:59:14,450
but it's specifically they tend to be
more orderly.

1036
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,060
So under that doesn't mean orderliness
is a bad thing.

1037
00:59:17,061 --> 00:59:19,310
It just means,
and this is something to think about

1038
00:59:19,311 --> 00:59:24,311
with regards to all the traits that any
trade exaggerated too far starts to

1039
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:27,890
become negative.
So the big five traits,

1040
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,810
at least in principle,
don't have any,

1041
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:36,980
what would you call it?
Intrinsic moral value.

1042
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,570
And that's partly because too much of a
good thing seems to turn very rapidly

1043
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:49,430
into a really bad thing.
So having a healthy personality seems to

1044
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:53,570
be more like something like the balance
between the different traits and maybe

1045
00:59:53,571 --> 00:59:58,130
also something like your ability to
increase the breadth of your traits.

1046
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,650
You know,
so maybe if you're hyper orderly,

1047
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,180
one of the things that would be good for
you to learn is to not be hyper orderly

1048
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:08,000
in every situation all the time.
It's too rigid.

1049
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:12,020
So okay,
so orderly people are bothered by

1050
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:17,021
disorder and they follow a schedule.
And so a industrious people

1051
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:21,620
do not waste their time and they know
what they're doing.

1052
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:26,770
So how many of you people
don't waste your time?

1053
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:36,590
So two people.
Okay,

1054
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:38,110
I've,
I've played it.

1055
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,480
How much time do you waste with you
before I have?

1056
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:43,490
Okay,
that's too bad because I love torturing

1057
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:46,400
undergraduates at that game.
Okay.

1058
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:49,370
So that's another advantage to a
schedule,

1059
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,233
you know,
because it can,

1060
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,280
it can really help you with time
wasting.

1061
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:55,580
And that's something that'll kill you.
Kill you over time.

1062
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:00,440
Um,
how many of you have good goals and you

1063
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:01,670
know,
and know what you're doing.

1064
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:05,290
Yeah.
So that's better.

1065
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:08,080
How many of you don't.
How many of you don't know really what

1066
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,270
you're doing or where you're going?
Okay.

1067
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,710
Okay.
So,

1068
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,400
okay,
so that's conscientiousness,

1069
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,540
neuroticism,
volatile.

1070
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:23,290
People get angry,
easy and they don't keep their emotions

1071
01:01:23,291 --> 01:01:25,600
under control.
What that should have been reversed by

1072
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:30,601
the way,
I'm withdrawal seldom feel blue.

1073
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,820
It's the opposite.
I'm filled with or sorry,

1074
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:35,680
sell them.
Feel blue is at the opposite,

1075
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,730
am filled with doubts about things
that's seems like more of a depression

1076
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:41,650
trait.
Withdrawal,

1077
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:47,470
so that's a negative emotion dimension,
so people reliably differ on the degree

1078
01:01:47,471 --> 01:01:50,410
to which the experience negative emotion
and the degree to which they experienced

1079
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:54,190
positive emotion and those two things
are actually different because the

1080
01:01:54,191 --> 01:01:58,630
circuitry that operates positive emotion
is a particular circuit and the circuits

1081
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,420
that operate negative emotion,
our particular circuits,

1082
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,600
and they're not merely opposites so you
can be highly neurotic and very

1083
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:10,000
extroverted and so that means you're
always at parties,

1084
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:12,280
but you're continually worrying what
people are thinking of you.

1085
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:15,850
So it's people like that are actually
quite complicated.

1086
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,760
You know,
so it's,

1087
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,070
it's,
it's a complicated

1088
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:24,020
combination of traits.
Agreeableness,

1089
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,270
polite people,
respect authority,

1090
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,060
and they do not believe that they're
better than others.

1091
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,770
And Compassionate people are interested
in other people's problems and take time

1092
01:02:33,771 --> 01:02:35,960
for other people.
So

1093
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,020
I'll tell you this after we do it at
extroversion,

1094
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,090
open people.
We talked about this already,

1095
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:47,220
if you're creative,
you believe in the importance of art,

1096
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:50,820
you love to reflect on things.
If you're smart,

1097
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,510
which is sort of the intellect category,
you're quick to understand things and

1098
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:58,800
can handle a lot of information and then
extroverted people are assertive,

1099
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,280
they take charge,
they're able to influence people,

1100
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,970
so they're kind of charismatic and if
they're enthusiastic,

1101
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,450
they make friends easily and are easy to
get to know

1102
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:15,330
it might be of some interest to you that
disagreeable

1103
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:17,663
people

1104
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,960
who are
extroverted are narcissistic.

1105
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,780
So
because a disagreeable person doesn't,

1106
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:34,800
isn't particularly applied,
they don't really care about your

1107
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:38,310
feelings and they're very dominant.
So and uh,

1108
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:47,810
so if you're like that,
it would be useful to learn when to be

1109
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:55,810
quieter and social situations and how to
attend more to other people.

1110
01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:00,310
One of the things that seems quite
useful for people who are disagreeable

1111
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:05,940
and narcissistic for that matter is to
try consciously on a regular basis to do

1112
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:10,120
something for someone else.
It also actually seems to make people

1113
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:14,020
who are narcissistic,
happier to do that.

1114
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:19,620
Interestingly enough.
Okay.

1115
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:31,961
So
I'll just briefly also talk about

1116
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:38,030
general cognitive ability is sort of an.
Excuse me,

1117
01:04:38,481 --> 01:04:41,150
it's an overview of where we're going to
head over the next few courses.

1118
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:44,030
This is a Raven's progressive matrices
test.

1119
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,010
I don't think this one is very
difficult,

1120
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:49,010
although I'm.
I'm going to look at it before.

1121
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:52,280
I certainly tell you that because I
don't want you to feel bad.

1122
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,830
Oh,
and the answer is there anyway.

1123
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,060
So it actually turns out to be extremely
easy.

1124
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,570
So why is seven the right answer?

1125
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,890
Hmm.

1126
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,700
Okay.
Say that again.

1127
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,870
It has to be the lowest.
Why?

1128
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:20,290
Why does it have to be the lowest?
And then the squares at the top.

1129
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:22,290
Right?
So there has to be in,

1130
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,590
there has to be an item at the bottom.
Okay.

1131
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,080
And be a little circle.
And it has to be trying have to be a

1132
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:32,290
triangle because it's the only thing
missing,

1133
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:34,820
right?
Because every other rowers triangle.

1134
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,140
So you inferred all that by analyzing
the three by three matrix.

1135
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:41,430
Okay.
The faster you can do that

1136
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,173
and

1137
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:47,340
it's an interaction between speed and
complexity.

1138
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:49,830
You could make these questions much more
complex than this one.

1139
01:05:49,831 --> 01:05:50,431
This one's,
you know,

1140
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:53,430
reasonably complex,
but they can get really vicious because

1141
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:56,910
maybe there's what,
two dimensions of variation here.

1142
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,410
There's whether or not it's an oval,
a triangle,

1143
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:04,860
and a rectangle,
and then where the thing is,

1144
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:07,140
that's it.
But you could imagine you could make a

1145
01:06:07,141 --> 01:06:09,540
matrix with like four dimensions of
variability.

1146
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:14,930
And so these tests turn out to be the
most accurate tests of general cognitive

1147
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:19,200
ability.
Raven's progressive matrices.

1148
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:22,170
That's not verbal intelligence,
it's nonverbal intelligence.

1149
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:23,490
But,
um,

1150
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:27,600
and I can tell you why it is that these
tests turned out to be that way later.

1151
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:33,030
And I will.
General cognitive ability is a very good

1152
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:38,031
predictor of life success and it seems
to be very much biologically.

1153
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,193
Um,

1154
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:47,090
what would you say biological factors
play a large role,

1155
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:50,360
especially in modern society and
determining relative levels of

1156
01:06:50,361 --> 01:06:53,000
intelligence,
which is a relatively rough.

1157
01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:58,250
It's a rough fact.
Okay.

1158
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:03,310
So we'll sum up briefly.
It looks like there's five basic

1159
01:07:05,331 --> 01:07:10,070
dimensions of variability
that characterize the human personality,

1160
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,570
conscientiousness,
emotional stability,

1161
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,680
agreeableness,
openness and extroversion.

1162
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,280
And what we'll do as we progress through
the rest of the,

1163
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,910
or at least the next,
roughly a little more than a third of

1164
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:30,380
the classes,
will delineate each of these variables,

1165
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:32,360
try to understand precisely what they
mean,

1166
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:37,130
see if we can analyze their effect on
society and maybe also provide you with

1167
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:41,120
the opportunity to get some more insight
into the personality traits that you

1168
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:42,830
have.
The exercise,

1169
01:07:42,831 --> 01:07:44,450
the personality,
self analysis,

1170
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:48,590
the adjectives that were in there were
taken from the big five models.

1171
01:07:48,591 --> 01:07:49,610
And so,
you know,

1172
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:53,150
that sort of gave you an opportunity to
assess yourself roughly on a big,

1173
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,260
on the big five dimensions and see what
you could do to improve.

1174
01:07:58,070 --> 01:07:59,810
So we'll see you on Thursday.
