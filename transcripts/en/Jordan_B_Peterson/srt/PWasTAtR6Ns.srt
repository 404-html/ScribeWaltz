1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,110
Um,
tonight's talk,

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:07,680
this is the most popular talk we've ever
done in 15 years.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,850
Thank you.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,793
Tonight is the third,
so it's been a weekend of Jordan 

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:22,933
Peterson,
which has been a huge pleasure for 

6
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:27,230
anyone who doesn't know him.
Um,

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,363
and last night I think it was one babe 
in arms and tonight it's probably my 

8
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:32,210
mother,
um,

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,610
he is a,
was it professor,

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,473
associate professor at Harvard 
University and is now the professor of 

11
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,080
clinical psychology at Toronto.
I'm,

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,923
his first book was a huge success.
It revolutionized the psychology of 

13
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:47,924
religion and his latest book of the 12 
rules of life is set to do exactly the 

14
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:56,240
same.
I'm just a few housekeeping things.

15
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,300
At the end of the talk we're going to 
have a q and a,

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,260
which I'm good to moderate.
Um,

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,113
so do prepare your questions,
please make them questions and also for 

18
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:07,424
those people in the live stream,
there'll be posted notes and you 

19
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:10,814
couldn't,
uh,

20
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,010
um,
hand questions for the washers and we'll

21
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:14,390
be taking those as well.

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,740
Um,
so,

23
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,350
um,
I look forward to that and at the end of

24
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:22,380
it we're going to be doing not so much 
assigning a bit here onstage,

25
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,620
a dedication.
Um,

26
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,483
everyone's book is,
or pretty well everyone's work is 

27
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:29,330
already signed,
so if you want to,

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,570
if you don't want a dedication,
then just leave you.

29
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,790
I'm on the third page.
You'll find the signature.

30
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,953
Um,
in order to last night there was a huge 

31
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:42,590
queue as you can imagine in order to 
make the q run smoothly.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,690
And sorry to sound Bossy,
but he's not going to be doing selfies.

33
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:48,913
I'm a
just because it means he's got to stand 

34
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,480
up the whole time and it'll slow down 
the flow.

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,513
Um,
but he is very happy to be photographed 

36
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,340
and you can photo bomb him if you'd 
like.

37
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,460
Also because all of us,
particularly me,

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm a really keen for him to solve the 
problems of our lives.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,670
I'm pleased resist doing that,
um,

40
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,650
during the dedication because it'll 
really slow everything down.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,873
Um,
I think the three things that you can 

42
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,840
take away from this evening,
um,

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,890
and you'll be the judges,
first of all,

44
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,110
be inspired by the talk.
Secondly,

45
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,660
read the book and thirdly,
Marissa Canadian,

46
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,360
I feel rather fortunate to have now done
all three.

47
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,573
Um,
also if you would like to tweet about 

48
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,960
it,
Hashtag the rules that 12 rules of life.

49
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,183
So without further ado,
please welcome one of the world's great 

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,440
public intellectuals,
Jordan Peterson.

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,033
Well that was nice.
So I thought I'd talk about my book 

52
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,654
tonight
given two talks now and I didn't 

53
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:48,480
actually talk directly about it,
I sort of talked around it then.

54
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,950
So I thought I don't like to give the 
same talk twice.

55
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,460
So I thought I'd actually walked through
it and,

56
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,590
and,
and outline it a little bit.

57
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,440
And so I had spent most of the day 
memorizing the rules.

58
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,274
You know,
you'd think if you worked on something 

59
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:04,190
for three years,
it's been five years,

60
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:06,020
I guess you'd actually have it 
memorized.

61
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:10,790
But memory is a very strange thing and 
it's very particular and goal oriented.

62
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,130
And I actually didn't have the rules 
memorized.

63
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,160
It's certainly not their numbers,
so hopefully I do by now,

64
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:16,994
so I guess we're gonna find out,
but I have a copy of the book here in 

65
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:20,024
case in case I forget,
so I think we'll go through them one by 

66
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:25,820
one and we'll see how,
see how that goes.

67
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,230
Seven o'clock.
So.

68
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,183
Alright,
good.

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,820
I'm
the first rule,

70
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,350
which is kind of a comical rule,
is stand up straight with your shoulders

71
00:04:36,351 --> 00:04:41,150
back and it's a meditation among other 
things on the habits of lobsters.

72
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,493
I read some papers on lobsters,
boat must be 10 years ago I guess and 

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,343
they just absolutely blew me away.
And one of the things I've really loved 

74
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,430
about being a psychologist and there's 
many things,

75
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:55,340
but I've really loved psychoanalytic 
theory and,

76
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,860
and the great clinicians,
the behaviors as well.

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,260
I mean Freud,
Jung Adler,

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,900
Carl Rogers,
Abraham Maslow,

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,540
uh,
that behaviors like skinner and,

80
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,100
and,
and the cognitive behavioral.

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,950
I mean I've learned a tremendous amount 
from reading the clinicians.

82
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,260
And so if any of you are interested in 
psychology,

83
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:13,094
I would really recommend reading the 
Greek clinicians because they know you 

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,270
learn so much about life.
It's crazy by reading them,

85
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:21,104
so that's been fun,
but then on the entirely other end of 

86
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:26,430
the spectrum,
where I've learned most about psychology

87
00:05:26,431 --> 00:05:30,390
is from the really low,
what would you call them,

88
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,560
the really science oriented animal 
behaviorist,

89
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,394
so that's where they were,
who they turned into the 

90
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,290
neuroscientists,
right?

91
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,880
Do they were the animal behaviors first 
of all,

92
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,714
and then they turned into the 
neuroscientists that I've learned a 

93
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,690
tremendous amount from them.
There's such clear thinkers.

94
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,380
The best of the bunch.
I think there's two of them.

95
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:48,800
One named Jeffrey Gray who wrote a book 
called the neuropsychology of anxiety,

96
00:05:48,801 --> 00:05:51,560
which is just a deadly book.
It's impossible to read.

97
00:05:51,561 --> 00:05:52,394
It takes like six months to read it 
because I think he he read like 1800 to 

98
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,110
write it or something like that and he 
actually read them.

99
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,600
That's the cool thing,
and he understood them,

100
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:03,434
which is really something.
Then there's another guy named Jaak 

101
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,910
Panksepp who wrote a book called 
affective neuroscience,

102
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,580
which outlines his studies,
for example,

103
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,414
of rats.
He was the guy who learned that rats 

104
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,650
laugh if you tickle them with the end of
a pencil eraser,

105
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,840
but they laugh ultrasonically like bats,
so you have to.

106
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,003
You have to slow down the ultrasonic 
vocalizations before you can hear them 

107
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:24,134
giggle and you'd think,
why the hell would you spend your time 

108
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,340
tickling rats with a pencil and making 
them laugh,

109
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,213
but see what he demonstrated there was 
that there was a place circuit in 

110
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:34,430
mammals that there's an actual.

111
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,250
There's a psychobiological basis for 
rough and tumble play,

112
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:39,350
for example.
It's a bloody big deal,

113
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,184
you know,
discovering a whole new circuit in the 

114
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:43,790
brain that's like discovering a 
continent.

115
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:47,330
It's Nobel prize winning stuff and 
Panksepp's affective neuroscience.

116
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,164
I would highly recommend that.
So there's this other book I know about 

117
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,310
too,
which is 12 rules for life,

118
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,870
which you could also look into if you 
want.

119
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:59,450
Anyways,
I was reading these articles on lobsters

120
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:04,451
and I came across this,
this finding that lobsters,

121
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:10,040
lobsters governed their postural 
flection with Serotonin,

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,211
and I thought,
God,

123
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,700
that's so interesting.
It's so into selection is this,

124
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,490
is to stand up straight to Dr. wow,
that's so interesting because you know,

125
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,523
depressed people crouch over.
I wonder if there's any leap between 

126
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,530
those two things.
And then I went and read a whole pile of

127
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:26,510
papers on lobster,
lobster,

128
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,390
neurochemistry,
lobster neurochemistry is actually quite

129
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,850
well understood because they have a 
fairly simple nervous system.

130
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,510
Right?
And,

131
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,330
and so if you want to understand the 
complex nervous system,

132
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,164
it's a good idea to understand a simple 
one first and then sort of elaborate 

133
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:43,810
upwards and it turns out that serotonin 
governed status,

134
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,043
a governed status,
emotional regulation and posture in 

135
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,560
lobsters just like it does in human 
beings.

136
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:54,510
And so that was just blew me away.
And so one,

137
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:55,344
one,
one thing that the chapter one is about 

138
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,890
is the fact that if a lobster is 
defeated in a dominance battle,

139
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,390
you can give it essentially 
antidepressants and it will fight again.

140
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,540
Another just blew me away,
you know,

141
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,383
it is.
So,

142
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,690
it's so remarkable because one of the 
things that tells you is that,

143
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,490
so if you're a manager,
you could be lobster,

144
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,590
top dog or bottom dog.
Imagine there's 10 strata in the lobster

145
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,330
hierarchy,
so you can be number one,

146
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,740
right,
top lobster,

147
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,150
number 10,
bottom lobster.

148
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,583
If your bottom lobster,
you have low serotonin levels and high 

149
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,023
dopamine levels.
That's the neurochemical that human 

150
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,044
beings don't produce and if you're a top
last or you have high serotonin levels 

151
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:40,490
and lower top,
I mean levels and you can move a lobster

152
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,324
in its dominance hierarchy by moderating
it's levels of serotonin and I thought 

153
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:46,094
that's so interesting because what it 
means is that the counter that keeps 

154
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,394
track of our status,
we have a counter in a sense in our 

155
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:56,010
minds that keeps track of our status is 
a third of a billion years old

156
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,140
and what that also means is that the 
idea of the hierarchy,

157
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,620
let's call it a dominance hierarchy 
because within lobsters it's.

158
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,570
It's kind of like a physical prowess 
hierarchy,

159
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:07,404
something like that.
The idea of the hierarchy is at least 

160
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,020
350 million years old and so I read that
and I think,

161
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,453
well so much for the idea that human 
hierarchies are associate cultural 

162
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:18,990
construct.
It's like,

163
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,730
no,
that's wrong.

164
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,450
It's not just a little bit wrong,
it's unbelievably wrong.

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,240
It's mindbogglingly wrong,
right,

166
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,550
and it's
right,

167
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,320
and so,
so hierarchies.

168
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,183
Hierarchies have been around for a third
of a billion years and and we have a 

169
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:40,191
neurochemical system that modulates our,
our understanding of those hierarchies.

170
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:42,450
And then also,
and this is the interesting thing too,

171
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,284
and this is why people's reputations are
so important to them among there's lots 

172
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,310
of reasons,
but this is one of them,

173
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,144
is that
where this counter that you share with 

174
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:52,764
lobsters rates you in terms of your 
hierarchical position determines the 

175
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:00,420
ratio of negative emotion to positive 
emotion that you feel.

176
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,160
And that's also an absolutely mind 
boggling idea for two reasons.

177
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,810
One is it tells you why it's so hard on 
people to be put down because it doesn't

178
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:10,644
just upset them in the moment.
It changes the way their entire system 

179
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:17,640
responds to the world so that they now 
experience more positive emotion in less

180
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,430
than a less negative emotion.
So that's really rough.

181
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,100
And then there's a corollary to that 
too,

182
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:23,934
which is like there's a very tight 
relationship between your belief system 

183
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:30,450
and your dominance hierarchy position.
It's complicated,

184
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,284
but it's worth going through like let's 
say that so I have a certain amount of 

185
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,060
status as a professor and and,
and,

186
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,650
and I have the,
let's call it the,

187
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,603
what would you say?
I've been granted the entitlement to a 

188
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,004
certain position in a social hierarchy.
Now the question is why do I have a 

189
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,404
valid claim to that position and the 
answer hypothetically is because I know 

190
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:54,720
enough so that my claim to the position 
is valid.

191
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,763
So then if you stand up in the audience 
and challenge my beliefs and show that 

192
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm wrong,
you might.

193
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:00,841
You might say,
well,

194
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:01,674
I get upset because I'm wrong,
but the more accurate reason that I get 

195
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,830
upset is because you're indicating to 
the crowd that my,

196
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,070
my position in the hierarchy of 
authority is invalid.

197
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,503
And by doing that you lower me in the 
hierarchy and you mess around with the 

198
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,610
neurochemical systems that are 
regulating my emotions.

199
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,623
And so if you're interested at least in 
part in why people are so prone to 

200
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:26,580
defend themselves and their beliefs in 
the service of their position,

201
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,120
then that's why.
And so that's a great example of how you

202
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:30,954
can learn these unbelievable things by 
stumbling across a rather obscure 

203
00:11:33,631 --> 00:11:35,070
biological fact.
It just,

204
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,100
it just,
what would you say?

205
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,310
It's like a,
it's like a series of dominoes and,

206
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,840
and that's also why biological facts are
so useful.

207
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,673
It's like we don't have to argue about 
whether or not social hierarchy says I 

208
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,910
said to her are or hierarchies are 
social constructs.

209
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,193
A given hierarchy is influenced in its 
structure by socio cultural 

210
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,980
conditioning,
let's say.

211
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,083
But the fact of the hierarchy.
So the part of your brain that detects 

212
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,643
and regulates your response to 
hierarchies is older than the part of 

213
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:08,470
your brain that recognizes trees like 
it's old.

214
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,390
It's really,
really fundamental.

215
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,313
And so,
and almost all social animals organize 

216
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:17,230
themselves and social in hierarchies 
because now the other thing that chapter

217
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:20,320
one is a bit of a meditation on what 
might constitute a hierarchy.

218
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,620
One of my business colleagues and former
student of mine from Harvard,

219
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,820
very,
very smart guy,

220
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,863
it's got a graduate degree in 
engineering from Mit and a phd in 

221
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,034
psychology from Harvard.
So there's like one of him in the whole 

222
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,314
world and he's a very smart guy and he 
helped me design the self authoring 

223
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:38,410
suite by the way,
and he's been working for about 20 years

224
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,244
on that.

225
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,003
That's a suite of programs that helps 
people write about their lives and 

226
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:43,564
straightened him out.
He told me to stop using the word 

227
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:49,330
dominance hierarchy and he said the 
reason for that was that it was infested

228
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,164
with Marxists presuppositions and it 
really bothered me when he first said 

229
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,790
that because I've been using the word 
for years,

230
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,970
dominance hierarchy.
He said we had a discussion about that.

231
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:58,421
He said,
well,

232
00:12:58,421 --> 00:12:59,254
it's predicated on the idea that you 
climb up the hierarchy human hierarchy 

233
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,390
as a consequence of the expression of 
power.

234
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,523
It's like that's wrong.
You climb up valid hierarchies as a 

235
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:08,194
consequence of the expression of 
competence and that's actually 

236
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,613
technically right.
He was exactly the right person to tell 

237
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:13,894
me that because he had done his phd on 
what predicts success in western 

238
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,600
hierarchies.
And the answer is quite clear.

239
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,110
General cognitive ability,
some prefrontal ability as well,

240
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,090
which was what he's specifically tested.

241
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,980
So intelligence.
Roughly speaking,

242
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,950
although it's a little bit more 
elaborate than intelligence,

243
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:30,784
but that's close enough and trait 
conscientiousness accounts for about 50 

244
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:36,400
percent of the variance in longterm 
success and you think,

245
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,450
well,
hey,

246
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:39,430
how do you want your society to be 
structured?

247
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,010
It seems pretty good to me.
That smart,

248
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:45,310
hard working people are the ones most 
likely to succeed.

249
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,250
That's not a bad empirical test of the 
validity of a structure.

250
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,383
You know,
especially given how much vaguery there 

251
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,320
is in life.
Lots of random things happen to people,

252
00:13:53,321 --> 00:13:54,154
but it's better to be born three 
standard deviations above the mean and 

253
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:59,040
intelligence in the West than it is to 
be born.

254
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,883
Three standard deviations above the mean
in wealth in relationship to where 

255
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,474
you'll end up when you're 40.
So he said to use the word competence 

256
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,970
hierarchy or we decided that and I think
that's much better.

257
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,133
So chapter one is a bit of a meditation 
on the nature of hierarchies in the 

258
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,790
biochemistry of hierarchy,
but it's also an injunction about how to

259
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,624
present yourself because you don't.
You want to present yourself to the 

260
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:24,424
world in a manner that
that doesn't disgrace you in some sense 

261
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:29,674
that that might be a good way to think 
about it and you don't want to disgrace 

262
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,440
yourself because the consequences of 
disgrace is emotional dysregulation,

263
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,750
more pain,
less positive emotion,

264
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,823
and so the best way to present yourself 
is to stand up forthrightly and to 

265
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,850
stretch out,
you know,

266
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,723
and to occupy some space and to to to 
make yourself sort of vulnerable by 

267
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,770
doing that because you open up the front
of your body,

268
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,663
right?
But it's a sign of confidence and that 

269
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,014
way people are most likely to give you 
the benefit of the doubt and that's a 

270
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,630
good way to start regulating your mood.

271
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,463
But not only does it directly regulate 
your mood to stand up because it's so 

272
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:07,430
tightly associated,
like pasta reflection is associated with

273
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,264
serotonin and emotional regulation.
But also because if you straighten up 

274
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,513
and you present yourself in that manner,
then other people are more likely to 

275
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,084
take you seriously.
And that means they'll start treating 

276
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:22,310
you as if you're a number one lobster 
instead of a number 10 lobster.

277
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,263
And that's another way that you can at 
least give yourself the bloody benefit 

278
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:27,500
of the doubt,
right?

279
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:28,883
And,
and,

280
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,723
and,
and,

281
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,633
and,
and confront the world in a courageous 

282
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,460
manner.
And that's a really good way of also of,

283
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,863
of figuring out how to establish 
yourself in multiple competence 

284
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,214
hierarchies because one of the general 
rules of thumb about how to be 

285
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:43,784
successful is to confront things that 
frighten you forthrightly and with 

286
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,404
courage.
And that's kind of a universal strategy 

287
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:51,290
for success.

288
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,210
And so that's what the first chapter is 
about.

289
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,670
So that's quite fun.
My graduate students,

290
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,370
I told them these lobster stories,
say my graduate students,

291
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:01,520
when we used to go out for breakfast and
they were a very competitive bunch,

292
00:16:01,521 --> 00:16:02,354
very fractious and witty,
and they were always trying to get one 

293
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:05,354
over on each other,
a making some witty put down or 

294
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:08,414
something like that.
And it got to the point in the 

295
00:16:09,371 --> 00:16:11,930
restaurants where they put their claws 
in the errands,

296
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,470
click like this when they got one over 
on one of their colleagues,

297
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:19,040
which was very peculiar and strange and 
very funny as well.

298
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,920
So,
so that's rule number one.

299
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,493
Rule number two is a treat yourself like
you're someone that you care about and 

300
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,120
that's a deeper chapter I would say like
chapter one is kind of comical,

301
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,120
but it's also got this serious 
scientific end for example,

302
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,070
and it's practical like most of the 
rules are.

303
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,070
Chapter two is a bit of a meditation on 
why.

304
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,520
See I read this,
I read this,

305
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,663
this piece of work by young,
the long while back and he was a 

306
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:50,324
meditation on the injunction to treat 
your neighbor as you would like to be 

307
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:57,530
treated or something like that and what 
you pointed out,

308
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:00,950
which I really liked was that that 
wasn't an injunction to be nice to other

309
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:04,100
people.
It was an invitation to reciprocity.

310
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:04,934
It was something like this is like you 
should figure out how you would like to 

311
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:10,730
be treated like you were taking care of 
yourself,

312
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,770
not how you would like people to respond
to you.

313
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,210
It's more important than that.
It's like,

314
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:17,660
imagine you had a child that you really 
cared for and and someone said,

315
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,883
well,
people will treat this child exactly 

316
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,410
like you want them to,
but you have to figure out what that is,

317
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,660
and so then you'd have to sit down for 
like a month and you think,

318
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:27,494
okay,
well how do you want your child to be 

319
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:28,850
treated?

320
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,620
You don't want everyone just to be nice 
to him.

321
00:17:30,621 --> 00:17:31,454
You know?
You want people to challenge them and 

322
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,283
you want people to discipline them and 
we want people to tell him when he's 

323
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,014
wrong.
It's like you don't just want everyone 

324
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,150
to be nice.
That's,

325
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,430
that's pathetic.
It's pathetic isn't.

326
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,323
There's no challenge in that and so well
you want to treat other people like you 

327
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,510
would like to be treated well.
Then you have to figure it out.

328
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,344
How would you like to be treated and why
you'd like people to foreign all over 

329
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:52,740
you and just lay everything at your 
feet.

330
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:53,640
It's like,
no,

331
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,120
that's not something you'd wish for for 
someone that you were taken care of,

332
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,343
and then then there's an additional 
problem which is it's often the case 

333
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:04,410
that people will treat other people 
better than they treat themselves.

334
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,490
That happens extremely frequently.
So one of the things I pointed out,

335
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,324
chapter two was the,
if you have a dog and you take him to a 

336
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,970
vet and the vet gives you your 
prescription medicine,

337
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:15,804
you'll go buy the medicine and you will 
give it to the dog and you will do it 

338
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:19,254
properly.

339
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,370
But if you go yourself to a doctor and 
you get a prescription,

340
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,204
there's one that there's a 30 percent 
chance you won't even pick up the 

341
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,020
medication.
And if you do,

342
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:28,854
there's a 50 percent chance that you 
won't administer it to yourself 

343
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:31,764
properly.
And so I already thought about when I 

344
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,610
first came across that statistic,
it really,

345
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,050
it was another one of those little 
facts.

346
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,790
I thought,
what the hell is up with that?

347
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:39,624
It's like you'll do it for your dog.
So obviously you'll do it for something 

348
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:47,550
you care about and you're conscientious 
enough so you'll actually do it.

349
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:49,560
So like,
why wouldn't you do it for you,

350
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,000
your dog likes you,
you know,

351
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,610
even your dog would rather that you did,
but you don't,

352
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:54,720
you don't.
And,

353
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,170
and it's actually one of the reasons 
that modern medicine doesn't work nearly

354
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:01,920
as well as it could because people just 
don't take their medication and it's not

355
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,750
only because they don't take care of 
themselves.

356
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,583
There's some skepticism about doctors,
but you can be just as skeptical about 

357
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:10,740
the vet.
So it's a deep meditation,

358
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:11,880
I would say,
and it's,

359
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,803
what I've done with these rules is 
they're very simple rules and they're 

360
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,160
kind of comical and tongue and cheek in 
some ways.

361
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:17,994
But what I've tried to do is like pull 
them apart and show what's underneath 

362
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:24,330
the men to go down as deep as I possibly
can.

363
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,840
And in rural too,
it's a bit of a meditation on why people

364
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:32,270
don't like themselves very much.
And I think there's two reasons really.

365
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,213
One is that we're,
we're fragile and damageable and 

366
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:39,390
imperfect in multiple dimensions all the
time.

367
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,583
And that often just gets worse,
it gets lots of things get worse as you 

368
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:44,190
get old,
for example.

369
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,024
So it's not necessarily that easy for a 
self conscious being who's 

370
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,860
extraordinarily aware of his or her own 
fragility and,

371
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,330
but not just virgility
foolishness and errors.

372
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,170
His like,
you know,

373
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:00,660
yourself better than anyone else knows 
you and you know,

374
00:20:00,661 --> 00:20:01,494
you,
you might have a certain amount of 

375
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,440
dislike for someone,
you know,

376
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:06,180
because of something they did.
But you know,

377
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,070
everything you did,
Jesus,

378
00:20:08,071 --> 00:20:09,360
that's a drag man.
You know,

379
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:10,950
you have to carry that along behind.
It's like,

380
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,150
really,
I did that,

381
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:14,220
you know?
And then so there's that.

382
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:15,054
It's like you're your week and kind of 
useless and prone to temptation and you 

383
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,644
know,
all those things that just shouldn't be 

384
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,314
that way.
And then you're also capable of pretty 

385
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:24,594
vicious acts of malevolence.
And so you also know that about 

386
00:20:26,881 --> 00:20:27,714
yourself.
And so it's a real existential question 

387
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:30,354
for people's like,
why the hell should you take care of 

388
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,260
something is sorry and wretched as you 
are.

389
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,450
And that's really what the chapter's 
about.

390
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:38,460
It's because the answer in the chapter 
is,

391
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:39,000
yeah,
yeah,

392
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,270
yeah.

393
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,900
You know your first of all,
yes,

394
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,753
you're pretty useless and terrible,
but so is everyone else and that's 

395
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,110
actually an existential problem.
Right?

396
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,183
And what I mean that it's a problem that
every human being has always had an 

397
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,630
always will,
so it's not just you,

398
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,510
it's a universal problem and that 
there's,

399
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,373
there's an answer to that and one of 
them is to what is to say love the 

400
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,360
sinner,
but hate the sin.

401
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,194
It's something like that is that despite
the fact that you're not all that you 

402
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,554
could be,
the proper attitude to have towards 

403
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:08,194
yourself is the attitude that you would 
have towards someone that you genuinely 

404
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:12,064
cared for and that it's incumbent on you
to act as if you genuinely care for 

405
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,504
yourself just like you would act toward 
someone that you actually cared about 

406
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,154
some other person.
So it's a reversal in some sense of the 

407
00:21:23,051 --> 00:21:23,770
golden rule.

408
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,830
Right?
And,

409
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,790
and it's a discussion of why that's 
necessary.

410
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,700
And also more than that,
it's a discussion of why,

411
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,040
why you have a moral obligation to do 
that.

412
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,710
It's not just that you should because it
would be better for you.

413
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,720
It's you actually have a moral 
obligation to do that.

414
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,390
I think because you make the world a 
much better place,

415
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,150
a much worse place if you don't take 
care of yourself,

416
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,640
so you should bloody well take care of 
yourself,

417
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,950
you know,
because well,

418
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,813
that's what the chapter's about.
It's partly because you have something 

419
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:51,844
valuable to bring into the world.
That's the thing about being an 

420
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,830
individual.
It's the thing that Western civilization

421
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:57,664
has always recognized that as an 
individual you have a light that you 

422
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:03,640
have to bring into the world and that if
you don't bring it into the world,

423
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,713
the world is a dimmer place and that's a
bad thing because when the world is a 

424
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,860
place,
it can get very,

425
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,150
very,
very dark,

426
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:13,120
and so it's not just so that you feel 
better,

427
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,250
not just so that you're a number one 
lobster.

428
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,420
None,
none of those things.

429
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,523
You need to take care of yourself 
because you're in the best position to 

430
00:22:19,511 --> 00:22:20,344
do that and it's necessary for you to 
take care of yourself despite the fact 

431
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:27,550
that we're mortal and vulnerable and 
self conscious and capable,

432
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:29,620
not only capable of doing terrible 
things,

433
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:32,250
but actually do them despite all that 
you.

434
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,293
You're still.
You still have that responsibility and 

435
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:36,814
so I wanted to hit the question as hard 
as I can to try to figure out well why 

436
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:45,580
people are have are contemptuous of 
themselves and there's plenty of reason,

437
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:46,414
that's for sure,
but the reasons do not justify the 

438
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:52,000
mistreatment of yourself.
It's as simple as that.

439
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,893
It's not a good strategy and the next 
rule is make friends with people who 

440
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:56,854
want the best for you,
and that's a meditation on my own 

441
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,900
childhood and adolescents to some 
degree.

442
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,020
I had friends who wanted the best for me
and friends who didn't know.

443
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,883
They were friends who,
some of them were aiming up and some of 

444
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,004
them were aiming down and if you have a 
friend that's aiming down and you do 

445
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:15,274
something that's aiming up,
then they're generally not that happy 

446
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:17,981
about it.
You know,

447
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:18,814
they tried to talk your accomplishment 
with one of their own hypothetical or 

448
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,534
real or put down what you're doing or 
offer you a cigarette if you're trying 

449
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,134
to quit and you've kind of done that 
successfully or a drink if you've been 

450
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,630
drinking too much and are just trying to
stop being an alcoholic,

451
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:32,920
you know,
or,

452
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,480
or any.
They're cynical and bitter and,

453
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,633
and devoted towards no good.
And sometimes that's family members too 

454
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:41,550
and sometimes it's even part of you,
you know,

455
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,410
but this chapter is a injunction to 
people is like,

456
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,130
like you have an ethical responsibility 
to take care of yourself.

457
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:49,964
You have an ethical responsibility to 
surround yourself with people who have 

458
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,073
the courage and,
and faith and wisdom to wish you well 

459
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,104
when you've done something good and to 
stop you when you're doing something 

460
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,394
destructive.

461
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,430
And if your friends aren't like that,
then they're not your friends.

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,833
And maintaining your friendships with 
them might not even be in their 

463
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:12,314
interest.
And so it's a tricky argument to make 

464
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:15,260
because I'm not saying,
you know,

465
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:16,094
whenever anyone's in trouble you should 
push them into a ditch and then give 

466
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,570
them a couple of kicks.
That's,

467
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,553
that's not the idea.
The idea is that what I had a couple of 

468
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,080
rules I didn't write about.
One was be careful,

469
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,650
be careful about whom you share good 
news with.

470
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:31,484
And another was be careful about who you
share bad news with and everyone goes 

471
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,010
rules ringing in people's minds quite 
quickly.

472
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,290
A friend is someone you can share good 
news with.

473
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,710
You know,
you go to them and you say,

474
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:42,170
hey look,
this good thing happened to me.

475
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,220
And they say,
look,

476
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:46,130
I'm so happy that that happened to you,
like way to be.

477
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,450
And they don't think,
God dammit,

478
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,180
why didn't that happen to me?
And like,

479
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,380
you know,
you didn't deserve it.

480
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,820
Here's a bunch of reasons you're stupid 
and why it won't work.

481
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:54,320
It's like,
that's not helpful.

482
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,800
And so I would say like if people are,
you know,

483
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,440
the other thing people are doing,
if they're trying to drag you down,

484
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:01,274
let's say,
is they're trying to see if you'll put 

485
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:02,984
up with it because they have this idea 
that maybe life isn't worth living and 

486
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,480
things aren't good.
And then if they can be smirch,

487
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:10,160
let's say,
to use an archaic term,

488
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,580
something that's pristine and good,
then they demonstrate to themselves that

489
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:14,414
there is no true ideal and that there's 
no necessary reason to be responsible 

490
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:21,080
and to strive forward.
And so they use us as a test case.

491
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,213
You know,
I'll just push you down into the low 

492
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,610
lobster,
been and see how you respond.

493
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,950
And if you put up with it then yeah,
my cynicism is fully justified.

494
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,893
So.
Well that's chapter three and it's a 

495
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:33,494
painful chapter because it also details 
the suicide of one of my friends which 

496
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,030
occurred over a very long period of 
time.

497
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,090
Not the actual suicide,
but all the pro drama to it.

498
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:43,350
And so.
And it's sick.

499
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,460
It's a contentious chapter.
Number four is

500
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,330
compare yourself to who you were 
yesterday,

501
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,033
not to who's someone else's today,
and the reason I wrote that it was 

502
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:59,510
because I had this client tenure,
I'm clinical psychologist and I've spent

503
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,080
20 hours a week for 25 years listening 
to people,

504
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,260
listening to people tell me about their 
lives,

505
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,094
you know,
and those people were people who were 

506
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,144
just barely hanging onto the bottom of 
the world up to people who are so 

507
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,470
successful.
You can hardly believe it.

508
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,510
Like the entire gamut of people.

509
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,510
And that's been absolutely fascinating.
It's like,

510
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,420
it's like being a clinical psychologist,
if you really listen,

511
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:24,470
is like being immersed in a Dostoyevsky 
novel all the time,

512
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,383
you know,
because it's amazing what people will 

513
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,000
tell you if you listen to them.
They are.

514
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:29,834
People are so interesting if you 
actually listened to them because 

515
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,320
they're so peculiar,
like they're like,

516
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:35,750
penguins are right now services an 
ostriches.

517
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:38,660
They're unlikely creatures.
And anyways,

518
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,230
with regards to,
um,

519
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,403
to a,
comparing yourself to who you were 

520
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,950
yesterday,
not as who someone else's today.

521
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,120
I'm this old client of mine,
he was about 85 when he came to.

522
00:26:54,121 --> 00:26:54,954
See me,
and he was a financier and a kind of a 

523
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:57,234
mathematical genius.
He made these little pendants out of a 

524
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,080
mathematical symbol for the most 
beautiful mathematical equation that was

525
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:04,914
ever written.
He made them out of gold and he would 

526
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,100
hand those out and and he,
he had,

527
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,953
he had studied psychology as a young man
and he introduced me to this concept 

528
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:14,790
that I didn't know about called the 
parades distribution,

529
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,624
which see I'd been taught as a 
psychologist that most human 

530
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:21,840
characteristics or normally distributed,
right?

531
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,040
So most people were average and some 
people were extreme.

532
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:29,250
Now that's a or normal distribution 
intelligence is like that and height.

533
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,440
There's more people of average height 
than that.

534
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:32,640
Very Tall,
very short,

535
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,483
and weight is like that.
And lots of things are normally 

536
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:38,250
distributed and psychologists tend to 
assume that everything is,

537
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,084
but it isn't.
Creative products are distributed in a 

538
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,593
prieto distribution and that's a whole 
different thing and it's really 

539
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,820
important to know this.
It's another fundamental fact,

540
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,440
the knowledge of which can sort of 
transform the way you conceptualize,

541
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:54,420
let's say,
the political landscape.

542
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:55,254
So here,
here's an example of the predo 

543
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:59,700
distribution half.
You know there's a rule of thumb that if

544
00:27:59,701 --> 00:28:03,210
you run a company that 20 percent of 
your employees do 80 percent of the work

545
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,103
or the 20 percent of your customers are 
responsible for 80 percent of your 

546
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,494
sales,
or the 20 percent of them are 

547
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,610
responsible for 80 percent of the 
customer service calls.

548
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,710
Same thing.
But that's not exactly the rule.

549
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:16,470
The rule is worse than that.
The rule is

550
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,803
in a given domain,
the square root of the number of people 

551
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,510
operating in that domain do half the 
productive work.

552
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,250
So you think,
well you have 10 employees,

553
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:27,660
three of them do half the work.
It's like,

554
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:28,590
yeah,
okay,

555
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,910
what if you have 100 employees?
Then 10 of them do half the work.

556
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,660
What if you have a thousand employees,
then it's 30,

557
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,380
and if it's 10,000 employees then it's 
100.

558
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:43,490
And this actually turns out to be a 
rather ironclad rule.

559
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,530
It applies across very,
very many situations.

560
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,970
It applies,
for example,

561
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,060
to the massive stars and the size of 
cities.

562
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,090
So you can see how universal it is as a 
law and it's,

563
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,400
it's something like those that have 
more,

564
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,740
get more and those that have less good,
less,

565
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:00,120
that's the matthew principle,
right?

566
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,570
To those who have everything more will 
be given from those who have nothing.

567
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,613
Everything will be taken away and the 
economists sometimes call that the 

568
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:07,914
matthew principle.
And so what that lays out is a world 

569
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,480
that's rife with inequality.
So you know,

570
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:17,010
you hear this idea that I think it's the
85 richest people in the world have more

571
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:20,820
money than the bottom 2 billion.
That's a pareto distribution phenomena.

572
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:25,680
And you might say to hell with 
capitalism for producing that.

573
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,551
It's like,
sorry,

574
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:29,580
you got your diagnosis wrong.
It's a natural law.

575
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,100
It's no,
no matter what society you study,

576
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:32,934
you get a prieto distribution of wealth.
You get a prieto distribution of number 

577
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:36,744
of records recorded.
You'll get a prieto distribution of 

578
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,174
number of songs written or goals scored.
Like creative product has that 

579
00:29:42,701 --> 00:29:43,534
characteristic.
And it's partly because as you start to 

580
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,100
become successful,
let's say people will offer you more and

581
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,120
more opportunities.

582
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,133
And as you start to fail,
people move away from you and you 

583
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:53,290
plummet.
And so,

584
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,090
okay,
so that's rough.

585
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:55,924
So what it is,
what it means is that there is always a 

586
00:29:57,431 --> 00:30:01,210
landscape of inequality and not saying 
that we shouldn't do anything about it,

587
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,240
although I am saying that we don't know 
what to do about.

588
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,353
That's the thing you know,
because you can modify the prieto 

589
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,730
distribution of wealth,
let's say,

590
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,743
but if you,
but we don't know how to do it without 

591
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:14,830
maybe disrupting the system so 
completely that it collapses,

592
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:17,170
which is what happened in the Soviet 
Union for example.

593
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,363
And in Mao's China,
they were trying at least in principle 

594
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:21,424
to adjust in equality,
but the cure was far worse than the 

595
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:25,510
disease.
And the,

596
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:26,344
the truth of the matter is we actually 
don't know technically how much 

597
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,840
inequality there has to be to generate 
wealth.

598
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,460
We can guess.
And you could say,

599
00:30:33,461 --> 00:30:35,110
well,
there should be less than you might say,

600
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:36,880
well there should be more.
If you're left wing,

601
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,740
you'd say less than if they're.
If you're right wing,

602
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,251
you'd say,
well,

603
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:40,084
we'll just let the inequality flourish.
But we do know that it's inevitable and 

604
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,780
we also know that we don't know how to 
regulate it.

605
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:47,823
So there is inequality.
What that means is there's always gonna 

606
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,780
be people around that are better at 
something than you are.

607
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,160
And the.
And that's a,

608
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,263
that's a problem because you can get 
jealous and you can get bitter and you 

609
00:30:57,701 --> 00:31:00,580
can get resentful and worse.
You can get hopeless,

610
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:01,450
you know,
because you look like,

611
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,900
look,
I have this friend of mine,

612
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:09,430
he told me something so funny he was,
he was decrying his,

613
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,443
his lack of success in the world.
And he compared himself to his roommate 

614
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,660
and he said,
know his roommate,

615
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,880
his college roommate was doing much 
better than he was.

616
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,430
And his bloody roommate was Elon Musk.
It's like,

617
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,360
really?
It's like,

618
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,960
oh,
you're not doing as well as Elon Musk.

619
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,603
I mean,
you can see it would take it rather 

620
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,430
personally because they were roommates 
and everything.

621
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,150
It wasn't like he was doing badly,
like he wasn't doing pretty damn well.

622
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:36,580
It's not as good as Elon Musk.
It's like,

623
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:39,700
yeah,
well you and 7 billion other people,

624
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:40,534
you know.
But I thought it was instructive 

625
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,970
because,
well,

626
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,933
he has.
You have to be careful who you compare 

627
00:31:46,591 --> 00:31:47,424
yourself to.
Now you can't just not compare yourself 

628
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,780
to others to successful people,
right?

629
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:53,310
Because then you don't have anything to 
emap.

630
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,830
And one of the things I learned from 
young,

631
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,783
this was a cool thing.
I'm going to make a real lateral move 

632
00:31:58,261 --> 00:31:59,670
here.
Young thought.

633
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:00,504
The book of revelation was appended to 
the Bible because of the Christ in the 

634
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:05,910
Gospels was to merciful.

635
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,250
He was too nice a guy.
Now he's an ideal,

636
00:32:08,251 --> 00:32:09,240
right?
And Young said,

637
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,700
wait a second.
An ideal is always a judge.

638
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,013
That's the thing about an ideal,
because you're not as good as your 

639
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:15,984
ideal.
So your ideal is a judge and revelation 

640
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:18,624
has Christ coming back as a judge.
And that was humans explanation at the 

641
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:22,524
level of the collective unconscious for 
the pasting of that remarkably strange 

642
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:28,350
and terrible book onto the end of the,
of the,

643
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,440
of the Bible.
So anyways,

644
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:32,274
my point is,
is an ideal is if you need an ideal 

645
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:34,794
because you have nothing to aim at,
but an ideal as a judge and you always 

646
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,124
fall short of the ideal.
So how the hell can you have the 

647
00:32:40,341 --> 00:32:45,341
benefits of having an ideal without 
having the crushing blow that goes along

648
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:47,630
with having the judge that always 
regards.

649
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:48,464
He was insufficient.
So I was trying to work that out in the 

650
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:51,014
chapter and this is something I've had 
to work out a lot as a clinical 

651
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:54,470
psychologist.

652
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,090
It's like,
well let's say you need a goal,

653
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,140
but we don't want to let your distance 
from the goal crush you.

654
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,860
So you got to set up a goal and then you
gotta make the goal,

655
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,723
break the goal down into parts so that 
you can move towards it and you have a 

656
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:13,370
fairly high likelihood of doing it.
So that's a bit a bit of practical.

657
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,670
I wouldn't say advice.
It's because it's better than advice.

658
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,030
It's some practical knowledge about how 
to go about achieving an ame.

659
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,660
Set a high aim,
but differentiated down so you know what

660
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,494
the next step is and then make the next 
step difficult enough so you have to 

661
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,720
push yourself past where you are,
but,

662
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,500
but also provide yourself with a 
reasonable probability of success.

663
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,510
It's also what you do with children,
right?

664
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:39,500
You want to push them because they need 
to grow up and be more than they are.

665
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,333
Right?
But you don't want to crush them with 

666
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:42,104
constant failure.
So what you do is aim high and make the 

667
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:48,230
goal approximate difficult but proximal.
So anyways,

668
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,420
so that's one,
one,

669
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,290
one,
one way of looking at it.

670
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,480
But then the next thing is,
you know,

671
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,560
uh,
I've,

672
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,360
I've,
I've had clients,

673
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:58,850
many clients in their thirties who are 
trying to.

674
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,013
This is more true with women.
I would say a lot of women who are very 

675
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:03,074
high achieving who established their 
career goals at 30 and then want to 

676
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,930
differentiate,
differentiate out their life.

677
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:10,730
They want to have a husband and they 
want to have a family.

678
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:12,080
They're trying to figure out how to do 
that.

679
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,810
And one of the things I've noticed that 
around 30,

680
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:18,380
you really have to stop comparing 
yourself in some ways to other people.

681
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,603
And the reason for that is that the 
particularities of your life are so 

682
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:25,300
idiosyncratic that there isn't anyone 
really all that much like you,

683
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,173
you know,
because the details of your life 

684
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,430
happened to matter.

685
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,030
And so maybe you compare yourself to 
some rockstar or something like that and

686
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,113
you know,
the person's rich and famous and 

687
00:34:34,101 --> 00:34:35,540
glamorous and all that,
but you know,

688
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,374
they're alcoholic and they use too much 
cocaine and they've had three divorces 

689
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:39,494
and it's like,
how the hell do you make sense out of 

690
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:42,584
that?
Is that someone that you should judge 

691
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:44,714
yourself harshly against,
are not managers is you don't know 

692
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,590
because you don't know all the details 
of their lives.

693
00:34:48,591 --> 00:34:51,560
And who do you know that you can compare
yourself to?

694
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,010
That's easy you yesterday.
So here's a good goal.

695
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:57,950
It's something like,
well,

696
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:00,200
aim high.
And I really mean that.

697
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:01,034
It's like,
we'll talk about that a little bit to 

698
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,630
aim high,
but use as your control yourself.

699
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,493
It's like,
so your goal is to make today some tiny 

700
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:12,500
increment better than yesterday and you 
can use better.

701
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,333
You can define better yourself.
This doesn't have to be some imposition 

702
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:17,390
of external morality.
You know,

703
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,310
you know where you're weak and 
insufficient,

704
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,840
where you could improve fake,
okay,

705
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:24,680
well this is what I'm like yesterday.
If I did this little thing,

706
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,750
things would be just an increment better
and well,

707
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,980
that's a great thing because you get the
ball rolling and incremental improvement

708
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:34,814
is unstoppable.
You can actually implement it and it 

709
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,320
starts to generate pareto distribution.
Light consequences.

710
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,900
It starts to compound and I've seen that
happen in people's lives over and all,

711
00:35:43,901 --> 00:35:46,200
and people write me all the time and 
tell me that they're doing that,

712
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:49,410
but I've seen that happen in people's 
lives continually.

713
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,440
They make a goal,
a goal that the goal should be.

714
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:56,880
How could I conceive of my life so that 
if I had that life,

715
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,690
it would clearly be worth living so I 
wouldn't have to be bitter,

716
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,260
resentful,
deceitful,

717
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,670
arrogant,
and vengeful.

718
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,010
Like that's sort of the bottom line,
right?

719
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,890
Because that's what endless failure does
to you.

720
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,053
It's not good and that's what life 
without purpose and a goal does to you 

721
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:15,390
as well because life is very hard,
so you think,

722
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:16,224
okay,
well I need to adopt a mode of being 

723
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:22,500
that would justify my suffering and you 
can ask yourself that question.

724
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,260
What would make this worthwhile need a 
quote Nietzsche?

725
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:30,480
I think in that chapter he said he who 
has a why can bear almost.

726
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:33,140
Anyhow,
that's a lovely lied man.

727
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,450
I mean it's a lovely line and it's 
really worth thinking about.

728
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:37,284
So you think,
well,

729
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,370
how do I manage all this misery and 
suffering and futility?

730
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:42,121
It's like,
well,

731
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:42,954
I need to figure out what I would have 
to do in order to make that clearly 

732
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:47,364
worthwhile,
and so then you have your goal and then 

733
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:49,410
you think,
well,

734
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:50,243
I need to move towards that 
incrementally because I'm kind of 

735
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:55,530
useless and can only do so much and 
maybe not even that,

736
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,280
but all I have to do is be a little bit 
better than my,

737
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,523
my miserable self yesterday and that'll 
propel you forward very rapidly and you 

738
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,340
can succeed at it.

739
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:08,670
Which is also really lovely because why 
not set yourself up for success,

740
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:09,504
you know,
because otherwise you drove around like 

741
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:13,410
a number 10 lobster and you know,
that's just not good.

742
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:16,440
You get a pinchy when that happens and 
it's not a good thing.

743
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,590
So that was,
that was chapter four,

744
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:25,100
chapter five g's recruiting long here.
Chapter five is the one that I thought I

745
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:27,000
would get in the most trouble for 
writing.

746
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,863
You know,
I figured people would be all over me 

747
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:29,874
for this and so far they haven't been,
but they still might be so in it's 

748
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:37,800
called do not let your children do 
anything that makes you dislike them.

749
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,630
And I thought that would be contentious 
first of all because people would think,

750
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,790
well I never just like my children.
It's like

751
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,250
really,
really?

752
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:52,270
You know,
you're going to really tell me that God

753
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,900
when there's a more.

754
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,210
There's a more horrifying element to 
that too.

755
00:37:57,211 --> 00:38:01,140
Because as a clinical psychologist I've 
seen the full Friday of nightmare.

756
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:03,240
I can tell you that.
And you know,

757
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,853
I've seen families where it's like,
this is like the family members are 

758
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,900
standing in a circle.
Let's say,

759
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,913
and each of them has their hands around 
each other's neck and they're squeezing 

760
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:20,300
hard enough to strangle the other person
in 20 years and that's the family.

761
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,710
It's like,
you know,

762
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:25,200
if you,
if you haven't met a family like that or

763
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,150
well then you're not paying attention 
and there is,

764
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,760
there's some reasonable possibility that
you're actually in a family like that.

765
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,810
So the idea that parents can't dislike 
their children,

766
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:40,090
it's like God,
how naive can you get?

767
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:43,810
It's just,
that's just if you think that man,

768
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,740
you don't even know where you start to 
straighten yourself out high could never

769
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:48,930
disliked my children's.

770
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,193
Yeah.
Well those are the people who produce 

771
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:53,860
the most monstrous children too.
I can tell you that.

772
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,480
So,
so,

773
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,000
and then there's this idea that young 
had,

774
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:58,834
which I really love,
which is the idea of the shadow and you 

775
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:01,644
know it,
it Kinda got pop psychology and trendy 

776
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,893
sort of among the new age types too.
But one thing I can tell you about Carl 

777
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:11,170
young is no matter what else someone 
might say about him,

778
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,213
he is absolutely not new age.
If you read Carl young and you 

779
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,910
understand them and you're not terrified
right to the depths of your soul,

780
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,863
you haven't understood a damn thing 
you've read and one of the things that 

781
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,840
you said about the shadow,
which is the dark side of humanity,

782
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:26,674
the dark side of each individual was 
that its roots reached all the way to 

783
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:31,120
hell and he meant something.

784
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,900
He meant something very specific,
both metaphysical and practical.

785
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,930
By that the metaphysical element was he 
meant hell literally and metaphysically,

786
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:40,864
but he also meant the more proximal 
kinds of hell and so what he meant was 

787
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:48,931
that if you were able to understand your
dark side than you would see in yourself

788
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:52,570
a reflection of the behavior that was.
That was present at Auschwitz,

789
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:53,404
for example,
and that the reason that people don't 

790
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:58,000
take the dark side of themselves 
seriously at all,

791
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,863
even confront the fact that it exists is
because no one wants to see that 

792
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:06,610
reflected within them and no wonder like
it's absolutely no wonder.

793
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:07,563
You also believed that that 
confrontation with the shadow was an 

794
00:40:10,631 --> 00:40:13,900
inevitable barrier to enlightenment.
That there was no.

795
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,430
You know,
Joseph Campbell,

796
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,310
who was a popularizer of young to some 
degree,

797
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,300
has become well known for saying follow 
your bliss and,

798
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,910
and,
and you know,

799
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,190
Campbell learned virtually everything 
you knew from young but young that isn't

800
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,330
what young said at all.

801
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,163
He said,
pursue what's meaningful and you'll 

802
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:33,070
encounter or that which you least want 
to encounter.

803
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,830
And that's what.
That's the dragon,

804
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,230
that's the dragon.
The towards gold for example.

805
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:39,064
And the dragon is also something that 
lives inside you and it's not something 

806
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:45,160
that you take the encounter with 
lightly.

807
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:45,994
There are very old stories about this.
There's this story about the God horus 

808
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:53,560
who was Egyptian savior in some sense,
and when he encountered evil,

809
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,010
even though he was a god,
he lost an eye in the battle.

810
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,500
And so that's,
that's the famous Egyptian I,

811
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,970
you know,
that everyone still knows about.

812
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:01,804
That's the eye of horus that was torn 
out by seth who is the precursor to 

813
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,120
Satan and so and so.
It's,

814
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,680
it's,
it's no joke.

815
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,890
It's no joke back to children.
See,

816
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:12,724
I kind of knew this when I had my kids.
I had already undergone that to some 

817
00:41:16,121 --> 00:41:19,780
degree and and understood what it meant 
to be a bad person,

818
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:20,614
a terrible person,
and one of the things I knew that was 

819
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:25,750
that that manifested itself in families 
all the time.

820
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,420
Tyrannical father over protective 
mother,

821
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,030
more rarely over protective mother,
tyrannical,

822
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,350
overprotective,
father,

823
00:41:32,351 --> 00:41:33,184
tyrannical mother.
It's usually the other way around and 

824
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,284
the terrible pathological familial drama
that Freud made much of in the early 

825
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:42,650
20th century.
I'd seen that in many,

826
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:44,960
many situations.
Dismal,

827
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,280
brutal,
awful,

828
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,653
and I've seen parents punish their 
children and you can also take a page 

829
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:54,470
from niche if you really want to punish 
your children or anyone else,

830
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,210
if you have someone that you're 
interested in punishing,

831
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,140
including yourself when you don't know 
what ever punish someone,

832
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:00,974
you really want to punish for doing 
something wrong because now it's 

833
00:42:02,511 --> 00:42:04,570
actually a bit of a relief to them.
You know,

834
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,910
that's the theme of Dostoyevsky's crime 
and punishment.

835
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,910
The murderer gets away with it and it's 
a relief to him.

836
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:12,290
When he gets caught,
it's like,

837
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,590
no,
if you really want to punish somebody,

838
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,190
wait until they do something good,
then you punish them.

839
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,820
Because that'll teach them,
that's the maximize the hurt,

840
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:20,654
that way you decrease the probability 
that they'll ever do anything good 

841
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:23,630
again.
And I'll tell you,

842
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,464
man,
if you want to have a good relationship 

843
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:27,500
with someone,
that's one thing you don't do.

844
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,280
You Open your bloody eyes and if they do
something that you would like them to do

845
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,114
again,
then you tell them how much you 

846
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:38,360
appreciated the fact that that happened 
and you hope that it replicates,

847
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:39,194
you know,
you see that if there's one thing you 

848
00:42:42,381 --> 00:42:44,120
can take away from tonight's lecture,
that's,

849
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,020
that's an extraordinarily useful thing 
to know.

850
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,203
Watch,
and when people do something that they 

851
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:49,430
should do more of.
Say,

852
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:51,710
look,
I saw that you did this specific thing.

853
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,320
I saw that it took some effort.
Here's what it meant.

854
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:55,670
Here's this.
Here's how I observed.

855
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,290
It's like,
keep that up.

856
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,820
And Man,
if you love someone,

857
00:42:58,821 --> 00:42:59,630
you do that to them.

858
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:00,920
That's,
that's encouragement.

859
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:04,040
That's such a great thing.
So anyways,

860
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:04,874
back to children.
So I already knew that I was pretty 

861
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:08,600
decent monster by the time I had kids.
And I thought,

862
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,610
well,
my kid,

863
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:11,810
my kid's little,
you know,

864
00:43:11,811 --> 00:43:15,230
like a baby or two year olds,
like I'm horrible monster.

865
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:17,960
And so that there's an uneven power 
problem here.

866
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,380
I better not let that child do anything 
that really makes me angry.

867
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,120
You know?
And now you're here now.

868
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:25,100
And then you hear about something 
horrible that happens.

869
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,330
When I was in Boston years ago,
I read about a woman who pledged her two

870
00:43:29,331 --> 00:43:31,430
year old daughter's arms into boiling 
water.

871
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,301
You think,
well,

872
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:34,670
how in the world can that happen?
It's like,

873
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,683
well,
you know,

874
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,740
she's probably hung over.
She'd probably just lost her job.

875
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,170
She was probably desperate and six 
different ways.

876
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:46,160
She probably didn't have any decent 
disciplinary disciplinary strategies for

877
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:46,580
children.

878
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,770
She probably didn't have anyone helping 
her.

879
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,813
She was bitter and resentful and angry 
and the child misbehaved at exactly the 

880
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,360
wrong moment.
And like,

881
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,203
you're going to be around your children 
a lot and so you might want to have it 

882
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:02,630
so that they don't misbehave at exactly 
the wrong moment because all,

883
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:05,810
all hell can break loose if they can.
And I didn't want that to happen.

884
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:06,644
So.
And I knew that it was easy for people 

885
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:09,014
to hate their children even though they 
mouth the words that they love the bulk 

886
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:12,284
of the time.
I saw very little evidence of that many 

887
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:16,880
situations.
And so one of the things you know,

888
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:19,490
you have a natural affinity for children
and even more,

889
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,130
maybe a more powerful natural affinity 
for your own children.

890
00:44:22,131 --> 00:44:22,964
So that's a good start,
but you don't want to set them up as an 

891
00:44:26,421 --> 00:44:27,290
enemy against you.

892
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,123
You don't want to allow them to engage 
in the kind of hierarchical challenge 

893
00:44:31,411 --> 00:44:34,680
that makes you irritable and resentful.
That's not a good idea.

894
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,830
And if the things they do make you 
dislike them,

895
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,813
the probability that they will make 
other people dislike them is 

896
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,664
extraordinarily high.
And so you can consult your own 

897
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:46,620
irritability and you can say,
look,

898
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,750
kid,
I used to tell my kids this,

899
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,640
you know,
when they were three or four and say,

900
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:51,474
look,
I'm not a very good mood and I'm likely 

901
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:54,054
to be unreasonable.
So it'd be best if you'd go into your 

902
00:44:55,411 --> 00:44:56,760
room and play for a while.
It's like,

903
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:57,600
I like you,
man,

904
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:58,800
you're a great kid.
But like,

905
00:44:58,801 --> 00:45:00,810
get the hell out of here for awhile,
you know,

906
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,990
and they were fine with that.
We've trained them already at that point

907
00:45:03,991 --> 00:45:06,250
to be able to go play by themselves in 
their room,

908
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:07,084
you know,
which is something that a kid should be 

909
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:08,190
able to do anyways.

910
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,023
But,
but you need to know what sort of 

911
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,360
monster you are,
if you're going to be a good parent.

912
00:45:12,361 --> 00:45:13,111
And if you think,
oh,

913
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,130
I'm not a monster,
it's like,

914
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:14,964
Oh yes you are.
You're just an unbelievably unconscious 

915
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:19,590
monster and that's actually the worst 
time.

916
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:20,903
So,
and then the other thing about that 

917
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:22,494
chapter is there's an idea in it and 
it's an idea that I think is well 

918
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:25,944
supported by the relevant literature,
which is that your fundamental job as a 

919
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:31,200
parent,
especially if a child from zero to four,

920
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,190
is to make that child eminently 
desirable socially.

921
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,780
So what?
You're,

922
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:41,781
you're a successful parent if when your 
child is for all sorts of other children

923
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:45,360
want to play with him or her,
that's really the.

924
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,930
That's like if you want one marker of 
whether or not you've been successful,

925
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:49,973
that's it.
Now some children are a lot harder to 

926
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,374
get along with than others and some 
children have a harder time playing and 

927
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:55,464
so I'm not saying that every parent who 
has a child that isn't popular at four 

928
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,380
is is at fault for that.

929
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,450
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying the reverse,

930
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:04,284
which is you can be sure that you've 
been successful if your child is not 

931
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:07,980
popular.
Exactly,

932
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:10,650
but desirable as a playmate and so then 
you think,

933
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:12,270
well,
what have you done for your child?

934
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,433
Well,
you've opened up the entire world of 

935
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:16,950
children to them so because they know 
how to play,

936
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,873
which is a very deep knowledge and it 
starts to become inculcated probably at 

937
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,044
the breast and certainly in the course 
of rough and tumble play at about two 

938
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:27,480
years of age.
It's a deep embodied knowledge.

939
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,600
They know how to play like a good well 
trained dog knows how to play.

940
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:33,180
You know,
you meet a new dog and he'd go like this

941
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,860
and the dog goes like this.
You Think,

942
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:35,694
oh,
that dog,

943
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,340
I can go like this and it will bite me.
Right?

944
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:42,120
It knows how to play and it's a kid 
who's awake and alert is just like that.

945
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,450
Like a well socialized kit.
If you know anything about kids,

946
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:46,284
if you can take a four year old and make
a little play gesture at them and 

947
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:49,254
they'll smile right away and start 
playing just right now and that's what 

948
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:54,120
you want for your kids and then 
everywhere they go,

949
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:54,954
other kids like them and we'll include 
them in their play and play is the way 

950
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,500
that children develop.
And so if other children include them in

951
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:02,334
their play,
then the children develop and the poor 

952
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:08,670
kids that don't get befriended at the 
age of four with the literature on.

953
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:09,504
This is crystal clear.
If your child is an outcast at the age 

954
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,373
of four,
the probability that anything can be 

955
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:18,420
done about that is almost zero.
No matter what you do.

956
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,010
And I hate to be so blunt about that,
but I've.

957
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,630
I know the literature and that's what 
the literature suggests and so.

958
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,463
And then the other thing is if,
if you don't allow your children to 

959
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:28,554
engage in dislikable behavior than 
adults will like them because adults 

960
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:33,310
actually like kids.
You know,

961
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,100
one of the things I loved about having 
little kids in Montreal,

962
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:38,800
I lived in a poor area in Montreal.
There's a lot of rough guys around there

963
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:42,490
and we used to roll our daughter around 
in a stroller and these rough guys,

964
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:45,310
you know,
like God only knows what they were up to

965
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:46,450
there.
Rough looking guys.

966
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,493
And you know,
we rolled our daughter by him and 

967
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:50,950
they'd,
they'd like smile and they crouched down

968
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,070
and make a little goofy faces.
And they were.

969
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:55,563
I tell you,
one of the great things about having 

970
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,870
little kids is they bring out the best 
in other people.

971
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,950
You see a whole side of humanity.
Even among the darker parts of humanity.

972
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,320
You see a whole side of them that you 
wouldn't normally see.

973
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:07,210
And it's lovely.
And the thing is,

974
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:09,430
if you're good to your kid in the real 
way,

975
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:13,900
you can help them maintain that 
tremendous attractiveness that they have

976
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:16,630
as young children and to respond to 
adults properly.

977
00:48:16,631 --> 00:48:19,660
Like a puppy that wags its tail instead 
of growls and you know,

978
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,000
goes for your ankle,
and then wherever they go,

979
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:22,834
adults welcomed them and teach them 
things and pat them on the head and 

980
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,880
smile at them genuinely instead of 
saying,

981
00:48:27,881 --> 00:48:28,714
oh my God,
here comes to couple with that Goddamn 

982
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:31,990
Brat again.
You know,

983
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,063
which is the horrible.
That's horrible thing to do to a child 

984
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,170
because then everywhere they go,
all the good,

985
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,363
all the goodwill is false.
There's nothing that you can do to 

986
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:43,204
someone that's more terrible than to put
them in a world where all the good will 

987
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,880
direct it towards them is false.
That's a terrible thing.

988
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,740
So anyways,
that's what chapter.

989
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,300
It's chapter five and chapter six is 
about.

990
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,990
It's a rough chapter.
It's about,

991
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,180
I spend a lot of time reading about 
totalitarianism and about atrocity,

992
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,250
some brutal,
many,

993
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:07,084
many brutal things.
Brutal beyond the capacity of 

994
00:49:09,191 --> 00:49:10,150
imagination even.

995
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:12,903
And I read a lot about individual 
criminals and serial killers and those 

996
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,850
sorts of people trying to get to the 
bottom row one book.

997
00:49:18,851 --> 00:49:21,190
I would really recommend this book by 
Carl Parents,

998
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,024
Ram,
which is a,

999
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,910
an autobiography,
a ram is the name of the book,

1000
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,130
and he was a,
here's a rough guy,

1001
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:27,964
man,
his whatever his dying words to his 

1002
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,140
executioner,
to his hangman.

1003
00:49:32,141 --> 00:49:33,820
He said,
hurry up you who's your bastard?

1004
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:36,640
I could kill 10 men in the time that it 
takes you to hang me.

1005
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,810
That was his dying words,
you know,

1006
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:39,693
he said,
I wished the human race had one neck so 

1007
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,050
that I could put my hands around it and 
squeeze.

1008
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,513
That was Carl Pans,
Ram and not many people like that write 

1009
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:48,503
autobiographies.
But he did and he told you why he was 

1010
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:53,710
like that and why he thought that way in
case you want to find out,

1011
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:54,723
which I would recommend by the way,
because it's very useful to know such 

1012
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,210
things.
But um.

1013
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:05,623
Alright.
I have to remember why I told you that 

1014
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,780
story.
Oh yeah.

1015
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:13,730
Chapter six is about that.
It's about,

1016
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:15,620
it's about pans,
Ram,

1017
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,933
and it's about the columbine kids,
the kids who shot up the high school 

1018
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:23,180
because I read their diaries and,
and I understood them to,

1019
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:25,480
which is even better than just reading 
them and you know,

1020
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,400
you see these mass shootings all time 
and everyone does the same thing.

1021
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:29,750
Oh,
how did that happen?

1022
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,730
Why did that happen?
How can it be this way?

1023
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,470
It's like,
well,

1024
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,770
why don't you read what they say about 
why they did and just assume that that's

1025
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:37,604
the reason.

1026
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,520
If you go,
if you go,

1027
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:42,100
oh,
the columbine kids,

1028
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:46,620
oh yeah.
It was like,

1029
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,823
oh,
they must've been.

1030
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,780
Oh yes.
Because you know,

1031
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:50,614
the natural response of anyone who's 
been bullied is to go arm yourself to 

1032
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:56,920
the teeth to plot the destruction of the
entire city.

1033
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:57,754
I think it was Detroit to line your 
entire high school ave with bombs and 

1034
00:51:01,751 --> 00:51:05,170
then to go and shoot your classmates.
That's what happens when you're bullied.

1035
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,900
It's like,
no,

1036
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,130
that's not what happens when you're 
bullied as a stupid explanation.

1037
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:09,964
It's shallow beyond belief and it,
and it really emerges only because 

1038
00:51:12,851 --> 00:51:16,210
people don't want to contend with the 
real issue and the columbine kids,

1039
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:17,980
while they were contending with the real
issue,

1040
00:51:17,981 --> 00:51:18,814
you know,
they basically said quite forthrightly 

1041
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:24,480
that in their own arrogant estimation 
being itself was corrupted,

1042
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,353
unnecessary,
and it would be best if it was 

1043
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,870
eradicated in the most brutal possible 
way,

1044
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:32,080
as fast as possible.
And you get to places like that.

1045
00:51:32,081 --> 00:51:36,460
If you dwell on revenge for three or 
four years in your mom's basement,

1046
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,650
you know,
you can go to very dark places.

1047
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:41,470
And so that's what chapter six is about.
And you know,

1048
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,433
pans,
Ram,

1049
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,570
who was very brutally treated when he 
was a kid and the column by guys who,

1050
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,920
you know,
had their ups and downs,

1051
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:51,910
but nothing compared to Carl Patty,
Patty's Ramsay were,

1052
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,313
were judges of being and decided that it
was flawed and that they were the ones 

1053
00:51:57,851 --> 00:52:00,820
to set it right.
And so it's a rough chapter,

1054
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,543
but it's more than that.
It's a meditation on resentment because 

1055
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:09,430
resentment is a key human motivation.
And I would say it's,

1056
00:52:09,431 --> 00:52:11,370
um,
it's a great teacher to,

1057
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:15,220
to listen to your resentment is one of 
the best things you can possibly do.

1058
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,083
You have to admit that it exists first 
and then you have to admit to the 

1059
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:19,654
fantasies that it's generating and you 
have to admit to what you would regard 

1060
00:52:22,961 --> 00:52:23,794
as the way out of it.
So that's all very difficult because it 

1061
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:29,860
means learning things about yourself 
that you probably don't want to learn,

1062
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,900
but resentment only means one of two 
things.

1063
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,090
It means either like shut the hell up,
grow up,

1064
00:52:37,091 --> 00:52:38,560
quit whining,
and get on with it.

1065
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,450
That's one thing it means,
or someone is playing the tyrant to you,

1066
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:44,523
might even be you.
And you have something to say and do 

1067
00:52:46,391 --> 00:52:48,970
that you should say and do to put it to 
a stop.

1068
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:53,230
And so maybe and resentment can show you
the pathway to doing that.

1069
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,890
Um,
it's a meditation on resentment.

1070
00:52:56,891 --> 00:52:57,724
And one of the,
one of the principles that I extracted 

1071
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:04,240
from that is like a resentful person 
wants other people to change.

1072
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,810
And if you're resentful,
then your motivations are trustworthy.

1073
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:08,561
In fact,
they're very,

1074
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,890
very dark and that's why I went to the 
extreme with people like pens,

1075
00:53:11,891 --> 00:53:13,120
Rehmann,
the columbine killers.

1076
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,373
I'm resentful.
People who want to change the world are 

1077
00:53:17,351 --> 00:53:21,190
not to be trusted.
What should you do instead?

1078
00:53:21,191 --> 00:53:23,110
How do you treat your own resentment?
I would say,

1079
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:24,190
well,
there's a.

1080
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,130
there's a great.
I read this great

1081
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
line in the Tsl,
eot play called the cocktail party and 

1082
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,580
in it this woman comes up to a 
psychiatrist,

1083
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:34,890
I think this is in this chapter,
and she says,

1084
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,470
no,
I'm having a really rough time of it.

1085
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:39,590
I'm suffering badly.
My life is not going well.

1086
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,710
And,
and then she says,

1087
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,290
I hope that there's something wrong with
me.

1088
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,530
And the psychiatrist says,
what the Hell do you mean by that?

1089
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:47,364
And she says,
well,

1090
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:48,323
here's how I look at it.
There's either something wrong with the 

1091
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:53,610
world and I'm just in it and that's how 
it is.

1092
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,920
And then like,
what am I going to do about that?

1093
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:56,754
Because it's the whole world.
Or maybe I could be fortunate and 

1094
00:53:58,891 --> 00:53:59,724
there's something wrong with me that's 
causing all this unnecessary suffering 

1095
00:54:02,371 --> 00:54:06,480
and if I could just set it right,
I could learn and I can set it right.

1096
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:11,310
And so while I've been thinking about 
that for a very long time,

1097
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:12,144
and I think,
well,

1098
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,100
if your life isn't going the way it is,
you know,

1099
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:14,934
you can find someone else to blame,
which is pretty convenient for you and 

1100
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,090
also relatively easy or you could think,
okay,

1101
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,300
I don't like life.

1102
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,550
I don't like the way my life is 
unfolding.

1103
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:28,483
Maybe I don't like life in general 
because it's tragic and tainted with 

1104
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,633
evil.

1105
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:38,540
How do I know if my judgment is 
accurate?

1106
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,180
And the question is what have I really 
done?

1107
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:42,014
Everything I possibly could to set my 
life straight because maybe I shouldn't 

1108
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:46,334
be judging it's quality or the quality 
of life itself or being itself for that 

1109
00:54:50,451 --> 00:54:51,284
matter.
If I haven't done everything I possibly 

1110
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:56,920
could to set my life straight.
Well.

1111
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:01,040
So there's a task,
Solzhenitsyn who I'm a great,

1112
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,290
I'm a great admirer of social hits and 
his book,

1113
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,124
the Gulag Archipelago.
It was one of the things that brought 

1114
00:55:05,391 --> 00:55:06,224
down the Soviet Union and he said that 
one man who stopped lying could bring 

1115
00:55:09,081 --> 00:55:09,914
down a tyranny and you know,
he said that with some authority that I 

1116
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:13,724
can,
I think you could easily make the case 

1117
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:18,230
that the Gulag archipelago is the 
greatest book of the 20th century.

1118
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,090
I mean,
there's other contenders obviously,

1119
00:55:20,091 --> 00:55:22,760
but he said when he was in the Gulag 
camps,

1120
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:25,340
you know,
meditating on how the hell he got there.

1121
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:26,780
And he had a rough life man.
I mean,

1122
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:27,614
first of all,
he was on the Russian front at the 

1123
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:30,493
beginning of world war two and then he 
was thrown in the gulag camps and that 

1124
00:55:32,211 --> 00:55:34,040
was just the beginning of his adventures
man.

1125
00:55:34,041 --> 00:55:36,130
He had a rough life and he was in the 
camps.

1126
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,030
He was thinking,
what the hell?

1127
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,030
Like how,
what,

1128
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,030
how did I get here?
What's going on?

1129
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,910
And he had Hitler and Stalin to blame.
Right?

1130
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,430
So if you have,
if you need someone to blame man,

1131
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:48,260
Hitler and Stalin that,
that's great.

1132
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:49,880
But he,
he,

1133
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,450
that isn't what he did.
He said he meditated for awhile.

1134
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,570
Once he realized that he might have 
something to do with in some strange way

1135
00:55:56,571 --> 00:55:59,780
with the way things turned out for him 
and he said he went over his life with a

1136
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:02,180
fine tooth comb in his memory and 
thought,

1137
00:56:02,181 --> 00:56:04,790
okay,
where did I go wrong?

1138
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,260
But by my own judgment,
when,

1139
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:07,160
when,
when I,

1140
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:08,023
when there was a path in front of me,
when did I take the path that I knew I 

1141
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:12,920
shouldn't take?
Because you all know that,

1142
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:13,783
right?
You know,

1143
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,500
sometimes you don't know if what you're 
doing is good or,

1144
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,980
or if it's bad,
it's just ignorance.

1145
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:19,814
You just don't know.
But sometimes you have bloody well know 

1146
00:56:21,471 --> 00:56:23,410
and you do the thing you know you 
shouldn't do anyways.

1147
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:27,070
That happens a lot.
And why do you do that?

1148
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,340
Spiked is part of it stupidity.
There's all sorts of reasons,

1149
00:56:30,341 --> 00:56:32,740
but you certainly know you do it.
So as units and thought,

1150
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:33,574
okay,
well what would happen if I took 

1151
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,930
responsibility for where I am in this 
concentration camp?

1152
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,710
And then I went over my whole life and 
tried to figure out all the things I did

1153
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,720
that were wrong.
By my own estimation,

1154
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,793
that increase the probability that I 
would get here and then what would 

1155
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:47,884
happen if I tried to set them all right 
now in the present and that's why he 

1156
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,130
wrote the Gulag archipelago and one of 
the consequences of that,

1157
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:54,964
as I said,
was it sped the dissolution of the 

1158
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:57,880
Soviet Empire.

1159
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,090
So hey,
that's not bad.

1160
00:56:59,091 --> 00:57:03,050
A like you make a real confession.
You really repent you,

1161
00:57:03,051 --> 00:57:03,884
you do your penance,
which is writing this book and you 

1162
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,370
completely changed the Geo political 
landscape of the world.

1163
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,493
It's like,
and that that's worth thinking about 

1164
00:57:11,981 --> 00:57:13,840
because it's not only Solzhenitsyn who 
did that,

1165
00:57:13,870 --> 00:57:15,730
Nelson Mandela did something quite 
similar.

1166
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:16,803
It's not so impossible.
And so the idea that what you should do 

1167
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,040
if you're feeling resentful about the 
nature of being,

1168
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,720
are suffering too much for your own 
life,

1169
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:27,910
let's say is straightened the damn thing
out.

1170
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:30,040
Like seriously,
try it for a year.

1171
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:30,874
Even try it for a week.
Try Not doing the things you know you 

1172
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:38,980
shouldn't do.
Try Not saying the things you know to be

1173
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:43,000
false and just watch what happens.
You might as well give it a shot,

1174
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,110
right,
because you say,

1175
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:45,880
well,
I'm all in for a year,

1176
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:47,650
you know,
I'm going to do things right,

1177
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,873
and then I'll just stand back and watch 
how things unfold and maybe I'll 

1178
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,920
reconsider at the end of that year.

1179
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,050
It's like,
try it,

1180
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:59,050
try it.
I mean,

1181
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:03,010
I would say I've had thousands of 
letters now from people who are saying,

1182
00:58:03,011 --> 00:58:03,791
Hey,
I tried that,

1183
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:07,530
you know,
and her worked.

1184
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,630
No,
I quit lying and everything quit.

1185
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,640
You ever seen that simpsons episode 
where sideshow Bob keeps stepping on the

1186
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:16,474
rake over and over whole yard is 
littered with rakes and all he does is 

1187
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:23,950
walk around and step and then curse 
steps on a rake and hits him in the face

1188
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:26,240
and he curse isn't any steps on another 
rake and it,

1189
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:30,220
you know what I mean?
Stop doing that.

1190
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:32,160
No.

1191
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,380
Yeah.

1192
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,670
I don't know if we'll get through all 12
rules.

1193
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,020
Guess you'll have to read the damn book.
Anyways.

1194
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,850
Rule seven,
rule seven just about killed me.

1195
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,660
Like I,
I've had a lot of bad health in the last

1196
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,493
year and having to rewrite rules,
seven coincided with one of those 

1197
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:58,634
periods that lasted about a month and it
was was the hardest chapter by far and 

1198
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:06,020
it went down the deepest by far and it 
was really hard to get right.

1199
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,160
It's called do what is meaningful,
what is expedient,

1200
00:59:10,161 --> 00:59:10,994
and I'll just tell you a little bit 
about the chapter because I figured 

1201
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:15,950
something out in it that hadn't been 
explained it.

1202
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,750
Something that took me decades to figure
out.

1203
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:21,740
So there's this idea.
It's a very deep Christian idea that the

1204
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:25,880
Messiah is the person who takes the 
world sins upon himself,

1205
00:59:25,881 --> 00:59:27,470
right?
That's a characteristic of Christ,

1206
00:59:27,471 --> 00:59:28,730
right?
Is it's something.

1207
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,250
The idea is something like Christ died 
for your sins.

1208
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:33,440
It's like what the,
what the hell does that mean?

1209
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:34,810
Exactly.
You know,

1210
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:35,653
and partly what it means,
and I would say a slightly corrupted 

1211
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:38,864
form of Christianity,
is that you just have to believe that 

1212
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:42,200
that happened in the end,
you're redeemed.

1213
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,470
It's like,
well that's.

1214
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:47,390
We'll leave that aside for a second,
but there's an idea there,

1215
00:59:47,391 --> 00:59:49,790
a psychological idea and you know that 
because it's,

1216
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,150
the idea doesn't go away.
It's lasted for thousands of years.

1217
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:53,984
It's like,
well,

1218
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:58,010
so the idea signifies something.
It has a psychological reality,

1219
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,020
independent of it's metaphysical 
reality,

1220
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:00,854
whatever that might be.
And so I thought about that for a long 

1221
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,434
time.
It's like,

1222
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:05,420
what in the world does that possibly 
mean?

1223
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,310
And then I realized,
and you knew this,

1224
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:10,040
Carl Yoga knew this,
that it was associated with this idea of

1225
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,480
the shadow.
Um,

1226
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:15,770
I had this client once who,
her parents man,

1227
01:00:15,771 --> 01:00:16,910
they were pieces of work.

1228
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,280
She,
her parents taught her,

1229
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:20,114
I swear to you that this is the truth.
Her parents taught her that adults were 

1230
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,093
angels literally.
And when I saw her she was about 30 and 

1231
01:00:29,061 --> 01:00:31,940
she had a lot of strange symptoms,
symptoms of sorts.

1232
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:34,950
I'd never seen a psychosomatic symptoms.
Um,

1233
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,650
she,
she,

1234
01:00:36,651 --> 01:00:38,450
uh,
she had kind of like,

1235
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:41,220
cause I epileptic seizures at night and 
no,

1236
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,180
but she stayed conscious during them.
It was a very difficult to understand it

1237
01:00:44,181 --> 01:00:45,290
and I,
I won't walk through it,

1238
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:48,990
but her parents told her that adults 
were angels and uh,

1239
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:50,713
and she was like 28,
she had a university degree in and I 

1240
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:54,554
said,
well,

1241
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,670
didn't you ever
wonder about that?

1242
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,410
I said,
didn't you read any history?

1243
01:01:00,411 --> 01:01:01,221
And she said,
yeah,

1244
01:01:01,221 --> 01:01:02,054
what?
I read something about the terrible 

1245
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:06,410
things that people did to each other and
I would just compartmentalize it.

1246
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:11,600
And that was actually the key that I use
to unlock what was wrong with her,

1247
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,790
which was eventually fixed.
And I won't go into that.

1248
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,460
But,
but I said,

1249
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:18,020
I gave her this book,
give her two books.

1250
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:20,960
I gave her a book called the terror that
comes in the night,

1251
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:22,400
which is a book about,
um,

1252
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:26,870
about sleep paralysis and nightmares 
because I thought that was,

1253
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,270
what might it be bothering your.
Turned out that wasn't it.

1254
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,960
Then I give her this other book called 
ordinary ordinary men.

1255
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:36,200
And it's a great book.
That's terrible book,

1256
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:37,063
terrible dark book about,
about this police battalion that was 

1257
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:41,864
moved into Poland during World War Two 
after the Nazis had marched through and 

1258
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:45,734
it was all made of middle aged guys who 
weren't like victims of Nazi 

1259
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,750
totalitarian propaganda when they were 
kids.

1260
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:54,470
They were just middle class guys,
kind of like all of us,

1261
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:55,300
let's say.

1262
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,133
Um,
and they went to to police Poland and 

1263
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,073
um,
they were going to have to do some 

1264
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:03,793
terrible things essentially,
but their commander told them quite 

1265
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,770
forthrightly that if being involved in 
war time,

1266
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:10,604
policing was too hard on them.
If they felt that it f ethically 

1267
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,450
violated them are psychological 
psychologically violated,

1268
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,570
that they could just go back to policing
in Germany.

1269
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,733
And very few of them did big.
Partly because they didn't want to 

1270
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:22,920
abandon their comrades,
let's say.

1271
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,180
They didn't want them to have to do the 
dirty work,

1272
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,520
you know,
and they ended up,

1273
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:27,533
they were normal policeman.
They ended up the sorts of people who 

1274
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:30,324
could take naked pregnant women out into
the middle of the field and shoot them 

1275
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:34,470
in the back of the head.
That's how the book.

1276
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,540
That's the culmination of their 
training.

1277
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:37,553
It's very interesting to read about 
their training because they were 

1278
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:42,450
absolutely sickened by what they learned
to do,

1279
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,500
like physically sick and vomiting,
shaking traumatized,

1280
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,260
but they didn't stop and if you want to 
know why,

1281
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:51,150
then you can read the book and I said,
look,

1282
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,283
read this book,
but don't bloody well compartmentalize 

1283
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:59,340
it and enough of that it's like read it 
like you're one of the dam policeman,

1284
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,490
which is how you should read history,
right?

1285
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,410
You read about Nazi Germany and you 
think,

1286
01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:07,320
well I'm Oskar Schindler.
I had saved the Jews.

1287
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:08,940
It's like,
no you wouldn't.

1288
01:03:11,010 --> 01:03:11,843
You wouldn't because people didn't and 
the probability is very high that you 

1289
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:18,180
wouldn't and all you have to do is think
it through.

1290
01:03:18,181 --> 01:03:19,380
You know,
and frank.

1291
01:03:19,410 --> 01:03:20,243
It's like you're really going to put 
your family at risk to hide a group of 

1292
01:03:23,641 --> 01:03:24,474
another family in your attic for like 
multiple years while there's Nazis 

1293
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:30,060
parading the street and where if you get
exposed you will die.

1294
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,433
You're going to do that.
Are you like very unlikely and no 

1295
01:03:34,741 --> 01:03:36,750
wonder.
It's not surprising that it's unlikely,

1296
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:38,970
but you don't want to be inflating 
yourself with self,

1297
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,153
with fictional heroism,
without actually knowing the facts on 

1298
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:44,400
the ground.
So I told her to read,

1299
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,800
read it,
and to understand that

1300
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:52,790
the policemen were her and that's the 
thing to understand.

1301
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:55,663
Well,
the idea that the savior is the person 

1302
01:04:01,901 --> 01:04:05,500
who takes the world's sins upon himself 
is exactly that.

1303
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:10,920
It's exactly the same idea.
It's like the way that their stops being

1304
01:04:11,501 --> 01:04:16,501
Nazis is for you to know that the Nazis 
were you and for you to decide not to do

1305
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,930
that again,
but you have to know.

1306
01:04:19,931 --> 01:04:22,240
You see,
this is the thing that people won't do.

1307
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:23,463
You have to understand that you could 
not only do what the Nazi camp guards 

1308
01:04:26,531 --> 01:04:29,260
did an Auschwitz,
but that you could actually enjoy it

1309
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,150
and then you have to decide that you're 
not going to do that anymore.

1310
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,000
And that's not an easy thing to figure 
out.

1311
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,830
Well then that's what that chapter is 
about.

1312
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,930
So that's a rough chapter,
man.

1313
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,790
That's a rough chapter and that's the 
only,

1314
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,110
a bit of what it's about.
You know,

1315
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,460
there's a lot of,
there's a lot in there and that's.

1316
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,461
Anyways,
that's what.

1317
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:53,250
That's about.
Chapter 10.

1318
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,290
It's chapter nine.
Let's see.

1319
01:04:59,410 --> 01:04:59,890
Better.
Look,

1320
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,690
I'm getting a little tired here.
Oh yes.

1321
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:02,524
Chapter nine is I assume that the person
you are listening to who might know 

1322
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:09,250
something you don't.
This is a chapter about conversation and

1323
01:05:09,251 --> 01:05:10,084
about the different forms.
Conversation takes and so chapter about 

1324
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:13,774
humility and it's a chapter book.
Listening and humility is it took me a 

1325
01:05:18,401 --> 01:05:19,234
long time to understand why there's 
religious injunctions supporting 

1326
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:23,314
humility and understand what the word 
really meant and that sort of technical 

1327
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:27,154
sense and it means something like this.
It means what you don't know is more 

1328
01:05:29,501 --> 01:05:30,334
important than what you know and that's 
a lovely thing to then then what you 

1329
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:36,310
don't know can start to be your friend 
who see.

1330
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,323
People are very defensive about what 
they know and for the reasons we've 

1331
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:40,384
already discussed,
but the thing is you don't know enough 

1332
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:44,643
and you can tell you don't know enough 
because your life is not what it could 

1333
01:05:47,291 --> 01:05:49,900
be and neither is the life of the people
around you.

1334
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:50,943
You just don't know enough,
and so what that means is that every 

1335
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:57,910
time you encounter some evidence that 
you're ignorant,

1336
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,983
someone points it out.
You should be happy about that because 

1337
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:01,060
you think,
oh,

1338
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,450
you just told me how I'm wrong.
It's like great,

1339
01:06:04,510 --> 01:06:05,343
like maybe I had to sift through a lot 
of nonsense to get through the real 

1340
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:08,824
message that you're telling me,
but if you could actually tell me some 

1341
01:06:11,081 --> 01:06:14,590
way that I'm wrong and then maybe give 
me a hint about how to not be wrong like

1342
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:15,424
that,
well then I wouldn't have to be wrong 

1343
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,014
like that anymore.
That that would be a good thing and and 

1344
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,410
you can,
you can.

1345
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:24,790
You can embark on that adventure by 
listening to people and if you listen to

1346
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,020
people,
they will tell you.

1347
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:27,543
They'll tell you amazing things if you 
listen to them and many of those things 

1348
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,933
are little tools that you can put in 
your toolkit like Batman and then you 

1349
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:36,880
can go out into the world and use those 
tools and you don't have to fall blindly

1350
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,710
into a pit quite as often.

1351
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,543
And so the humility element as well.
Do you want to be right or do you want 

1352
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:47,110
to be learning and it's deeper than 
that.

1353
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:47,944
It's do you want to be that the 
tyrannical king who's already got 

1354
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:51,664
everything figured out or do you want to
be the continually transforming hero or 

1355
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,344
fuel for that matter?
Who's getting better all the time and 

1356
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:04,321
that's actually a choice.
It's a deep choice and it's better to be

1357
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,783
the self transforming fool who's humble 
enough to make friends with what he or 

1358
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:10,564
she doesn't know and to listen when 
people talk and listening is a 

1359
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,624
transformative exercise,
like if if you listen to the people in 

1360
01:07:17,231 --> 01:07:18,190
your life,
for example,

1361
01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:19,024
if you actually listen to them,
they'll tell you what's wrong with them 

1362
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,084
and how to fix it and what they want.
They can't even help it if you start 

1363
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:28,920
listening because people are so shocked 
if you actually listen to them that they

1364
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,840
tell you all those sorts of things that 
they might not have even intended to,

1365
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:34,300
things they don't even know,
and then you can.

1366
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,860
You can work with that and so and the 
other thing that's so interesting,

1367
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:41,230
you know now and then you have a 
meaningful conversation,

1368
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:42,064
right?
You have a good conversation with 

1369
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:43,960
somebody.
You walk when you think,

1370
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:44,794
Geez,
you know,

1371
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:45,693
we really connected and I know more than
I did when I came away from that 

1372
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,530
conversation and during the 
conversation,

1373
01:07:50,531 --> 01:07:53,450
you're really engrossed in it and that,
that,

1374
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,323
that feeling of being engrossed is a 
feeling of meaning and the feeling of 

1375
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:01,090
meaning is engendered because you're 
having a transformative conversation.

1376
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,520
Your brain produces that feeling of 
meaning for it says,

1377
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:04,354
Oh yeah,
that is exactly where you should be 

1378
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:06,550
right here.
Now it's,

1379
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:11,680
it's the right place and time for you 
and that's a great place to occupy,

1380
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:12,514
and so a good conversation where people 
are listening has exactly that nature 

1381
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:19,280
and the reason it has that nature is 
because it is in fact transformative.

1382
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:22,070
It's one of the truisms of clinical 
psychology,

1383
01:08:22,071 --> 01:08:22,904
like if you're a clinical psychologist,
a huge part of what you do is just 

1384
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:29,240
listen to people.
It's like they come in,

1385
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,103
they're unhappy,
and they'd rather not be something like 

1386
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,080
that.
You say,

1387
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:33,914
well,
why do you think you might be unhappy 

1388
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,910
and they don't know.
They have some ideas,

1389
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:38,763
but they may have to ramble around for 
like a year before they figure out why 

1390
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:42,344
they're unhappy.
They get rid of a bunch of reasons why 

1391
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:46,880
they thought they were unhappy that are 
untrue,

1392
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:47,714
and then you kind of get to the heart of
the problem and then you might ask them 

1393
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:53,960
all if you could have what you wanted so
that your life would be okay,

1394
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,453
what would that look like?
Then they have to ramble around a bunch 

1395
01:08:57,501 --> 01:08:59,090
about that because they don't really 
know,

1396
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,133
but the listening will straighten them 
out because people think by talking and 

1397
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:05,144
in order to think,
you have to have someone to listen 

1398
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:08,060
because it's very hard to think.

1399
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:09,193
Hardly anyone can think and even the 
people who can think can only think 

1400
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:12,854
about a limited number of things,
but almost everybody can talk and you 

1401
01:09:15,861 --> 01:09:16,694
can listen to yourself talk and if 
someone listens to you then well then 

1402
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,310
you also have a foil for your thoughts.
Right?

1403
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:23,144
Because you can watch the person when 
you're talking and see if you're boring 

1404
01:09:25,221 --> 01:09:28,550
or see if you're amusing or if you're 
engrossing all of those things.

1405
01:09:28,551 --> 01:09:31,850
And so listening.
That's a very good thing.

1406
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,780
I outline a Carl Rogers dictum.
He was a famous clinical psychologist.

1407
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,200
This is another great little tip.
Rogers said,

1408
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,120
here's a trick to tell if you're 
listening.

1409
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,590
So let's say someone lays out their 
perspective for you and then what you do

1410
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:46,424
is say,
look,

1411
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,293
here's what I think you said.
I think you said this and this and this 

1412
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:51,320
and this,
and then this.

1413
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:54,290
Is that right?
Have I got what you're saying?

1414
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,150
Right.
And maybe the person says,

1415
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:57,043
God,
you haven't been listening at all and 

1416
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,440
you know,
then they have to straighten you out.

1417
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:01,800
Or maybe they say,
yeah,

1418
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:02,643
yeah,
you got it.

1419
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:03,943
And then the nice thing about that is 
that you summarize their argument for 

1420
01:10:07,461 --> 01:10:09,140
them,
which can be very helpful and for you,

1421
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:13,490
but also you don't get to make the 
person into a straw man.

1422
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,170
So like if you're arguing with your 
wife,

1423
01:10:15,171 --> 01:10:16,190
let's say,
or your husband,

1424
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:21,230
big parties going to want to win.
That's stupid because if you win,

1425
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:25,580
you get to be top lobster,
but they get to be bottom lobster and if

1426
01:10:25,581 --> 01:10:28,430
you want to live with bottom lobster 
then more power to you,

1427
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:30,210
but I wouldn't recommend it.
Right?

1428
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:31,880
Because you don't want that.
You want to.

1429
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:34,280
You want to defeat your wife in an 
argument.

1430
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:35,503
Oh well great.
Like if she was going to disappear 

1431
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:38,300
tomorrow,
no problem.

1432
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:41,600
But like you're going to like live with 
defeated,

1433
01:10:41,601 --> 01:10:44,570
miserable her for the next week.
That's no good.

1434
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,400
So you listen and you think,
okay,

1435
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:47,234
well here's,
here's what what I think you said and 

1436
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,664
maybe even make it a little stronger and
more elaborated than was the case with 

1437
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:56,330
the original audience so that you get 
the damn argument right.

1438
01:10:56,540 --> 01:10:59,570
And because you don't want to.
When you want to fix the problem,

1439
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,673
that's the winning.
And so the summary with listening so 

1440
01:11:03,651 --> 01:11:06,050
useful for that because the person can 
say,

1441
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:08,120
well yeah,
that's what I meant.

1442
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:08,670
It's like,
then,

1443
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:10,730
well then you have to grapple with that.
And Roger said,

1444
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:11,564
well,
people will usually won't because you 

1445
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:13,890
know,
if you live with someone

1446
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,860
and they tell you the truth about the 
situation,

1447
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:20,640
it usually means that there's something 
really stupid that you're doing,

1448
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,710
you want them to,
but there's something stupid that you're

1449
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:23,544
doing that you know you're doing,
that you actually have to stop and you 

1450
01:11:26,671 --> 01:11:30,390
know that's difficult and unlikely,
but well if you don't stop,

1451
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,224
then you get to have the same damn 
problem everyday or every week for the 

1452
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:34,554
rest of your life.
So it's probably better to undergo the 

1453
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:39,120
misery of stopping it.
Then the misery of continuing it.

1454
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:41,580
But that's the injunction to listen.

1455
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,033
Rule 11 is don't bother children when 
they're skateboarding and that's a 

1456
01:11:49,841 --> 01:11:54,730
meditation on the difference between 
weakness and goodness.

1457
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,253
You see one of the things that's 
happened in our society and especially 

1458
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:01,810
with regards to our attitude towards 
men,

1459
01:12:01,811 --> 01:12:05,020
but also our attitude towards the 
masculinity and women.

1460
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:06,003
So it's just as toxic for women is that 
we seem to have concluded that strong 

1461
01:12:09,611 --> 01:12:10,444
men are dangerous.
And that's partly because we think 

1462
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,430
Western culture is a tyrannical 
patriarchy.

1463
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:16,264
And the only reason you get to the top 
is because you misused power and so all 

1464
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:19,863
the men who are at the top of the heart,
all misusing their power and their all 

1465
01:12:23,621 --> 01:12:24,454
tyrannical and all the guys who have the
ame an ambition to achieve that or just 

1466
01:12:28,661 --> 01:12:29,494
tyrants in training and that's sort of 
the basic attitude that we have towards 

1467
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:34,900
our own culture and towards young men 
now.

1468
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,063
And that's just.
There's everything about that is 

1469
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:44,791
pathological and inexcusable and 
shameful in first the claim that western

1470
01:12:45,521 --> 01:12:46,354
culture.

1471
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:51,360
Thank you.

1472
01:12:56,790 --> 01:13:01,480
The idea that western culture is 
primarily a patriarchal tyranny is like,

1473
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:05,221
well,
first of all,

1474
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:07,740
it's,
it's historically ignorant beyond belief

1475
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:12,510
because what are you compared to what 
exactly how many civilized countries are

1476
01:13:12,511 --> 01:13:15,200
there in the world?
Know three dozen.

1477
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:17,940
The rest of them are run by brutal 
thugs.

1478
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,360
Right?
And it isn't just thugs at the top,

1479
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:22,194
man,
because that isn't how it works in any 

1480
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,343
country that's corrupt.
The corruption is spread through the 

1481
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:30,030
entire country.
So we're not like that.

1482
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:34,530
And that's that mean western culture is 
fundamentally honest.

1483
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:38,220
And I can give an example of that 
because people don't like that idea.

1484
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,820
Bay proved that because here,
here we did.

1485
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,683
It did.
It was a very interesting thing because 

1486
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:46,830
when Ebay first popped up,
like the cynic would say,

1487
01:13:46,831 --> 01:13:49,770
Ebay is not going to work because I 
don't know you.

1488
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,390
You live in the other side of the 
country,

1489
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:55,560
you're going to send me junk and I'm 
going to send you a check that bounces.

1490
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,480
And that'll be the end of Ebay.
Right?

1491
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,540
Right.
That's what a cynic would say.

1492
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,990
And then what happened was that brokers 
popped up and they said,

1493
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:06,390
well look,
we'll guarantee the exchange rates for a

1494
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:09,030
fee 10 percent,
we'll make sure that you don't send junk

1495
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:10,560
and we'll make sure your check doesn't 
bounce.

1496
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:14,710
And what happened was the brokers 
couldn't find enough business.

1497
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:18,490
And the reason for that was all the 
transactions were honest.

1498
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,700
All of them,
you know,

1499
01:14:20,701 --> 01:14:21,534
it's like 19.
If you are on Ebay and you have a 

1500
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:23,554
reputation of less than 99 percent,
there's actually something wrong with 

1501
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:26,764
you.
You know?

1502
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,390
Okay,
Ninety eight percent.

1503
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:30,460
But really it's that,
it's that tight.

1504
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,533
And so the default position was you're 
offering this all by it will make the 

1505
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:39,340
exchange fairly,
and what happened was a bunch of capital

1506
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,260
that was frozen,
technically speaking,

1507
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:42,094
junk that people had that other people 
could need God freed up and he'd be 

1508
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:45,693
freed up a tremendous amount of money 
for people and it was all a consequence 

1509
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,230
of default,
honesty.

1510
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:51,423
And we also know that one of the best 
predictors of success in Western world 

1511
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:57,880
is conscientiousness and conscientious 
people are honest and have integrity and

1512
01:14:57,881 --> 01:14:59,860
are due to full and do what they say 
they'll do.

1513
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:02,290
And that's a really good predictor of 
longterm life success,

1514
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,990
especially as a manager and 
administrator or something like that.

1515
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:06,303
So

1516
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:09,373
well.
So chapter 11 is a discussion about the 

1517
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:14,150
assault on the,
on the positive masculine.

1518
01:15:14,151 --> 01:15:14,984
And I read it partly as a continuation 
of what Nietzsche announced back in the 

1519
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:20,890
late 18 hundreds as the death of God.
Right?

1520
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:21,733
Because in western culture,
God was a masculine figure and the idea 

1521
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:27,560
that the divine masculine had been 
decimated,

1522
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:28,394
which was basically niches.
Pronouncement has filtered all the way 

1523
01:15:30,171 --> 01:15:31,004
down to masculinity itself.
And I think that's an absolutely 

1524
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,620
appalling outcome.
It's,

1525
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:37,663
it's,
it's something that could only be 

1526
01:15:38,871 --> 01:15:41,810
desired by someone who is a true enemy 
of humanity.

1527
01:15:41,811 --> 01:15:45,740
And so partly chapter 11 is a call to 
encouragement.

1528
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,663
It's like you want,
and I've been telling young men in 

1529
01:15:48,771 --> 01:15:50,810
particular,
but young women as well,

1530
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:51,703
so they don't seem to be quite as in 
need of the message to adopt 

1531
01:15:54,981 --> 01:15:59,060
responsibility for their life,
to tell the truth and to understand that

1532
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,120
their failure to participate fully in 
being leaves a hole that's precisely the

1533
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:08,720
size of their soul in the cultural 
landscape.

1534
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,093
It's no joke.
We need all the light we can possibly 

1535
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:17,050
bring to bear on the situation.
And while,

1536
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:17,893
and I firmly believe that,
and I believe that for all sorts of 

1537
01:16:19,761 --> 01:16:22,430
reasons and I think they're very deep 
reasons.

1538
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:26,240
And that's partly why I would say rules 
to life also has,

1539
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,760
it's a funny book because it has a very 
religious core,

1540
01:16:28,761 --> 01:16:32,300
but it's also very heavily grounded in 
evolutionary biology.

1541
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:33,134
So,
um,

1542
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:36,080
but that's what chapter 11 is about.
10,

1543
01:16:36,081 --> 01:16:40,280
it's about people who are the enemy of 
the human spirit.

1544
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,890
The people who restrict children's play,
for example,

1545
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:45,110
which is a particularly pathological 
thing to do,

1546
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:48,080
there's a movement now to not let 
children have best friends.

1547
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,900
It's like,
really what the hell man,

1548
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:55,220
that's so.
There are so many things wrong with that

1549
01:16:55,221 --> 01:16:58,910
idea that would take an entire nother 
lecture just to scrape the surface,

1550
01:16:58,911 --> 01:17:02,060
but mostly it's just,
well,

1551
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,243
we're not even

1552
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:04,143
start over.

1553
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:08,823
Final rule.
That's called pet a cat when you 

1554
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:13,340
encountered one on the street and it's.
It's very.

1555
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:16,100
It's the most personal chapter in the 
book.

1556
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:16,934
It's a lot about my daughter and my 
daughter was very ill when she was well 

1557
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,673
when she was a kid,
but what particularly when she was a 

1558
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:25,550
teenager,
she had a very terrible time of it.

1559
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,253
She had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 
and when she was between the ages of 14 

1560
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:31,694
and 16 at first destroyed her hip,
which had to be replaced and then it 

1561
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:34,964
destroyed the ankle on her other leg 
which had to be replaced and she walked 

1562
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:40,304
around for two years on broken legs and 
she was taking massive doses of opiates 

1563
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:45,104
and could hardly stay awake and like.
And she had this advanced auto immune 

1564
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:49,184
disease which produced all sorts of 
other symptoms that were just as bad as 

1565
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:54,440
the joint degeneration but which are 
harder to describe.

1566
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,410
And so it was just bloody brutal,
you know,

1567
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:58,244
and as a test of your faith,
there's almost nothing that's more 

1568
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:05,630
direct than a serious illness inflicted 
upon an innocent child.

1569
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:06,493
Right.
And so the chapter is a meditation on 

1570
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:12,530
that and also on,
well what to do in a situation like that

1571
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:15,740
because everyone is going to have a 
situation like that in some sense,

1572
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:16,574
you know,
because you'll be faced with illness in 

1573
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:21,220
the people that you love and in crisis.
And so it's a,

1574
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,990
it's a practical guide to coping with 
those sorts of things.

1575
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:24,824
Like in.
One of the things you do when you're 

1576
01:18:25,731 --> 01:18:29,240
overwhelmed by crisis is you shorten 
your timeframe.

1577
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,523
You know,
it's like you can't think about next 

1578
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,013
month,
maybe you can't even bloody well think 

1579
01:18:33,681 --> 01:18:35,870
about next week or maybe not even 
tomorrow.

1580
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:39,410
You know,
because now is just so overwhelming that

1581
01:18:39,411 --> 01:18:40,400
that's all there is.

1582
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,773
And that's what you do.
You cut your timeframe back until you 

1583
01:18:44,031 --> 01:18:44,864
can cope with it,
and if it's not the next week that you 

1584
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:47,874
see how to get through,
then it's the next day and if it's not 

1585
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,474
the next day,
then it's the next hour and if it's not 

1586
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,920
the next hour,
then it's the next minute.

1587
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:57,230
And you know,
people are very,

1588
01:18:57,231 --> 01:18:58,400
very,
very,

1589
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,293
very tough.
And it turns out that if you face 

1590
01:19:01,791 --> 01:19:02,624
things,
it turns out that if you face things 

1591
01:19:06,471 --> 01:19:09,200
that you can put up with a lot more than
you think you can put up within,

1592
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:11,630
you can do it without becoming 
corrupted.

1593
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:17,080
And she did recover quite,
quite fully and much as a consequence of

1594
01:19:17,241 --> 01:19:18,074
our own machinations because she figured
out what was wrong with her and then 

1595
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:21,164
took the necessary steps to fix it,
which is nothing short of a bloody 

1596
01:19:23,361 --> 01:19:26,150
miracle as far as I'm concerned.
And,

1597
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:27,460
uh,
anyways,

1598
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,860
part of the,
the,

1599
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:30,003
the cat bit is I actually started by 
talking about our dog who actually died 

1600
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,900
about a year ago,
but he's still alive in the book.

1601
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:37,660
Um,
I,

1602
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:38,503
you know,
I let people know because dog lovers 

1603
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:40,934
love dogs and if you love cats than they
think you don't like dogs and then they 

1604
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:44,423
don't like you.
So I also pointed out at the beginning 

1605
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:47,510
of the chapter that,
you know,

1606
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:49,820
if you want a pet,
a dog on the street,

1607
01:19:49,821 --> 01:19:50,654
that's okay too.
You don't have to get up in arms about 

1608
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,084
it,
but,

1609
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:54,860
but the idea is that,
you know,

1610
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:57,200
you have to be alert when you're 
suffering.

1611
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,990
You have to be alert to the beauty in 
life.

1612
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:01,093
The unexpected beauty in life.
And I've kind of what I was trying to 

1613
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:04,304
get across with the idea of the cap.
There's this cat that lives across the 

1614
01:20:06,351 --> 01:20:07,590
street from us,
ginger,

1615
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:08,070
Ginger's,

1616
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,740
assignees,
Captain Cat's really aren't domesticated

1617
01:20:10,741 --> 01:20:12,930
a technically speaking.
They're still wild animals,

1618
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:16,200
but they kind of like people.
God only knows why,

1619
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:17,250
but they do,
you know.

1620
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:18,263
And so ginger will come wandering over 
and our dog looks at her but their 

1621
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,880
friends and she rolls over on his back 
and seek use to noser a bit and then she

1622
01:20:26,771 --> 01:20:27,604
kind of Mosey over and let you pet her.
If she was feeling like at that day and 

1623
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,050
you know you have to look for those 
little bit of stuff,

1624
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:38,700
little bit of sparkling crystal in the 
darkness when things are bad,

1625
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:39,534
you have to look and see where things 
are still beautiful and where there's 

1626
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,960
still something that's sustaining,
you know,

1627
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:45,813
you narrow your timeframe and you be 
grateful for what you have and I've can 

1628
01:20:49,621 --> 01:20:54,621
get you through some very dark times and
maybe even successfully if you're lucky,

1629
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:55,674
but even if unsuccessfully,
that maybe it's only tragic and not 

1630
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:02,100
absolute hell,
and you can do that,

1631
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:02,934
you know,
in the worst situation you can make it 

1632
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:09,470
only tragic and not held and there's a 
big gap between tragedy and hell.

1633
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:12,540
You know,
there's nothing worse at a deathbed than

1634
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,070
to see the people.
They're fighting.

1635
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,073
The death is bad enough,
but you can take that as terrible as it 

1636
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,140
is and make it into something that's 
absolutely unbearable.

1637
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,273
And maybe I think,
and this is sort of what I closed the 

1638
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:25,680
book with,
is this idea,

1639
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:26,514
is that if we didn't all attempt to make
terrible things even worse than they 

1640
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,344
are,
then maybe we could tolerate the 

1641
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:33,744
terrible things that we have to put up 
with in order to exist and maybe we 

1642
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:38,700
could make the world into a better 
place,

1643
01:21:38,701 --> 01:21:39,534
you know,
and it's what we shouldn't be doing and 

1644
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:43,080
what we could be doing because we don't 
have anything better to do.

1645
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,420
And that's what the book is about.
And

1646
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,070
that's the end of 12 rules for life.

1647
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:56,470
Thank you.

1648
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,913
But we've overrun joyously and normally 
I would have a sort of cup the talk and 

1649
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:40,020
dump something so we can have a 
questions,

1650
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,880
but I really didn't think it was 
appropriate.

1651
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:43,230
Um,
this evening.

1652
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:46,320
Stoke was absolutely luminous and 
inspiring.

1653
01:22:46,321 --> 01:22:48,150
But.
So I'm going to do one question,

1654
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,283
one question only and I'm,
and I'm going to leave Jordan to 

1655
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:55,380
actually decide what's the question?
Who's going to ask?

1656
01:22:55,381 --> 01:22:57,600
So I'm going to take three from the 
audience.

1657
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,633
Um,
I'm going to read out three that Ivanka 

1658
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,660
have come from the live stream.
Um,

1659
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:05,333
one from the live stream is how'd you 
challenged the identity politics of 

1660
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:09,814
today.
The second is a more personal one is 

1661
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:13,444
where do you fall short yourself in 
these 12 rules and is it a constant 

1662
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:20,890
adjustment?
And now let me take three questions from

1663
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:21,724
the audience and I'll leave Jordan to 
then decide which is the last question 

1664
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:31,321
that he wants to ask.
So first hand there,

1665
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:34,803
first of all,
it's an honor to be as your lecturer 

1666
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:40,340
and,
and the question is I wanted to ask like

1667
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:41,860
for example,
some people like,

1668
01:23:41,861 --> 01:23:44,440
for example,
Stefan Molyneux who interviewed you,

1669
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,180
a puts,
I think,

1670
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:47,740
tremendous,
um,

1671
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,640
attention to admitting faults of 
parents,

1672
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:54,490
uh,
and admitting the harm that was done,

1673
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:55,383
uh,
when getting better and working through 

1674
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:00,970
adversive childhood experience.
And I wanted to ask you about,

1675
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:02,410
about that and what you think about 
that.

1676
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:06,400
And then if you take the young lady just
here,

1677
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:12,160
sorry,
my question is about chapter nine,

1678
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:12,994
about being humble and listening to what
your enemies are saying and criticizing 

1679
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:18,200
you.
I'm,

1680
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:23,170
I'm a kind of person who kind of speak,
speak my thoughts.

1681
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:24,004
So I,
I speak them to my friends and see how 

1682
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:29,410
they bounced them.
Um,

1683
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:31,793
so,
um,

1684
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:37,380
I noticed that there's always a group of
my friends who always criticize what I'm

1685
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:42,370
saying and not even try to understand 
what I'm,

1686
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,670
where I'm coming from.
And um,

1687
01:24:45,230 --> 01:24:46,063
I've,
I've always wondered how to deal with 

1688
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:48,050
that.
I mean,

1689
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:53,050
I want to listen to what they're saying,
but they're not understanding what I'm,

1690
01:24:53,410 --> 01:24:55,630
they're not trying to listen to what I'm
saying.

1691
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:57,980
So what would you do in that situation 
that

1692
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,013
very briefly,
there's a line in the new testament 

1693
01:25:01,761 --> 01:25:05,890
that's relevant to that.
Do not cast pearls before swine.

1694
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:10,210
And what that means is that if people 
are not listening to you,

1695
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,900
stop talking to them.
And that's really,

1696
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,040
that is the best piece of advice that I 
can give you.

1697
01:25:16,041 --> 01:25:19,630
And what happens is,
is that if you stopped talking to people

1698
01:25:19,631 --> 01:25:22,420
who aren't listening to you and start 
watching them,

1699
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:24,940
instead,
they will tell you what they're up to.

1700
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,580
But,
so if you have things to say,

1701
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:29,680
you say them,
but you find people that will listen.

1702
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,933
Talk to them,
the ones who aren't listening pullback 

1703
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:36,190
because you're a Jew,
you're devaluing what you have to say by

1704
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,024
offering it to an audience that does 
nothing but rejected and that's a good 

1705
01:25:40,270 --> 01:25:43,420
guideline to life in general.
So pull back.

1706
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:44,750
Yeah,

1707
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:49,750
and our last question is gentlemen over 
there with the blue.

1708
01:25:51,930 --> 01:25:52,763
Thank you.
Just a broad smile to my face when you 

1709
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:59,350
mentioned the work of John Taylor Gatto 
and I just wanted to know what you think

1710
01:25:59,351 --> 01:26:03,620
their relationship is between the 
classic trivium and the Holy Trinity and

1711
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:05,360
if there is,
how has that changed over time?

1712
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:11,080
I'm going to leave you to answer one 
question only and then

1713
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,900
you're going to be back on stage.
Dedicated?

1714
01:26:16,050 --> 01:26:17,010
Yes.
Yes.

1715
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,780
Okay.
Okay.

1716
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:21,950
I think I'm going to answer where do you
fall short in these 12 rules?

1717
01:26:21,951 --> 01:26:24,860
Is it a constant adjustment?
You know,

1718
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:27,873
I wrote these rules.
What you mean why did I write these 

1719
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:31,820
rules?
Well,

1720
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,780
you know,
and especially when I said,

1721
01:26:35,781 --> 01:26:36,614
well,
you should try to improve yourself 

1722
01:26:37,191 --> 01:26:38,024
instead of trying to set the world 
straight or instead of worrying about 

1723
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:41,810
what other people are doing wrong,
you might say,

1724
01:26:41,811 --> 01:26:43,280
well that's a hell of a thing for 
someone to say,

1725
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,200
you just wrote a book called 12 rules 
for life.

1726
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,370
It's like,
you know,

1727
01:26:46,371 --> 01:26:49,970
but the thing is is that I wasn't just 
writing that.

1728
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:55,510
I was reading that for me as much as for
anyone else and I mean that's,

1729
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,190
I really mean that sincerely.
You know,

1730
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:58,053
I had an opportunity to spend somewhere 
around five years meditating on how you 

1731
01:27:02,961 --> 01:27:05,980
should conduct yourself so that your 
life is what it could be.

1732
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:09,170
Like I'm in the group of people that I'm
advising you.

1733
01:27:09,171 --> 01:27:10,004
You know what I mean?
It's like all of these things are very 

1734
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:15,110
difficult to stand up straight to 
remember that and to treat yourself like

1735
01:27:15,111 --> 01:27:19,430
you're someone worthwhile and to make 
friends with people who are good for you

1736
01:27:19,431 --> 01:27:20,220
and,
and,

1737
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:22,490
and to tell the truth or at least not to
lie.

1738
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:23,870
I mean,
these are all ideals,

1739
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,060
right?
At especially taken as a whole.

1740
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:28,580
They constitute a kind of ideal and you 
never,

1741
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:31,070
you never,
you never attained the ideal,

1742
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,533
the eye,
and not only that he receives as you 

1743
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:34,550
approach it,
right,

1744
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:36,590
because you straighten yourself out and 
you think,

1745
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:37,700
well,
I've got it now and you think,

1746
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,200
wait a minute,
there's more to go.

1747
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:41,870
There's still more to go,
and then you get that much farther along

1748
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:42,441
the line.
You think,

1749
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:43,760
cool,
yeah,

1750
01:27:43,761 --> 01:27:45,500
I thought this was the end of the road.
It's like,

1751
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,334
no,
there's plenty of imperfections left to 

1752
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:52,370
iron out,
and so it is a constant adjustment and.

1753
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:56,660
But there's something about that that's 
also positive because you might say that

1754
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,560
it's not so much that there isn't such a
thing as a good person.

1755
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,053
It's that our idea of what constitutes 
good isn't right because a good person 

1756
01:28:05,961 --> 01:28:10,961
is someone who's trying to get better 
and no matter how good you are,

1757
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:15,620
there's better that you can get,
but the real goodness is in the attempt,

1758
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:16,810
right?
It's in the,

1759
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:19,760
it's in the process to use somewhat of a
cliche,

1760
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:20,923
you know,
there's this and I'll close with this 

1761
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:24,650
and it's a good way to close.
You know,

1762
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:26,540
and this is the psychological 
observation,

1763
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,590
the the central figure of Western 
culture is Christ,

1764
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,053
and we can look at that psychologically 
because Christ is the dying and 

1765
01:28:34,071 --> 01:28:37,460
resurrected hero,
and what does that mean psychologically?

1766
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:39,410
While it means that

1767
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:47,090
you learned things painfully,
and when you learn something painfully a

1768
01:28:49,051 --> 01:28:51,840
part of you has to die.
That's the pain.

1769
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:54,660
You know when a dream is shattered,
for example,

1770
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:57,480
a huge part of you that that constituted
that dream,

1771
01:28:57,481 --> 01:29:00,120
maybe even the biological substrate of 
that June has to be

1772
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,933
stripped away and burned,
and so life is a constant process of 

1773
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,953
death and rebirth and to participate in 
that fully is to allow yourself to be 

1774
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:20,610
redeemed by it.
And so the good is that process of death

1775
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:21,444
and rebirth voluntarily undertaken.
It's like you're not as good as you 

1776
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:27,060
could be,
so you let that part of you die.

1777
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:29,340
And if someone comes along and says,
you know,

1778
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:32,370
there's some deadwood here,
man,

1779
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,020
it needs to be burned off.
You think,

1780
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:35,610
well,
that stuff's still a bit alive.

1781
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:37,410
When that Burns,
it's going to hurt.

1782
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:38,311
It's like,
yeah,

1783
01:29:38,311 --> 01:29:39,900
well,
no kidding,

1784
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,530
but maybe the thing that emerges in its 
place is something better,

1785
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,230
and I think this is the secret of human 
beings.

1786
01:29:46,231 --> 01:29:47,550
This is what we're like,
you know,

1787
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:48,393
unlike any other creature is that we can
let our old cells die and let our new 

1788
01:29:52,741 --> 01:29:56,310
selves be born and that's what we should
do.

1789
01:29:56,400 --> 01:30:01,400
And so where do I fall short in these 12
rules?

1790
01:30:02,251 --> 01:30:04,560
Well,
endlessly because.

1791
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05,933
Well,
here's a way of thinking about it until 

1792
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:08,424
the entire world is redeemed.
We all fall short and that's probably a 

1793
01:30:12,961 --> 01:30:16,320
good
place to stop.

1794
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,770
Thanks.
