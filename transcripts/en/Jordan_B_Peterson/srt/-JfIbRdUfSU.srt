1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
It's graduation is highly significant 
for young people because it is a death 

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:06,030
and a renewal at the same time.
I mean,

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,173
it's a good way of learning too about 
life because you see when you graduate 

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
at simultaneously,
you have attained the pinnacle of 

5
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,500
something,
but by the same token,

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:20,730
it instantly transforms you into a 
beginner at the next stage of your life.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,080
When people say,
what do you want to be when they grow up

8
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:25,914
in our society,
they usually mean what career you're 

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
going to pick.
It's really not the way the question 

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,324
should be asked or conceptualize.
You should really think about what sort 

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,040
of character you want to have.
I would say you should surround yourself

12
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:38,874
with people who are aiming up at,
who want the best for what's best in 

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,024
you.
Unless you want people that will excuse 

14
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:49,971
your pathologies and make weight for 
your weakness and lead you down the path

15
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
of perdition,
so you're going to take care of 

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:54,630
yourself.
You need to take care of your family.

17
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,160
You're going to take care of your 
community.

18
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,350
You want to grow up and be a 
responsible,

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,640
forthright and honest person.
It's the best way through life.

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,210
There could be a lot more to you than,
you know,

21
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,000
highly probable,
and you should act as if there is,

22
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,980
and then you should go out there and try
to do,

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,370
if not great things,
at least honest,

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,440
productive,
meaningful,

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,600
engaged,
and positive things.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,350
That's what you should be aiming.
There's nothing in that except good.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,113
Okay.
