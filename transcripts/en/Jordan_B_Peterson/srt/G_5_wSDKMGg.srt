1
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,220
Looks
like

2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,280
everybody's here.
For those of you who were,

3
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,860
so does everybody have a copy of this?
I rewrote.

4
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,220
I'd been rewriting the introduction to 
this bearing script.

5
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,900
I did.
I do do.

6
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,533
I mentioned to you before that it
terms of techniques for writing an 

7
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,820
essay,
the essay that you should put aside what

8
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:35,280
you wrote.
I do that all the time.

9
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,750
So what you have here,
let's see,

10
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,300
in terms of payment
on the first page,

11
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,380
1616 and a half,
that stuff you've already read,

12
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,214
it's hopefully written more clearly but 
from 17 and a half to the end of 18 is 

13
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,430
actually an outline of the argument in 
the whole book.

14
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,703
Hopefully
that will provide the transition to the 

15
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:09,300
second part of the course which starts 
today.

16
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,723
I tried to start the last week,
but I had a hard time because I wasn't 

17
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:15,474
in the right sort of mood to discuss the
sort of material and also because I've 

18
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:22,530
been working on the first half of this 
manuscript for about a year.

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,350
I spent the previous year working on the
second half,

20
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,184
but a year ago was a long time.
Can I forgotten a lot of what I was 

21
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,563
trying to say and it was really,
it took more effort than I was willing 

22
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,164
to engage him last week and the week 
before to make sense of the chapter or 

23
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,350
contamination of the experience with 
death.

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,273
I mean what I'm trying to do in that 
chapter is to describe the difference 

25
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,114
between consciousness and self 
consciousness and also to portray how 

26
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:58,800
mythology represents the consequences of
the emergence of self consciousness.

27
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,250
And I want to do that for a particular

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,083
reason.
It's not because I'm really necessarily 

29
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:07,111
all that interested in that as a topic 
is sort of a precursor to discussing why

30
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,520
it is that we differ in our emotional 
response was from animals.

31
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:12,363
Why our emotional response to that I 
think are are more heightened and also 

32
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,990
maybe why do we were actually more 
conscious.

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,880
So it's a lot of background work to 
describe that.

34
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,603
Trying to figure out how self 
consciousness differs from 

35
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:29,050
consciousness.
That's difficult.

36
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,640
That's a difficult procedure in and of 
itself,

37
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,690
let alone when it's just the basis of 
another argument.

38
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,040
So let's go over the outline of the 
manuscript and hopefully that help clear

39
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:44,524
up in your minds.
Some of the things that I've been 

40
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,840
discussing.
How can me help clear them up your mind,

41
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,070
mind?
Okay,

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,900
so this is the basic argument.
We'll really can be construed as a forum

43
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,750
for action as well as a place for 
things.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,380
I want you to discuss that and be ready.
I would say,

45
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,243
well scientific methodology constitutes 
the formal process whereby we described 

46
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:10,060
the world as a place of things 
narrative.

47
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,500
On the other hand,
myth,

48
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,980
literature and drama portrays the world 
as a forum for action.

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,290
The two forms of description had been 
unnecessarily set it odd because we have

50
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,260
not yet for the clear picture of their 
respective domains.

51
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,203
The domain of the former that is the 
world as a place of things is what is 

52
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,910
from the perspective of interest,
subjective perception,

53
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,003
so we can get a description of the 
objective status of things by comparing 

54
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,944
a perceptions,
the domain of the ladder as the domain 

55
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:46,880
of pathology describing the world as a 
forum for action

56
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,253
is what he is and what should be from 
the perspective of emotion than the 

57
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:53,784
action.
You can see why those two things would 

58
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:56,914
have been confused because both in a 
sense are an attempt to describe what 

59
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,683
is,
although myth also with to describe one 

60
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,790
should be and you can describe what is 
in terms of its implications for you and

61
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,550
behavior,
which is a perfectly valid approach.

62
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,563
Or You could describe what he is from 
the perspective of objective 

63
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:14,374
description,
which is also a valid approach because 

64
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,200
in both cases you're engaged in a 
process that looks similar.

65
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,543
It's easy to confuse one form of 
description and its purposes with the 

66
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,571
other,
and I would say,

67
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:26,404
well,
that's being basically that confusion 

68
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:29,254
has led to the dissociation of 
scientific knowledge from from moral 

69
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:34,984
knowledge or for mythological going one 
gen chem two they're unnecessary 

70
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,973
opposition.

71
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,093
Okay.

72
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,033
I mean,
look,

73
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,873
either they're both valid and we don't 
understand how that can be or one's 

74
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:51,740
valid than the other isn't and it looks 
like all the evidence suggests that it's

75
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:52,574
scientific if one's valid than the other
is all the evidence suggests that the 

76
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,204
scientific knowledge it's smell seems a 
bit unreasonable given that all human 

77
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,323
conscious up to the European culture 
essentially 500 years ago lived 

78
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,710
according to the mythological 
presuppositions.

79
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,463
We get pure science sciences.
We also have a lot of my clinical 

80
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,994
psychology and in any,
in any in designs we talk about basic 

81
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:20,350
research,
but also applications.

82
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:23,780
A sure.
Talking about that second domain.

83
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,380
I would say absolutely science is 
meaningless if it doesn't imply what you

84
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,214
should do,
but the application of science 

85
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:29,954
necessarily implies that you should.
But I would say as soon as you're 

86
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:35,030
applying science to what should be,
it's not science anymore.

87
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,283
I guess since it's side it's it's 
mythology that's operating under the 

88
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,974
guise of science and this all this 
explains for me at least why for 

89
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,500
example,
there are,

90
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,393
I teach personality course though.
There's endless numbers of competing 

91
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,784
personalities.
There's many of them predicated on 

92
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,124
completely different presuppositions.
They all provide a coherent story more 

93
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,760
or less fairly coherent.
As a matter of fact,

94
00:06:58,761 --> 00:06:59,594
even though they don't agree and the 
truth of the matter appears to be that 

95
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,553
if you're a therapist and you pick any 
of those stories and you apply it 

96
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,443
according to the rules of that story,
it works about as well as any other 

97
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:12,194
store.
I mean people don't like to admit that 

98
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:16,460
if their adherence of one theory or 
another and behaviorism seems to be good

99
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:20,240
for per some specify things better than 
perhaps some other doctors,

100
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:24,740
but I think you can understand that not 
from a scientific perspective.

101
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:28,910
So watch us from the perspective of 
mythology which is to say that if you've

102
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:32,840
come to therapy and you have no story 
whatsoever,

103
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,393
the provision of a coherent story for 
you is already an improvement over your 

104
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,164
current status even though you might not
be being exposed to the basketball 

105
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:44,750
possible story so to speak.
But I'd also say that

106
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,113
this is part of the reason why there's 
such a problem in constructing 

107
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,564
psychiatric classifications from liberal
illness cause they're not scientific at 

108
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:57,080
the bottom of them is some conception 
implicit or explicit.

109
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:02,081
It's implicit in the DSM by design about
what constitutes mental health.

110
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,613
Because you have to define your own is 
in contrast to hell and as soon as you 

111
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:09,110
start talking about health,
whether it's mental or otherwise,

112
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,180
you're not in the objective domain 
anymore.

113
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,820
You have to make judgments about what 
Pumpkin to the ideals.

114
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,103
And I think this is part of the problem 
that psychiatric diagnosis has has not 

115
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:20,294
dealt with explorer.
It's part of the problem with 

116
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,520
psychiatric diagnosis in general and has
a problem.

117
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:27,410
It's generally not dealt with 
explicitly,

118
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,233
so if it's an applied science,
it's pulling in some mythological 

119
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,973
presuppositions.
I don't think there's any way around 

120
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,470
that.
I think we just have to,

121
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,540
we have to recognize that that's the 
case.

122
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,903
Okay,
so you have the world as a place of 

123
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:47,870
things in the world is a forum for 
action

124
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,510
as a forum for action.
It appears to be composed of two,

125
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,100
the three constituent elements that 
we've discussed in detail,

126
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,783
unexplored territory,
explored territory and the process that 

127
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:05,600
mediates between the two.
If you analyze the characteristics,

128
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:10,320
emotional responses of the human brain,
that analysis reveals that the brain has

129
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:15,030
adapted itself to the world as a forum 
for action as well as place of things.

130
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,733
This implies to me the fact that this 
biological adaptation implies that the 

131
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:21,950
environment is in reality a form for 
actions.

132
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,870
We'll also place for things,
so that implies mean if you,

133
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,030
if you buy the argument that adaptation 
does take place to the environment.

134
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,900
If we've adapted to the environment as a
forum for action,

135
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:34,734
then it applies.
The descriptions of the world as a form 

136
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,630
for action are in fact descriptions of 
something that's real.

137
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,593
I think that's a strange idea,
but it still strikes me as as if you 

138
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:52,350
accept that preset positions,
then that's a necessary conclusion.

139
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,143
Each of the three constituent elements 
of the world as a four for action has a 

140
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:57,414
characteristic nature or personality and
it has garnered mythological or 

141
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,790
narrative representations.
As such,

142
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,320
these representations have the 
structural aspect of natural categories

143
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,240
and appear relatively stable across 
cultural place in time.

144
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,743
It's unexplored.
Territory is the great mother source of 

145
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,660
all determinant things.
Creative and destructive,

146
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,494
threatening and promising explored 
territory is bringing father cumulative 

147
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:27,000
ancestral wisdom simultaneously 
protective and tyrannical.

148
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,583
The process that mediates between the 
two is the individual son of the great 

149
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:35,340
father and mother,
the hero word who creates the cosmos.

150
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,333
That's a Christian viewpoint and the 
adversary who spitefully rejects that 

151
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:43,170
creation about who we will talk for the 
remainder of the course

152
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,490
group identification,
which I think might be conceptualized as

153
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:55,320
ritual limitation of the debt,
protects the undeveloped individual from

154
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,640
the terrible forces,
that rural,

155
00:10:56,641 --> 00:11:00,540
unexplored territory,
which is only to say that when you're on

156
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,020
familiar ground,
you're not anxious.

157
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,293
You know what to do and the reason you 
know what to do is because you're 

158
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,474
imitating the actions of people who at 
some point in the past figured out what 

159
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:13,860
to do and transmitted that knowledge to 
you across the generations.

160
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,993
And you also tend to act in the presence
of others who also constitute your own 

161
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:18,984
culture,
who are also beneficiaries of the same 

162
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,790
way as the men who therefore act 
predictably kind of these,

163
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,624
the fact of the predictability,
in fact that protects you from 

164
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,110
unpredictability.
By definition,

165
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:36,000
absolute identification with the group,
however interferes with the process that

166
00:11:36,001 --> 00:11:40,200
maintains and updates the group and 
increases the likelihood that protective

167
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,034
strategies designed to maintain the 
integrity of the group with necessary 

168
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,080
strategies will escalate into 
uncontrollable warfare.

169
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,693
So then the question is,
given that if you identify with your 

170
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:51,594
group too strongly,
it will actually come to your group in 

171
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:58,120
the long run plus increase the 
likelihood that you'll engage in perhaps

172
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,040
unnecessary and counter productive.

173
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:03,400
How do groups that surround him group?
So why do people do it?

174
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,140
What is it that motivates us to adopt 
absolute identification with the group?

175
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,110
We know burke proof identification has 
its problems.

176
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,310
I identified with a group and you 
identify with a different group of stage

177
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:16,144
is set for our conflict,
but we also know that you have to 

178
00:12:17,831 --> 00:12:21,700
identify with the group.
Yeah,

179
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,390
so there has to be a balance struck 
while people,

180
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,283
there are situations in which time 
balance is on your mind and people I 

181
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:28,994
talk to absolute identification with the
group and you get the construction of 

182
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,740
totalitarian or authoritarian states and
the Mo,

183
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,970
the,
the motto of a totalitarian state,

184
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:40,480
his every one should act exactly the 
same way.

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,460
So they're all,
we're all absolutely predictable.

186
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,530
That's what totalitarian means.
Act The same way.

187
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,180
You think the same way,
look the same way.

188
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,000
Believe the same things in your 
individual.

189
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,893
These absolutely constrained by your 
dogmatic identification and the 

190
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,104
advantage to that has been everyone 
becomes extraordinarily predictable 

191
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,134
because everyone is a clone.
Fundamentally question is why would 

192
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:01,120
people do that?
What's the,

193
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,910
what's the attraction of absolute 
identification?

194
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,223
Given that it's evident that such 
identification also has negative 

195
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:09,550
consequences,
why would you bother with,

196
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,473
well,
that's what we're going to try to 

197
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:15,601
discuss for the rest of the class.
What forces motivate us to subjugate our

198
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:18,970
individuality to the group?
Well then the question,

199
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,930
the question immediately rises 
essentially what are the consequences?

200
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,000
Like first of all,
what is individuality?

201
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:27,340
What does it mean?
And second of all,

202
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:29,560
what are the consequences of that 
individuality?

203
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,653
And that's what I'm trying to address in
the chapter on self consciousness and 

204
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:35,650
the contamination of experience with 
death.

205
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,053
Where would you put something like a 
religious order in terms of group 

206
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,890
identification and individuality?

207
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,890
Well,
I actually discussed this.

208
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,963
Emilia invited me for dinner last night 
at the faculty dinner and this is 

209
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,510
something that we discussed there.
I mean,

210
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,303
it strikes me that the purpose of a 
religious order or any discipline for 

211
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:59,521
that matter is partly that the erection 
of necessary boundaries of order,

212
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,680
I mean you have to have boundaries of 
order.

213
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,480
What those boundaries are can differ.
I mean to some degree there's,

214
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,333
there's variation across groups,
but the fact that the boundaries has to 

215
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,484
be that it's partly so that you can 
carve out a domain in which you're 

216
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,320
comfortable to act.
But it's also partly because,

217
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,900
and this is niches,
observation primarily.

218
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,000
If you don't identify with the group,
you never,

219
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,620
you never disciplined yourself,
he never subjected to any discipline.

220
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:30,454
And as a consequence you're never able 
to actually foster any sort of true 

221
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:34,564
individuality.
So I would say voluntary slavery is a 

222
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:43,261
precondition for freedom and a dogmatic 
group or a doctrine,

223
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:45,580
let's say a doctrine because that's less
rigid,

224
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,540
a doctor and is something to which you 
can adhere voluntarily.

225
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,433
And the purpose of that is that while 
and excludes all sorts of possibilities 

226
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,770
so that it's,
that's it's negative aspect in a sense.

227
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,490
But it also allows you to develop the 
skills necessary to do something.

228
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,583
And so I mean,
the example I always thinking about 

229
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,690
that's the apprenticeship or,
right,

230
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,943
so you want to be a concert pianist.
What you do first is learn how it was 

231
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:15,900
that all other concert pianists 
essentially behaved in the past.

232
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,970
Do you develop your technical skills and
that means your,

233
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,850
is that your individuality is 
essentially subjugated to it,

234
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,480
to a discipline.
Once you've got the skills,

235
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:28,481
then you can transcend the limitations 
that that that discipline placed on me.

236
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,773
So that's why I wanted everyone to read 
the abuse use and abuse of history 

237
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,960
because this is a,
this is a problem that gt dealt with for

238
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:36,794
a long period of time,
despite the fact that he was a radical 

239
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,283
antichristian.

240
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,443
One of the things you constantly pointed
out in his philosophy was that 

241
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,193
catholicism was net worth was a 
precondition to European greatness in a 

242
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,624
sense because although it was arbitrary 
and unfair and authoritarian and 

243
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:58,520
doctrinally bombed and destroyed,
all sorts of useful things,

244
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,570
it also forced people to discipline 
their other spirits in a sense.

245
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,404
But their minds at least to,
he said if you could learn to think one 

246
00:16:07,221 --> 00:16:12,221
way in a discipline manner,
then once you develop that ability,

247
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,830
then you could use the ability to think 
and all sorts of different ways.

248
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,900
But you never,
you could never do that.

249
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,273
You'd never have the freedom without 
first of all having gone through the 

250
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:28,241
disciplinary procedure,
so like the jesuits were the Franciscans

251
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,353
you would,
would you consider it a totalitarian 

252
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,983
group?
Well it would depend on the particular 

253
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:36,224
group.
I mean groups tend towards a 

254
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:42,791
totalitarian
groups tend to worst totalitarian status

255
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,900
because partly because they have to for 
a group to last for any length of time.

256
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,733
It has to protect its structure,
which means it has to exclude 

257
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,840
information that would result in the 
undermining of instruction.

258
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,810
So for a group to exist,
it has to say,

259
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,470
so to speak,
this group is the best group and if you,

260
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:04,580
and the best thing you can do is be an 
eminent member of this group.

261
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,790
So that's a perfectly reasonable moral 
statement.

262
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:10,400
It's just incomplete because at least as
far as I'm concerned,

263
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:14,690
because of the problem with that 
statement is that it eliminates the fact

264
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,420
that in order for the group to maintain 
itself,

265
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,283
at least some of the group's members 
have to transcend this limitation so 

266
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,390
that they can update the group,
but there's a tension,

267
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,673
there's a tension between the group and 
the individual that cannot be resolved 

268
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,740
or,
or I think that's a,

269
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,400
that's more or less reasonable 
statement.

270
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,890
I mean,
if you're,

271
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:38,570
if you're a great newtonian physicist at
the end of the 19th century,

272
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,003
what that might mean is that you're 
actually such a great newtonian 

273
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:45,620
physicists that you undermine the whole 
structure of Newtonian physics.

274
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,370
So there's a tension there and you'll 
see this in mythologies as well.

275
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,650
Okay?
No New Testament,

276
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,484
for example,
Christ is presented as someone who had 

277
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:59,580
mastered his culture,
his dark truck completely by the time he

278
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:02,840
was 12 that's why you could argue with 
the elders,

279
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,440
the temple.
So there's,

280
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,800
there's tremendous theirs,
theirs,

281
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,823
theirs

282
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,803
recognition in that story of the fact 
that before a doctrine can be 

283
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,560
transcended,
it has to be absolutely mastered,

284
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,610
otherwise you risk otherwise your hero 
is so to speak,

285
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,820
risks only me being surface heroism,
which is,

286
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,833
it's actually undisciplined rebellion 
and you're just using the mask and here 

287
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,780
was to hide the fact that you're on 
discipline from yourself.

288
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,170
See this,
it's an important,

289
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,004
I think this is particularly important 
for people and cultures like well like 

290
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:40,140
the north and North American culture 
because we tend to think,

291
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,483
we tend to have a notion in our minds 
that I think was fed by humanistic 

292
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:45,144
psychology.
Most pain in the 60s that groups are 

293
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:48,054
necessarily tyrannical.
And what a group does is squash your 

294
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,170
individuality.
That's true.

295
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,830
Yeah,
it does that.

296
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,100
But the other side of the coin as well 
as its squashing it,

297
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:56,934
it's also fostering it and there's no 
way that you can get one without the 

298
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,544
other.
Although some groups are more 

299
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,310
totalitarian than others.
So that's what it group does.

300
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,520
It has to do that or it will disappear 
and if it disappears,

301
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,460
well we know what the group does is it 
brings order to chaos.

302
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,170
So if your group disappears then there's
just,

303
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,110
there's nothing but chaos.
So you know,

304
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,083
classic,
ample viewpoint is that the cosmos is 

305
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:25,560
supposed to be property now it's right 
for there to be the proper meaning.

306
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,730
There has to be the right amount of 
order and the right amount of chaos and

307
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,170
I both,
both things are absolutely necessary.

308
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,813
Okay.

309
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,183
So I said absolute identification with 
the group is motivated by the negative 

310
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:43,620
consequences of the development of self 
consciousness.

311
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,500
So I guess you see,
all right,

312
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,553
I'm interested in,
I was interested in trying to answer a 

313
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,570
number of questions sort of 
simultaneous.

314
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,770
Why is it that you would say you're in 
Neil Knox,

315
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,683
that's a good exam.

316
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,903
Just say that you're a Neo Nazi.
It's kind of a strange thing to say 

317
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,630
because if you're a neo announcing that 
the same as all the other agencies,

318
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,840
so the you is almost disappeared 
entirely.

319
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,033
You pick this group identification.
Now the consequences of the group 

320
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:13,474
identification are that you surround 
yourself with a whole group of people 

321
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:16,594
think exactly like you,
so there's no threat in the group 

322
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:18,844
whatsoever.
All anomalous information is placed in 

323
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,054
the outside of the group.
But the other thing that's interesting 

324
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:26,030
about being a Neo Nazi is that,
okay,

325
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,370
you're in it theoretically at least as 
far as your concern,

326
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:32,250
because that's the best group to be a 
part,

327
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,133
so you're very moral and upright as a 
consequence of your identification 

328
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,573
thing.
That's peculiar is that it also gives 

329
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:38,674
you an immediate target,
and the target is the target for all 

330
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:42,184
your resentment and hatred and cruelty 
and all those things that you wouldn't 

331
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:45,214
really think that you would have as the 
member of the most optimal conceivable 

332
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:49,990
group.

333
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,823
Of course,
you justify that to yourself by saying 

334
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:52,814
that all that cruelty and resentment,
hatred is necessary in the service of 

335
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,204
the group ideals.
But to see this makes me very skeptical 

336
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,203
and that's,
so that's a rationalization as far as 

337
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,214
I'm concerned.
I think the person that situation has 

338
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:09,310
constructed up the world so that 
simultaneously they can be protected.

339
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,073
Although they're cowardly.
They can be protected from anomalous 

340
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:17,260
information with the group 
identification and they can have all the

341
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:18,094
advantage of those,
of retaining their cruelty and 

342
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:23,230
resentment and hatred while justifying 
the morally.

343
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,190
Now the question then becomes what,
where does that,

344
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,280
this is something I think psychology has
real problem with cause we don't have,

345
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,413
we don't have very good time grappling 
with higher order emotions like 

346
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:38,250
resentment or jealousy or cruelty.
And we have a hard enough time with like

347
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,030
base level emotions like anxiety.

348
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,350
So why or where does the resentments and
cruelty come from?

349
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,783
What's at the base of it?
Why is it that someone would turn 

350
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:48,814
against,
well let's not necessarily say turn 

351
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,480
against life,
although you certainly do see that,

352
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,763
but at least turn against large segments
of life and attempt to stamp it out of 

353
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:58,084
existence.
But that's why I tried to write this 

354
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:00,604
chapter on the consequences of the 
emergence of self conscious 

355
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,100
consciousness.
So this is the basic idea.

356
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,073
Development of human self consciousness 
has contaminated the domain of 

357
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,880
unexplored territory with the threat of 
death.

358
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,660
It's not something that makes us 
different than out can.

359
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,910
I think that the valence,
we know from a very early age,

360
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,893
it's hard to say how early or five maybe
that we not only are able to react 

361
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,400
emotionally to phenomena that we can't 
predict.

362
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,263
I mean we can do that when we're too and
animals do that like a long ways down 

363
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,680
the phylogenetic chain.

364
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,083
We have added to that the possibility of
inferring from the mere presence of the 

365
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:48,751
known that the possibility of our 
imminent demise or painful demise one,

366
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,093
one of the two and that's something 
that's unique to people and I think 

367
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:54,064
that's a big,
it's a very large part of what it means 

368
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,254
to be self conscious when that's the 
sort of thing we're going to try to 

369
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:00,700
discuss today.
When you're self conscious,

370
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:03,070
it means that you can view yourself as 
an object,

371
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,963
although you're a subject,
you can view yourself as if you were an 

372
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:06,764
object in relationship to other objects.
And the thing about an object is that 

373
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:11,710
it's something that has defined 
characteristics,

374
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:12,800
right?
If you,

375
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,490
if you can identify an object,
you know its borders.

376
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,670
So this book has four sides basically,
and it's certain extension in space.

377
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:22,660
That's what makes it an object.
Well,

378
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:23,494
if you're self conscious,
what that means is that you can view 

379
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,540
yourself as an object that has 
limitations.

380
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,720
And we know our spatial limitations,
they're not that hard to defined.

381
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,800
Maybe even animals are aware of their 
spatial limitations in the sense theory,

382
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,634
extension space.
But the thing that really makes us 

383
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,260
unique is that we're aware of our 
temporal limitation,

384
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,570
which is that if you have a beginning 
and an end,

385
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,430
and that is something,
I think there's no evidence for it all.

386
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,273
And you know,
we'll paint.

387
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,110
It's something that makes us absolutely 
unique.

388
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:51,944
And one of the things that that's done 
to us is height I think has heightened 

389
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:58,070
the emotional significance of the 
unknown.

390
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,383
Because w you know,
we know that well you see this say in 

391
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,160
hypochondriacal conditions,
you know,

392
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,013
someone has a,
well maybe they have what a normal 

393
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,450
person would regard as a backache.
And the normal person,

394
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:12,290
so to speak,
would say,

395
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,124
well,
my back hurts and the way they go to 

396
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:15,650
work,
but the hyper can drive.

397
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:18,620
Gold person says,
my back hurts.

398
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:21,770
That's the phenomena.
But the inference is I might die.

399
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,270
And so you say,
well,

400
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:25,580
the anomalous information is the 
backache,

401
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,300
but it's a window into a realm of 
unknown phenomena.

402
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,003
One and t hen you know,
those are known phenomena have a range 

403
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:35,594
of possibilities and the range of 
possibilities defined by death 

404
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:42,260
fundamentally.
So I think that's one of the,

405
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,243
when when we say that we're conscious 
are much more conscious than animals 

406
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:47,114
sort say self conscious.
One of the things that we're saying is 

407
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,544
that the emotional valence of phenomena 
is heightened for us because we can 

408
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,750
understand cognitively the consequences 
of things that strike as emotional.

409
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,643
So there's a theme that the way things 
are supposed to work is that so to 

410
00:25:00,951 --> 00:25:01,784
speak,
same report,

411
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:04,700
you didn't exist it and recognizing 
something as anomalous.

412
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,463
So you focus your attention on a message
goes out to your prefrontal cortex and 

413
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,120
the messages,
anomalous information,

414
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,293
reconfigure behaviors so it goes away or
be configured mode of interpretation so 

415
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:16,940
that it's no longer threatening.

416
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,223
That's perfectly fine.
But if your prefrontal cortex then it 

417
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,230
says,
Oh yes,

418
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:22,064
that really is much more friendly than 
even then you might think as a 

419
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:24,884
consequence of your natural impulses.
Then there's a feedback group that 

420
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,540
develops where you see this and panic 
attacks,

421
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,640
for example,
heart palpitations.

422
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,530
Well No,
I might die.

423
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,970
Well,
right.

424
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,293
The whole system cycles out of control.
The point being that the inhibitory 

425
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:41,354
mechanisms that have developed 
evolutionarily to help us conquer our 

426
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:49,440
fears can also be used to dramatically 
heighten them.

427
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,310
And when we talk about the development 
of self consciousness,

428
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:53,144
that's one of the things that we're 
talking about cause that's one of the 

429
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:59,381
things that implies
selfconsciousness passable.

430
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,630
Well it's much less possible.
That's the whole,

431
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,050
that's one of the underground purposes 
of group identification.

432
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,943
That's that's that's like underlying the
argument that I'm trying to make all 

433
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:14,144
along.
Why identify with the group subjugates 

434
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,770
years.
That's exactly right.

435
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,390
That's now.
That's now,

436
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,400
you see the problem with that is,
is that,

437
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,890
well,
the question is in some part,

438
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:25,724
well,
what's the architect of self 

439
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,070
consciousness?
What's the hero?

440
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,800
Now this is a strange thing because it's
pretty,

441
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,180
it's very paradoxical,
right?

442
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,400
Because something that's self,
something like us,

443
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:37,160
that self conscious,
part of that self consciousness itself,

444
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,470
consciousness of vulnerability.
And you think,

445
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:43,110
well that's the opposite of something as
powerful as the notion of the hero.

446
00:26:43,111 --> 00:26:43,944
But it's not at all.
It's a precondition for heroism because 

447
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,680
courage,
which is an essential aspect of heroism,

448
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,200
is predicated on recognition of 
vulnerabilities,

449
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,034
right?
You have to know you can be hurt before 

450
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,590
you can be brave.
Otherwise you just,

451
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,020
well,
you're just stupid basically.

452
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,730
Hey,
saying two things.

453
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,860
One of which I agree with though in that
I'm going to show,

454
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,783
if that's what you're saying,
the first is that we can abstract a 

455
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,680
death.
We can think about it and make racist,

456
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:08,500
emotional valence,

457
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,333
right?
It's also a defining characteristic of 

458
00:27:10,871 --> 00:27:13,150
our b,
the fact that we're vulnerable to it.

459
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,913
Okay?
And the second thing that I hear you 

460
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,100
saying is that humans respond,
uh,

461
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,070
stronger to the presence of anomalies.
That's right.

462
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,090
That's the argument I'm making.
We,

463
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,053
we,
we react more strongly to the presence 

464
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:28,210
of a normal knee in general because we 
can make,

465
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,820
we can make inferences about what the 
unknown might mean,

466
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,000
which is only to say your plan for the 
future.

467
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,920
And why is that?
Well,

468
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:38,980
it's because you can draw conclusions 
from the present,

469
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:39,814
from occurrences in the present about 
possibilities that may happen in the 

470
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:43,540
future.
For example,

471
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,553
you have a healthcare program.
Well that's because you've drawn the 

472
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:47,734
inference that uh,
being such as yourself is vulnerable to 

473
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,630
a whole class of phenomena,
which includes,

474
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,280
well,
certainly the possibility of illness.

475
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,180
Any,
any set amount of severity up to a fatal

476
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,230
illness.
So you,

477
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,290
you make plans to take that fact into 
account.

478
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,140
The fact that we'll do that,
it's one of the things that drives us to

479
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,460
construct cultures,
I think.

480
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:07,294
And that,
and that's part of the argument I try 

481
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:09,640
and make as well.
Why do people,

482
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,430
why are people engaged in construction 
of cultures?

483
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:13,710
Okay.
I,

484
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,590
I,
I still tend to to see it as I would,

485
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,453
I wouldn't say that humans react 
stronger to the nominally because like 

486
00:28:19,711 --> 00:28:21,300
you said,
when a rat is presented with,

487
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,850
with an an endless something in the 
cage,

488
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:24,684
it freezes.
And you rarely see humans phrase that's 

489
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:27,914
like that.
But the reason is I think because 

490
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,070
animals cannot,
don't have this cognition to be able to,

491
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,150
to,
they don't,

492
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,920
you know,
they can't necessarily remember or,

493
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,330
or make these natural category as well 
as we can.

494
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,620
And so what we would say is anomalous 
information,

495
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,170
it only breaks certain levels and when 
it does break,

496
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,813
you know,
maybe we can break these levels 

497
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:49,230
consciously what I thought,
but I wouldn't say that that,

498
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,660
look,
I'm actually stronger.

499
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:50,810
Yeah.

500
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,260
Well I'm not,
you're,

501
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,350
you're,
you're touching on another argument that

502
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:56,240
we'll get to really near the end of the 
course,

503
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:57,074
which is that although selfconsciousness
heightens the effect of valence of 

504
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:00,764
something like the unknown,
it also provides a mode of dealing with 

505
00:29:03,621 --> 00:29:05,300
it that,
that animals don't have.

506
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,390
That's why,
well,

507
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,910
fruit,
I can,

508
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,100
I don't want to get into that part of 
the argument right now though,

509
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:13,940
because it's very complicated and it 
sort of presumes that we've gone through

510
00:29:13,941 --> 00:29:18,090
all of this as a presupposition.
So because self like I'll,

511
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,410
I'll put it in very quickly.
The Christian,

512
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,440
the Christian myth essentially 
presuppose it's two things.

513
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,460
One is that I'll,
I'll,

514
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,850
I'll talk a little bit about Buddhism,
the here in a minute too.

515
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:33,380
What is it that it was the development 
of self consciousness consciousness that

516
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:36,920
knocked people out of paragraphs.
So that's what number one,

517
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:37,754
into the normal world and mass,
the world is characterized by awareness 

518
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:45,791
of as manifested as shame,
which I think is precisely equivalent to

519
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:47,230
knowledge of vulnerability.

520
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,843
What else would it mean?
And knowledge of death and knowledge of 

521
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,780
good and evil,
right?

522
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,420
All those things are congregating 
together and the genesis story,

523
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,910
but the rest of the Christian story,
so to speak,

524
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:02,350
the rest of the story is how heightened 
consciousness can actually be used as an

525
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:06,130
antidote.
So the thing is is that although a small

526
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:06,964
dose of something might kill you,
a larger dose might curie and that's 

527
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,074
basically the notion that's that's under
law that well that underlies adaptive 

528
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:16,660
mythology in general as far as I can 
tell,

529
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,300
so a little knowledge is a dangerous 
thing.

530
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,930
That's the apple at the snake provides 
this.

531
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:23,920
You're like,
God,

532
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,740
you know who you are and what happens 
when you know who you are.

533
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,753
When the human cases,
you get all the knowledge of God so to 

534
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:30,664
speak,
without any of the power so you can see 

535
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:32,860
your borders.

536
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,080
All of a sudden you know that you're 
going to die.

537
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,510
You have to start making plans for the 
future.

538
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,493
That means you have to work,
which is another thing that happens in 

539
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:42,580
genesis as well,
so you're condemned to work.

540
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,423
The why you worked was because you can 
view the future as a place of negative 

541
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:48,730
possibilities,
all of which are hypothetical.

542
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,730
All of which you attempt to conquer even
before they appear.

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,833
That's planning and when you,
when you start up grain for the winter 

544
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,303
is because you can perceive anomalous 
information where it hasn't even 

545
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:02,500
manifested itself in a sense.
That's intelligence.

546
00:31:02,501 --> 00:31:03,334
We don't,
we don't,

547
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,413
we don't tend to to emphasize the 
emotional aspect of intelligence that 

548
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:08,224
much,
but extraordinary anxiety I think is 

549
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:12,100
part of the force that drives 
intelligence.

550
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,593
So anyways,
we'll get to the other part of that 

551
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:17,590
argument lead.
Okay.

552
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:18,424
So I,
I'm trying to make the point that the 

553
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:20,944
fact that people are developed 
selfconsciousness has made us much more 

554
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:26,650
susceptible to anxiety and also the 
curiosity,

555
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,660
I think as it turns out than other 
animals are.

556
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,173
And it's also provided motivation for us
to try to reject the fact of our 

557
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,023
consciousness in any possible way.
And that provides additional motivation 

558
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:41,550
for adoption of an authoritarian stance 
just to save me.

559
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,993
It's the fact of your ignorance and 
limitation that bring about all the 

560
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,620
painful things that are associated with,
with hall humility basically.

561
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,463
I mean,
you think about the occasions when you 

562
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:54,310
have to admit to making a mistake,
for example.

563
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,890
It's very,
I mean it's absolutely necessary,

564
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,780
but it's very,
very annoying.

565
00:31:58,781 --> 00:31:59,614
It's embarrassing as a matter of fact 
because because what it means to make a 

566
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,604
mistake is that you admit to yourself 
that you know that an essential aspect 

567
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:07,864
of your vulnerability,
which is that you're obviously you 

568
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:10,324
perfect and so and so on.
You have to actually make a statement 

569
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:13,750
about pattern.
It is the case.

570
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:15,530
If you want to embarrass someone in that
space,

571
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,020
what you do social ways,
right.

572
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,213
It's like there are doing a good job of 
hiding their vulnerabilities and just 

573
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,190
pop a little information that makes one 
absolutely evidence.

574
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,820
They'll turn red
fall into themselves,

575
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,654
so to speak.

576
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,473
That's one way of dealing with that is 
to try to read you one way of dealing 

577
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,004
with it is to try to rid yourself of the
of your individuality as one of the 

578
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:44,160
things group identification serves.
Okay,

579
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,870
and the contamination of the unknown 
with the threat of mortality.

580
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,440
I can animal a deer or something.
It's in,

581
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:55,441
it hurt her and her dad.
If they see a why am nearby or honestly,

582
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,390
herds of envelopes will raise quite 
quiet lions.

583
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,520
Your,
as a general rule,

584
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,354
the lions have to manifest a particular 
pattern of behavior before the lopes 

585
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,280
become afraid.
And that's not really because there are,

586
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,480
it's not because they're afraid that the
envelopes would kill them.

587
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:14,930
It's because they're hardwired to 
recognize a particular pattern,

588
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,240
predatory behavior and responding to it 
with fear.

589
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,293
And if antelopes were self conscious and
could think they'd get the hell out of 

590
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,284
the way,
and whenever there was a line anywhere 

591
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,430
near and they don't,
they're not afraid of death,

592
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,880
they're afraid of the,
normally we're afraid of anomaly,

593
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,230
but it's contaminated for us.

594
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,200
It's contaminated with the possibility.
It's not just death.

595
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:34,034
That's just the biggest aspect of it.
But it's all imaginable suffering 

596
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,353
basically.
And that's what you know how your 

597
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:43,130
imagination can grip on to things.
Say It's,

598
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:44,480
you know,
if you were alone at night,

599
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:45,314
that's a good example.
You a little bit less stable than you 

600
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:48,674
might otherwise be that day.
Some little nagging thing is worrying 

601
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:53,420
you.
It's easy for your imagination,

602
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:54,254
take that little chunk of information 
below it up and you know any number of 

603
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,813
possible ways.
So it seems like Brandon was the 

604
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,660
anomalies either either gives you this 
emotional balance or you're here,

605
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,290
but as humans had this huge array of,
of,

606
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,021
of,
you know,

607
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:11,330
we're normally it down here because we 
can track these,

608
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,560
these,
the stories that protect us,

609
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,960
but then the thought can,
can bring us,

610
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,794
can titanus to,
to the level where we might need it to 

611
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,560
get us the heck out of.

612
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,910
Well that's,
I mean I,

613
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,783
I you're referring to the possibility of
moving the information stored of up and 

614
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:24,884
down levels of stories.
While I think that's one of the things 

615
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,313
that's another one of the things that 
are cognitive flexibility has allowed 

616
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,413
mean it's,
it's a negative thing in some ways 

617
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:32,264
because it does,
it means that you can make a mountain 

618
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:35,024
out a molehill.
It's positive for all sorts of other 

619
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:42,920
obvious reasons,
but maybe look regards to her original,

620
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,330
what the threat of death does for 
civilizations.

621
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,173
You think about the Egyptians in the 
Egyptian spent their whole time 

622
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,373
essentially dealing with death.
That was the basis of their whole 

623
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:56,830
culture.
I mean,

624
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,560
there are civilizations were devoted in 
large part towards construction of these

625
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,260
massive pyramids and that took a lot of 
work.

626
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:04,094
It took a lot of cultural energy.
We know some of the methodology behind 

627
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:07,250
that.

628
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,430
I mean for the Egyptians,
the Pharaoh was the intermediary between

629
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:11,264
heaven and earth.
And to the degree that you participated 

630
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:13,484
in the life of the Pharaoh,
you were granted at least partial 

631
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,350
status,
the partial status of having an immortal

632
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:19,280
soul.
Well,

633
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:21,680
that was a potent enough motivator for 
the Egyptian so that,

634
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,773
you know,
they engaged in what was essentially a 

635
00:35:24,591 --> 00:35:25,424
recreational cultural activity.
You can't really define what they're 

636
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,840
doing in terms of any simplistic notions
of,

637
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,120
of making sure there was enough to eat 
or any rational economically motivated,

638
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,600
uh,
ideas as far as I can tell anyways,

639
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,190
a lot of work into building those,
those more than monuments.

640
00:35:43,191 --> 00:35:45,480
It's the same thing was true for this 
medieval Christians.

641
00:35:45,481 --> 00:35:46,314
With regards to the cathedrals.
Often those were the constructions of 

642
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,094
those cathedrals sort of equivalent to 
in a sense to that can alter the space 

643
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:58,041
program and the 1960s height of 
technological endeavor and you know,

644
00:35:58,861 --> 00:35:59,694
a lot of our cultural activities 
motivated by fear of death because we 

645
00:36:03,031 --> 00:36:05,160
plan then it's not just,
yeah,

646
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,450
it's vulnerability in general.

647
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,330
All right,
so the idea is this,

648
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,443
the fact that the development of self 
consciousness has meant that for us the 

649
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:16,704
unknown is contaminated with threat of 
death has much more extreme emotional 

650
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:23,490
valence for us than it does for other 
animals.

651
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,430
Now,
one of the consequences of that is we're

652
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:30,360
much more motivated to plan for the 
future and to construct how to construct

653
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,194
cultural structures in general.
The other thing is we're much more 

654
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:37,950
motivated to get ourselves away from any
information that's anomalous,

655
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,770
to reject it,
to protect ourselves from it.

656
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,183
And that's one of the things that 
underlies our temptation towards the 

657
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:51,140
adoption of authoritarianism as an 
authoritarian says in what's that?

658
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:51,974
The basis of authoritarian is it is 
either the personal adoption of 

659
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:59,850
omniscience hit inhibitors cases,
Darlin's case,

660
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,910
or it's the secondary adoption of 
omniscience and uneven,

661
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,540
more cowardly mattered in someone like 
Hitler,

662
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,460
at least this is the way I look at it.

663
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,713
He was sort of out on the front lines of
the authoritarian struggle and someone 

664
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,890
could have taken a shot at him at any 
time,

665
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,233
but all the followers of hidden and 
they've got to identify with his power 

666
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,013
and his beliefs,
not actually putting themselves on the 

667
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:24,450
line and that's the essential nature of 
an authoritarian stance.

668
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
Yes,
I know everything that needs to be no.

669
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,940
So if you offer any information that's 
forward to my foreign,

670
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:36,520
to my my particular theory,
it's obvious that you're an agent of,

671
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:37,763
while we say an agent of chaos,
way something to be eliminated as is as 

672
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,510
efficiently as possible.
Hence adoption of omniscience.

673
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:46,344
That's where the authoritarian is a 
means and the motivation for that is 

674
00:37:49,321 --> 00:37:50,154
that if you know everything,
there isn't anything unknown and if the 

675
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,283
unknown has this sort of vantage,
you can understand why people are 

676
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:57,960
motivated to get rid of it.

677
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,740
Now the problem with the development of 
an authoritarian personality,

678
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,900
this is why I wanted you to read Milton 
because the note in this parable,

679
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,823
paradise lost,
is about the consequences of the 

680
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,410
adoption of the numbness in stance.
That's the devil sin,

681
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:14,910
right?
So as I will be like,

682
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,740
God,
I don't want to take the place of God.

683
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,900
As soon as that happens in Middleton 
story,

684
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,153
devil's cast down into to help where and
you can get out of it at any time just 

685
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,620
by admitting he was wrong,
but he won't have been.

686
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,454
He was wrong.
And the reason for that is that if he 

687
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:30,540
admitted he was wrong,
you have to face all the chaos that he'd

688
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,970
been avoiding.
I think it's a good,

689
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,980
this is one of our fries meeting of the 
same parable.

690
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,050
It's a good or a little about the rise 
of states.

691
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:38,883
Like in union,
there's a cumulative evidence gathered 

692
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,400
up over the course of it.
I mean it was certainly,

693
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,533
it wasn't evident by the fifth.
Harmony doesn't look at working with 

694
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,080
certainly evidence by the end of the 
sixties it still took another 2030 years

695
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,970
before the system.
Well,

696
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,930
it's not like people gave it up really.
It's just more like the,

697
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,310
it just,
it wasn't even self supporting anymore.

698
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,163
Couldn't go on any farther.
They wouldn't admit to any anomalous 

699
00:39:07,451 --> 00:39:08,284
information,
which was inflammation that would 

700
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:12,400
suggest that there are particular theory
was wrong.

701
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,033
Having just not,
it's not as if it's a stance that only 

702
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:16,234
characterized as communists that 
certainly it's just this is the stance 

703
00:39:20,051 --> 00:39:23,500
of authoritarianism in general.
Hell,

704
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,350
you know,
while we've talked about so far.

705
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,883
Yeah,
and the constituent elements of the 

706
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:34,794
world.

707
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,640
Okay,
awesome.

708
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,660
We've only talked about positive aspect 
of the individual,

709
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,690
not the native aspect.
That's what we're going to talk about.

710
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,173
The positive aspect of the individual 
methodology is the part of that 

711
00:39:56,861 --> 00:39:57,694
voluntarily admit to the existence of 
the unknown and that admission is a 

712
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:02,854
precondition for the next stage,
which is creative exploration of that 

713
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,763
unknown and then its transformation into
something that's either irrelevant or 

714
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:13,870
something beneficial.
And then communication of that among the

715
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:15,940
group while on the question is what's 
the,

716
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,340
what's the pattern that's opposite to 
that?

717
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,400
And you can't sum it up in a,
in a sentence or in a few words.

718
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,830
It's like these other,
these are all natural categories.

719
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:29,070
Natural categories are full of all sorts
of big related information so to speak,

720
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,544
and I actually think this is the reason 
why mythology Ken's to present these 

721
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:34,714
different domains of the world as a 
forum for action as personalities 

722
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,110
because the personality is something 
that's very complex and it's got lots of

723
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:41,944
different levels of motivation,
lots of different potentials for action 

724
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,000
and the adversary of the hero is a 
personality.

725
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,170
Christianity left personalities,
the devil one,

726
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:54,370
it is the case.
This is a claim by yell yet anyways.

727
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:55,204
Then Christy I think has the most well 
developed notion of the negative aspect 

728
00:40:59,411 --> 00:41:04,411
of the individual potentially arguing.
Anyways.

729
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,880
All right,
I wanted you to read Milton's.

730
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,970
Well,
the funny thing is if you look at,

731
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,410
if you look in the old and New 
Testament,

732
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,313
there's,
there's almost no reference at all to 

733
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,960
the mythological figure if the devil 
just like a few sentences and that's it.

734
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:19,794
And the entire book.
I mean all of the methodology that we 

735
00:41:21,641 --> 00:41:24,000
all vaguely know about what describes 
the devil,

736
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:24,843
that's all.
It's dreamlike imagery that sort of 

737
00:41:27,011 --> 00:41:29,830
surrounds the canonical writings of 
Christianity.

738
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,500
It's all storytelling and mythologies.
Milton tried to codify it.

739
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,920
It's kind of interesting.
I would say,

740
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,000
well,
why did this develop?

741
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,893
And it's because people have always been
fascinated by what constitutes the 

742
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:43,724
essential aspect of evil and the theory 
that we'd be discussing in this class 

743
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,350
suggested evil for the sake of argument.

744
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,240
It's a pattern of action and a pattern 
of interpretation leads to actions.

745
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,440
We tend to those patterns of action,
although we see them in story form.

746
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,213
First of all emerged from the forms of 
behaviors and people observe the 

747
00:42:07,431 --> 00:42:09,800
behaviors and told stories about the 
papers and so on.

748
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:10,634
Until we got to the point of abstraction
where we could construct an image about 

749
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,980
the pattern of the say,
well,

750
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,410
mythological representations of the 
devil.

751
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,980
It's not just the devil,
but the negative counterpart of the hero

752
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:26,180
throughout history are our cumulative 
attempts to formulate it.

753
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:31,130
Image of the pattern of behavior and 
interpretation that characterizes all of

754
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:35,270
the negative aspects of the individual.
So we're going to try to figure out what

755
00:42:35,271 --> 00:42:36,800
those attributes are.
Well,

756
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,080
one of them is,
this is the why.

757
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,470
I think perhaps the one milton stress is
above all else is pride.

758
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,900
And that's refusal to admit to error.

759
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,760
And what does that mean?
If you think about

760
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:53,300
it means that refusal to admit to error,
his refusal to admit to the existence of

761
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,910
anomalous information,
it's precisely the same thing.

762
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:57,680
Yes.
And you know,

763
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:59,223
it seems to me to figure out too,
because all you have to do is observe 

764
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:01,694
yourself in the course of an argument.
So you're arguing about someone arguing 

765
00:43:04,731 --> 00:43:08,910
with someone about something that's 
meaningful to you and,

766
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,060
and you know what you're wrong.
Because you know,

767
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:11,894
sometimes they'd be either their 
argument is just so much more 

768
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,563
destructive than New York or you know 
perfectly well that the moral ground 

769
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:20,510
they stand on,
it's much firmer than yours.

770
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,140
It says,
well,

771
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,980
the thing that stops you from admitting 
to the anomalous information,

772
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,310
which is actually that you're nowhere 
near as good as you think you are,

773
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,930
the thing that stops you use pride.

774
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,053
Why is it pride and arrogance for that 
matter in the context of the devil and 

775
00:43:35,261 --> 00:43:37,280
who was telling the stories and what 
context,

776
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:42,170
why is it simply the refusal to submit 
to the authority well into the authority

777
00:43:42,171 --> 00:43:43,004
of God?
Look often white interpretation instead 

778
00:43:47,331 --> 00:43:48,164
of the

779
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:51,161
well,
okay,

780
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,840
that's a good question.
Look,

781
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:53,823
there's been a lot of books written 
lately by Elaine Paige Hills for 

782
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,540
example.
She wrote a book about the devil and she

783
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:01,450
basically said that the whole concept 
was extraordinarily dangerous.

784
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:03,340
It was primarily a Christian concept.
She said,

785
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,593
Perp,
the function of the image of the devil 

786
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,260
was essentially to,
uh,

787
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,843
to allow Christians greater ease in and 
defining and bills who didn't hold the 

788
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:20,690
same beliefs as them as an entity in 
there.

789
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:21,524
I mean,
you can see that,

790
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,800
you can see the rationale in that 
argument.

791
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:24,460
I mean,
it's,

792
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,440
that's what happens.
As soon as there's a war,

793
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,530
the enemy gets demonized.
Well,

794
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,250
it's not as much of a leap because a 
stranger is an of chaos anyway.

795
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,430
It's chaos has a reptilian aspect,
so to speak.

796
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:36,264
You don't have to push people very hard 
before they're willing to buy that 

797
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:38,934
interpretation.

798
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:43,680
What I'm trying to say is that basically
is that the least natural categories may

799
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:44,514
tend to merge and Meld and mixed 
together sort of helter skelter in our 

800
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,204
heads.
They're not very well defined and they 

801
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:51,510
have fuzzy borders.
Now it's very,

802
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,403
it's very simple for someone to say all 
those individuals who do not accept 

803
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,220
established order our prime of facie 
agents of the devil,

804
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:01,054
and you can understand why they would 
say that because if you don't accept 

805
00:45:02,971 --> 00:45:03,804
establish order,
then you're a threat to stability and 

806
00:45:05,221 --> 00:45:07,590
you are an agent of chaos.
Fine,

807
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,353
but the problem with that line of 
argument is that by that definition you 

808
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:16,680
can't distinguish those who update the 
group from those who want to destroy it.

809
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,140
Right.
Is that in fact quite often couch,

810
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,513
yes it is difficult to tell,
but if you want to make a categorical 

811
00:45:25,441 --> 00:45:28,620
statement about what constitutes the 
essential aspect of evil,

812
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:29,723
you can't say that evil is the process 
that undermines the group because you 

813
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:34,074
can't distinguish the process that 
undermines the group from the process 

814
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:39,610
that updates it and you know the process
that updates it is the board.

815
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,060
So whatever evil is has to be something 
else.

816
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,493
So like people also tend to like,
I would also say that in the Old 

817
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,103
Testament,
one of the great sins for the ancient 

818
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:54,930
Hebrews was making idols on go on,
which is essentially the say that it was

819
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:57,960
considered immoral to categorize 
something light go on.

820
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,390
In terms of something that was actually 
understandable,

821
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,690
you always had to allow for the 
transcendent aspect of God.

822
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:04,923
But I would say that people make the 
same mistake when you're discussing 

823
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,560
evil.
They want to make an idol out of,

824
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,910
which is to say they want to make it the
thing that's definable.

825
00:46:11,911 --> 00:46:16,380
So it might be the process that 
undermines established order or it might

826
00:46:16,381 --> 00:46:19,290
be a aggression,
might be jealousy,

827
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,153
might be whatever.
Because know there's all sorts of 

828
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,183
emotions.
It might be sexual desire and that's 

829
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:28,710
being demonized time and time again,
that's making an idler well,

830
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:33,360
I would say just as just as you have to 
regard the individual,

831
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,510
no one has a thing that can be defined,
but as a process,

832
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,283
which is to say,
I would say in archaic language of 

833
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:42,934
spirit,
you also have to do the same thing with 

834
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:47,700
the negative aspect of the individual 
process.

835
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,573
No one other thing,
and it's the process by which an almost 

836
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,680
inflammation has rejected.
So is that a reasonable answer?

837
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:00,420
Does that satisfy your question?
Well,

838
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,283
the thing is low,
it's confusing and what we're trying to 

839
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:04,014
do to some degree is clear up the 
boundaries of these natural categories 

840
00:47:06,271 --> 00:47:09,710
because it's very easy for the figure of
the devil,

841
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:13,320
so to speak,
to take on the aspects of the tyrannical

842
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:17,400
aspects of a border and also the 
negative aspects of chaos.

843
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:18,263
I mean Girtha described the devil knows 
the strange son of chaos and we tend to 

844
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:25,830
think of anything that's at the moment 
negatively valence as evil.

845
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,110
That's,
that's an,

846
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,150
that's just an example of fuzzy thinking
and w w w what since we're trying to get

847
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,740
out the basis of what constitutes 
motivations for social conflict here,

848
00:47:35,741 --> 00:47:38,320
it's very useful to start clarifying up 
the descriptions.

849
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,780
We can't say,
well the unknown is evil.

850
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:41,823
That's not any good because although 
it's very dangerous if you don't have 

851
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:47,830
any around,
you come to a halt and you can't say,

852
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,840
well cultures evil.
Although you can say,

853
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,810
well it tends towards authoritarianism.
That's a problem.

854
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,150
It also provides you with necessarily 
security.

855
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:59,140
You can't say that the process that 
transforms orders,

856
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:03,130
he believe it because although it can be
very upsetting if you don't have it,

857
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,790
you come to a halt as well.
So by process of elimination and sense,

858
00:48:07,791 --> 00:48:11,410
your left to the questions,
what can you define as evil?

859
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,660
Where does it go?
Assuming need exists?

860
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:17,240
Assuming an exist is a good question.
Well it depends on your death.

861
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:18,310
It exists.
I mean,

862
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:20,810
cause there's some news.
No,

863
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,090
it doesn't just exist as a religious 
abstraction and we know that it exists.

864
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,073
I mean that's why we have things like 
the Nuremberg trials and that's why we 

865
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:30,520
have things like Holocaust museum in 
Washington.

866
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,390
I mean even though we're not very good 
at defining it and we don't exactly know

867
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:39,540
what it means when it occurs
even in in terms of consensus,

868
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:41,913
people can tell.
So hopefully what we can do is try to 

869
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:46,264
figure out what it is and what it isn't 
because it's easy to say if I'm part of 

870
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:50,194
Group Bank,
all members of Group B are Evil and you 

871
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,940
can understand why there's motivation to
do that.

872
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:56,263
Like Group B poses a real threat to 
group bates non trivial threat has 

873
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:02,410
nothing to do with their moral nature in
a sense.

874
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,260
And it's very easy for people to make 
that presumption.

875
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:06,573
So one of the things I want to do is 
clear up the categories so that it's no 

876
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:11,104
longer possible to rationalize the 
notion that just because you're a part 

877
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,330
of Group B and I'm part of Group A,
you as a member of group,

878
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:20,050
we are necessarily evil and I 
necessarily all good.

879
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:21,633
So,
so in a sense when you label another 

880
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,410
group,
when you say that group is the devil,

881
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:28,570
you're sort of taking on the devil more 
protective stuff.

882
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,540
Well I,
I I,

883
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,630
I would say that that's necessarily the 
case here as soon as,

884
00:49:34,631 --> 00:49:38,380
as soon as you adopt because,
well that's one aspect of it.

885
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:39,214
Anyways,
it's the inappropriate adoption of 

886
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:42,720
omniscience.
Like level,

887
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,710
let's say you can even know it is 
necessary for me to protect my group and

888
00:49:47,711 --> 00:49:49,840
also that my group is valuable to 
things,

889
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:50,674
which for me,
whenever you would never create any 

890
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,430
debate,
we know the function of group.

891
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,820
The problem is when,
when you say one,

892
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,750
I personally am actually,
uh,

893
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:05,890
what would you say the most admirable 
possible exponent of wine group,

894
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,903
which means first of all that I actually
understand its structure and that given 

895
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:11,734
such understanding,
I actually acted out both of which are 

896
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:14,374
highly debatable propositions and also 
that my understanding of my group 

897
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,114
processes is sufficiently profound for 
me to determine what the absolute 

898
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:24,580
certainty that you're wrong.
That for me,

899
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:26,620
that's arrogance.
I think that's pride.

900
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,190
It's also,
it's the underground adoption of,

901
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:31,340
and I'm missing steps soon as you do 
that.

902
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,250
Well there are certain consequences 
which

903
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,030
detail.
Oh Man,

904
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:37,943
I,

905
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,093
okay,
I'm confused.

906
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:39,933
Um,
we have the positive part of the 

907
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:43,730
individual as somebody who accepts a 
nonlinear,

908
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,603
we had the,
the negative individual how do the 

909
00:50:46,331 --> 00:50:48,130
individual as a process that rejects 
anomalies.

910
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,950
However,
and we've already discussed the positive

911
00:50:50,951 --> 00:50:52,090
part,
uh,

912
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:52,983
update society and yet we've also 
discussed how the negative part is a 

913
00:50:55,811 --> 00:50:58,240
process that also a bait society,
uh,

914
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:58,991
you know,
through,

915
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:00,340
through fire.
The devil,

916
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,553
uh,
updates.

917
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:03,380
No,
no.

918
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,213
The idea here,
the idea of essentially was that if 

919
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:07,574
you're in a group,
like say you're the spoke of a 

920
00:51:10,161 --> 00:51:14,570
particular group from within the group,
it's very difficult for you to determine

921
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,830
the difference between the power of that
wants to just lay the group to waste and

922
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:21,350
the power that we'll update it cause 
they look very much the same,

923
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:26,180
which is why revolutionary heroes who 
are often heretical are so badly treated

924
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,650
by group members.
It's like it's because they're dead.

925
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,610
They're indistinguishable from random 
maintenance of chaos from,

926
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,980
well at least for less than 
distinguishable.

927
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,963
Usually I think you can tell the 
difference but people are not 

928
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:37,244
necessarily willing to.

929
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:40,350
It was minute.
Okay,

930
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,193
so it's,
so we're still saying that the negative 

931
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:45,450
part of the individual is the one that 
rejects anomaly,

932
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,160
right?
Knowing that it's there,

933
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,830
knowing that it's there,
which is the second one,

934
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,870
something occurs
and at least at one level of analysis,

935
00:51:54,871 --> 00:51:58,300
you know that it's undermining one of 
your theories and you say it,

936
00:51:58,370 --> 00:51:59,203
well,
no,

937
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,100
it doesn't exist.
I think given that the individual is the

938
00:52:05,561 --> 00:52:06,394
houses,
the positive aspect of the individual 

939
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:09,794
would be an aggressive like means toward
the unknown which would be the hero and 

940
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:19,301
then the negative would be the group or 
the culture which is instant.

941
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,073
Well it's partly that.
I mean that's why in the diag for that 

942
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,113
growing the relationship has always been
like this cause because the negative 

943
00:52:28,161 --> 00:52:33,161
aspect of the individual heightens the 
catastrophic danger of the group,

944
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:34,604
which is to say that if you take a group
that's entirely composed of individuals 

945
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,790
who reject it,
normally what you have is a tyranny.

946
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,073
So to the degree that the group is 
composed of individuals who reject the 

947
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:45,914
normally it will become integrity.
One of the things that we're trying to 

948
00:52:48,591 --> 00:52:49,424
discuss in this class and to formulate 
overtime is it the relationship between 

949
00:52:52,131 --> 00:52:54,320
individual action and group 
identification,

950
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:55,154
which is to say like what can you do to 
ensure that your group does not only 

951
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,560
your group tending towards tyranny as it
necessarily will,

952
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,770
will not absolutely transform itself 
into tyranny over time.

953
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:07,723
And the only thing you can do as an 
individual is to ensure that when an 

954
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:12,344
anomalous piece of information pops its 
ugly head up and makes you realize that 

955
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:16,544
you're vulnerable and mortal,
that you admit to its presence and take 

956
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:23,480
the necessary action,
whatever those actions happen to be.

957
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,730
Now the problem is under some 
circumstances that doing so will be very

958
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:27,564
dangerous to you.

959
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:32,180
That's essentially what culture is.
Culture is protect is protecting.

960
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:35,330
You are denying that which you know,
um,

961
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,470
can threaten to you.

962
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,580
Well that's part of it.
It's also,

963
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,200
that's only part of it.
It's also,

964
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,860
I think to think of it as a parent,
which is to put it in its personality,

965
00:53:43,861 --> 00:53:44,694
guys is very accurate because of parent.
Both protects you but exposes you at a 

966
00:53:49,171 --> 00:53:51,390
rate that you can tolerate.
Now,

967
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:55,170
one of the things we're going to talk 
about at the end of this class is how,

968
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,890
how you can tell if you're being exposed
to the unknown at the proper rate.

969
00:53:59,130 --> 00:53:59,963
And I would say just in passing that you
can tell when you're doing something 

970
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:05,520
that's interesting to you that's 
meaningful.

971
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,413
That's the indication that you're 
sufficiently secure so that you're not 

972
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:11,574
going to fall apart,
but also sufficiently open so that your 

973
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:14,724
stability will be maintained over time.
The way that manifests itself is in the 

974
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:18,744
feeling of interest.
That's when self consciousness vanishes 

975
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,030
in part and time tends to disappear as 
well,

976
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,820
so therefore can the hero be part of the
group?

977
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,030
Well,
the hero's necessarily what the hero has

978
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:30,864
to be from

979
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,863
heroes,
the group.

980
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,860
Right,
right.

981
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,753
But the hero can't necessarily can know 
of the hero identify with the group 

982
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:38,660
while still being a euro.

983
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,410
No,
I don't think so.

984
00:54:40,411 --> 00:54:41,244
I think it's a matter of recognition of 
the value of the group and also the 

985
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,690
necessity of its being.
Yeah.

986
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:46,524
Without saying,
without trying to get from childhood to 

987
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:50,064
individually.
I think about any group intermediation 

988
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:55,020
whatsoever or without saying that the 
group is the be all and end all,

989
00:54:55,021 --> 00:54:55,854
which is what all groups wanted you to 
say about them or without saying that 

990
00:54:58,171 --> 00:55:00,690
the group is only an impediment to 
individuality,

991
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:01,524
which is just not,
it's also a precondition so it's more a 

992
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,270
matter of appropriate.
Look,

993
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,980
here's an example.
This is a really good,

994
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:08,903
this is a good little parable.
It's from the gnostic gospels that were 

995
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:16,791
discovered in the late 1950s.
Christ is walking down the road and it's

996
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:18,690
Sunday or Saturday,
actually,

997
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:20,600
it's the Sabbath Day.
And uh,

998
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:24,510
there's a man in a ditch and his sheep,
his fallen into a hole and he's,

999
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,493
he's picking the sheep out of the hole,
which you're not supposed to do on the 

1000
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:30,720
sabbath because by prostitutes were in 
Christ test.

1001
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,940
And Amanda,
if you know what you're doing,

1002
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:34,260
then you're blessed.
And if you don't,

1003
00:55:34,261 --> 00:55:36,810
you're a transgressor of the law and 
you're cursed.

1004
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,183
Well,
and then he wants you saw him down the 

1005
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:39,760
road.
And that's like,

1006
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,703
that's really quite an interesting 
philosophical position because he said 

1007
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:44,694
to the man,
if,

1008
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,960
if you actually understand the 
significance of your actions,

1009
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:50,123
which has bit,
you're breaking a moral rule that's 

1010
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,190
there for a reason,
you know,

1011
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:54,024
the reason why the rule is there,
you appreciate its necessity and you've 

1012
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,700
decided as a consequence of that 
appreciation,

1013
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,880
it's still worthwhile to par the sheep 
out of the hole.

1014
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,760
No problem.
But if it's just a casual gesture,

1015
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,290
you know there's something wrong with 
the way you think and you'll pay for it.

1016
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:14,940
So really it's a nice little story.
So in fact,

1017
00:56:15,090 --> 00:56:16,830
there are a number of parables in the 
New Testament.

1018
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:21,600
They're very much like that,
but that's not so it's very simple.

1019
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:26,140
It's a very powerful little story.
Anyways,

1020
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:30,460
I want to read you a Buddhist myth 
briefly because it will,

1021
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,130
it will,
uh,

1022
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,153
put into story form some of the ideas 
I've been trying to describe to you 

1023
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:37,204
about the relationship between the 
development of self consciousness and 

1024
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,070
the contamination of things with the 
idea of death.

1025
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,600
Uh,
before you start,

1026
00:56:43,601 --> 00:56:46,570
I just wanted to ask you something 
because there's been bothering me,

1027
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,720
which is,
uh,

1028
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,173
our reference to the identification of 
the individual with the process rather 

1029
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:55,540
than to the individual sort of as the 
process.

1030
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,593
Yeah.
The thing that strikes me is that the 

1031
00:56:58,601 --> 00:56:59,434
group is,
can be no more than a bunch of 

1032
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,960
individuals.
I mean,

1033
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,550
I grew group is a,
it's a way of,

1034
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,593
it's an abstraction that that puts a 
bunch of individuals who are similar 

1035
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,550
together there.
And furthermore,

1036
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:16,623
an individual is not the process unless 
it's already has something to work the 

1037
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,780
process on.
Yeah,

1038
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,820
I'm saying,
I mean the,

1039
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:29,540
the known is as much a part of the 
individual as the process is fine.

1040
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,850
That's a perfectly good objection.
This is the Arctic individual,

1041
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,700
right?
Like

1042
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,150
this is a map of experience in total,
the whole thing.

1043
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,013
And you can say,
well you're the sum total of your 

1044
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:40,844
experience,
which basically means that there's an 

1045
00:57:42,051 --> 00:57:42,884
aspect of you that's characterized by
both participation in the unknown and 

1046
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,693
the consequences of being exposed to it 
and the group inside you and the 

1047
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:54,884
architect will individually inside you.
But as we are all these things and the 

1048
00:57:57,231 --> 00:57:59,240
grow your experience or your 
experiences,

1049
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,770
all of these things,
and you can say,

1050
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,630
I am my experience.
Okay.

1051
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:03,840
And I think that's perfect.
The reason,

1052
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:05,003
no,
but it's the architectural rep 

1053
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:07,163
representations of the individuals that 
constitute the process because there's 

1054
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,890
archetypical representation,
the wise king for example,

1055
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,950
that's an individual who just occupies a
part of the whole,

1056
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:21,600
the whole of,
of all of experience.

1057
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,003
So yeah,
I mean what got me into this to begin 

1058
00:58:25,021 --> 00:58:25,950
with,
at least in part,

1059
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:28,650
was the recognition that to the degree 
that there's a group,

1060
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:29,640
it's in your head.

1061
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:30,661
Right?
Right.

1062
00:58:30,661 --> 00:58:33,060
I mean because it is an abstraction.
It's like people,

1063
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:34,320
you know,
I see people,

1064
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:35,790
you go to the Canadian,
the u s border,

1065
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:36,624
they get out of the car,
they look at the border because they 

1066
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,230
think the motors on the ground,
it isn't.

1067
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,873
It's in their head,
but they have it confused with actual 

1068
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:46,830
world,
so the group isn't in the same way.

1069
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:47,664
I mean the group is an intra psychic is 
something that has an interest psychic 

1070
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:52,554
incarnation and as part of the reason 
that this course is called socialites 

1071
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,103
got a terrible title.
It's called social identity and 

1072
00:58:58,531 --> 00:58:59,364
information processing because social 
identity plays a role in the way you 

1073
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,910
process information.
It's incarnated inside you,

1074
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:07,410
so to speak.
All right.

1075
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,273
Yeah,
because I've just been seeing him every 

1076
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:11,610
once in a while in this class.
It seems like we're confusing the arc to

1077
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:15,250
the archetypes with actual,
right,

1078
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:15,961
right.
Well,

1079
00:59:15,961 --> 00:59:17,880
and then not to know.
That may be the case as well.

1080
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,673
I guess part,
I guess maybe that emergency in part 

1081
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:24,080
people's natural tendency is to identify
them more,

1082
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:27,530
particularly with the group and to 
counter balance that.

1083
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,060
I guess I'm trying to put more stress on
this,

1084
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,770
this aspect and perhaps even someone on 
this,

1085
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,910
the
negative,

1086
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,610
the negative switched on.

1087
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,260
You've gotten both from above of young 
nuns are positive.

1088
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,063
Oh,
nice.

1089
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,840
That's a good problem.
Alright.

1090
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,830
Um,
positive.

1091
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,470
Right.
Thank you.

1092
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,410
Okay,
so let me read you this story.

1093
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:12,950
What I want you to do is to,
you maybe read it.

1094
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:14,623
What I want you to do is to think about 
it in terms of the categories that you 

1095
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:18,930
know,
because you should be able to figure out

1096
01:00:18,931 --> 01:00:19,880
what story means.
Now,

1097
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,560
the father of Prince Gautama,
the Buddha savior of the Orient,

1098
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,850
determined to protect his son from 
desperate knowledge and tragic awareness

1099
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:33,110
built for him and enclosed pavilion,
a walled garden of earthly delights.

1100
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:36,950
Walled Garden,
by the way,

1101
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,050
means paradise.

1102
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,070
Only the healthy,
the young and the happy.

1103
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,380
We're allowed access to this earthly 
fair.

1104
01:00:45,381 --> 01:00:46,214
That's all signs of decay and 
degeneration were kept hidden from the 

1105
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:53,880
prints.
Now you remember what,

1106
01:00:53,881 --> 01:00:57,650
what food,
his father had been visited by an oracle

1107
01:00:57,651 --> 01:00:58,484
and the Oracle told him that his son was
either going to grow up to be a great 

1108
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,040
religious leader or a leader of like an 
earthly leader,

1109
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,933
politician.
Basically his father wanted him to be a 

1110
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:07,874
politician,
so he was trying to keep him away from 

1111
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:13,130
anything that would lead them towards 
more spiritual concerns.

1112
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,203
So you could say in a sense go Thomas 
Farley wanted him to identify with the 

1113
01:01:17,211 --> 01:01:21,230
group,
which is perfectly reasonable.

1114
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,233
So he built this wall enclosure and 
inside it we're only things that were 

1115
01:01:27,111 --> 01:01:28,550
good.
Everything terrible.

1116
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,393
It was kept outside immersed in the 
immediate pleasures of the census in 

1117
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,330
physical law,
dance and music and beauty.

1118
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,253
Azure Gautama grew the maturity 
protected absolutely from the 

1119
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,000
limitations of portal being.
However,

1120
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:41,983
he grew up curious,
despite his father's most particular 

1121
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,990
attention and will and resolve to leave 
is seductive prison.

1122
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:53,320
He wanted to find out what was beyond.
So as far the main preparations to,

1123
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,930
I think this,
you know,

1124
01:01:56,931 --> 01:01:57,764
there was a,
this was a procedure that was often 

1125
01:02:00,741 --> 01:02:02,300
fault,
the fault in the Soviet Union,

1126
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,190
I think it was called a Potemkin 
village.

1127
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:05,660
You've heard him correctly,
is that right?

1128
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:06,533
Yeah.
So I'm from tech village was a village 

1129
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:09,800
that the Soviets would construct a full,
stupid,

1130
01:02:09,801 --> 01:02:12,350
gullible Westerners.
So the Soviets would say,

1131
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:13,213
we have a wonderful society come and 
looks that they construct this 

1132
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:16,520
beautiful,
whatever it happened to be,

1133
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:17,354
prison camp.
And the Westerners would come with him 

1134
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,900
and everyone would look at that and 
healthy and the western is,

1135
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:23,210
would go back home and say,
this will be,

1136
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,113
aren't so bad.

1137
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:25,740
Look at this model prison.
Anyways,

1138
01:02:25,741 --> 01:02:26,574
that was a Potemkin village and Thomas 
Farley as basically trying to do the 

1139
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:31,510
same thing here.
So he wants to get outside of the wall.

1140
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:32,344
So his father like whitewashed yourself 
all the shacks and gets the beggars and 

1141
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:39,600
everyone off the street and there's a 
little root carved out.

1142
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,640
And uh,
that's the first trip.

1143
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:47,030
So he covers his path with flowers and 
displays alongside the road,

1144
01:02:47,491 --> 01:02:48,324
the fairest women of the kingdom.
The print sets out with all of his 

1145
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:55,020
retinue in the shield and comfort of a 
chaperone,

1146
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:58,500
chariot and delights in the panorama 
prepared for him.

1147
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,510
So things fall outside world is not so 
bad.

1148
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:01,741
The gods,
however,

1149
01:03:01,741 --> 01:03:02,574
decided to disrupt these most carefully 
laid plans and sent an agent man to 

1150
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:07,194
hobble in full view alongside the road.
Prince as fascinated gaze fell upon the 

1151
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,490
ancient into local compelled by 
curiosity.

1152
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:18,330
He asked his attendant,
what is that creature stumbling,

1153
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:22,380
shabby bent and broken beside my revenue
and the attendant answer.

1154
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,620
That's a man like a man who was born in 
the infant became a child.

1155
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:27,750
Youth,
a husband,

1156
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,250
father,
father,

1157
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,084
fathers.
He's become old subject to destruction 

1158
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:35,310
of his beauty,
his well in the possibilities of life.

1159
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:39,390
Like other menu,
say hesitantly acquired the brands.

1160
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:44,580
That means this will happen to me and 
the attendant answer inevitably with the

1161
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:48,120
passage of time,
lots of piece of anomalous information.

1162
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,570
What happens,
it's like back to the walled city.

1163
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:54,023
The world collapsed in upon guitar and 
he has to be returned to the safety of 

1164
01:03:57,091 --> 01:03:57,924
home.
That's a story about creative 

1165
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:02,080
exploration and that's exactly how 
children offered.

1166
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:03,803
They use their parents as a stable base 
and the explore outside that base of 

1167
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:08,514
stability to the limits of their 
tolerance for anxiety and when that 

1168
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:12,324
cards is exceeded,
they go back to their parents and the 

1169
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:15,114
whole exploratory procedure,
which is in fact the procedure that 

1170
01:04:17,581 --> 01:04:18,414
leads to maturation is a constant 
interplay of moving out and coming back 

1171
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,860
and moving out and coming back.
Theoretically each move out,

1172
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:26,783
being slightly farther out as the child 
learns that he can in fact tolerate 

1173
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:31,703
exposure to the,
to the unknown world outside of the 

1174
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:34,764
family.

1175
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,373
So you got home as far the bills,
him a walled city and only good things 

1176
01:04:40,051 --> 01:04:40,884
are inside of it.
That's exactly what we do for our 

1177
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:43,260
children.
Fundamentally.

1178
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:47,460
I mean what you do if you have a child,
if you treat the child properly,

1179
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,140
is to protect it from all those forms of
anomalous information that it,

1180
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,093
that it cannot by any stroke of 
imagination deal with so you know the 

1181
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:03,840
for or even understand for that matter.
And there's all sorts of things that you

1182
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:07,680
don't discuss with children unless the 
necessity arises and it's absolutely,

1183
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,390
it's absolutely necessary and that's 
what it means to take care of them.

1184
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:13,950
Fundamentally.
By the same token,

1185
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,784
you don't shield them from those things 
that they are capable of actually 

1186
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:22,110
conquering anyways,
he's back home in time.

1187
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,374
His anxiety lessens,
his curiosity grows and the adventures 

1188
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:27,424
outside again because time to go,
it's sent a sick man to view this 

1189
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:31,570
creature.

1190
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:34,870
He asked his attended shaking and palsy,
horribly afflicted,

1191
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:38,350
unbearable to behold,
a source of pity and contempt.

1192
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:39,213
What is he and the attendant answered 
that is a man like other men who was 

1193
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:45,430
born hold but who became ill and sick,
unable to cope,

1194
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:49,990
a burden to himself and others suffering
and incurable like other men,

1195
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:50,824
you say acquire the prints.
This could happen to me and the 

1196
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:53,794
attendant answer,
no man is exempt from the ravages of 

1197
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:56,680
disease.
You see,

1198
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:57,514
this is a story about the development of
self consciousness because what Gautama 

1199
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:01,924
has discovery are aspects that he 
encounters in the external world that 

1200
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:08,404
are actually also characteristic of him.
So it's a consequence of being immersed 

1201
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:13,414
in society.
He sees that it is possible for people 

1202
01:06:15,491 --> 01:06:18,340
to die knowing that he is in fact 
person.

1203
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,323
The inference is pretty easy to draw 
that that changes the structure of the 

1204
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:23,350
world substantially.

1205
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,170
So now he knows that he get died and now
you can become sick.

1206
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,690
So back to back to the castle once 
again.

1207
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:30,881
This time,
however,

1208
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:31,714
it doesn't work so well because he's not
so happy with the things that used to 

1209
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:36,550
make him happy.
So he goes out a third time.

1210
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,160
This time,
the godsend.

1211
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,150
Send a dead man in the funeral 
procession.

1212
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,783
This creature,
he asked his attendant laying so still 

1213
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:46,890
appearing so fierce.
I'm surrounded by grief and sorrow lost.

1214
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,630
And for Lauren,
what is the intended answer?

1215
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,660
That's a man like other men,
born of woman I loved and hated.

1216
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:56,940
Who once was unl.
Is there like other men you say inquired

1217
01:06:56,941 --> 01:06:59,440
the prints,
then this could happen to me.

1218
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:02,350
This is your ends and the attendant and 
the end of all,

1219
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,184
man,
the world collapsed the final time and 

1220
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:06,820
get time.
I asked to be returned home,

1221
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,540
but the attendant had orders from the 
princess father and took them instead to

1222
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,540
a festival of women who concurring 
nearby and Grove in the woods.

1223
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:15,003
Prince was met by beautiful assemblage 
who offered themselves freely to him 

1224
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:19,294
without restraints,
song and dancing play in the spirit of 

1225
01:07:21,941 --> 01:07:22,774
central love.
Good time I could think of when we have 

1226
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:25,294
death and the inevitable decomposition 
of beauty to feel pleasure in the 

1227
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:30,400
display.
So for him,

1228
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:34,840
the consequences of the emergence of 
self consciousness for the contamination

1229
01:07:34,841 --> 01:07:37,180
of all good things with the possibility 
of death.

1230
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,343
That's a funny story because it's a 
descent from paradise right when he 

1231
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:44,620
falls out of the protected city and 
that's a catastrophe.

1232
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:49,630
But it's also a precondition to his 
eventual regeneration as the Buddha.

1233
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,583
So you know,
that story is the story that we've been 

1234
01:07:52,271 --> 01:07:55,120
talking about over and over,
which is

1235
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,633
this story.

1236
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:14,190
So this is the wall of the city
and outside of the walled city,

1237
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:15,524
and there's but chaos.
And if a piece of the Nautilus 

1238
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:25,160
information
knocks down your structure,

1239
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,100
then you end up in a place that's 
defined by chaos,

1240
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:32,150
which of course appears to be a complete
catastrophe to you because your emotions

1241
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:35,510
are dysregulated and there's nothing 
left but anxiety and depression.

1242
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:38,000
But it's also the case that this 
descent,

1243
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:40,580
which in,
in these stories,

1244
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:42,110
it's,
it's absolutely inevitable.

1245
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,944
This is so,
it's very interesting because the 

1246
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:46,070
concept of original sin isn't explicit 
in Buddhism,

1247
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:46,904
but it's very much explicit in that 
story because the reason that Buddha 

1248
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:52,430
goes outside of the walls,
because he's curious like,

1249
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,780
hey,
he's happy.

1250
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,850
Everything's going real well.
So you might think,

1251
01:08:55,851 --> 01:08:56,271
well,
you know,

1252
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:57,104
why spoil a good thing.
But the point is he does for the good 

1253
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:00,440
things,
like it's not good enough.

1254
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:02,850
What's outside the wall?
Awesome.

1255
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:05,390
And so it goes and looks and the 
consequences are,

1256
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:07,220
it's like that's the end of the paradise
foy.

1257
01:09:07,221 --> 01:09:08,460
And you're not going to get back.
He's,

1258
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,280
you're not going to go back to the same 
place to get it.

1259
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:11,660
It's gone.
Well,

1260
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:13,850
that's,
that's exactly the same idea as original

1261
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:17,240
sin in Christianity as Adam's Adam and 
Eve's sin,

1262
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:18,074
right?
They take the apple as the forbidden 

1263
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:21,920
thing that makes themselves conscious.
It makes them,

1264
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,110
makes them aware of their own death,
makes them aware of their own nakedness,

1265
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,750
makes it necessary for them to work and 
tosses the amount of paradise,

1266
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:31,460
curiosity,
original suit,

1267
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,550
miscarriage.
That's what it is.

1268
01:09:33,551 --> 01:09:34,201
And it,
while,

1269
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:35,990
and it's a funny thing because it's 
also,

1270
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:38,870
well,
it's also the auto fill.

1271
01:09:38,910 --> 01:09:40,730
That's an original sentence.
Also,

1272
01:09:40,731 --> 01:09:42,320
the precondition for,
uh,

1273
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,180
for the whole redemptive story because 
although this was paradise,

1274
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:52,181
so to speak,
this place is on a higher order of being

1275
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:54,960
than this place was,
I guess at that.

1276
01:09:54,970 --> 01:09:55,803
I think that's because here,
the paradise that precedes the original 

1277
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,090
descendants characterized by complete 
lack of consciousness.

1278
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,163
There's no consciousness there.
And the paradise that re emerges as a 

1279
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:07,544
consequence of this whole story is one 
in which self consciousness exists and 

1280
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:13,010
his whole,
so it's,

1281
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:19,120
well I think personally I think that's
partly because here's one reason

1282
01:10:23,330 --> 01:10:24,163
in a sense,
this pretty conscious paradise is 

1283
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:28,910
nothing.
It's paradise because it's nothing,

1284
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:31,970
which means there's no suffering there,
but there's nothing else either.

1285
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:35,390
And here at least there's actually the 
world,

1286
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,010
but it's the war.
So there is a world,

1287
01:10:37,011 --> 01:10:40,130
there's the possibility for suffering,
but it also represents a sort of mode of

1288
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:45,131
being where there can be a world and 
simultaneously people can live in it.

1289
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,183
It's just the question that gets that 
everyone's always trying to figure out 

1290
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,833
how is it that there can be a world and 
that it can be tolerable at the same 

1291
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:53,984
time.

1292
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,333
So because isn't it also that story 
because that's simply what those 

1293
01:10:58,491 --> 01:10:59,610
happened.
Everything.

1294
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,090
It's an explanation.
Well,

1295
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,733
I mean how did we get,
we can't be were originally simply by 

1296
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:06,930
watching what does happen.
Right.

1297
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:08,323
Well the other thing about this story 
too is that it's the story of 

1298
01:11:10,011 --> 01:11:12,890
maturation.
Like you can think of it as it's,

1299
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:16,320
it is theoretically a description of 
what happened at the dawn of time,

1300
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:17,154
so to speak.
And in a sense that's accurate in a 

1301
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:19,644
sense because there wasn't time back.
Who knows how long ago when we weren't 

1302
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:25,014
self conscious.
And this is something that's emerged as 

1303
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:28,280
a consequence of,
of you know,

1304
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:29,123
who knows what processes and it seemed 
to emerge very quickly if you assume 

1305
01:11:32,411 --> 01:11:33,244
that the development of self 
consciousness is related in some way to 

1306
01:11:35,311 --> 01:11:36,144
the expansion of the Cortex,
which seems to be pretty reasonable 

1307
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:38,844
hypothesis.

1308
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:43,970
The human cortex expanded unbelievably 
quickly from the evolutionary viewpoint.

1309
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:48,480
So our development of self consciousness
was that historical event.

1310
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,733
I wouldn't say the business,
an accurate description of historical 

1311
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:54,180
event is,
it's not really trying to be that.

1312
01:11:54,181 --> 01:11:57,690
It's trying to describe the meaning of a
series of processes,

1313
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,230
but more importantly also it's a story 
of what necessarily,

1314
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:03,750
how it was when you mature.
Because the thing,

1315
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:04,521
like when you're,
you're,

1316
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:06,510
you're say you're very young,
two years old,

1317
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:09,750
your mother does protect you.
I mean it is literally the case that she

1318
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:12,510
shields you from your vulnerability.
It's right here.

1319
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:13,653
You have a screwdriver and you're 
heading towards the electrical outlet 

1320
01:12:15,341 --> 01:12:16,290
and your mother says,
well,

1321
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,730
no,
you know there's a wall,

1322
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:18,593
there's a wall there.
She tries to make sure that you don't 

1323
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:23,640
fall down the stairs or at least that 
they're soft if you do and the old stick

1324
01:12:23,641 --> 01:12:25,320
your hand on the oven and so on and so 
forth.

1325
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,153
She's always there as an intermediary 
and that's a form of paradise and you 

1326
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:29,401
say,
well,

1327
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:32,970
what drives you beyond that paradise 
lost your curiosity.

1328
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:35,790
As you mature,
you get,

1329
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,630
you develop a larger and larger 
repertoire of behaviors,

1330
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,680
more and more interest in what's going 
on and outside world who finally you get

1331
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:48,450
to the point where the things you know 
because of your own curiosity because of

1332
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:52,530
your own exploratory activity are so 
complex that your mother and father,

1333
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,470
they can't protect you anymore.
It's like you're outside the walls.

1334
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:57,450
That's it.
If you try to go back,

1335
01:12:57,451 --> 01:12:58,800
it just means you're sick.
That's all.

1336
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:00,180
I mean it's not a solution.
It's,

1337
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:02,490
it's really going to solution.
We'll just make things worse.

1338
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,330
So this is this story,
which is a mythological story is a story

1339
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,260
that characterizes everyone.
That's,

1340
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,110
that's why you know,
it's not such a very,

1341
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:11,003
not very logical idea too,
to make light of a notion like original 

1342
01:13:13,651 --> 01:13:14,250
sin.

1343
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,310
So you figure out what,
what is it a heritable

1344
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,060
heritable characteristics kind of 
humanity.

1345
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,550
It's fair enough,
far as I can tell,

1346
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,870
especially if you look at the 
consequences once you're self conscious,

1347
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,850
you know,
it's very easy to view the world.

1348
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:31,600
There's an unfair place and we can look 
at it.

1349
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,600
It looks like a pretty ain't fair place 
and think about it.

1350
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,673
And it is the case that you know,
your tooling along doing just fine and 

1351
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:38,950
acting appropriately as far as your 
concern.

1352
01:13:38,951 --> 01:13:42,150
And it's like one day bang of cancer,
something equally horrible.

1353
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,340
It doesn't seem to be any justice in 
that at all.

1354
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:47,820
It's not very difficult to turn an 
animal into something that's aggressive.

1355
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:49,200
Oh,
you have to do is punish it.

1356
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:53,790
Unpredictable and unjustly.
What does that mean?

1357
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,973
Well,
it means that the animal can't figure 

1358
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,340
out how to avoid the punishment and also
that the punishment,

1359
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,990
well that's the primary aspect of it.

1360
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,180
As far as the animals concern and we're 
in that position all the time.

1361
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:04,890
It's like terrible things happened to 
us.

1362
01:14:05,050 --> 01:14:05,883
That seems completely independent of our
particular behavioral patterns and 

1363
01:14:09,300 --> 01:14:11,350
that's one of the things that turns 
people against the world.

1364
01:14:12,330 --> 01:14:16,970
But that's what makes me,
right.

1365
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:17,973
Absolutely.
That's in fact in an earlier version of 

1366
01:14:20,591 --> 01:14:21,424
this manuscript,
in this chapter I had a sexual and 

1367
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:27,490
learned helplessness because it is the 
case that if you punish an animal and it

1368
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:29,330
can escape,
but what happens to them

1369
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,683
also get aggressive?
Well Gretchen is one of the things that 

1370
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:36,670
might happen along the way.
I handle the circumstances.

1371
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,160
For example,
like if you take an animal and you shock

1372
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:40,330
it,
it's in a cage.

1373
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,990
Well it Kevin you get aggressive cause 
there's nothing to get aggressive about.

1374
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,810
Like,
like let's say you take out,

1375
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:48,370
take a wrap,
Nelson,

1376
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,790
his cage and any shocked the wrath 
killed him ups.

1377
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:53,163
So to some degree the effects of 
punishment or a situation dependent and 

1378
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,124
punishment does do two things.
It's an unconditioned stimuli for 

1379
01:14:59,471 --> 01:15:03,850
aggression and it's also conditioned 
stimuli for for extinction of behavior,

1380
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,220
which she has learned helplessness.
So there's these two pathways to,

1381
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:09,940
and it's almost the case.
Like you

1382
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,810
say,
it's a thought experiment.

1383
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,030
There's a cat here and you chase around 
with a stick.

1384
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,130
Any corner,
any neck if you're an you poke it with a

1385
01:15:19,131 --> 01:15:21,160
stick was going to hiss,
hiss and fight.

1386
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:22,173
But if you keep doing it sooner or later
the aggressive response has been 

1387
01:15:24,151 --> 01:15:28,570
extinguished and it'll just pass bath is
to lay there and take the punishment.

1388
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,230
That a thing of the thing that's funny 
about your example,

1389
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:33,970
we are in that situation,
sorry,

1390
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,373
the learn like our conditions of 
existence are very much and now it gets 

1391
01:15:38,651 --> 01:15:39,484
to those experiments that psychologists 
and conduct that produced learned 

1392
01:15:41,771 --> 01:15:42,604
helplessness.
We are close to at least some subjected 

1393
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:48,160
to um,
unpredictable.

1394
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,920
Our problem is we have to learn how to 
deal with it nonetheless.

1395
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:54,953
Yes.
Part of what we're trying to just 

1396
01:15:55,770 --> 01:15:59,290
discover in these messages.
Is there a possible way of doing that?

1397
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,440
Also while admitting to the fact that it
is the case,

1398
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:04,870
because one way of doing it is just to 
deny it,

1399
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:10,930
deny the fact that terrible things out 
fafsa and the recent social psychology,

1400
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:11,823
psychological literature,
there's a whole body of studies that 

1401
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:15,580
suggest that that's the best way to do 
it.

1402
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:17,190
That's right.
Has themself allusions.

1403
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,033
Um,
I know it's only all these things that 

1404
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:22,664
happened to one or only
one thinks that there's some reason 

1405
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:31,550
they're not,
and then it wasn't there.

1406
01:16:31,551 --> 01:16:32,384
I missed the trend.
Is that a punishment because it's a 

1407
01:16:34,371 --> 01:16:37,010
negative experience or it just happened 
that I missed the train?

1408
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,530
It's not anything can do well.
Huh?

1409
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,870
See,
yeah,

1410
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,413
I see what you mean.
I think the inference that we generally 

1411
01:16:47,471 --> 01:16:50,410
drive that regardless of whether there's
a will behind it,

1412
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:53,800
it's arbitrary and unfair.
I mean the training things slightly,

1413
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:55,830
it's me,
it's too minimal to make a case out.

1414
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:58,390
But I mean,
if someone close to you and develops,

1415
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,313
like say someone that's close to you,
that's also universally recognized as 

1416
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:03,334
good,
develop some absolutely atrocious 

1417
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:06,034
disease,
which happens with a fair amount of 

1418
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,164
frequent frequency under conditions.
It's very difficult not to draw the 

1419
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:15,530
inference that despite the lack of will 
behind the disease,

1420
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:19,400
it's evident that the world as it's 
constituted is a very unfair place.

1421
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:21,203
It because it certainly those sorts of 
things would run contrary to all our 

1422
01:17:23,481 --> 01:17:25,190
notions of what constitutes fair.

1423
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,810
Do you have an expectation that the 
world is at their place?

1424
01:17:27,811 --> 01:17:31,370
That's how you define it as unfair or do
you think that,

1425
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:35,370
I mean,
it seems to me,

1426
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:37,900
nevermind.
No,

1427
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:38,753
that's what,
go ahead.

1428
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,880
Well,
seems to me that

1429
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,593
until the current age where everyone 
fairly well accepts the whole idea of 

1430
01:17:50,131 --> 01:17:51,460
evolution.
Yeah.

1431
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:52,983
When there's no real reason,
there's no meaning for us to be the 

1432
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,353
types of creatures that we are.
It just sort of happened before that I 

1433
01:18:00,271 --> 01:18:01,104
think philosophers strove very hard to 
find the meaning to explore why it was 

1434
01:18:04,381 --> 01:18:05,214
the way it was.
Yes.

1435
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,080
Um,
in,

1436
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,510
in that sense that there was an 
expectation that the,

1437
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:12,900
the,
the world should be just right.

1438
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,790
There's no reason for it not to be 
unless,

1439
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,350
unless there's,
if it's not just,

1440
01:18:16,351 --> 01:18:19,760
there must be a reason it was worth 
uninsured now that,

1441
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:24,230
okay.
I guess I would say that I see the logic

1442
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:26,930
in your argument.
I guess what I'm trying to figure out is

1443
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:27,764
that you like is it possible,
is it possible for us to exist in any 

1444
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:32,414
sane manner?
Which I would say saying being in part 

1445
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:36,993
not in adopting authoritarian 
identification with groups and civil 

1446
01:18:40,311 --> 01:18:41,144
tediously pa be able to accurately after
him the fact that the fundamental 

1447
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,630
structure of the world is falling,
neither fair nor I'm fair,

1448
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:50,030
but at least it appears to us under many
circumstances.

1449
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:53,570
It's very unfair.
And the answer that seems to be no,

1450
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,433
I think all right,
is that people who are faced with that 

1451
01:18:56,961 --> 01:18:57,794
sort of choice frequently take a route 
out of the problem that actually makes 

1452
01:19:02,091 --> 01:19:04,340
it worse over time.
For example,

1453
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:05,350
they'll adopt,
uh,

1454
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,263
in an authoritarian stance as a means of
protecting themselves against types of 

1455
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:10,370
information.

1456
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:11,203
They kept tolerant.
So I guess part of what I'm trying to 

1457
01:19:13,701 --> 01:19:16,630
find out is there,
is there a story that makes sense out of

1458
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,230
things that we necessarily perceive as 
unfair one?

1459
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,650
And that's kind of one of the things 
we'll try to discuss it over the rest of

1460
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:28,100
the course.
So I'm just saying what are like I want,

1461
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:31,120
I'm trying to do today is line some of 
the consequences of did this.

1462
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,653
I think people do have a implicit idea 
that the world is fair because the part 

1463
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,830
they're given that when they're brought 
up,

1464
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:40,664
when their kids,
that's one of the things he tried to do 

1465
01:19:42,951 --> 01:19:44,380
with the child's environment.
Sorry,

1466
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,223
do you make sure the rewards and the 
punishments are distributed in an 

1467
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:48,194
equitable and predictable manner and not
towards the twos justice in large part 

1468
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,980
and one of the things the child 
discovers and it's necessary to do that.

1469
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:55,814
The child would just completely like,
we'll be in developed by chaos and 

1470
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:03,410
terrible things will happen.
It's necessary to do that.

1471
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:04,573
But if you do do that,
then when the child goes out into the 

1472
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:08,090
world,
he will discover,

1473
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:08,973
she will discover in short order that 
there are all sorts of things that have 

1474
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:15,740
that don't fit into that framework even 
though the framework that has this.

1475
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,400
So I would say that that is our natural 
response is like this is unfair.

1476
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:21,503
And that's,
I think that's part of the reason why 

1477
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,573
tragic things,
especially those things that appear 

1478
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:30,480
possibly unnecessary.
Like say someone that say something that

1479
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:32,470
you're very close to is brutally 
murdered,

1480
01:20:32,471 --> 01:20:33,304
sort,
sort of on a whim by something halfway 

1481
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:35,353
did psychopath.
I mean that's the sort of thing that's 

1482
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,590
not only seems incredibly tragic but 
also completely pointless.

1483
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:41,753
It is those sorts of things that really 
undermine our ability to believe that 

1484
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,320
our existence is have any meaning at 
all.

1485
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,640
And then distance is predictable.
I'm not people in their hands very close

1486
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,510
to uh,
develops cancer.

1487
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:59,340
Saying the attribution could be that 
this is unfair,

1488
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,430
but what you're really saying is that it
was unpredictable.

1489
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:03,264
There's no way.
Well that's one aspect that would be 

1490
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:07,590
unfair attribution.
It's unpredictable.

1491
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:10,240
Plus,
I think it's also an unjust judge.

1492
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,740
Yeah.

1493
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:14,030
But if you're just not intelligent 
enough,

1494
01:21:14,031 --> 01:21:15,540
you don't add that up.
It's not true.

1495
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,310
If you don't have what,
you don't have.

1496
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:20,010
The fact that it's adjustable because I 
don't know if you do,

1497
01:21:20,011 --> 01:21:23,640
like what do you think?
You might say it's not logical to do so,

1498
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:26,160
but I would say that if it happens to 
you you will do it.

1499
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:26,971
Yes,
I agree with it.

1500
01:21:26,971 --> 01:21:28,720
That is generally the way we work,
but I don't think that,

1501
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,500
I don't think that's across the board 
the case.

1502
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:32,221
And I think,
I think,

1503
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,620
I don't see why you couldn't,
why you can't get beyond that.

1504
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:35,963
What I really wanted to say that was 
something that you said about when you 

1505
01:21:37,381 --> 01:21:41,640
were saying that children that you teach
children that the world is fair,

1506
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:43,463
but it seems to me that that's often not
the case because I think chil children 

1507
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:50,640
often use that as,
as their complaint.

1508
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,510
That's not fair.
You know,

1509
01:21:51,570 --> 01:21:52,403
is not fair.
And one of the things that I've always 

1510
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:57,210
heard parents say to kids as well,
well life isn't fair.

1511
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:02,010
You know,
one of you say that to a child,

1512
01:22:02,020 --> 01:22:04,140
you're not actually communicating any 
information.

1513
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:05,243
You'll just rationalizing the present 
situation because of the truth of the 

1514
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,424
matter is,
is that if you set up a stable 

1515
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:11,850
environment,
everything you've done has led the child

1516
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:13,770
to believe that in fact,
the world is fair,

1517
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:16,530
which means it is predictable and it's 
just,

1518
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:19,680
but I do think that maybe you're just 
exposing them to that you're exposing it

1519
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:21,450
to them slowly,
like in the small thing,

1520
01:22:21,451 --> 01:22:22,540
like you can't have the ice cream 
because,

1521
01:22:22,630 --> 01:22:23,463
well,
I do think that's what you're doing 

1522
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,850
eventually.
Maybe they will learn that life.

1523
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,310
Why shouldn't they learn eventually that
life isn't fair?

1524
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,400
But the question is,
once they learned that life isn't fair,

1525
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,450
what do they do?

1526
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,810
Let's this fear.
Let's see the unabomber for an example,

1527
01:22:36,811 --> 01:22:38,610
because I know,
I know what I think.

1528
01:22:38,611 --> 01:22:39,444
I know what he's like.
He's someone who thinks that the world 

1529
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:43,643
fundamentally is an unfair place,
and then it's his moral obligation to 

1530
01:22:46,831 --> 01:22:47,664
take revenge against it.
Now he's picked certain aspects of the 

1531
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,680
world to take revenge against.
But his,

1532
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:53,643
like in his self consciousness,
he construes himself not only as a 

1533
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,084
victim of unfair then just forced us,
but as the kind of victim and who has 

1534
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:01,734
the right to cast judgment on is 
victimization and to take action in a 

1535
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,330
vengeful action essentially.
So look,

1536
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:09,370
where does he live in a cabin in 
Montana?

1537
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:10,690
Why is that?
Well,

1538
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:11,524
I'll tell you,
it's so that he won't get contaminated 

1539
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:15,790
by the rest of the human race,
that's for sure.

1540
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:16,624
So he might've been rejected,
but he's sitting there thinking like in 

1541
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:23,920
the back of his dark and stormy and 
little brain that that,

1542
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,240
that half
the human race is fundamentally evil and

1543
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:34,000
the only appropriate thing to do is to 
detach yourself from it.

1544
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,530
And there's also an,
a tremendous amount of volume,

1545
01:23:36,531 --> 01:23:39,400
the scn posturing and arrogance at the 
back of that,

1546
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:43,360
which is why he could spend all this 
time constructing bombs and sending them

1547
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:44,194
off to more or less random targets that 
he inappropriately identifies with the 

1548
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:51,910
natural methological categories that 
make up this thinking.

1549
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:53,780
You know?
So he's mad at university.

1550
01:23:53,781 --> 01:23:56,030
So we bombs individual professors.
I mean,

1551
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:56,864
you know,
this is,

1552
01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,190
this is not,
this is not inappropriate.

1553
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:01,623
So the question is,
if you construe the world he has an 

1554
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:07,210
unfair place,
what did you do?

1555
01:24:07,780 --> 01:24:08,890
Well,
I would say one of their,

1556
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:11,350
I mean we can either change your action 
or you can change your thinking.

1557
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:14,020
Have an alternative.
Yeah,

1558
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,120
but you need an alternative that you can
believe.

1559
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,400
You can't just,
you can't just say,

1560
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,960
hey look,
this is a problem.

1561
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:20,853
I mean,
the,

1562
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:24,310
the problems that self consciousness 
pose,

1563
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,720
it's an emergent problem.

1564
01:24:25,990 --> 01:24:28,840
Let's say it's only a problem that's 
been around for a million years.

1565
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,690
It's nobody's figured out what to do 
about like,

1566
01:24:31,691 --> 01:24:34,240
because as soon as you become self 
conscious,

1567
01:24:34,780 --> 01:24:37,480
it appears that the world is an 
arbitrary and unfair place.

1568
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:38,723
Then the question is,
if the world is an arbitrary and unfair 

1569
01:24:41,231 --> 01:24:43,330
place,
how should you respond to them?

1570
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:48,100
Now an animal subjected to evidence that
suggests that the world is arbitrary and

1571
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:50,290
unfair develops,
learned helplessness,

1572
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:51,473
just depression.
Now lots of people develop that like 

1573
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,250
they quit.
It was because why bother?

1574
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,600
Which is a really potent argument.
Why bother if such and such is likely to

1575
01:25:01,601 --> 01:25:03,430
happen to you,
which it undoubtedly is.

1576
01:25:03,670 --> 01:25:04,990
Why do anything?
Well,

1577
01:25:04,991 --> 01:25:05,824
that's that.
Lots of people don't accept that our to 

1578
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:09,880
because they never think about it or 
whatever.

1579
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,640
For whatever reasons they're protected 
from that line of logic.

1580
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,370
But another line of logic is,
well,

1581
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,560
let's take some revenge against the 
world.

1582
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,913
That's a potent line of logic as well.
Group girth that for goods and for 

1583
01:25:22,331 --> 01:25:23,164
example,
his,

1584
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,123
his notion of the,
of the fundamental philosophy of 

1585
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:31,720
Mephistopheles,
who's the,

1586
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:33,593
you know,
literary incarnation of the negative 

1587
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:36,660
aspect of the archetypal individuals 
west.

1588
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:37,983
This is memphis off these credo.
The world is such a horrible place 

1589
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:43,054
intrinsically,
but the best thing you can do for it is 

1590
01:25:45,551 --> 01:25:48,280
to work for its eradication.
Hey,

1591
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:50,770
lots of people except that line of 
argumentation.

1592
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:52,031
I mean you say,
well,

1593
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:52,864
why?
Like why did the Nazis killed 6 million 

1594
01:25:54,041 --> 01:25:55,150
Jews?
Well,

1595
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:56,823
it's hard to say exactly why,
but I suspect that at the bottom of the 

1596
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:04,100
individual psyches that participated in 
that sort of act was the notion that,

1597
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:05,473
you know,
after all the world isn't relatively 

1598
01:26:06,471 --> 01:26:07,304
harsh an unfair place and it might not 
be so bad to take a little bit of 

1599
01:26:09,651 --> 01:26:10,490
revenge against it.

1600
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:13,320
It's like balancing that,
you know,

1601
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:14,233
it's done.
The world has done a lot of terrible 

1602
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:18,410
things to me.
It's like what's your attitude to that?

1603
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:19,543
Revenge is one.
It's like all she'll do those all show 

1604
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:25,080
those whatever the hem to be.
I'll show those jeeps,

1605
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:29,780
whoever you pick as your target for 
having inappropriate be persecuted you.

1606
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,461
So,
and I,

1607
01:26:31,461 --> 01:26:32,294
I,
what I'm trying to do is to get at the 

1608
01:26:32,931 --> 01:26:35,690
bottom of that.
So why would people be like that?

1609
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,193
I think it has something to do.
The necessary consequences of self 

1610
01:26:40,481 --> 01:26:42,800
consciousness as soon as your self 
conscious.

1611
01:26:42,801 --> 01:26:44,870
Well,
the genesis story says it quite clearly.

1612
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,183
What happens when you cover yourself up 
because you're ashamed and why are you 

1613
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:51,710
ashamed?
Because you know you're naked.

1614
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,650
But what does that mean?
It means that you can view yourself as a

1615
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:57,110
somewhat vulnerable pink thing.
That really could be

1616
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,250
who's also subject to all sorts of 
social pressures,

1617
01:27:01,251 --> 01:27:02,084
many of which are negative,
who needs a substantial amount of 

1618
01:27:04,071 --> 01:27:06,980
protection just to ensure survival 
continued from day to day.

1619
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,800
Give an even that that survival is a 
doubtful,

1620
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,460
is doubtful in the long run.
That's the basis of shame.

1621
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,490
The other thing that happens in the 
genesis story is as soon as Adam and eve

1622
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:17,450
discovery,
they're naked,

1623
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,600
God comes walking through the garden and
they're hiding.

1624
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:22,663
Why would,
this is a strange bit of the story is 

1625
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:26,030
why would you hide one?
A few things,

1626
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:29,190
say maybe you could look at it this way 
then

1627
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:34,190
from the mythological perspective,
God's voice,

1628
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,233
so to speak,
is the thing that calls you to do your 

1629
01:27:38,421 --> 01:27:41,630
basket to perform to the maximum of your
ability,

1630
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:44,750
and why wouldn't you do that?
Why would you hide from that?

1631
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,870
And the truth of the matter of reasons 
that we all hide from that.

1632
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,093
Because what we recognize most 
profoundly about ourselves as our 

1633
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:52,004
inadequacies and those inadequacies make
it impossible for us to believe that we 

1634
01:27:55,581 --> 01:27:57,500
could do our master that would even be 
worth doing.

1635
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,730
And that's what the story about hiding.
And certainly the case that we do that.

1636
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,070
So what happens if you hide from the 
best in you?

1637
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,860
Well,
we know if that's the archetypal hero,

1638
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:08,293
you hide from that,
then you have no defense at all against 

1639
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:10,694
chaos because that is the defense.
Abandoned that because you're afraid 

1640
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:16,543
what's left.
The only thing that's left is the 

1641
01:28:17,631 --> 01:28:21,320
protection of the group.
So if you abandon what's best in you,

1642
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:23,780
the only thing you can do is become 
authoritarian.

1643
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:26,330
As soon as you do that,
while lots of things happen.

1644
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:27,613
So you have to have the group that,
because if it disappears your gap 

1645
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:32,053
because there's nothing left of you.
Plus anyone that's out there that 

1646
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:37,220
reminds you of what you might've been 
you hate.

1647
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,453
Wow.
So then you have a good reason for 

1648
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:42,930
rubbing them out.
What's the job's doing through this?

1649
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:45,640
Isn't this what Joe,
the book of job is been?

1650
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:50,930
Well you don't view that book as a sort 
of a narrative precursor to the story of

1651
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:54,350
a Christian redemption.
So he said it was like the whole,

1652
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,213
the whole Bible basically tells a 
redemption story and that one of the 

1653
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:02,550
things that the story of job 
necessitated was the emergence of a full

1654
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:05,940
blown hero myth.
That's why fry says for example,

1655
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:08,940
that the idea of Christ is embedded in 
the old testament.

1656
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:10,193
It's implicit in there,
which is to say that the Old Testament 

1657
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:13,284
is a story that cries out for a hero and
that's also why there are notions of 

1658
01:29:17,941 --> 01:29:19,050
prophecy.
For example,

1659
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:21,780
saying this person,
the millennium is going to arrive,

1660
01:29:21,781 --> 01:29:24,000
which is to say where we are in a 
position,

1661
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:28,230
which is this position that calls for 
the,

1662
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,170
we know the story,
we have to be here.

1663
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:32,004
The rest of the story is the arrival of 
something that will move us out of 

1664
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:35,124
there.
It's like these are all people that are 

1665
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:38,430
caught in the belly of the beast.
For example.

1666
01:29:38,431 --> 01:29:41,670
They're waiting for the hero to go down 
into the belly and freedom.

1667
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,710
So it's such a kind of unsatisfying 
story.

1668
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,570
The job's story.
Right,

1669
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:49,710
right.
Makes perfect sense.

1670
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,700
Right?
Yeah.

1671
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:55,701
Well that's a chunk of on,
why is Joe Joe his story?

1672
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:04,080
Well,
cause he never learned what to do.

1673
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,440
That's right.
The arbitrary nature has this big speech

1674
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:13,470
about how wonderful wisdom and isn't how
God created the world.

1675
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,304
And since he created it,
he has the intimate knowledge of how 

1676
01:30:15,721 --> 01:30:16,554
everything works and to wisdom.
And then God comes in a world when 

1677
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,900
instead it's like I'm God European on 
suck it up.

1678
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,090
You're right.
I'm sorry.

1679
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,010
And then he gets all this stuff he ever 
lost.

1680
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,720
What would you rather suck it up or 
figure out what to do for yourself?

1681
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,120
Well,
there's nothing you can do.

1682
01:30:30,121 --> 01:30:31,130
It was it like,
oh completely.

1683
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:31,973
But that's not the message.
The message of Christ is that there is 

1684
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:35,840
something that you can do.
But this was

1685
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:39,360
the message of Christ and the story of 
Joe,

1686
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,553
the whole like,
look at what job's like predicated on 

1687
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:43,850
like Gods and God and Satan there.

1688
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:49,260
Which is kind of an interesting thing.
Like,

1689
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:51,033
okay,
sure.

1690
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,270
Anyways.
Well there,

1691
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,320
there,
there is a book,

1692
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:58,260
there's a book that was written 
specifically to address this problem,

1693
01:30:58,261 --> 01:31:01,310
which is answered to Joe.
I assume stealing spoke it.

1694
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,353
Him.
Yeah.

1695
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,283
Describes this issue particularly,
but we also want to make sure that we 

1696
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,600
can distinguish g,
uh,

1697
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:12,000
or that we put the story of job sort of 
on a broader perspective,

1698
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:12,834
which is the story of someone who's 
desperate fundamentally for very good 

1699
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:15,984
reasons.
And the thing about desperation in 

1700
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:21,150
general is that it calls out for a 
solution.

1701
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,190
That's all.
That's all off.

1702
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,233
The only appointment I was making is 
that the story of job is the story of 

1703
01:31:25,681 --> 01:31:29,040
someone who's in as desperate as 
circumstances as can be imagined.

1704
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:30,720
And that's how the story is structured,
right?

1705
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:31,563
I mean,
it doesn't get us and he doesn't get 

1706
01:31:33,410 --> 01:31:36,720
solution.
It's a solution,

1707
01:31:36,721 --> 01:31:40,350
but it's not the best solution or one 
they appeal to our sense of fairness.

1708
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,680
That's exactly the issue though.
That's exactly this problem.

1709
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:47,010
That's what makes it on satisfactory.
That's exactly the issue.

1710
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,840
We demand.
Fairness exists,

1711
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,580
right?
That's what we do to map that.

1712
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,303
No,
we don't.

1713
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,460
No we don't.
Because as soon as you get past that,

1714
01:31:56,461 --> 01:31:58,950
then you're like,
let's say we'll abandon fairness as a,

1715
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:00,130
well,
you better

1716
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,460
watch out for me then well then if you 
look at it from God's point of view,

1717
01:32:03,461 --> 01:32:04,294
it was fair because God is God and you 
can do whatever he wants and there 

1718
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:07,174
wasn't preexistent bet,
which it's very hard for us to separate 

1719
01:32:11,601 --> 01:32:13,800
them.
And that's what religion is for.

1720
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:16,390
You have to have faith.
There's some greater like plan out there

1721
01:32:16,391 --> 01:32:19,810
that we can only see a small snippet up 
so we can't possibly understand so well.

1722
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,673
Well
let's just consider for a moment that 

1723
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:27,154
some of the fundamental interpretations 
of these things are culturally bound by 

1724
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:35,971
the Christian tradition that they're 
necessarily universal questions are,

1725
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,823
yes,
yes.

1726
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:39,670
Well this is,
this is a problem,

1727
01:32:39,671 --> 01:32:43,330
but that's why I said that we should try
and look at the story sort of outside of

1728
01:32:43,331 --> 01:32:45,400
both traditions,
if that would be possible.

1729
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:49,240
And to see it as a story of something of
someone who's getting the aspiration.

1730
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:54,390
That's all
true enough.

1731
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:55,953
I mean unless we got a very diverse 
representation of peoples from all the 

1732
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:01,574
time.
Well that's kind of what we're hoping 

1733
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:06,160
seeped in the Judeo Christian.
True enough,

1734
01:33:06,161 --> 01:33:08,170
but that's what we're trying to do in 
part in this class.

1735
01:33:08,171 --> 01:33:09,004
Even though in terms of personal 
representation we don't have like we're 

1736
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,570
not as diverse a group as well.
You might be.

1737
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,553
What are the things hopefully that we're
trying to do is contrast and compare 

1738
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:21,700
enough traditions so that we can see the
stories that are common to all of them.

1739
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:26,200
Now this is going to be a problem in all
sorts of different ways,

1740
01:33:26,440 --> 01:33:30,250
but I'm hoping that the enough 
information in general,

1741
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:31,143
not just in the context of this class 
has been gathered so that we can start 

1742
01:33:34,541 --> 01:33:37,090
to see patterns that transcend 
particular,

1743
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:41,170
particular viewpoints without 
undermining how do you avoid the problem

1744
01:33:41,171 --> 01:33:42,004
of seeking confirmation and other 
conditions so that you have already 

1745
01:33:45,341 --> 01:33:46,174
within one tradition a sense of what the
fundamental elements and then because 

1746
01:33:50,861 --> 01:33:54,190
traditions are broad and inclusive you 
can find good question.

1747
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,713
Good question.
The ones that are most important to you 

1748
01:33:57,281 --> 01:34:00,850
and how,
how do you avoid that problem of bias?

1749
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,350
That's an excellent question.
I mean,

1750
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:03,790
look,
that's an absolutely,

1751
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,013
absolutely solid question.
The fundamental like I think one of the 

1752
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:08,674
reasons why there has been such a 
discrepancy between scientific 

1753
01:34:12,101 --> 01:34:12,934
viewpoints and mythological viewpoints 
is because in science we have a mode of 

1754
01:34:17,411 --> 01:34:19,960
determining what comes to or institutes 
of truth,

1755
01:34:19,961 --> 01:34:20,794
at least provisional truth,
regardless of the desires of the 

1756
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:25,660
exponents,
of any given at any given truth.

1757
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:26,903
Here's a methodology.
The problem with moral viewpoints is 

1758
01:34:29,831 --> 01:34:33,520
that we don't have a methodology now,
and this may be in some ways,

1759
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:34,383
in some ways it's an insoluble problem I
think because I don't think that we can 

1760
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:41,701
come to a conclusion about what is good
by the same sort of process of consensus

1761
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:45,940
necessarily that we use in science 
because it's hard to point to an object.

1762
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:49,660
Okay,
so then the question as well,

1763
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,060
so how do you get to,
what comes to mind?

1764
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,220
What might constitute a fact?
Well,

1765
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:58,280
the only way that I can see that it can 
be done is by looking

1766
01:34:58,280 --> 01:34:59,113
at various cultures and various 
historical traditions and also by 

1767
01:35:02,751 --> 01:35:05,240
drawing in information from other fields
of endeavor,

1768
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:06,074
if that's possible.
That's why I've been trying to look at 

1769
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:08,684
both the neuropsychology of the 
emotional brought an information 

1770
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:15,050
processing plus looking at at various 
historical traditions.

1771
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:20,380
So the problem of looking for what you 
want and finding it is a big problem and

1772
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,153
maybe there isn't an entirely 
satisfactory solution of the present 

1773
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:25,304
time.
But it strikes me that there's enough 

1774
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:30,650
data gathering so that we can at least 
make some movements towards that end.

1775
01:35:31,730 --> 01:35:36,380
So
I think I have a solution.

1776
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:40,190
Oh,
this is good training program.

1777
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:41,790
Well,
the,

1778
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:43,470
uh,
I think it would,

1779
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:45,000
I think that would be the hardest way to
do it.

1780
01:35:45,001 --> 01:35:47,580
The way you're doing it now is I 
presented it in a conscious level,

1781
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,810
but I think you'd be presented on an 
unconscious of them.

1782
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:50,644
Create your own story.
And of course you have to have 

1783
01:35:52,351 --> 01:35:55,920
confidence in you and what you've come 
up with and see that it is,

1784
01:35:55,940 --> 01:35:56,773
you know,
something that is more right or 

1785
01:35:57,301 --> 01:35:58,170
whatever.
But anyways,

1786
01:35:58,340 --> 01:35:59,173
you create the story and through the 
behaviors that are embodied in the 

1787
01:36:01,411 --> 01:36:02,244
story,
you are passing on this kind of wisdom 

1788
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:04,374
knowledge,
the same thing that Jesus did in making 

1789
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:08,040
his parables and other figurative 
language stuff.

1790
01:36:08,070 --> 01:36:10,740
And he said,
well he was able to pass that on through

1791
01:36:10,741 --> 01:36:11,790
those stories.
Not necessarily.

1792
01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:12,723
This is also,
this is also an issue with regards to 

1793
01:36:14,251 --> 01:36:15,084
the methodology.

1794
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:16,003
The problem with with discussing truths 
about how to add is that the only form 

1795
01:36:20,101 --> 01:36:22,650
that you can actually test them out and 
use it in your own experience.

1796
01:36:23,190 --> 01:36:24,090
It's like,
so if you say,

1797
01:36:24,091 --> 01:36:26,910
why should act such and such a way you 
can't ask anybody else,

1798
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,220
should I act this way?
Because they can't tell you.

1799
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,080
I mean you might go to hell,
you should listen to them.

1800
01:36:31,081 --> 01:36:32,670
Maybe they have some good information 
for you.

1801
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:33,683
But in the final analysis,
you're the only one that can figure out 

1802
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:37,350
if the way you're acting is right.
And not only that,

1803
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:38,213
it's worse than that because you have to
define the criteria by which you 

1804
01:36:41,701 --> 01:36:44,160
determine if the way you're acting is 
appropriate.

1805
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:45,230
Right?
So you're,

1806
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:48,360
you're kind of caught with decisions to 
make the matter which way you look.

1807
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:49,643
Well,
that's one of the things that I'm going 

1808
01:36:50,281 --> 01:36:51,114
to try to address later in the later in 
the course because these sorts of 

1809
01:36:54,031 --> 01:36:56,750
things,
these sorts of things pop up being,

1810
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:00,870
since you can't rely on anyone else in 
the final analysis,

1811
01:37:00,871 --> 01:37:02,010
you have to rely on yourself.

1812
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:02,970
And then the question is,
well,

1813
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:05,490
how is it that you can be sure that you 
can rely on yourself?

1814
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,620
Why do you say that you can't rely on 
anybody else?

1815
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:08,760
You have to realize,
well,

1816
01:37:08,790 --> 01:37:11,310
partly because nobody else can feel your
pain.

1817
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:13,440
I mean,
that's the basic,

1818
01:37:13,441 --> 01:37:15,330
because there's an aspect of your 
experience,

1819
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:19,440
the subjective aspect of no one else has
access to and what's right for you.

1820
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:22,230
It's going to be,
it's going to share,

1821
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,423
there's gonna be overlap between that 
and what's right with other people and 

1822
01:37:25,951 --> 01:37:28,890
what's always be going to be right.
But it's gonna be unique to you.

1823
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,540
What about the what,
what about recap?

1824
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,573
We cast a lot of this whole thing in 
terms of interpersonal interactions as 

1825
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:39,150
opposed to an individual's actions 
against the world.

1826
01:37:39,151 --> 01:37:39,984
So for example,
when you were talking about how the 

1827
01:37:41,431 --> 01:37:44,520
child learns,
the child explores his territory,

1828
01:37:44,521 --> 01:37:45,380
it's a very,
yeah,

1829
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,223
Jillian [inaudible] information and the 
mother is there as sort of a protector 

1830
01:37:51,091 --> 01:37:54,600
to protect you from the world rather 
than using a whole nother way of looking

1831
01:37:54,601 --> 01:37:56,520
at that same child learns,
doing,

1832
01:37:56,521 --> 01:37:57,354
interacting with the mother.
I think absolutely top of the story of 

1833
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:02,004
Buddha,
Buddha goes out into the world rather 

1834
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:04,554
than anomalous information.
Part of the interactions with the sick 

1835
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:09,720
person,
an old person in a dead person,

1836
01:38:09,721 --> 01:38:11,730
but these are interactions that were 
previously,

1837
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:13,863
look at this diagram.
One of the ways that an individual 

1838
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:21,810
generates information is through going 
back with the unknown,

1839
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:23,303
but the other way that he generates 
inflammation is through contact with 

1840
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,250
culture.

1841
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:27,083
And in the case that you're describing 
of the mother who is providing 

1842
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:32,580
information as an intermediary for 
culture but also another person,

1843
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:36,120
I mean people,
sure.

1844
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,510
But a lot of cultural information is 
embedded in other people,

1845
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,710
not just in what they say.
Let me how many APP?

1846
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:43,740
As soon as you interact with someone 
else,

1847
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,574
they're providing you with all sorts of 
cultural information in the interaction 

1848
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:50,100
or is there still something else you 
mean?

1849
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:52,440
Yes,
yes.

1850
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,280
Asking some of these questions that 
asked a lot of these same questions,

1851
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:59,160
but my area of concentration in social 
psychology

1852
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:04,670
and I spent a lot of time trying to 
figure out what level to ask a question.

1853
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:07,270
Um,
why does an individual harbored,

1854
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:11,190
for example,
to create,

1855
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,790
to do her ethic that or what is it about
a group?

1856
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:16,243
Okay that needs the group to do 
clarifications or what is it about the 

1857
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:19,944
dynamics between two groups that causes 
one of them to do these things to the 

1858
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:24,000
other one?

1859
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,833
And it seems to me that you can ask the 
question at every level and it's hard 

1860
01:39:27,961 --> 01:39:32,961
for me to understand why one,
is this views of all of those levels put

1861
01:39:33,241 --> 01:39:34,074
together or is it focusing on one limits
to things like it's an attempt to 

1862
01:39:36,961 --> 01:39:40,700
integrate
ideas about group car.

1863
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:41,853
The,
the,

1864
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,400
the question really for me as an why do 
groups engaged in cons?

1865
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:46,973
It's why do the individuals that make up
those groups actually conducting 

1866
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:52,590
individual acts that make up the 
conflict?

1867
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,680
Okay.
And since I'm interested in,

1868
01:39:55,681 --> 01:39:59,490
in the individual as like the four 
runner of the group,

1869
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,593
what can the individual do personally to
reduce the likelihood that given the 

1870
01:40:04,921 --> 01:40:08,250
preconditions they will engage in those 
sorts of peripheric actions?

1871
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,670
That's my,
like specifically that's my concern

1872
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:16,350
in which individuals are doing these 
things.

1873
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:19,890
So for example,
if I were a Nazi teachers

1874
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:24,030
Nazi in Germany,
German,

1875
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,690
and my job was to,
I dunno,

1876
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:29,280
throw the switch on the train line 
somewhere down the line.

1877
01:40:29,700 --> 01:40:31,740
And you may ask,
now why would I do that?

1878
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:34,200
Well,
one reason is because if I don't do it,

1879
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:36,000
somebody else will do it.
Well,

1880
01:40:36,001 --> 01:40:37,430
that becomes irrelevant.
What,

1881
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:38,264
why did I throw the switch?
Because the switch is going to get 

1882
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:41,850
thrown whether I threw it or not.
Okay.

1883
01:40:41,851 --> 01:40:42,900
Well that's,
you know,

1884
01:40:43,020 --> 01:40:43,830
that's,
that's uh,

1885
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:44,730
that's,
uh,

1886
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:50,460
well that's a very untoward or arguments
similar in some ways to also carrying it

1887
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,230
on as a consequence of borders.
It's like,

1888
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:54,060
you know,
you're a hierarchy.

1889
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,173
Why did I throw the switch?
I'm asking why are you asking why did I 

1890
01:40:57,131 --> 01:40:58,300
throw the switch?
I'm telling you,

1891
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:01,510
don't ask me why I did it.
Ask me why the switch got thrown in.

1892
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:02,463
To answer that question,
maybe you'll have to look at something 

1893
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:05,620
beyond me.
Maybe.

1894
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:08,190
I would say you don't have to look at 
something.

1895
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:09,533
I would say that it was the pattern of 
your whole life up to the point where 

1896
01:41:13,451 --> 01:41:14,284
you threw the switch that made you into 
the sort of creature that would think 

1897
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:20,170
that that was a normal app.
Like Kinda Rod said,

1898
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:24,550
people has been out.
I think she was wrong actually.

1899
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:25,384
I think that it's not valid.
It's just that many of the things that 

1900
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:32,440
we think are but now are actually heat.
So that's this things,

1901
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:35,470
so to speak,
that we do every day that don't have any

1902
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:36,640
immediate consequence.

1903
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:38,950
We write them off.
So there've been out,

1904
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:39,843
but they're not by now.
Because if you look at what you're 

1905
01:41:41,321 --> 01:41:42,154
doing,
the consequences of that over time or 

1906
01:41:44,141 --> 01:41:44,974
say why does society is going say well 
it's because the individuals that 

1907
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:53,290
composable conduct the activities that 
they think are saying no one notices,

1908
01:41:53,291 --> 01:41:54,124
no one said anything.
They're not saying they're completely 

1909
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:56,884
off the wall.
And the culmination of all those 

1910
01:41:58,840 --> 01:41:59,673
[inaudible] actions is a society 
composed of individuals that all things 

1911
01:42:03,421 --> 01:42:06,320
are good,
who are acting on mass and an absolutely

1912
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,980
boring way.
So say in part,

1913
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:11,010
I mean one of the things I'd be trying 
to answers,

1914
01:42:11,150 --> 01:42:11,983
they just question posed in the late 18 
hundreds he said are their 

1915
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:17,890
psychopathology is of health.
And what he meant was,

1916
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:21,130
was it possible for someone to be 
perfectly normal and well adjusted,

1917
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:21,983
well adapted,
and they did an admirable by the 

1918
01:42:23,321 --> 01:42:26,440
standards of their society and still be 
sick.

1919
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,400
And you know from the perspective of 
cultural relativism,

1920
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:31,234
the answer's no.
But from the perspective of the number 

1921
01:42:33,321 --> 01:42:35,410
of trials to answer is,
Oh yes.

1922
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:36,723
So what I'm trying to figure out is if 
you can be sick by doing what everyone 

1923
01:42:39,611 --> 01:42:40,444
else is doing,
does that imply that there's some 

1924
01:42:42,791 --> 01:42:45,520
universal standard by which being sick 
can be judged?

1925
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:46,690
I'm going to say,
well yes.

1926
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:51,400
Three this says if you are open to the 
existence of anomalous information,

1927
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,473
you admitted it when it occurs and you 
update your behavioral models as a 

1928
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:56,920
consequence,
then you're healthy.

1929
01:42:57,070 --> 01:43:01,010
If you're not well then you're not.
How can an individual do that?

1930
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:07,570
How can I in the train station admit the
anomalous information?

1931
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:11,110
Actually there's two preconditions.
What has been,

1932
01:43:11,111 --> 01:43:11,944
you have to admit that you're vulnerable
to even to being killed and to accept 

1933
01:43:17,111 --> 01:43:17,944
it.
And the second is to to risk putting up 

1934
01:43:20,021 --> 01:43:22,000
with the fact that the group might 
actually do it too.

1935
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:25,120
So that's what you have to do that 
delete the group.

1936
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:27,330
That's right.
No,

1937
01:43:27,331 --> 01:43:29,380
not only that,
you have to leave the group knowing that

1938
01:43:29,381 --> 01:43:30,214
if you do leave,
they might kill you and are very 

1939
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:33,904
motivated to do so.
And that's a classic hero myth as well 

1940
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,500
as the hero.
There's two things,

1941
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:41,470
death weights at the end.
And so does the negative reaction of the

1942
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:42,304
group.
So if you want to transcend the group 

1943
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:45,280
that's,
that's what you do.

1944
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,370
Say can you do it?
And I was too much for any individual to

1945
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:50,020
do.
Well that's the,

1946
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:52,010
that's the question.
I would

1947
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,120
say it's,
it's kind of,

1948
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,480
there's a paradox.
It's a paradoxical solution.

1949
01:43:55,550 --> 01:43:56,383
Actually.
If you tried it is possible that if one 

1950
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:03,200
tried it,
it might be possible.

1951
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:04,633
And if it were possible,
it may be that there were side effects 

1952
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:07,994
to doing it.
It might actually eliminate all the 

1953
01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:12,980
things that appear negative about it.
So,

1954
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:14,030
and I would say,
well look,

1955
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:14,864
I mean the,
but the basic problem is how do you 

1956
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:21,041
adapt to the presence of chaos
when it's unfair and unjust aspects?

1957
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:24,680
Cause what ways do you identify with the
group?

1958
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:28,730
That's what the groups for the other way
is that you learn how to deal with it on

1959
01:44:28,731 --> 01:44:33,110
your own and the questions can you,
and if the answer is yes,

1960
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:34,573
then that implies that you're a 
different sort of creature than you 

1961
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:37,064
think you are.
And if you're a different sort of 

1962
01:44:38,661 --> 01:44:39,494
creature than you think you are,
maybe the world is not configured it 

1963
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:43,340
unfair and unjust,
man.

1964
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:44,713
It may be that it appears that it is 
because you have an inadequate opinion 

1965
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,213
of your own power to adapt.
And I would say that the purpose of 

1966
01:44:52,041 --> 01:44:57,041
pyramids generally is to provide you 
with some evidence home from history.

1967
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:04,190
Then there's far more to the individual 
that meets the odd enough,

1968
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:05,024
more so that the conditions of existence
that we normally regard as unjust and 

1969
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:10,080
unfair are.

1970
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:17,990
But the only way you can find out is if 
there's a big risk.

1971
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:19,790
We know what the risk entails.
I mean,

1972
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,893
what we've been trying to figure out the
whole time is why do people identify 

1973
01:45:22,791 --> 01:45:25,010
with groups when there's a big good 
reasons?

1974
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,550
So helps them regulate their emotions 
and protects them from terror.

1975
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:32,030
So people are well motivated.
You can you get me on that?

1976
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:37,370
That's the issue.
Okay,

1977
01:45:37,371 --> 01:45:40,700
so
that's that for this weekend.
