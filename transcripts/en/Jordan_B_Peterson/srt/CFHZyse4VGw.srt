1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,973
So
here's how to conceptualize yourself in 

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:06,930
union terms.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,923
Okay.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,130
The part of you that you consider you 
roughly speaking young,

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:16,974
considered the ego and you might think 
about that as the most individual part 

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:25,500
of your cycle.
Physiological being,

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,043
I mean

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,513
the difference between individual and 
collective in that sense is that you 

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,870
share very many attributes with other 
people.

10
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:43,010
Obviously your physical form is very 
much like that of other people.

11
00:00:43,011 --> 00:00:43,844
And then you share attributes with other
living creatures way back down the 

12
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:50,780
phylogenetic chain.
And so in that regard,

13
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,450
there's nothing specifically individual 
about you.

14
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,520
Okay.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,520
But the part of you that you identify 
with most completely and that you regard

16
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:04,880
as unique,
that's the union ego.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,430
Now young sort of conceptualized your 
psyche as a,

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,553
as a,
I would say as a place I suppose that 

19
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:21,950
many spirits could inhabit and you might
think about a spirit.

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,860
Okay.

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,150
From,
from the union perspective as

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,690
okay,

23
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,150
a personality that can inhabit the 
psyche.

24
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,243
And so like all of the psychoanalysts 
young regarded the psyche as a 

25
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,960
relatively loose collection of partially
integrated personalities.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,100
And each of those personalities had 
their own perspective,

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,683
their own thoughts.
Like their own way of looking at the 

28
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,210
world.
That would be the perspective,

29
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,100
their own thoughts,
their own emotions,

30
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,290
their own habits,
their own actions.

31
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,680
And those are roughly aggregated into 
some sort of unity.

32
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,280
And that was the,
that was the ego.

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,693
Now

34
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,280
ego has a public face and the public 
face,

35
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,114
you don't call it the persona.
Persona means mask and the persona is 

36
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:17,374
both that part of you that you showed 
other people instead of the part that 

37
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,941
you hide.
And then also to some degree it might be

38
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,730
the form that your ego takes even to 
you.

39
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,880
So for example,
if you're a naive person,

40
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,340
you might think that your public face is
all there is a view

41
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,773
that the rough difference between the 
ego and the persona might be 

42
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,070
conceptualize this way that
you know there are things that you think

43
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,340
that you won't say in public,
maybe not even in private.

44
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,980
Okay.

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,813
Some of those things you're pretty aware
of and those would be thoughts that are 

46
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
relevant to the ego but not the persona.
And then some of them you don't even 

47
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,424
really want to be aware of and young 
would consider those more associated 

48
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,370
with the shadow now.

49
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,490
Okay.

50
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,830
The Shadow,
the existence of the shadow.

51
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,040
First of all,
you might want to remember that the best

52
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:22,874
way to conceptualize umes archetypical
constructions is in some sense as 

53
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:29,564
metaphors.
So you could say that while you thought 

54
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,810
that it was useful to separate up the 
psyche into persona,

55
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:36,644
an ego and then shadow,
it isn't that there aren't other ways 

56
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:41,894
that it could be broken up,
but breaking it up this way is useful 

57
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,504
for certain purposes.
And Yoni regarded this terminology as 

58
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,840
particularly useful from a 
psychoanalytic perspective and also from

59
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,420
a historical perspective.
So

60
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,260
perhaps the divisions could have be 
made,

61
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,094
could be made otherwise,
and there are many ways of looking at 

62
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:06,770
archetypes,
but this is sufficiently useful to

63
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,170
progress with.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,993
Now,

65
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,900
people's personas are generally somewhat
harmless and somewhat socialized.

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,520
If you don't know how to act in public,
you don't have a well crafted persona.

67
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:28,430
You know,
some of you are going to be the kinds of

68
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,593
relatively deep thinking intellectuals 
who think that small talk is nonsense 

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,073
and uh,
there is some utility in that thinking 

70
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:41,510
because in some sense,
from a philosophical sense,

71
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,344
obviously it's nonsense.
But if you don't know how to make small 

72
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:45,524
talk,
basically what that means is that you 

73
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:50,480
have a poorly developed persona.
And what that'll mean is that you're not

74
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,314
going to do very well,
at least at the beginning of social in 

75
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,474
social engagements because you need to 
be able to convince people that you're 

76
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,613
basically civilized and social before 
it's even reasonable for them to go 

77
00:05:04,491 --> 00:05:08,900
beyond pleasantries with you.
And the ability to exchange pleasantries

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,753
in a relatively banal way in a variety 
of different circumstances is part of 

79
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,630
having a persona.

80
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:20,200
And you don't want to denigrate the 
utility of that because you need it.

81
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,270
You know,
as you progress in your careers,

82
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,104
for example,
you're going to be thrust into 

83
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,860
situations where you don't really know 
anyone.

84
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,083
And the purpose of the gathering is to 
familiarize a large number of people 

85
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,294
with one another.
And there's a skill that's associated 

86
00:05:38,661 --> 00:05:42,800
with that that's somewhat Glib,
social ability.

87
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,070
The unions would say,
well,

88
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,340
you shouldn't,
if you don't have a persona,

89
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:51,680
you're just a disaster.
But by the same token,

90
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:56,030
you shouldn't be only persona because 
one of the possibilities is that the ego

91
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:56,864
can identify with persona and then the 
person thinks that they are what they 

92
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:05,210
show the social world.
And the problem with that,

93
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,370
at least from the union perspective,
is that,

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,993
um,
a people are a lot more than the 

95
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,910
persona.
There are a lot more than the ego and be

96
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
a lot of the things that make them more 
than mere persona or mere that more than

97
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,444
mere ego are not necessarily things that
are acceptable in casual public 

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,360
gatherings.

99
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,183
So for example,
because of your psychophysiological 

100
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,584
makeup,
you all have the capacity for 

101
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,960
aggression.
Now,

102
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,794
a lot of you,
especially the ones that are more 

103
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:49,370
agreeable,
you could say that even it's either that

104
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:54,371
that capacity for aggression has been 
underdeveloped because you've identified

105
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:55,874
with a certain mode of social being or 
you could say perhaps if to the degree 

106
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,534
that agreeableness is temperamental,
that the aggressive tendency isn't as 

107
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,034
powerful in you as it is and other 
people that might lead you to make 

108
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,330
judgements like,
and I'm sure some of you,

109
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,553
perhaps some,
some of you who had an angry parent or 

110
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,004
particularly an angry father have 
decided at some point in your life that 

111
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,240
to be aggressive is wrong,
to be angry is wrong,

112
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,790
for example,
or to be aggressive is wrong.

113
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:26,624
It's morally wrong.
One of the things that happens in 

114
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,624
psychotherapy very frequently though is 
that people come into psychotherapy for 

115
00:07:33,891 --> 00:07:34,820
a variety of reasons.

116
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,653
Some of them are merely practical.
They're having problems in adaptation 

117
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,684
because their lives have got very,
very complicated and they really don't 

118
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:41,384
know what to do about it.
Sometimes they go into psychotherapy 

119
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,654
because they have very high levels of 
negative emotion and that can be 

120
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,924
associated with the first problem.
But very often they come into therapy 

121
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:51,794
because they're getting pushed around 
constantly and they really don't have 

122
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,144
anything that's a sufficiently well 
developed personal identity and 

123
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,824
generally those that happens by the way 
most more often with women than it does 

124
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,224
with men.
And that's because women are by 

125
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,190
temperament,
more agreeable than men.

126
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,860
And perhaps also by socialization.
Um,

127
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,770
temperament certainly plays a big role 
often then they,

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,613
the goal of therapy is assertiveness 
training and assertiveness training you 

129
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:22,184
could think of as the behavioral 
psychologists equivalent to 

130
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:27,470
incorporating the shadow.
So,

131
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,450
you know,
you may think,

132
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:32,240
well it's,
it's a necessary part of existence to be

133
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,320
nice to other people.

134
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,220
And there's some truth in that.
Not really.

135
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,203
It's a very shallow way of looking at 
the world because nice is not a very 

136
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:42,164
sophisticated work.
But even if that's the word that you do 

137
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:47,240
use,
you should also be nice to yourself.

138
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,523
And sometimes what that means is that 
you have to put forward your own wishes 

139
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,380
and desires in a manner that causes a 
certain amount of conflict.

140
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,610
And in order to withstand that conflict,
you have to have,

141
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,473
you have to be able to draw on the 
sources of aggression that in some 

142
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,570
sensor are,
are,

143
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,550
are a deep part of your,
your inbuilt set of possibilities.

144
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,384
Now the reason that's necessary in part 
from a biological perspective is that 

145
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,110
people are often afraid of engaging in 
conflict because they're afraid because?

146
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:25,470
Because,
because conflict can be real trouble and

147
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,993
anger inhibits fear.
So if you don't have a well developed 

148
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,734
capacity for while we could say rage,
then you can't overcome your fear and 

149
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:40,370
then you can't stand up for yourself and
then you're going to get run over.

150
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,650
Now the problem with that is is that if 
you get run over enough,

151
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,813
it'll make you resentful and then that 
will make you aggressive except it'll 

152
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,863
make you aggressive and sneaky 
underground and somewhat unconscious 

153
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,890
ways that are much less likely to be 
productive.

154
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,903
Then you know,
a frank exchange of viewpoints and some 

155
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:05,601
conscious negotiation.
So one of the things I do in therapy for

156
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:07,824
people who need assertiveness training 
is I get them to pay attention to their 

157
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:11,334
resentment.
And resentment is often a good avenue 

158
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:14,934
into the shadow because first of all,
resentment is a pretty destructive 

159
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,940
emotion.
It's extremely useful emotion,

160
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,460
but it can be very destructive cause it 
gives rise to,

161
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,683
well first of all sense of victimization
and second then the underground growth 

162
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,514
of all sorts of ideas of revenge and 
vengeance and and also a kind of 

163
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,590
stubborn non cooperativeness because 
who,

164
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,770
who wants to cooperate when they feel 
taken advantage of.

165
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,353
And so part of young's idea with regards
to the shadow is that obviously the 

166
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:48,924
social world wants you to be peaceful 
and predictable and maybe even easy to 

167
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:54,264
get along with.
But that doesn't necessarily mean that 

168
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,600
peaceful,
predictable and easy to get along with a

169
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,060
are the only virtues because they're 
certainly not.

170
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:06,210
And one thing we know about virtues is 
that if they're taken to two,

171
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,310
great at an extreme,
they become vices.

172
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,623
And B,
there are certainly not the only 

173
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,600
virtues.
You know,

174
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:15,540
there are what you might call darker 
virtues,

175
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,643
so to speak.
There they're more dangerous virtues in 

176
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,034
some sense because they harness forces 
that can be very destructive if they're 

177
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,244
not utilized consciously.
And aggression is certainly an example 

178
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,104
of that.
So here's some fundamental rules about 

179
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,870
the shadow that you might think about as
you move forward through your life.

180
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,040
So a lot of times you're going to have 
to negotiate on your own behalf.

181
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,203
And so what that means from the 
perspective of agreeableness and 

182
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:48,624
aggression is that you should be able to
stand up for yourself at least as well 

183
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,160
as you would stand up for someone that 
you care for.

184
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,383
So the problem with the idea of being 
nice to other people is that it doesn't 

185
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:02,230
take you into account.
And that's supposed to be an equation,

186
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,700
even though it's,
as I said,

187
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,040
nice is a pretty weak philosophical 
term.

188
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,560
But the fundamental rule is that you 
should certainly include yourself in the

189
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,950
circle of people who deserve respect and
care.

190
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,220
And that means that you have to be 
willing to advocate for yourself.

191
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,520
And if you're willing to advocate to 
yourself for yourself and you want to do

192
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,590
it,
you have to be able to say no.

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,353
You have to,
because otherwise you have to say yes 

194
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,270
and then you can't negotiate.

195
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,373
And in order to say no,
you have to have armed yourself with 

196
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,920
strategies and plans that enable you to 
say,

197
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,020
no,
you can't be dependent.

198
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,520
You can't be afraid of potentially 
searching out new opportunities,

199
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,523
et cetera.
You have to be willing to stand your 

200
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,234
ground.
And it's very difficult to do that 

201
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:52,741
without drawing on some of the deeper 
sources of psychological energy that are

202
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,440
part of our psychophysiological 
heritage.

203
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,710
So young would say,
well,

204
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:00,544
there's the persona and the ego and you 
can identify with your persona and then 

205
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:05,960
you're,
you're,

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,200
you're a kind of a shallow puppet of 
culture.

207
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:13,201
So Pinocchio as the Marionette is a 
Persona Pinocchio himself as an eagle,

208
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,710
but as a Marionette,
he's the persona.

209
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,260
So anybody who's ideologically 
possessed,

210
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:21,094
by the way is a persona,
although they're also possessed by the 

211
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:25,000
shadow,
even though they don't know it.

212
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,133
And you can tell when someone's 
ideologically possessed because you can 

213
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:30,700
predict whatever they're going to say 
once you know,

214
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,980
a few axioms of their particular 
radiology.

215
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,760
So given ideology probably has four or 
five explanatory,

216
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,470
um,
axioms,

217
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,970
like everything is caused by economic 
disparity.

218
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:45,050
That might be one.
Um,

219
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,660
or success is due to hard work,
that might be another,

220
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,130
and those are broad enough statements,
even though they're in opposition to one

221
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:54,964
another,
both of those statements are broad 

222
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:58,030
enough so you can virtually explain 
everything with them.

223
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,133
The problem with it is,
is that you can predict what the 

224
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:04,120
explanation is going to be before you 
even have to talk to the person.

225
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,450
And whenever you're talking to someone 
and you can predict exactly what they're

226
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:10,150
going to say because they're using some 
idiot,

227
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:10,984
logically mediated structure,
then you know perfectly well that 

228
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:14,134
they've identified with the persona.
You also know that they're likely to be 

229
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,184
possessed by a pretty vicious shadow 
because we know that the shadow of 

230
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:26,191
ideological possession is repression and
death.

231
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,863
So one of the things that's always 
interesting about the psychoanalysts is 

232
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:35,380
that whenever they see something good,
they're always looking for the dark side

233
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,240
of it and vice versa.
By the way,

234
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,940
whenever they see anything dark,
they're looking for the good side of it.

235
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,120
And so they're very unlikely to take 
anything at face value.

236
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,490
And so if someone comes up to you and 
says,

237
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,060
I stand for some good thing,
the thing that you ask,

238
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,930
you're a psychoanalytically minded is,
well,

239
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:58,430
what does that mean that you hate?
Because there's a reasonable probability

240
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,220
that even though you think that you're 
standing for something,

241
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,790
that a lot of what's motivating you is 
the desire to be against something.

242
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,120
And that's particularly the case when 
you're dealing with,

243
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,380
with negative emotions because they're 
more powerful than positive emotions.

244
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,040
So it's one of the things,
George Orwell,

245
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,490
who was one of the 20th century's great 
anti Edea logs,

246
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,563
published a book in the 1940s Thirties 
forties called up road to Wigan pier 

247
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:29,630
where he went to stay with some coal 
miners in the north of England.

248
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,770
And those coal miners,
man,

249
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:31,604
they had a hard life.
Like some of them had to crawl three 

250
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:34,874
quarters of a mile to work in tunnels in
the morning in tunnels where they 

251
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:42,770
couldn't stand up just to get to work.
So and then they do,

252
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,604
they're like 10 hour shift in the coal 
mine digging out call and then they'd 

253
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:49,370
have to crawl back three quarters of a 
mile underground,

254
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,050
you know,
so they had very,

255
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,540
very hard lives.
And so you know,

256
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,374
Orwell was pretty unimpressed by the 
conditions in which they were forced to 

257
00:15:58,461 --> 00:15:59,294
work.
So he wrote an essay for the English 

258
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:05,840
left book club and they were,
that was a socialist publishing house,

259
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,674
but he upended another essay to it where
he criticized the socialists who are 

260
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:11,084
most likely to read that sort of book as
much more oriented towards hating the 

261
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:20,030
rich.
Then then loving the poor as devastating

262
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:20,660
criticism.

263
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,000
And the left book club didn't even want 
to publish his book,

264
00:16:23,001 --> 00:16:26,090
but they ended up publishing has become 
a very famous essay,

265
00:16:26,091 --> 00:16:26,924
but it lays out a general principle.
It's like if you have identified with a 

266
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:33,290
given persona,
which is like a,

267
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,500
a social machine in a sense,
and you think you're all good because of

268
00:16:39,411 --> 00:16:40,910
what you think,
then you might ask,

269
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,400
well where'd all the parts of you that 
aren't good go?

270
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,323
Because unless you think that you're a 
saint and that everyone who thinks 

271
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:51,941
differently than you is Satan himself,
then you're missing a chunk of yourself.

272
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,950
You're not taking a chunk of yourself 
into account.

273
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,784
And that's the part that is nowhere near
as well behaved or as benevolent as you 

274
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:04,010
might think or that you actually have 
any reason to believe,

275
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,760
you know?
And so one of the things that has struck

276
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:12,761
me as a consequence of analyzing 20th 
century history and,

277
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,023
and often through a union lens,
is that there's not much evidence that 

278
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,860
the sorts of atrocities that 
characterize the Soviet Union,

279
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
um,
and,

280
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:24,703
and Nazi Germany were the result of a 
few extremely corrupt people at the top 

281
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:29,954
of the hierarchy,
forcing everyone down into slavery and 

282
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:34,430
then making them do terrible things.

283
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,790
I think that's a very weak explanation.
In fact,

284
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,260
I think it's,
I think it's wrong.

285
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,690
I think the historical record is quite 
clear that it's wrong.

286
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,760
I mean,
in East Germany for example,

287
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,400
one third of the people government 
informers.

288
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,340
So that means if you had a family of 
six,

289
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,150
two of your family members were 
reporting on you to the government.

290
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,910
So when you look at human capacity for 
destructiveness,

291
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,540
if you don't regard yourself as one of 
the agents of that destructiveness,

292
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,360
or at least one of the potential agents 
of that destructiveness,

293
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,400
then from the union perspective,
at least there's a high probability that

294
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,890
you're part of the problem rather than 
part of the solution.

295
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,923
Now,
that doesn't necessarily mean that you 

296
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:23,844
should be blamed for it because blame 
has to come from another person and it 

297
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:32,940
isn't obviously clear that like I get to
blame you for being potentially violent.

298
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,950
That's I think is a complete mistake.
But if you,

299
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,203
if you familiarize yourself with the 
realm of human capability and then you 

300
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,304
regard yourself as human,
what that means is that you have to 

301
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:51,291
regard yourself as a creature that's 
capable of what human beings are capable

302
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:52,500
of.

303
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,333
And human beings are capable of a lot of
things and some of them are absolutely 

304
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,140
wonderful.
I mean,

305
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,990
there's nothing more remarkable than a 
human being on the planet.

306
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,540
I mean,
people can do amazing things.

307
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:07,410
But the downside of that is that we can 
do absolutely horrible things.

308
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:11,400
And it's not obvious that it's only the 
pathological people who do that.

309
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,234
In fact,
it's,

310
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,630
it's that,
it's not reasonable to assume that.

311
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,460
So the shadow for young was a very big 
deal,

312
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:22,140
you know,
and he believed in some sense,

313
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:24,090
and this is where the idea is get 
archetipal.

314
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,730
He believed that the ideas of,
of,

315
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,953
uh,
the evil twin of the king or the evil 

316
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,124
twin of God for that matter,
so that would be Satan and Christian 

317
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,180
theology.
That was,

318
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:39,840
uh,
that was as real a representation of the

319
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,150
human and transpersonal human capacity 
for evil as there was.

320
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,250
And he believed that if you look deep 
enough into your own follow motivations,

321
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,610
and if you look far enough down that 
you'd be looking,

322
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,260
so to speak,
into hell itself,

323
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,760
and you'd find the main controller of 
hell deep inside your psyche.

324
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,210
So it was no journey for the timid.
And you'll also believe that,

325
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,153
and this is what separates him from a 
new age thinker because he's often 

326
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,544
accused of being a new age thinker.
New Age thinkers tell you things like 

327
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,130
follow your bliss and you'll,
you know,

328
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:20,370
you'll run into utopia,
your own counter utopia.

329
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,233
But that isn't what the unions 
especially young said about his process 

330
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:27,774
of individuation at all.
He said that if you follow what's 

331
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,580
meaningful and you do it,
honestly,

332
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,030
it will take you somewhere.
You really do not want to go.

333
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,373
And until you go there,
you'll never be able to climb up higher 

334
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,274
on the other side.
And so that provides a real impediment 

335
00:20:44,881 --> 00:20:47,250
for enlightenment because for 
enlightenment,

336
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,093
there's a price to be paid.
And if you look at architectural 

337
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:53,890
representations of the cost of 
enlightenment,

338
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,730
you often find that the person who 
becomes enlightened has,

339
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,700
is damaged in some profound way before 
it happens.

340
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,923
So for example,
in the ancient Egyptian stories of 

341
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,440
Horace and Oh,
Cyrus,

342
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,360
horace loses an eye when he has to 
encounter set who's the ancient Egyptian

343
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:13,420
equivalent of sate.
So it's no joke.

344
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,360
It's seriously no joke.
You know,

345
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,194
and it's,

346
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,363
you know,
one of one of young's propositions 

347
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:26,811
essentially was that the human race will
continue to be plagued by phenomena like

348
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,790
the outbreak of the genocidal Nazi and 
Soviet ideologies.

349
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,520
Until people realize that the Nazis and 
the Soviets are them,

350
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:44,400
that it isn't someone else's problem.
It isn't other people who weren't you,

351
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,730
it's you.
If you were there,

352
00:21:47,731 --> 00:21:49,740
it would've been you.
And you might say,

353
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:50,251
well,
no,

354
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:51,630
I would have been a hero.
It's like,

355
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,523
no,

356
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,850
probably not.
Because they were rare.

357
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:58,684
And I mean,
unless you have real reason to think 

358
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:00,934
that you could have done it,
then it's safer to think that you 

359
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:04,804
couldn't have and wouldn't have.
And so then there's a responsibility 

360
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,334
that goes along with that.
And the responsibility is to broaden 

361
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:13,924
your capacity of who you are so that you
have the possibility of controlling the 

362
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,720
parts of your psyche that are very dark.
Now,

363
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,480
let me give you some examples of this.
So you know,

364
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,690
there's a philosopher named Bruce,
so,

365
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,720
and most of you are resilience without 
knowing it.

366
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:31,960
And Russo basically made the following 
propositions.

367
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,660
He said that human beings were basically
good,

368
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,513
but they were corrupted by culture.
So human essential human nature was 

369
00:22:41,231 --> 00:22:42,064
good.
And the corrupting influence was was 

370
00:22:44,051 --> 00:22:47,290
society.
Now that's true,

371
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,124
but it's only half true.
And there's a philosopher named hobbs 

372
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:51,370
who said exactly the opposite thing.

373
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,990
He said,
no human beings are base and violent and

374
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,883
uncontrollable.
And unless we have society structuring 

375
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:02,980
their interactions,
he was more like Freud structuring their

376
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,814
interactions.
They would be constantly at one 

377
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:07,930
another's throat.
And then if you think,

378
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:08,830
well,
who's right,

379
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:11,710
Russo or hobbs,
first of all,

380
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,230
they're both right.
Even though they say the opposite thing.

381
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,393
And second while you look around the 
world and you tell me whether there are 

382
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:21,270
more hobbsy and states are resilient 
states announcer,

383
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,400
that's pretty clear.
Most countries are disastrous.

384
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,320
Authoritarian dictatorships in which 
people where people live and suffer,

385
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,603
and the places where civilization has 
has become stable enough so that people 

386
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:39,850
can live peaceful,
relatively peaceful and productive lives

387
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:40,684
are very rare.
They're more common than they were in 

388
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:45,560
the past and they seem to be getting 
more common all time.

389
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:50,270
Thank God.
But it's a lot easier to be disorganized

390
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:53,930
and brutal that it is to be organized,
productive and free.

391
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,483
So now you believe that the,
the shadow is something that kind of 

392
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,620
comes apart when you,
when you face it.

393
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,603
So it's a blurry black mass and in a 
sense before you start to differentiate 

394
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,204
it and so you can,
you can tell what the shadow is as far 

395
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:19,130
as any one of you is concerned because 
you,

396
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,730
you can start to notice how you aren't 
like you act,

397
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,323
especially when you act around,
act around people that you're trying to 

398
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:32,060
impress or people whose opinions you 
think are important to you.

399
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,730
You have to pay attention to it though.
And you,

400
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
you'll be able to see that there's a 
distinction between what you say because

401
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:43,850
you're saying something in order to make
something turnout the way you want it to

402
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:48,851
turn out and what you actually think and
the shadows at work in two ways.

403
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:53,030
There.
One way is that it's convincing you that

404
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:53,864
using your speech and actions to 
manipulate the world in a conscious 

405
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,510
manner is a good idea and it's not.

406
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,853
And the second is that you'll see that 
there are counter thoughts to what you 

407
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,470
think.
So if you,

408
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,513
for example,
if you find yourself in the position of 

409
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,160
being too nice to someone,
maybe it's a boss for example,

410
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,020
who's bit of a tire it,
you know,

411
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:17,840
and you don't feel that you're in a 
position to say anything,

412
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,353
um,
in your only defense against his or her 

413
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:22,784
bullying tactics.
The consequence of that is that you'll 

414
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:26,144
think all sorts of dark and dangerous 
thoughts about that person in your own 

415
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,590
fantasies when you're not interacting 
with them.

416
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:34,424
And if you catch a hold of those 
fantasies and you let them play 

417
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:38,534
themselves out consciously,
you'll see that they take you to very 

418
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:44,180
dark places now,

419
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,350
okay.

420
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,290
Or at least to places that you regard is
very dark.

421
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:50,963
So

422
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,240
w

423
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,073
young's notion essentially is that when 
you start to uncover those elements of 

424
00:25:59,901 --> 00:26:00,734
yourself that
don't fit comfortably within your ideas 

425
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:06,594
about yourself is that you discover 
things about yourself that are also 

426
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:11,244
potentially very useful.
It says if you threw the baby out with 

427
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,940
the bath water when you were setting up 
your personality.

428
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:18,780
So,
for example,

429
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:19,614
earlier I talked about people who may 
have decided very early in their life 

430
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:24,990
that they're just not going to get 
angry.

431
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,120
It's like,
well,

432
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,590
it's not necessarily something that you 
want to throw away.

433
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,233
It might instead be something that you 
want to bring within the realm of your 

434
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,480
personality so that it,
it can express itself consciously and in

435
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:47,700
an articulated manner.
Because without anger,

436
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:50,040
for example,
you don't have any power,

437
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,820
which basically means that no one needs 
to be afraid of you.

438
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,050
And you might think,
well,

439
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,800
people shouldn't be afraid of you.
And then a union might ask,

440
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,230
well,
what in the world would ever lead you to

441
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,190
believe that

442
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,713
mean?

443
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,710
The distinction between being respected 
and being feared is not clear.

444
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,070
But I would say that you don't respect 
anyone

445
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,803
whom you couldn't imagine fearing if 
they decided to make that their 

446
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:28,214
priority.

447
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:30,643
So

448
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,170
without the capacity for aggression,
you're not going to get any respect.

449
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,590
That doesn't mean that people have to 
fear you,

450
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,310
but it does mean that you have to 
incorporate your capacity for aggression

451
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:46,460
enough so that they would fear you if 
you wanted them to.

452
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,140
And if you think about it,
that makes a lot more sense for memorial

453
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:51,974
perspective,
then the argument that you should be 

454
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:54,614
nice to everyone because if you're nice 
to everyone because you don't have any 

455
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:01,160
choice because you're weak and 
ineffectual and harmless,

456
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,460
then that's not a virtue.
That's just,

457
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,530
you just can't do anything else.
You're,

458
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,693
you're,
you're harmless by default and harmless 

459
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,700
and virtuous are by no means the same 
thing.

460
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:14,893
If by contrast you're capable of causing
all sorts of terrible trouble and you 

461
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:20,984
know it and you know how and then you 
decide not to do it because you can 

462
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,580
articulate,
carefully,

463
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:29,414
articulate a different route,
well then you have the possibility of 

464
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:36,260
virtue because without the capacity to 
sin,

465
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,040
so to speak,
there's no virtue in not doing it.

466
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,983
So if you're a,
if you're a young man who feels that 

467
00:28:50,191 --> 00:28:55,191
sleeping around is wrong but never has 
the opportunity to do it,

468
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,850
then you can hardly attribute that to 
your virtue.

469
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,480
So a good union would say,
well,

470
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:05,730
you're just making a virtue out of 
advice.

471
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,200
It's just rationalization.
It has nothing to do with,

472
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,213
with virtue.

473
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,163
Okay.

474
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,153
Now if you are attractive to people and 
you decide that that attraction should 

475
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:24,190
only manifest itself within certain 
tight boundaries.

476
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,410
And that's a voluntary choice,
that's a whole different issue.

477
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,220
Now,
when you claims,

478
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:34,054
for example,
that you throw the baby out with the 

479
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:40,681
bath water when you're trying to develop
and become a socially personality,

480
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,123
that happens in a different way as far 
as he's concerned for each of the 

481
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:52,120
genders.
And so one of the prices young would say

482
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:52,954
that we pay,
and that this is a very modern idea in 

483
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:58,510
some ways for growing up

484
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,713
as a distinctly gendered society,
is that it's very easy for men to 

485
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,113
suppress and fail to develop,
to develop those elements of their 

486
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:12,540
character that might be considered 
classically feminine.

487
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,123
And it's difficult for women to develop 
and express those aspects of their 

488
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:22,950
personality that might be classically 
considered masculine.

489
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,433
And but so young believed that Nastad 
inside the shadow in some sense where 

490
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:32,430
the contra sexual capacities.
So for example,

491
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,433
for a man,
given what we knew about the 

492
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:38,190
temperamental difference between men and
women,

493
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,500
it may be that men could be more,
could develop the capacity.

494
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:48,450
For true compassion and care.
If they,

495
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,503
huh?

496
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,913
They could find that ability within what
they've thrown out in the shadow and 

497
00:30:55,761 --> 00:30:59,540
women for example,
could find the capacity to be aggressive

498
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,613
and assertive because that's part of 
what they threw out during their stage 

499
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,620
of their course of development because 
of,

500
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,240
because of it's a priori categorization 
as inappropriate behavior.

501
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,920
Now that doesn't mean that you thought 
that there was,

502
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,710
that people should be raised without any
gender identity.

503
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:19,544
That issue never came up for him.
He just thought that once you had 

504
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:26,000
established a personality that was 
sufficiently

505
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:32,740
develop to be acceptable socially and 
functional on the individual level,

506
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,570
then you could have the opportunity to 
expand that personality and to take into

507
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:43,571
yourself elements of,
of perception and thought and behavior

508
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,503
that

509
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,340
you wouldn't have had the sophistication
to be able to handle at an earlier stage

510
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,184
of development.
So young would say perhaps that if 

511
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:00,154
you're a male,
you have to become masculine before you 

512
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,570
could become feminine.
And if you are a female,

513
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,404
the reverse is true.
But that if your development only star 

514
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,420
stops with a narrow and categorical 
gender identity,

515
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,080
then there are elements that of,
of,

516
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,153
of being that you could draw on that 
aren't at your disposal and that will 

517
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:22,744
make you weak.
So the shadow breaks up into the Anima 

518
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,350
ananymous and the Anima is the female 
inside the mail,

519
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,184
so to speak,
in the animus is the male inside the 

520
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:36,334
female and you and believe that he could
see those partial spirits manifesting 

521
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:41,924
themselves in people's behavior.
And so he talked about a couple of 

522
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:50,330
typical behaviors that he thought were 
associated either with anema possession.

523
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,164
So that would be in the case of a man or
animus possession in the case of a 

524
00:32:54,051 --> 00:32:56,180
woman.
And so he would regard,

525
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,373
if you ever talk to someone who's female
who seems to respond to all of your 

526
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,014
propositions with nothing but 
argumentation for the sake of 

527
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:07,244
argumentation,
human would regard that as a 

528
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,230
manifestation of possession by the 
animus.

529
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,030
And if you ever talked to a man who
is

530
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,780
irrationally possessed by

531
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,750
okay,

532
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,583
second rate and few tile emotions,
then he would regard that as possession 

533
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:29,834
by the anima.

534
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,270
Okay.

535
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:36,220
So and you can see that if you watch for
it and if you believe in such things,

536
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,403
um,

537
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:38,550
yeah.

538
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,383
The best thing to do when confronted 
with someone who's Animus possessed is 

539
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:45,240
just shut up because you're not going to
make any headway.

540
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:48,900
Because the point of the argument of an 
Animus,

541
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:52,380
inspired argument is to get you to argue
not to win.

542
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,980
Because by getting you to argue the 
animus wins.

543
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,653
So and then behind those two things,
behind the shadow and the anima and the 

544
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,420
Animus,
there's a final archetype,

545
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:06,690
which is the archetype of the self.
And that's young,

546
00:34:06,691 --> 00:34:10,200
believed that the self was what you were
as a totality.

547
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,110
And that's a hard thing to understand 
but,

548
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,340
but you could think about it this way.
You could think about the self as the,

549
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,863
as the total of what you are now plus 
the total of all those things that you 

550
00:34:23,101 --> 00:34:26,340
could still be.
So it would be you as a reality.

551
00:34:26,341 --> 00:34:27,870
Plus you as potential.

552
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,360
And that's a strange idea,
right?

553
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,194
Because we don't really know how to 
understand the idea of potential as 

554
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:39,501
modern and empirical people because 
potential virtually by definition is not

555
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:40,944
yet manifest and also not a straight 
forward thing to either measure or 

556
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:48,270
conceptualize.
By the same token,

557
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:54,060
everybody acts as if they're,
they have potential unrealized potential

558
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,313
and so you know,
generated up a category to account for 

559
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:04,971
that which he felt was expressed in all 
sorts of symbolic weight.

560
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:08,850
So for example,
the wise old man,

561
00:35:08,851 --> 00:35:09,684
like like the wizards in the movies that
all of you have seen in the last five 

562
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,480
years,
it's always the same wizard.

563
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,314
Sometimes it's even the same actor.
It's like that's an archetype of the 

564
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:24,321
wise old man and for young Christ was an
archetype of the self as well.

565
00:35:25,561 --> 00:35:26,394
And I told you why that was to some 
degree and it's partly because the 

566
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:30,924
phoenix is also an archetype of the self
because the Phoenix is something that 

567
00:35:33,721 --> 00:35:35,040
can die and be reborn.

568
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,870
And so the Phoenix stands for the part 
of your that can let one thing go.

569
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,270
One part of you,
which is an ally live part,

570
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,343
can let that go and burn up so to speak 
so that something new can be born 

571
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,430
because you very seldom gain something 
before you let something else go.

572
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,533
That's partly because what you already 
assume can be the worst impediment that 

573
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,830
you have to work to learning something 
new.

574
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,910
And it's complicated because sometimes 
what you know worked in the past,

575
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,610
you know,
so you can think about that.

576
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,473
Maybe you're a perfectly well adapted 11
year old and you're still acting that 

577
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:14,550
way when you're 15 it's like,
well,

578
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,163
it's hard to let that go because it 
worked and you put a lot of effort into 

579
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:20,850
it,
but unless you let it go,

580
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:23,940
the new personality isn't going to be 
able to manifest itself.

581
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,163
So you have to stop being a child before
you can be an adult and there's a 

582
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:29,364
sacrifice that goes along with that.
It's also a sacrifice that parents have 

583
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,371
to make,
right?

584
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:33,204
Because in order for a parent to 
encourage you to adopt the 

585
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:37,704
responsibilities of an individual,
they have to allow you as a child to 

586
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:42,714
die.
And Freud's observation on that 

587
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:48,384
phenomena was that many parents and he 
believed this was particularly 

588
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:57,831
characteristic of mothers because of 
their tight bond with their children and

589
00:36:59,101 --> 00:36:59,934
the dependency that that implies that it
was particularly difficult for a mother 

590
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:04,914
to let her child die so that an adult 
could manifest itself in that child's 

591
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:10,134
place.
And that's fundamentally in many ways 

592
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:16,650
the oedipal complex.
Okay,

593
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,870
so now I'm going to show you some of 
these things again,

594
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:19,704
because the thing about young is that 
it's not easy to understand what he has 

595
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:27,810
to say and it's not a simple thing to 
explain it.

596
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,003
And his books are complicated,
although I don't think there are any 

597
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:36,150
more complicated than they have to be.
Like I don't think young is obscure.

598
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,780
I think he's just difficult.
And then beyond difficult,

599
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:40,614
he's actually frightening.
So there's lots of reasons that people 

600
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:44,064
don't like you,
and the fact that he's difficult and 

601
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:51,270
frightening are probably the two 
foremost objections.

602
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,104
I think the other thing that happened to
you that maybe slowed his acceptance as 

603
00:37:57,271 --> 00:38:01,170
an intellectual was that many of his 
students were women,

604
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,850
like his primary students and the people
who developed his ideas.

605
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,700
Many of the people who identity I,
um,

606
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,810
continued to develop his ideas after he 
died were women.

607
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:13,644
And that was perhaps not the most 
effective way of making headway in the 

608
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,450
academic world at,
at the time that he was alive.

609
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,183
So let's look at some things.
I'm going to show you some things from 

610
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:29,961
the lion king because the lion king
shows you archetypes everywhere.

611
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,990
So
let's do this first.

612
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,323
Okay.

613
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,363
Okay.
So the first thing that I would like to 

614
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:23,660
point out here is that this takes place 
at daybreak.

615
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,850
And daybreak is when the sun re-emerges.
And from an architectural perspective,

616
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:33,260
the sun re-emerges from a terrible Babel
that had had with the thing that devours

617
00:39:33,261 --> 00:39:36,980
the sun at night and it comes up again 
triumphant in the morning.

618
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:38,263
And so it's the dawn of consciousness 
and not that idea that the sun 

619
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:42,284
undergoes.
This battle is associated with the idea 

620
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:47,810
that you descend into unconsciousness 
when you sleep.

621
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,823
And magically you,
we reemerge from it in the morning and 

622
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,570
you do that in accordance with the sun.
So for you,

623
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:57,260
darkness is a time of unconsciousness 
and there's a tight relationship between

624
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,170
unconsciousness and darkness.
And so young would say,

625
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,723
people projected that idea.
It was an idea that was in there in 

626
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:06,920
their imagination,
that unconsciousness and darkness,

627
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,060
we're tightly aligned.

628
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,343
And so they use their imagination to 
explain the world and conceptualize the 

629
00:40:12,471 --> 00:40:13,304
sun in those,
uh,

630
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,173
in those terms of imagination.
So that if you analyze the terms of 

631
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:17,804
imagination,
you can get some understanding into the 

632
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:22,820
structure of the imagination.
And so that's one of them.

633
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,010
Consciousness and light are the same 
thing,

634
00:40:25,011 --> 00:40:26,480
illumination,
enlightenment,

635
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,763
all of those things.
And that's because we're primarily 

636
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:32,720
visual creatures and were conscious 
during the day.

637
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,850
And so this is a new beginning,
the new day,

638
00:40:34,851 --> 00:40:35,684
which is something that everyone also 
experiences because sleep washes away 

639
00:40:38,841 --> 00:40:41,720
the carers of the previous day.
Um,

640
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,723
and it does revitalize you.
We know perfectly well that if you 

641
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:47,240
deprive people of sleep for any length 
of time,

642
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,890
it's not good for them.
It,

643
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,753
it,
it,

644
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,990
it derails them entirely.
Deranged ranges them entirely.

645
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,440
So there is a reason that this movie 
opens with the dawn of the day.

646
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,923
Okay.

647
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,663
Okay.
So there's another re casting of the 

648
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:32,460
same idea,
right?

649
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:33,294
Except the also indicated that there was
an association between the dawn of self 

650
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:42,200
consciousness and the emergence of the 
light because the lyrics were,

651
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:43,034
when we step the day,
we stepped onto the planet and stepped 

652
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:47,810
out blinking into the light.
There's a,

653
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,273
there's a transition from 
unconsciousness to consciousness 

654
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:52,214
metaphor underlying that.
And so one of the statements that film 

655
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,824
is making,
or one of the ways that the film is 

656
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,064
trying to set you up to understand this 
as a story about the emergence of 

657
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:08,120
consciousness into the light.
Now you might say,

658
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,040
well,
did the film makers know all this?

659
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,630
The answer to that is a,
it depends on what you mean by no,

660
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,060
which is really of critical factor in 
this sort of discussion and b,

661
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,020
well,
yes,

662
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,003
and the re the way they manifested the 
fact that they knew it is because they 

663
00:42:24,531 --> 00:42:25,940
knew when things fit together.

664
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,250
So you know,
when you're writing a story or something

665
00:42:28,251 --> 00:42:29,084
like that or reading a story,
you know when the story is going well 

666
00:42:31,641 --> 00:42:32,151
you think,
yeah,

667
00:42:32,151 --> 00:42:33,440
that makes sense.
In fact,

668
00:42:33,441 --> 00:42:34,580
you don't even notice it,
right?

669
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:37,250
You just assume that everything's fine 
because it makes sense.

670
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,480
It doesn't jar you out of the narrative.
And so people are perfectly capable,

671
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,530
especially if they concentrated on it 
for long periods of time of assembling a

672
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:46,364
narrative with images that make sense.
Now they may not know why it makes 

673
00:42:50,991 --> 00:42:51,741
sense.
In fact,

674
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:52,574
if they're actually artists,
they don't know why it makes sense 

675
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,430
because they're,
they're ix,

676
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:00,920
they're expanding their capacity to 
comprehend and explain things well.

677
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,390
They're producing what they're 
producing.

678
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,224
They have to be moving beyond what they 
know cause otherwise they're just 

679
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:07,730
producing propaganda.
You know,

680
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:08,564
when there were elements of many Disney 
films that sync now and then into 

681
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:14,390
propaganda,
it's sort of conscious moralizing.

682
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,000
But when the films are really working,
they're not doing that at all.

683
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,133
And when,
when,

684
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,740
when they are consciously moralizing,
they're boring very quickly.

685
00:43:21,741 --> 00:43:24,140
Plus they date extremely rapidly.

686
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,343
Si.

687
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,063
Okay.
So that's a brilliant piece of film 

688
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:06,164
editing there because the the filmmaker 
sweep your eye along and then make 

689
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:15,200
something appear as a revelation and 
they do it at exactly the same time that

690
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:16,034
the music swells to a climax.
And that's indicating to you that 

691
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:21,350
something of tremendous importance is 
about to be revealed.

692
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,310
And so you see two things here.
The first thing you see is what's called

693
00:44:25,311 --> 00:44:27,440
pride rock,
which is a,

694
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,573
is a roughly peer middle shape at least 
to triangular shape that emerges in the 

695
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:36,330
middle of the landscape that actually 
serves symbolically as the center of the

696
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:37,164
kingdom are.
You can think about that as an Egyptian 

697
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,760
pyramid or you could think about it as a
dominance hierarchy.

698
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:44,190
It doesn't really matter.
It's both of those things.

699
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:45,203
It's also the thing on which the thing 
that the animals are subjugated to 

700
00:44:48,421 --> 00:44:49,940
stands right?

701
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,773
Cause that's where the king is and the 
king happens to be a lion and the lion 

702
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:55,620
is a solar beast.
It's always been a solar beast.

703
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,454
It's associated with the sun and it's 
the king of beasts because it's an apex 

704
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:02,430
Predator.
It's at the top of the hierarchy and for

705
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:03,264
whatever reason,
although obviously the lions in the 

706
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:08,360
animated movie are there are not 
actually lions.

707
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,203
It's important to remember that while 
you're analyzing the film because it's 

708
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:15,270
very easy to just think of them as lines
even though clearly they're not.

709
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,020
Now you also see this little character 
up in the right hand corner,

710
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,390
left hand corner,
and that zoo,

711
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,313
right and Zazu is the eye of the king 
and so the king is on top of the 

712
00:45:26,851 --> 00:45:27,684
pyramid,
but the king's eyes free from the king 

713
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:30,924
and the kid go where all over the place 
even where the pyramid can't see and 

714
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,240
that's the eye on the top of the 
pyramid.

715
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:38,460
You've seen that symbol everywhere.
No doubt.

716
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,503
It's the symbol that's on the back of 
the American dollar bill and there's a 

717
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:42,684
reason for it.
It's because the eye of the king is not 

718
00:45:44,731 --> 00:45:45,564
part of the hierarchy.
The eye of the king is something that's 

719
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:52,791
always free of the hierarchy and can,
can fly over all hierarchies and that's,

720
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,933
that's equivalent to the thing that 
could make its way up any hierarchy in 

721
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:03,300
some sense.
It's also the same as horace though.

722
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:06,390
The God of vision in the ancient 
Egyptian stories.

723
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,933
No.

724
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,021
Okay.
So there are,

725
00:46:18,021 --> 00:46:21,020
we've got the king and we will see that 
he's on top of the Rock,

726
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,063
which is where the king belongs.
He's also in full sunlight even though 

727
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:27,950
that's not characteristic of any of the 
other animals.

728
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,293
He's got his little bird there that 
tells them things because the king is 

729
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:33,104
someone who pays attention because the 
king who doesn't pay attention is a 

730
00:46:36,201 --> 00:46:41,201
tyrant and then the wind is blowing 
through the king's hair because the wind

731
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:46,250
is spirit.
And so the king is also something that's

732
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:47,084
associated with the everlasting spirit.
PNEUMA PNEUMA is the breath of air and 

733
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:53,720
it's also the,
the,

734
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,930
the essence of life from an 
architectural perspective.

735
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,273
So to be inspired is like risk.
Respiring to be inspired is to take in 

736
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:02,834
spirit and the kind of spirit that the 
king takes in is associated with the 

737
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:11,531
image of the wind.
Now you got to look at his face.

738
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,193
You remember before I was saying,
cause the animators do a very good job 

739
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,334
of this.
They gave him a very mature face and a 

740
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:25,600
mature phase is something out of which 
something is coming instead of something

741
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:26,463
into which something is coming.
And you'll see that the move Fossa is 

742
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:33,910
always looking like this.
He's very intent and focused and,

743
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:36,370
and um,
intimidating.

744
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,430
Whereas his son right up until he 
becomes

745
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,103
mmm

746
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,210
initiated is like this always as soon as
he becomes initiated.

747
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:49,744
And I'll show you that in the film,
his face hardens and it isn't until his 

748
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:52,804
face hardens that he can go back and 
fight scar who's basically a figure of 

749
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:56,764
the shadow.

750
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,613
Now originally this character we're Fiki
was going to be one of those typical 

751
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:15,451
sort of Disney kick buffoons that didn't
work out so well in the narrative.

752
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,684
And he ended up as a symbol of the self 
and Stan and Rick Fiki is obviously a 

753
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:25,120
showman and he's the part of the psyche 
that guides its transformation.

754
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:28,930
So here's another way of looking at the 
self is very interesting idea.

755
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:32,290
So you know,
as you go through life,

756
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,293
there was going to be triumphs and then 
catastrophes and when there's a 

757
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:36,394
catastrophe the psyche falls apart.
And then maybe it gathers its resources 

758
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:44,440
back together and pulls itself together.
It's going like this.

759
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,150
Well young would say the self is what's 
guiding that process.

760
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,984
So the ego feels it like this.
So that's triumphant catastrophe and 

761
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,840
triumph and catastrophe or tragedy and 
comedy.

762
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:58,450
But the self is the thing that's 
underneath all of it,

763
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,090
allowing those transformations to take 
place.

764
00:49:01,091 --> 00:49:04,460
And that's where Fiki and that's why 
he's associated as well with the sun.

765
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:20,370
So when he's a good king,
because he's in touch with the self.

766
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:25,760
So that makes him not something that's 
either serving his persona or his ego.

767
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,133
But you could say that what are you 
serving is a manner of ruling that 

768
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:32,394
allows for the appropriate amount of 
stability and transformation to take 

769
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:41,520
place in the kingdom so that it remains 
stable,

770
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,630
but also adapting to change.
And the king has guided,

771
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:46,464
did not buy the little bird who tells 
him what's going on in those places he 

772
00:49:48,991 --> 00:49:49,824
can't see.

773
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,130
Now that's clearly a Madonna and child.
The image.

774
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,813
Yeah.

775
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:07,610
And the reason for that is quite simple.
I mean,

776
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,781
you might think,
well,

777
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:11,210
why would the idea of the Madonna and 
child,

778
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:15,080
which by the way is a far older idea,
then the Christian representation of it,

779
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,840
there's lots of fingers of Madonna's and
Cha,

780
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,880
Madonna,
Madonna's and children.

781
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,400
Yeah.
In the ancient Egyptian art,

782
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:24,590
for example,
now the Isis with horace.

783
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:25,723
Well,
the reason that that's an archetype is 

784
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,333
any society who doesn't regard the dyad 
of mother and infant as something 

785
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,373
sacred,
which would mean of highest value is 

786
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:36,434
doomed obviously.
Because without that being held as a 

787
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:43,850
value,
the society will cease to propagate.

788
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:44,923
And that will be the end of it.
So if the society isn't structured so 

789
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:48,314
that,
that's that that dyad is up among the 

790
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:57,700
highest of values,
then the society is become ungovernable.

791
00:50:57,701 --> 00:50:58,534
He corrupt.

792
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,013
Okay.

793
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,973
So you see refuke you,
they're just anointed the little king 

794
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:25,990
with something that was orange.
And that was something like the sun.

795
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:26,824
So the idea that the film is expressing 
is that there's some sunlike substance 

796
00:51:30,851 --> 00:51:35,851
that's being associated with the,
with this new born son of the king,

797
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,290
and that that's,
uh,

798
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,403
a dramatic manifestation of his destiny.
And an indication that he asked also be 

799
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:46,003
in cultured because what Rafiq he is 
doing as a cultural act before he's 

800
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:50,200
going to be complete.

801
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:03,700
Now the sand is also an indication that 
he's mortal.

802
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,360
Now watch what happens here because this
film makers,

803
00:52:07,361 --> 00:52:08,194
I think they just nail this part.
So they're going to do the sweeping 

804
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:14,830
thing again and the music rises to the 
ultimate climax of the song.

805
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:20,250
And what's happening here is that the 
self is presenting this the sun.

806
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,413
And so it's a,
it's a presentation of the savior 

807
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:23,704
fundamentally.
And that's the thing that has just been 

808
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:26,650
born.
That's the hero.

809
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,873
And when the hero is presented and the 
sun breaks open wide and shines on 

810
00:52:31,961 --> 00:52:33,970
immune would call that a synchronous 
event.

811
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,163
And what happens is there's an emotion 
associated with that which you will 

812
00:52:37,661 --> 00:52:38,494
feel.
And it's at that time that all the 

813
00:52:39,581 --> 00:52:42,040
animals bow down and they do that 
spontaneously.

814
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:42,874
And the idea is that there's a hierarchy
here and the little boy in the sun is 

815
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:48,844
the highest element of the hierarchy.
And when that it manifests itself and 

816
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:56,560
you can see beyond the facade facade to 
something that's divine behind it,

817
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,640
the consequence of that will be a 
spontaneous bursting forth of law.

818
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:03,370
And I really think the filmmakers nailed
out here.

819
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:00,050
Okay.

820
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,600
Yeah,
so they hit that pretty hard there.

821
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:03,853
So there's also a nuclear family thing 
going on in the background that you 

822
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:11,741
might have noticed because of course the
little king has a mother and a father.

823
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,240
That's partly because that works better,
but also partly because the,

824
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,440
the archetypical hero is the son of 
culture had nature.

825
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,660
So okay,
so here's a,

826
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,950
here's a shadow figure.
Yeah.

827
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,890
Here he's represented here,
not so much a symbol as shadow,

828
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,090
although he's part of Simba Shadow.
He's represented as Mufasa is shouting.

829
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,810
And so it's quite a complex idea because
what it says is when,

830
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,980
when a king like organization grows up,
which means any organization,

831
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,650
anything that's a hierarchy and that's 
powerful,

832
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,723
there's a shadow element to it that 
tends towards totalitarianism and 

833
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:52,614
tyranny.
And that's represented often by the 

834
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:58,560
king's evil brother.
It was a very common motif in,

835
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,053
in mythologically based stories.
And the king is generally blind to his 

836
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:07,680
brother,
so often willfully blind.

837
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:09,990
Although that doesn't really seem to be 
the case in the lion king,

838
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:10,824
it's,
it is clearly the case that move well 

839
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:18,080
fossa underestimates the danger posed by
his usually older and smarter brother.

840
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,023
It's and,
and the miss very often make the case 

841
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:27,690
that the evil king is the older one and 
also the one that's more intelligent.

842
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,230
And the reason for that is that as far 
as I can tell,

843
00:55:31,231 --> 00:55:36,210
is that intelligence is something that 
can go very wrong if it goes wrong.

844
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:41,211
And one of its big temptations is that 
it produces models of the world and then

845
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:42,054
falls in love with the models.
And when it falls in love with the 

846
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:45,264
models,
that makes it totalitarian because it 

847
00:55:47,101 --> 00:55:47,934
believes that its constructions are good
enough so that there doesn't need to be 

848
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:52,194
anything else.
So it eliminates the necessity of the 

849
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:54,774
transcendent.
And that's definitely a characteristic 

850
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:59,100
of any totalitarian system.
It says,

851
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:01,980
this is everything we need,
and then you know,

852
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:07,010
if you happen to suffer or if you happen
to openly rebel against the system,

853
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:08,484
then you're regarded as an enemy of 
truth and then it's fine to do with you 

854
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:14,454
whatever might be done because 
everything worth doing is already been 

855
00:56:18,301 --> 00:56:19,134
done.

856
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,493
Yeah.

857
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,373
Now he's got an interesting facial 
expression and it's really worth 

858
00:56:38,551 --> 00:56:43,551
watching facial expressions in animated 
cartoons because they're not faces,

859
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,173
right?
What they are is the consequence of the 

860
00:56:47,941 --> 00:56:48,774
observations of extremely talented 
artists about how's people's faces 

861
00:56:52,531 --> 00:56:55,380
configure themselves over very long 
periods of time.

862
00:56:55,381 --> 00:56:57,300
Because these people are high level 
artists,

863
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:58,134
they know what they're doing,
and so they're able to distill down 

864
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:03,450
certain facial expressions to describe a
character.

865
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:05,970
Now this guy's obviously,
he's whiny,

866
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:08,970
he's got this supercilious and arrogant 
voice.

867
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,410
So He's,
he's,

868
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:11,244
he's arrogant beyond belief and he all 
is also hard done by and resentful and 

869
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:15,924
that's a really good,
and maybe he has a reason he's got a 

870
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:20,040
scar or something happened to them that 
wasn't good,

871
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,233
but he's taken on this attitude as 
resentful victim who really deserves to 

872
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:28,950
rule.
If only everyone could see how wonderful

873
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:30,900
he was.
And then he has all sorts of reasons why

874
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:34,650
the fact that he isn't powerful has 
nothing to do with his own shortcomings,

875
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,530
passes on his way.
He

876
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:13,020
doesn't matter if
they're looking at me that way.

877
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:22,743
Okay,

878
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,290
well as we can tell the eyes of the king
and scarred not friends.

879
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,280
And that's because scar doesn't really 
want to see what's going on.

880
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,550
Now here's an interesting little 
archetype.

881
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,073
What,

882
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,450
okay,
so that's quite interesting.

883
00:59:24,451 --> 00:59:26,610
There's a variety of statements there 
that are very,

884
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,830
very cool.
So one of them is

885
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:31,313
the kingdom is a bounded place and so 
that's playing off the idea of explored 

886
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:42,120
territory versus unexplored territory or
the known versus the unknown.

887
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:45,780
And the proposition there is that 
whatever the dominance hierarchy happens

888
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:48,450
to be,
it has a limited domain of

889
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,153
a limited domain of competence and the 
domain of competence is defined by 

890
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:57,943
everything that the light touches.
Now this is actually something that you 

891
01:00:01,491 --> 01:00:03,140
can notice in your own life.
It's,

892
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:03,983
it's quite interesting.
You'll see that if you move into a new 

893
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:10,880
place or a new neighborhood,
or if you do anything new at all,

894
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:16,130
that nothing that you haven't attended,
two is actually yours.

895
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:17,623
It will,
it will stay foreign in a sense and 

896
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,463
unfamiliar to you until you interact 
with it with a substantial amount of 

897
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:26,444
attention.
And that's partly because while you're 

898
01:00:27,981 --> 01:00:30,980
attending to it,
which is an act of conscious swill,

899
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,930
you're,
you're,

900
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,123
you're modifying your perceptions and 
your thoughts and your actions and your 

901
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:41,570
emotions to take it into account as a 
phenomenon.

902
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,570
And that means that you're competent 
there.

903
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:46,033
And it takes conscious effort to be 
competent because you have to practice 

904
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:51,800
being competent at a new domain.

905
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,130
And until you've practiced being 
competent in a new domain,

906
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,023
it's not yours.
And so this clip is showing what's 

907
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:03,560
basically an eternal truth,
which is that your territory is whatever

908
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:07,910
you've mastered and it's demarcated by 
everything you haven't mastered.

909
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:11,540
And in this particular representation 
that's associated with,

910
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:12,823
with death,
it's also associated in some bizarre 

911
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:18,350
sense with paradise.
Because of course,

912
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,640
Simba encounters the elephants grave out
in no man's land,

913
01:01:22,641 --> 01:01:25,370
so to speak.
But when he runs away across the desert,

914
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:26,204
he also finds paradise.
And so there's a paradoxical idea there 

915
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:29,474
that the unknown contains death and 
everything you need to make your life 

916
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:35,953
worthwhile.

917
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:54,200
Here comes the anima.
That's

918
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,220
okay.
So you see that cocky?

919
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,560
He's a cocky little rat here.
Okay.

920
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:09,561
So he's very confident,
but that's egotism and also persona.

921
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,280
Well,
it's no wonder he's confident.

922
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:12,750
He's the son of the king,
you know?

923
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:13,584
And the fact is that he has a position 
of dominance that he doesn't deserve 

924
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,530
merely because he was born into it.
And that's him.

925
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,980
Shallow and arrogant and possessed by a 
persona.

926
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:26,183
No,
this little figure who is basically an 

927
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:33,270
anima figure always knocks him down.
A peg continually knocks him down a peg.

928
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,110
How many of you seen groundhog day?
Yeah.

929
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,970
Yeah.
You remember in Groundhog Day,

930
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,480
Bill Murray's character is a real,
he's a jackass at the beginning.

931
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:45,240
He's very arrogant and he's very 
unskilled.

932
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,583
And then he gets stuck in the same day,
which is pretty funny because that is 

933
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,420
what happens to you if you're arrogant 
and unskilled,

934
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,580
you end up in the same damn day.

935
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,773
That's not fun.
And then in that day he becomes 

936
01:02:58,111 --> 01:02:58,944
attracted to this woman who's an anima 
figure and for for years as far as the 

937
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:04,074
films concern,
every time he approaches her in his 

938
01:03:06,721 --> 01:03:09,360
arrogant and clumsy way,
she slaps him.

939
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:10,703
So there's one scene in the movie where 
I think it lasts for about 30 seconds 

940
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:14,424
and it's nothing but clips of her 
slapping him probably 30 times at that 

941
01:03:18,901 --> 01:03:19,734
point.
You've seen him go through the same day 

942
01:03:21,241 --> 01:03:22,074
and the continually painful way that he 
does and she slaps him in those longer 

943
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:27,370
clips and after a while the film maker 
gets tired of that,

944
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,030
just shows you nothing but the slaps,
you know,

945
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:30,864
eventually he's brought so far down as a
consequence of being stuck in the same 

946
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:39,030
day and continually being slapped that 
he falls completely apart.

947
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,650
Right?
Then he tries to kill himself.

948
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:41,803
And one of the very comical things about
that movie is that that doesn't work 

949
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:44,640
either.

950
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,550
He just wakes up at the same day again.
And you know,

951
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:51,150
what that means in some sense is that if
you're too damn stubborn to change,

952
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:54,990
you will keep running into the same 
thing over and over continually.

953
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:57,960
And that's why you're in the same day 
because you won't let go of it.

954
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,340
And that might drive you even to 
question the value of your own being.

955
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,310
But that's also not a very useful 
adaptive strategy,

956
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,413
you know?
And it isn't till he starts to take his 

957
01:04:07,471 --> 01:04:12,120
rejection seriously that he starts to 
actually build some real character,

958
01:04:12,121 --> 01:04:12,954
right?
And then he starts paying attention to 

959
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,354
the day and finds out that there's all 
sorts of things that he can do during 

960
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,104
that day to make it rich and meaningful.
And as soon as he does that enough and 

961
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:24,540
becomes an expert at it,
poof,

962
01:04:24,541 --> 01:04:28,620
he gets out of the the day,
the same horrible day.

963
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:33,750
And they saw that horrible day is also a
representation of tier of the tyranny of

964
01:04:33,751 --> 01:04:36,870
the state because the state is something
that's static.

965
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,730
So anyways,
now la,

966
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:39,564
she's

967
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:46,773
was,

968
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:00,311
yeah,
and well,

969
01:05:00,311 --> 01:05:02,620
they're not paying attention.
They end up in the shadows,

970
01:05:02,621 --> 01:05:04,840
outside the kingdom.
So

971
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:07,323
here's,
here's that image of scar transforming 

972
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:12,604
himself essentially first into Hitler,
but because there's a lot of Nazi 

973
01:05:15,671 --> 01:05:18,760
imagery in this,
in this clip,

974
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:21,130
but also into a sate tannic figure at 
the end,

975
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,410
you'll see he's associated with the 
crescent moon.

976
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,590
So we turns into the horn demon of the 
night essentially.

977
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:34,450
Okay,
got

978
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:40,830
you.

979
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:43,270
See,
that's all images of hell obviously.

980
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:49,480
Alright,
come on board talks back.

981
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,490
Slide
my words.

982
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:10,183
See,
one of the things that happened to 

983
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:12,164
people like stolen for example,
is Stellan had nothing but contempt for 

984
01:06:14,901 --> 01:06:17,750
people and he thought all they ever did 
was lie.

985
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,230
Well,
what happened to Stellan is that he's,

986
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,240
he became surrounded by people

987
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:26,143
with to whom he could demonstrate 
contempt and who never did anything to 

988
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:30,044
them except lie.
Cause the reason for that was they were 

989
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:34,940
so terrified of them that they would 
never tell him the truth about anything.

990
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:38,420
And so he got into this spiral,
which is kind of the spiral of the,

991
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,613
of a paranoid psychopath where I 
distrust you so badly and set things up 

992
01:06:44,091 --> 01:06:44,924
so that you'll be punished so hard if 
you ever deviate from the appropriate 

993
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,980
line that you'll do nothing but lie to 
me.

994
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:52,190
And so then I'm fully justified my 
contempt and sort of,

995
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,310
it's like Peter pan in some sense,
king of the lost boys.

996
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:58,000
It's like,
well who do you want to be king of while

997
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,700
the route that scar took,
which is the negative archetype.

998
01:07:01,701 --> 01:07:02,534
The shadow root means that he's king,
but you know he's King of Hell and all 

999
01:07:05,631 --> 01:07:06,464
he's God are these brainless minions.
And so you know he's King of people he 

1000
01:07:10,641 --> 01:07:14,030
wouldn't want to associate with.
It's not exactly a,

1001
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:16,923
it's not exactly,

1002
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:03,220
I'm about
to

1003
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:14,070
start quizzing me.

1004
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:45,110
So you,
you,

1005
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:45,944
you may remember or you may not remember
that or who may not know that Hitler of 

1006
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:54,791
course set up the war,
the biggest meeting arena that the world

1007
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:59,240
had ever seen for the Nuremberg Nazi 
party rallies.

1008
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,370
And there's,
there's something to see.

1009
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:06,170
They were filmed quite brilliantly in a 
film called will to power.

1010
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:07,853
I think that's what it's called,
Leni Riefenstahl and what Hitler has 

1011
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:13,214
arrayed in front of him,
our blocks of thousands of soldiers 

1012
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:20,480
everywhere as far as you can see an 
absolutely perfect

1013
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,670
uniformity,
and that's the idea,

1014
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:28,120
because if you're already right,
nothing has to be different.

1015
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:30,610
Everything can be the same as the 
perfect thing.

1016
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:34,870
The problem with that is you're not 
right and things have to change.

1017
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:35,913
And Hitler,
he was a master of the use of fire as 

1018
01:09:38,111 --> 01:09:40,750
well,
and also put as displays on at night.

1019
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:46,200
And so he took all the Luftwaffe is 
error craft spotting spotlights,

1020
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,650
which were huge,
massive lights,

1021
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,900
maybe they must have been 20 feet 
across,

1022
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:54,093
and he had them all lined up behind him 
on the stage and they would shine miles 

1023
01:09:57,791 --> 01:09:58,624
up into the sky.
And so he would address these thousands 

1024
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,870
and thousands of people in this 
nighttime ritual with a curtain of light

1025
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:09,040
behind him that was several miles high.
It's an unbelievably powerful pageant.

1026
01:10:09,041 --> 01:10:12,640
And the people who made this film or 
drawing on on that

1027
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,840
to produce these images.

1028
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,770
Modern people will say things like,
well,

1029
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:14,963
the idea of hell is just a superstition,
but then you watch this and it makes 

1030
01:11:18,661 --> 01:11:19,494
sense and then you think,
well hell is where Satan himself rules 

1031
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:25,164
and nothing happens but the body's 
burning death and that's exactly what 

1032
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:29,244
happened during the Holocaust.
And so thinking that these sorts of 

1033
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:33,114
archetipal ideas are superstitious is 
it's extraordinarily foolish and naive 

1034
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,943
because they represent possibilities of 
being that continually manifest 

1035
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:44,490
themselves and everyone knows about 
them.

1036
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,580
So you know the,
the,

1037
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:48,473
the,
the implicit idea here is that if you 

1038
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:54,660
take the path that scar torque,
which is one of resentment and deceit as

1039
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:57,370
well as arrogance,
which are three major motive,

1040
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,240
major,
major shadow motivators,

1041
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,060
then you'll end up at best ruling over 
hell.

1042
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:06,060
And it's no joke,
like it's not a superstition.

1043
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,140
The stories are trying to tell you 
something,

1044
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:11,160
that,
that his mode of being is the pathway to

1045
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:11,994
perdition and,
and that the things that happen there 

1046
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,993
are so terrible and so deep that the 
only way you can really express them is 

1047
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,673
using the kind of imagery that we've 
come to associate with religious and 

1048
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:28,011
religious imagery in a sense is imagery 
that cannot be made more powerful.

1049
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:31,080
That's what makes it archetipal.
It's like a limit.

1050
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,140
You can't go past it in terms of the 
representation.

1051
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:39,410
And so when you represent the ultimate
destiny of evil as eternal hell,

1052
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:41,154
where all the bodies burned forever and 
there's nothing there except demonic 

1053
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:44,543
chatter,
that's about as far as you can go in 

1054
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:49,230
terms of your capacity to represent 
something.

1055
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,820
But it's representing something.
So when you can say,

1056
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:55,290
well,
it's an eternal place,

1057
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,530
while that's because this possibility's 
always there,

1058
01:12:58,531 --> 01:13:01,500
it never goes away.
It's always there.

1059
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,370
And that's also what makes it 
archetipal.

1060
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,073
And do you know that because otherwise 
you wouldn't be able to understand the 

1061
01:13:09,521 --> 01:13:12,970
story and everyone knows it.
Otherwise this story wouldn't be,

1062
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:17,200
I still believe it's one of the top 10 
grossing films of all time.

1063
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,670
So obviously it makes sense.
Okay,

1064
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:24,190
well I'd like to show you a lot more,
but,

1065
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,640
but I can't,
so we'll see you Thursday.

1066
01:13:33,501 --> 01:13:37,100
I'm going to post some sample questions 
on the website

1067
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,660
very soon tonight,
possibly tomorrow morning,

1068
01:13:41,661 --> 01:13:44,090
possibly somewhere around there.
So check it out.

1069
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,430
Neil gets some sense of what the exam's 
going to be like.
