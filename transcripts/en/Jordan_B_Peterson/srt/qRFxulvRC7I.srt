1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,810
Okay.
So today we're going to talk about

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,230
Oh,
openness.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,233
Now

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,580
you might say in some sense that 
openness is the last discovered that the

5
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,414
big five traits,
and it's also the one I would say that 

6
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:21,400
comes up most weekly in the factor 
analysis.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,273
Um,
when hands ising formulated his trait 

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,870
representation,
which was extroversion,

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,870
neuroticism and psychotic system,

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,073
he,

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,383
he felt that he encapsulated all of the 
fundamental variation in human 

12
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,711
personality and he was loath to include 
intelligence as a personality trait.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,310
Now the relationship between 
psychologists,

14
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,144
ISM and openness is rather complex.
Isaac basically felt that people could 

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:58,680
be extroverted and that would be the 
positive dimension.

16
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,850
It could be,
you know,

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,684
high in negative emotion.
That'd be the negative emotion 

18
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,754
dimension.
And that they also could have a 

19
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,530
predisposition to psychosis.
And I guess that would be,

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,143
he was thinking about the brain systems 
that underlie schizophrenia and that 

21
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,613
that tendency to,
to dissociate and develop 

22
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,134
hallucinations,
but also maybe the system in human 

23
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:26,070
beings that are affected by 
hallucinogenic drugs,

24
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
which seem to affect human beings 
differently than they have other 

25
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,130
creatures.
So,

26
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:32,964
but Isaac psychotic cism.
Eventually it was broken down into low 

27
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,194
agreeableness and low conscientiousness.
It didn't predict the predisposition to 

28
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,570
psychosis at all.

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,830
And later factor analysis found that you
could load out

30
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,290
intelligence and creativity as a 
personality dimension separately.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,030
Now it's a bit tricky because you have 
Iq measures.

32
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,493
Iq measures are much more direct 
measures of intelligence than the 

33
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
personality measures.
I mean the personality measure is 

34
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,600
something like,
do you think you're smart?

35
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,123
You know,
I mean I'm being a bit flip about that 

36
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,720
because it's more sophisticated than 
that.

37
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,660
But when you talk about someone as a 
smart person,

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,500
you're generally referring to the trait 
that we would describe as openness.

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,080
You also are doing that when you refer 
to the,

40
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,233
to creativity as a,
as a predisposition and you could 

41
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:27,714
measure the smart part a lot better with
Iq and Iq is also a pretty good 

42
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,350
predictor of creativity.
So

43
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,310
well,
so let's see how they're associated.

44
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:43,311
So he remember that
you have your big two traits,

45
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,060
stability of plasticity and stability 
breaks down into conscientiousness,

46
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:49,800
emotional stability and agreeableness.

47
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,640
And then you can see how each of the 
aspects are correlated,

48
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,474
how highly they're correlated.
So industriousness and orderliness at 

49
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:59,130
about 0.4,
volatility,

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,320
withdrawal and emotional stability or 
neuroticism actually,

51
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,573
um,
about 0.6 and agreeableness and 

52
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,664
politeness at about 0.4.
And then the next trade is extroversion 

53
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
and openness that makes plasticity and 
people who were high in plasticity tend 

54
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,874
to be good entrepreneurs by the way.
And extroversion rates into 

55
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,153
assertiveness and enthusiasm correlated 
at about 0.5 and then openness and 

56
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,590
intelligence and the correlation there 
is lower.

57
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,424
It's 0.35.
The average correlation between the big 

58
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:40,741
five is 0.2 and the correlation between 
the big two is about 0.2 and so you have

59
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,060
to remember,
you might ask yourself,

60
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,894
well,
is it correlation of point for twice as 

61
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,250
large as a correlation of point to 
announce to that is no,

62
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,220
because you have to square them to 
compare the marath medically.

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,520
So correlation of point to give you 
0.044% squared,

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,873
right?
And of correlation port four gives you 

65
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,304
16% squared.
So there's actually a difference of a 

66
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,784
factor of four.
And so you need to remember that when 

67
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,114
you're considering effects sizes so that
you can understand exactly what they 

68
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,724
mean.
Now you know if you're accounting for 

69
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:21,520
16% of the variants,
which would be a correlation of 0.4 then

70
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,354
that leaves 84% left unexplained.
But that's a bit of an overstatement 

71
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,731
most of the time in psychology because 
our measures are are rather imperfect.

72
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,263
And so for example,
if you give someone a personality test 

73
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,144
and let's say that the validity of their
self report is about 0.6 and 0.7 which 

74
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:45,574
is probably what it is,
maybe it might be a little bit higher 

75
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,510
than that.
So that's,

76
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,463
that means that they're self reporting 
is only picking up 50% of the variation 

77
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,320
in their personality.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,630
And if you pick up,
you know if,

79
00:04:58,990 --> 00:04:59,823
if your are,
if an are derived from that measure 

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,273
accounts for 16% of the variance.
In some sense it's twice as powerful as 

81
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:10,840
it appears to be because the measure is 
so error retinal and a lot of the things

82
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,930
that we measure in psychology,
our error ridden.

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,773
And what that means is that the 
correlations are generally what it 

84
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,100
means.
Although not in variable,

85
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:18,934
he isn't.
The correlations are bigger than they 

86
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,430
look.
In any case,

87
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,473
the correlations that come up in 
personality research are certainly big 

88
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,824
enough to be meaningful.
And I would say meaningful in terms of 

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,833
predicting major life outcomes and 
predicting important economic outcomes 

90
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:37,420
and that sort of thing.
So all right,

91
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:42,421
so
one of the things you might ask yourself

92
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,520
is exactly what does intelligence 
measure.

93
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,880
So we'll start with intelligence from,
from the,

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,860
and that would be equivalent to 
intellect,

95
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,610
roughly speaking.

96
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,443
So intellect in the big five,
the aspect seems to be associated with 

97
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,140
interest in
whereas the openness proper aspect seems

98
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:06,371
to be associated with aesthetic 
sensibility and creativity.

99
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,070
That's the best way to think about it as
far as we've been able to figure out.

100
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:10,904
And the biggest relationship is between 
the intellect and intelligence as 

101
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,063
measured psychometrically.
Now intelligence is an interesting 

102
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,830
concept.
It's very controversial.

103
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,990
In fact,
if you,

104
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,463
one of the things that continually 
happens over and over again in 

105
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:30,164
psychology is that psychologists 
discover all sorts of new kinds of 

106
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,374
intelligence and you know,
the biggest two proponents of that sort 

107
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,114
of thing.
I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came 

108
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,920
up with this thing he called practical 
intelligence and then Howard Gardner who

109
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:45,140
came up with the theory of multiple 
intelligences,

110
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:49,130
which had a very large effect on 
educational psychology.

111
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,040
Um,
when the theory was first proposed.

112
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,933
And that's not saying much because 
generally speaking it's very difficult 

113
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,144
to find a discipline that's more 
susceptible to fads than educational 

114
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,750
psychology.
And as far as I can tell,

115
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,840
generally speaking,
each fat is worse than the previous one.

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,790
So you know,
Gardner positive that I think there were

117
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,140
seven,
oh there they are,

118
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:16,070
seven or eight different intelligence as
linguistic,

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,210
musical,
logical,

120
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,340
mathematical,
spacial body,

121
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,940
kinesthetic,
interpersonal and interpersonal.

122
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,133
And people talk about emotional 
intelligence and they talk about 

123
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:29,240
practical intelligence.
And as far as I'm concerned,

124
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,620
all of that's complete rubbish.
And there's technical reasons for that.

125
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:36,770
I mean there's technical and 
philosophical reasons for that.

126
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,220
The first thing is you can't just mess 
up a word.

127
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,473
You know,
the whole point of having a word is so 

128
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:43,694
that it defined some things at described
some things and doesn't describe other 

129
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:47,474
things,
right?

130
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,403
And so you can,
you can make the word intelligence a 

131
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,510
comment for whatever you want.

132
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,410
So you can say that the ability to dance
as a form of intelligence.

133
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,223
But the problem with that is you blur 
out the word so bad that you can't tell 

134
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,580
what it means anymore.
And so,

135
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,414
and I would also point out we had 
perfectly good words for those major 

136
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:12,971
intelligence as we called them talents.
And so it's perfectly reasonable to make

137
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:15,860
a distinction between the talent and 
intelligence.

138
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,000
Now you might say,
well,

139
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:19,520
how the hell do you know the difference?
Like if,

140
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:24,110
if things look similar to some degree,
then how do you know if they're the same

141
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,420
or different?
Well that's exactly what you do when you

142
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,254
do the construct validity process.
So let's say you rated a number of 

143
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,054
people on their dancing ability and then
you rated the number of people on their 

144
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,060
ability to multiply two digit,
two,

145
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:42,620
two digit numbers in their head quick 
while then you see,

146
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:46,010
technically if both of those were 
intelligences,

147
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,233
then the people who could dance better 
could multiply two digit numbers faster 

148
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:55,250
in their head and they would be slightly
positive.

149
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,430
Sorry.
See,

150
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,530
that's what happens when I don't have 
any diet coke.

151
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,123
So anyways,
if intelligence was the right word to 

152
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:09,054
subsume both of those,
then what you'd see is that would be a 

153
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,194
high correlation with people who are 
good dancers would also be the ones who 

154
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:20,541
could multiply most rapidly.
And I mean multiply in their head.

155
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,430
Um,
but that,

156
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,290
but you're not going to be able to 
extract out a single factor like that.

157
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,020
It's just not,
it's just not the case that those things

158
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,030
associated like that.
So for something to be one phenomena,

159
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,600
the things that it,
hmm,

160
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,910
obviously I've talked too much this 
semester.

161
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,490
All the things that are subsumed under 
that definition has to be correlated and

162
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:59,280
highly correlated because otherwise 
they're not the same thing.

163
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,670
It's the definition of the same thing.
Now,

164
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,504
Rq is a very peculiar construct,
a very unique construct from a 

165
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:10,974
psychological perspective,
but also more generally from a social 

166
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:14,724
science perspective because Iq has the 
most predictive validity of anything 

167
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:22,500
ever discovered in the social sciences 
period.

168
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,490
Now the other thing that is interesting 
about our Iq is that a lot of the people

169
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,300
who were interested early in the 
measurement of intelligence,

170
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,243
we're engineers turned psychologists and
the engineers have actually had quite a 

171
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,224
whopping effect on psychology.
Part of the reason that psychology has 

172
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,670
an advanced methodology and advanced 
statistical techniques is because we got

173
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:51,120
invaded by engineers in the early part 
of the 20th century.

174
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,013
And so the engineer has made our 
measurements much more rigorous than 

175
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,070
they would've otherwise been.

176
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,990
And it's been a huge advantage.
I mean,

177
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,010
one of the things that's happening to 
psychology is that starting to eat other

178
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,844
disciplines,
so it's had a massive effect on 

179
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:08,100
economics and it's going to have a 
massive effect on political science.

180
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:08,934
And the reason for that is because we 
know how to measure things and it 

181
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:13,770
actually turns out to matter that you 
know how to measure things.

182
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,023
Obviously.
I mean if you're going to be talking 

183
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,570
about something that's specific and well
defined,

184
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,633
first of all,
if you can't make it specific and well 

185
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:25,500
defined,
all you can really do is argue about it.

186
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,870
And you know there are better and worse 
arguments.

187
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,704
But the problem is is that just because 
an argument is good doesn't mean it's 

188
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,364
right and that's a big problem.
So also something to remember when 

189
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:42,090
you're arguing about people that you 
have relationship with because you know,

190
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:44,670
if you happen to be better at 
structuring your arguments and your more

191
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,504
verbally fluent man,
perhaps more assertive and maybe less 

192
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,950
agreeable,
you're going to win the arguments.

193
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,750
But that doesn't mean you're right.
It's unfortunately,

194
00:11:53,751 --> 00:11:57,470
it's not that simple.
And so as far as I can tell me,

195
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:58,304
empirical process is the only way of 
getting rid of that is restricting or 

196
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:07,550
eliminating the catastrophic,
the detrimental effects of pure theory.

197
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,603
No and

198
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,020
well,
and our measurement techniques have been

199
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:14,130
pretty good about that.
Okay.

200
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:18,270
So now what happens with Iq here?
I can define Iq for use,

201
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,060
just so you know what it is.
So

202
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,650
imagine that you had a library of 
questions.

203
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,880
So here's some questions.
So there's millions of questions in this

204
00:12:32,011 --> 00:12:32,844
data bank.
What's two times 68 what's the capitol 

205
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,850
of Georgia?
What's the definition of hyper tricks?

206
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:42,390
Anemia?
What comes after in this sequence?

207
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:44,250
Two four eight 16

208
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,170
yeah,

209
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,003
remember these numbers?
So I'd tell you the numbers and then 

210
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:50,004
you'd have to tell me the back.
Two (413) 576-1215 1418 2022 and then I 

211
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:01,320
might ask you in fact to remember them 
backwards.

212
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,080
And that's a working memory task.
So,

213
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:06,450
okay,
so those are all questions that require,

214
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,270
they require abstraction and mental 
operations.

215
00:13:09,271 --> 00:13:12,660
That's the key as far as I can tell.
So you might say,

216
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:13,494
well,
exactly what constitutes and 

217
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:15,594
abstraction.
And it looks to me like what an 

218
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:18,894
abstraction is.
There's the capacity to formulate an 

219
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,043
abstraction and there's the capacity to 
manipulate them to formulate an 

220
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,374
abstraction.
I think what you do is you take a 

221
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:30,660
phenomena and you represent it with 
something that's low resolution,

222
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,850
that's more or less what an abstraction 
is.

223
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:37,851
So for example,
if I imagine this classroom later,

224
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,780
um,
my,

225
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,793
my imagined representation is going to 
be a much lower resolution than the 

226
00:13:44,611 --> 00:13:45,444
actual classroom,
but it's sufficient for certain 

227
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:49,044
purposes,
just like a thumbnail on a computer is 

228
00:13:51,151 --> 00:13:53,010
sufficient for certain purposes.

229
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,390
And then once I simplify the,
the,

230
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,583
the phenomena in question,
then I can also perform certain 

231
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,173
operations on it,
say in imagination or semantically and 

232
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:09,720
the capacity degenerate.
That abstraction and the trends and make

233
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,970
the ability to manipulate those seems to
be the core element of intelligence.

234
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:18,030
And I think part of the reason why 
intelligence,

235
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,570
roughly speaking as a human dimension,
although you know,

236
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:23,190
obviously you can,
you can,

237
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,653
you can to some degree rank order 
animals in terms of their capacity to 

238
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:28,764
learn.
But there's this whopping 

239
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,840
differentiation between human beings and
animals in this area,

240
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,690
particularly is because we can use 
abstractions.

241
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,553
Now,
I heard a woman named Temple grandin 

242
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:42,120
speak once and it was very interesting 
talk.

243
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,570
She's very autistic.
And,

244
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:46,920
uh,
but very,

245
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,240
very,
very brilliant,

246
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:49,074
which is not very common for people who 
are artistic because usually it's 

247
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,544
associated with it,
a substantial amount of intellectual 

248
00:14:54,141 --> 00:14:54,620
impairment.

249
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,453
But she also had an extraordinarily 
devoted parent who spent almost all of 

250
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,250
her time trying to pull her daughter out
of her autistic isolation.

251
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,713
Now,
grandon has gone on to become a 

252
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,820
University of Chicago professor,
and she works in the,

253
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,420
in the agricultural area,
and she has redesigned the mission,

254
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,790
the chutes walkways basically that take 
cattle to the slaughterhouse.

255
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,260
And she's done that to make them less,
much less stressful for the animals.

256
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,840
And part of the reason that she can do 
that as far as she's concerned,

257
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,674
is because she thinks like an animal.
And what that means as far as she can 

258
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:34,250
tell is that she cannot generate an 
abstraction,

259
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,680
not easily.
Now she could speak.

260
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:38,690
So obviously she learned to do it to 
some degree,

261
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,524
but she talked more about inner talk,
more about deficits and imagination or 

262
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:43,484
concrete [inaudible] of imagination.
So one of the weird things that you see 

263
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:48,980
with autistic kids,
not frequently,

264
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,430
but now and then it's actually a famous 
example of this on the web.

265
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,773
There's a guy,
I think he's from Britain and you can 

266
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:56,084
take them in a helicopter and fly him 
over a city and then he can stand in 

267
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:03,410
front of a paid piece of paper,
like 12 by eight start anywhere and draw

268
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,900
the entire city,
you know,

269
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,630
and now,
and then you see autistic savant who are

270
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:11,750
children who can draw perfectly 
realistically.

271
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,410
And so maybe they'll draw a horse and 
they don't even start the horse.

272
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,270
Like a kid would,
like a normal kid would,

273
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:20,450
would sketch the outline of the horse 
and put some eyes in,

274
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,643
you know,
they start anywhere and make the horse 

275
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,110
perfectly detailed.
And,

276
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,840
and what Clarendon claimed was that,
so she said,

277
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:30,920
okay,
you think of,

278
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,240
think of house or think of church.
And she says,

279
00:16:35,241 --> 00:16:37,220
what comes to mind if you think of 
church?

280
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,330
And maybe she'd say,
well,

281
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,040
you'd get this little image of something
that's sort of shaped like this with a,

282
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,173
you know,
a steeple on top or across or something 

283
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,140
like that.

284
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,900
And that's the church.
And so maybe you think of house and it's

285
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:49,100
like a little kid's house,
you know,

286
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:49,934
it's gonna,
it's got a rectangle and a parallel and 

287
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:55,340
Graham and that's not a Parallelogram,
whatever the hell you call that thing on

288
00:16:55,341 --> 00:16:56,174
the top.
And then it's got a chimney with smoke 

289
00:16:57,801 --> 00:16:58,760
coming out of it,
right?

290
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,560
Two windows and a door house.
Yeah.

291
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,540
But there,
there are no houses like that.

292
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,710
Like each individual house looks a lot 
different than that.

293
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,260
And so in order to have that conception 
of house,

294
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,094
what essentially what you have to do is 
you have to take the class of all 

295
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,484
possible houses and extract out the 
features that are in common across all 

296
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,250
of them.
And that's an abstraction.

297
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,230
And so as far as Grandin's concerned,
she doesn't have obstructions like that,

298
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,020
which when you ask her to remember to 
think of church,

299
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:31,220
she remembers at Church it's always 
singular instances.

300
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,920
Now,
the thing about human beings is that,

301
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,293
you know,
we perceive singular instances to some 

302
00:17:38,151 --> 00:17:38,984
degree,
although I think our abstraction 

303
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:43,130
capacity all often interferes with our 
ability to do that.

304
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:46,970
But we also perceive abstractions.
And you can kind of tell this,

305
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:50,550
if you're ever trying to learn to draw,
like if I say draw a hound,

306
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,110
you guys,
most of you,

307
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:52,944
unless you have artistic training,
you're going to draw up what's 

308
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,940
essentially a hero glyphic hand.
And I,

309
00:17:57,941 --> 00:18:00,720
I think the drawings the children come 
up with aren't drawings.

310
00:18:00,721 --> 00:18:01,554
I think their hero glyphs,
they're abstracted representations that 

311
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:08,040
are quasi linguistic.
They're not artwork there.

312
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,420
They're pro prodo language.
Right?

313
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,190
And so,
and here are glyphs,

314
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,024
of course,
we're one of the earliest forms of 

315
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,010
written language.
It makes sense.

316
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,780
Cause if you want to communicate about 
something,

317
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,640
why not draw an image?
You know?

318
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,740
And then the eventually the image turns 
into a word.

319
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,573
But I actually think that's,
I think that's the developmental 

320
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,570
progression of language among human 
beings.

321
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,660
It's the abstract,
that image first and then it's the word.

322
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,420
Um,
anyways,

323
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:31,800
you know,
if you drew a hand,

324
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,610
you'd like to draw a hieroglyphic hand,
five fingers or maybe even four,

325
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:36,840
right?
Because that's what they do.

326
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,703
That's what animators do.
You can't fit all those sausages on one 

327
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,190
circle,
you know,

328
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,250
so they just simplify it down to four 
and no one even cares.

329
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:46,830
You Watch an animation automated 
program,

330
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,360
which is highly abstracted,
right?

331
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,194
I mean,
homer Simpson looks nothing like an 

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,653
actual person,
like really tremendously unlike an 

333
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,250
actual person that's completely 
irrelevant,

334
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,170
you know,
after two or three seconds,

335
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:01,740
it doesn't matter at all.
Which is also why I think three d movies

336
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,574
never really,
it's never a technology that's ever 

337
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,900
caught on.
It's after the first four seconds.

338
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,733
Who the hell cares?
It's irrelevant whether you see it in 

339
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:10,734
three dimensions because you don't need 
much information to actually structure 

340
00:19:13,441 --> 00:19:14,970
your perception.
Now,

341
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,630
if you want to see your hand,
weirdly enough so that you can draw it,

342
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:21,330
you have to snap out of your normal mode
of perception.

343
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,463
I find it's often a lot easier to do 
that with one eye closed because it 

344
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:25,524
flattens it out and then you have to 
stop looking at your hand as if it's a 

345
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,514
hand.
You have to look at it again like it's 

346
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,910
an object.
And as soon as you do that it's actually

347
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:35,520
rather shocking cause it's such a 
strange looking thing.

348
00:19:35,521 --> 00:19:36,354
Like if you,
if you put your hand in a non-canonical 

349
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,670
position that's a canonical position,
I would say you put your hand in the non

350
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:44,640
canonical position and then look at it.
It's,

351
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,410
it's the weirdest shape thing.

352
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,243
It's quite shocking to see it.
And then you can draw it once you can 

353
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,620
actually see it like that.
But before that you're pretty much stuck

354
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,450
in hand.
So,

355
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,003
so anyways,
I think what happens with intelligence 

356
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:03,090
is that people are capable of 
abstracting and then they can manipulate

357
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,180
abstractions.
And so let's take another look at,

358
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,710
at what abstractions might be.
So

359
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,433
now part of the reason I think that 
abstraction is so useful is because 

360
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,153
things are really,
really complicated and it's going to be 

361
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,890
a lot more difficult to manipulate.
The actual thing that to manipulate some

362
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:22,260
represent to div,
abstraction of it.

363
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:26,970
So if you could get an abstraction that 
that captures the gist of the entity.

364
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,490
Now how would we do that is not exactly 
obvious,

365
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,520
but if you can then you can expand a lot
more resources,

366
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:34,770
concentrating on the relevant parts of 
the,

367
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,420
of the entity and a lot last time 
concentrating on the irrelevant parts.

368
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,820
So you know,
so for example,

369
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:46,440
if you ask a child to draw a house,
what color the house is is irrelevant.

370
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,360
Now why it's irrelevant.
It's not exactly obvious.

371
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,194
I guess it's because color can vary 
across houses and color varies across 

372
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:54,604
all sorts of other things.
And so color turns out to be a non 

373
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:00,070
canonical element of house so you can 
just dispense with it.

374
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,080
When you're thinking about a house,
you'd say,

375
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:03,940
well it doesn't matter what the into 
houses,

376
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,793
it's still a house.
So what exactly defines those features 

377
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:09,424
that make something a house rather than 
something else or are not that easy to 

378
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,390
figure out?
You know,

379
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,260
you could say,
well,

380
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,120
how's has four walls and a roof?
And those are the external walls.

381
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:22,360
And I guess you could identify the 
minimal necessary components,

382
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,760
but even that's not so,
so simple.

383
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,163
And you could say a house is also 
something that someone lives in which 

384
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:30,574
allows you to put caves as houses 
because caves obviously share very 

385
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:36,280
little in common with you know,
a standard house.

386
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,473
So my,
my point is is that it's difficult 

387
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,264
exactly to figure out what set of 
features we do use to determine whether 

388
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:47,860
something is a member of a class.
There's this guy named,

389
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:48,780
uh,
gigger answer,

390
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,910
who's thought about this a lot and he 
thinks that we,

391
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,540
that there are a combination of 
objective and functional basically.

392
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,374
And that enables us to do things like 
come up with the category of things you 

393
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,250
would take from your apartment if it was
on fire.

394
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,890
It was really interesting category,
right?

395
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,724
Because most of the things that you're 
going to take bear very little 

396
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:09,484
resentment.
It's hard to see why they make a 

397
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,160
category.
Pets,

398
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,870
family members probably in that order.
Um,

399
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,750
photo albums,
identification.

400
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,490
What else might you take if you were 
your phone,

401
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,353
I suppose,
what else would you take out of an 

402
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,320
apartment during the fire?

403
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,303
Well,
you guys would be out on the street 

404
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,060
stark naked obviously,
so well you get,

405
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,470
the point is that,
you know,

406
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,333
those things that are just mentioned 
seem to share very little in terms of 

407
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,574
objective features in common.
But there's some reason that they still 

408
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:43,330
cohere as a category.
All right,

409
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:45,280
so anyways,
why do you need to abstract?

410
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,620
Well,
because you can handle the complexity of

411
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:48,454
the world better.
Even your perception is a form of 

412
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:51,190
abstraction.
You know,

413
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,024
because when you look at someone,
a lot of the abstraction has done for 

414
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,550
you because you just can't perceive very
well.

415
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:59,320
But when you look at someone,
first of all,

416
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,160
you only see the surface of them that's 
facing you would not the other surface.

417
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:06,670
So that's a big limitation.
You only see them now in this,

418
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,310
you know,
split second rather than extended across

419
00:23:09,311 --> 00:23:10,144
time.
You don't see any of their micro 

420
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,650
structure right beyond the,
beyond the,

421
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,033
you know,
general pattern of the physiology at 

422
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,200
this level of resolution.

423
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,770
You don't see anything below that.
I can't see yourselves or your organs or

424
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,604
anything like that,
which is actually a real problem often 

425
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:26,944
for us.
And I can't see the systems that you're 

426
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,350
part of.
So right off the bat just to proceed,

427
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:34,480
gives you a low resolution 
representation.

428
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,240
And a lot of that's limitations of your 
processing.

429
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,074
Your eyes just can't zoom in that far.
You don't have the cortical capacity to 

430
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:42,670
improve your vision,
you know,

431
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,010
plus how much do you really want to see 
at one time,

432
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,540
no more than necessary,
whatever that means.

433
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,880
And evolution seems to take care of that
problem.

434
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,780
So your perception abstracts for you 
right away.

435
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:54,614
But then I would say maybe you make a 
leap from perception to conception or 

436
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:58,883
something like that.
And so that would be the leap from the 

437
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:05,330
perception of the actual object to the 
image of the object and then a leak from

438
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:07,340
the image of the object to the word.

439
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,910
So it looks to be like a word is a 
representation of an image,

440
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,570
which is a representation of an object 
or situation.

441
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,643
It's something like that.
So and you need those because you have 

442
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:21,470
to deal with the complex world.
So here's,

443
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:22,304
here's one way of thinking about it.
So look at the top left corner of that 

444
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,310
diagram.
So I called that the thing in itself and

445
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:29,901
what it is,
is,

446
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,420
is an array of dots,
roughly speaking.

447
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,860
And I think there's 360 dots there.
And you might say,

448
00:24:36,861 --> 00:24:39,560
well,
and then if it was a real world object,

449
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,900
you could imagine that would be in three
dimensions.

450
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,033
Not to cause that's too,
and it would be transforming because it 

451
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:48,590
would be also extended across time.
So,

452
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:49,424
and it would have micro structures that 
were far smaller than that and macro 

453
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,600
structures that were far bigger.
But so even that is an abstraction.

454
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,750
But it's,
I'm,

455
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,630
I'm using a fairly complex abstraction 
to rip represent the thing in itself.

456
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,580
That's the thing.
You cannot proceed,

457
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,680
right?
What something actually is,

458
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,514
you just get an image and then the next 
five things are ways you could look at 

459
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:12,500
that.
So you could say,

460
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:13,520
well,
it's a rectangle.

461
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,820
You could say it's four rectangles and 
forget about the dots.

462
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,570
You could say that it's,
I think that's 16 lines or what is it?

463
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:23,780
32 lines,
a 24 lines.

464
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,963
So if you are going to,
if that thing in itself was an orchard 

465
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:31,850
and you are going to walk north,
south to north through it,

466
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:32,684
that would be a good representation.
You know those would be corridors 

467
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:36,554
roughly speaking.
And then object for is a combination of 

468
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:43,370
object one and object to,
and then object five is well all of it's

469
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:46,490
blurred out are the little groups of six
dots.

470
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,000
And so you might say well what is that 
thing?

471
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,910
And then answer is well it's any of 
those five things.

472
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,360
And so that's an interesting way of 
thinking about it too because one of the

473
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:57,194
things that shows you is that you can 
disagree about what something is right 

474
00:25:59,421 --> 00:26:02,120
at the level of perception.
And then you might say,

475
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:04,670
well which of those is the best 
representation?

476
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,540
And the first answer might be well the 
most complex one,

477
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,790
the top,
the one on the left hand corner.

478
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,624
But that's not necessarily the case.
It might depend on what you want the 

479
00:26:14,571 --> 00:26:16,400
representation for.
Like,

480
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,780
imagine.
It's weird.

481
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,940
It's weird because imagine you have a 
map.

482
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,980
Okay.
And so you think,

483
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,173
well,
I'm going to make the best map in the 

484
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,330
world.
And so you make a map that's exactly the

485
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:30,350
same size as the territory that it 
represents and has all the detail.

486
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,813
Well that's not any use at all.
That thing because you could just use 

487
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:36,920
the territory.
Right?

488
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,783
So you know the,
just because as a map gets increasingly 

489
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:46,530
detailed to some degree,
it's increasingly useless as a map.

490
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,693
And so what you need is this weird 
combination between accuracy and 

491
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:51,324
simplicity.
And so you want your map to be no more 

492
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:57,660
complicated than is necessary to take 
you from point a to point b.

493
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,973
That's it.
So because otherwise it wouldn't be 

494
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,094
simple to use and the additional 
complexity would eliminate the utility 

495
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:07,050
of the,
of the map.

496
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,393
So,
so you might say that what we're trying 

497
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,304
to do with our intelligence is to get 
what we need with the least amount of 

498
00:27:14,641 --> 00:27:16,590
effort possible.
And,

499
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,993
and you know,
there's a sort of a Piagetian idea 

500
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,830
that's lurking behind that,
which is,

501
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,700
well you don't want,
you have limited resources,

502
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:27,534
you don't want to expend any more energy
than is necessary and you want to build 

503
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:31,554
representations of the world that 
suffice to keep you going now and then 

504
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:36,774
next week and next month,
and then you know alone and then in 

505
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,820
groups.
And so you build a representation of the

506
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:45,600
world that has some concordance with the
thing in itself,

507
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:46,434
but has this functional simplicity so 
that you could actually use it in the 

508
00:27:49,471 --> 00:27:51,090
real world.
All right,

509
00:27:51,091 --> 00:27:51,924
so back to this diagram.
So I've got the object and five 

510
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:59,910
representations and then there are ways 
of representing it linguistically at the

511
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:00,744
bottom.

512
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,283
So

513
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,660
what that is,
the words are basically a simplification

514
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:08,730
of something that's already simplified.
So okay,

515
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:09,564
so intelligence seems to have something 
to do with the process of functional 

516
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:15,990
simplification.

517
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,393
Now back to the library of questions.
So you have this database of questions 

518
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,400
and so then what you do is pull out a 
hundred questions randomly.

519
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,713
All right?
And you want to pick out a hundred 

520
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:34,744
because if you just pick out one,
like if I asked you what the capital of 

521
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:38,644
Georgia was and I asked you what the 
capital of Georgia was and you got it 

522
00:28:41,141 --> 00:28:44,560
wrong and you got it right,
I couldn't really say with any degree of

523
00:28:44,561 --> 00:28:45,394
certainty that that means that you have 
more intelligence because the 

524
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:52,540
probability that I get an accurate 
measure with one question is quite low.

525
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,540
But if I use three questions while then,

526
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,803
you know,
I would,

527
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,763
I would start to become,
my measurement would start to become 

528
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:04,740
less error written and if I use 10 would
even be better.

529
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:08,430
And if I use 20 for a personality 
questionnaire,

530
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,370
the rule of thumb,
and this is just a rule of thumb,

531
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:15,270
is that if you don't have 20 questions 
in the questionnaire,

532
00:29:15,271 --> 00:29:19,440
then you don't have enough questions to 
really generate a reliable measure.

533
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,993
So you'll still,
you'll still see single item measures 

534
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,490
used in psychology,
but um,

535
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,820
you can add additional accuracy by,
by increasing the number of items.

536
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,360
I designed an Iq test a while back and 
we got a pretty good,

537
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,300
we've got pretty good reliability and 
pretty good validity.

538
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,450
Reliability as you know,
you the same set of people twice and the

539
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:46,000
rank order of their performance stays 
the same.

540
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,460
So if you've got 90 on the previous 
test,

541
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,330
you'd get 90.

542
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,870
And if you go up 95 because you're more 
intelligent in this example,

543
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,080
if you've got 95 and the last one you'd 
get 95 on this one.

544
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:59,020
So that's reliability.
You can get a pretty,

545
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:01,780
we could get a pretty reliable Iq test 
with nine items,

546
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:06,520
but it was substantially improved with 
17 and with increments,

547
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,354
you know,
you get uh,

548
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,410
uh,
what would you call it?

549
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,870
Diminishing returns.
So a hundreds,

550
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,280
plenty.
Okay.

551
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:13,114
So you pull out a hundred questions and 
then you take a hundred people and you 

552
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:21,130
give them those questions and then you 
score them right and wrong.

553
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:23,920
That's all there is.
And then you sum the scores.

554
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:26,080
Okay.
So basically that,

555
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,550
that miss some behaves like the average.
Let's say you average the scores just to

556
00:30:30,551 --> 00:30:33,640
make the argument a little bit more 
straight forward.

557
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,630
You average the scores.
And so each of you gets the average of,

558
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,663
you know,
uh,

559
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,390
calculated across the Times that you 
were right and wrong.

560
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,300
So it's an approximation of the 
frequency of your,

561
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,193
of how right you were.
And then we rank order you one to a 

562
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,920
hundred.
That's Iq,

563
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,550
that's all there is to it.
So now people say Iq doesn't exist.

564
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,570
Well that's annoying because all they're
doing is gerrymandering.

565
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,540
The definition of the word exist,
you know,

566
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,650
cause you can do that if you ask if a is
equivalent to be,

567
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,100
the answer is it depends on what you 
mean by a and what you mean by be,

568
00:31:16,101 --> 00:31:16,934
it's almost always a foolish question 
because you can take b and a and bend 

569
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:24,190
them and twist them in such a way that 
you could make one thing and other thing

570
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,024
without too much problem.
People usually get around that by only 

571
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:30,280
using a word in a context,
right?

572
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:31,114
In a sentence or a phrase or a paragraph
that defines the word so that you can't 

573
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:36,550
weasel around like that.

574
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,080
But,
but more specifically in psychology,

575
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:43,240
we have methods to tell if something is 
real.

576
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,000
You know,
and psych,

577
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,340
if Iq doesn't pass the test of reality 
for a psychological measure,

578
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,443
then no other psychological measures 
passed the test because they're 

579
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:59,770
validated exactly the same way Iq is and
they don't work as well.

580
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,760
So you can say,
well no that's not real.

581
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:04,594
But then you have to throw out,
you probably have to throw out the 

582
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,474
social sciences completely insofar as 
they're actually sinuses because the 

583
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,930
same statistics are used to generate 
their findings.

584
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,973
So you can't just say,
well this really powerful thing doesn't 

585
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,374
exist.
Well a bunch of these weak things exist 

586
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,220
and they're measured the same way.
You don't get to play that game.

587
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,320
So,
okay,

588
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:25,450
so does it exist?
Well you could measure it,

589
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,110
you can measure it reliably.
So that's definitely something you know,

590
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:31,450
cause you might say,
well does your shadow exist?

591
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,853
Well generally speaking,
under normal conditions you could 

592
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:37,810
envision your shout a relatively 
reliable,

593
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,380
you know,
does it exist?

594
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,840
Well it passes one test of existence.
You know,

595
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,230
you can't be detected with a number of 
senses.

596
00:32:48,231 --> 00:32:51,410
You can't touch it for example.
But you know,

597
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:54,140
whether or not something exist is 
actually a rather tricky question,

598
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,263
but

599
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:06,650
you can measure it and it's useful and 
that's not a bad definition of,

600
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,810
of exist.
So what's it good for?

601
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,733
Well,
it predicts major life outcomes and 

602
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,820
importantly,
so,

603
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,900
and we can talk about the power of 
intelligence momentarily.

604
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
If you were actually going to calculate 
an Iq score per se,

605
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,403
you would take the rank order that I 
just described and you would correct it 

606
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:37,940
for age because you know,
you can't really expect a seven year old

607
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:41,450
to know as much as it,
if the year old or a 20 year old.

608
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:44,780
So generally speaking,
if you take a technical Iq test,

609
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,333
it will rank order you,
but it'll only rank order you with 

610
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:51,170
people of the same age as you.
So that's just another,

611
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,610
you know,
it's an additional correction.

612
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,713
Whether or not that actually gives you a
more accurate estimate of Iq is depends 

613
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,730
on what you mean by accurate.

614
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,140
Uh,

615
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,140
very bright seven year old
generally doesn't know enough to do much

616
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,130
useful in the way of work,
but they can learn extremely quickly.

617
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,353
And so,

618
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,963
mmm.

619
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,673
If you compared seven year olds to 
people of other ages purely in terms of 

620
00:34:20,301 --> 00:34:21,134
their score on an Iq test,
there's a high probability that you 

621
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,060
would underestimate their speed of 
learning.

622
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,673
By the same token though,
by the time you were 40 you have a lot 

623
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:35,351
of accumulated knowledge and so if,
if you only measure learning speed,

624
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:37,154
then you would underestimate,
you would overestimate that seven year 

625
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:45,310
olds advantage over the 40 year old
Iq is basically a unitary phenomenon,

626
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,550
but you can fractionated into,
it's very,

627
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:53,384
very complicated
for reasons that I'll tell you about in 

628
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,033
a minute.
If you had to divide Iq into to the way 

629
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,364
you would divide,
it would be into crystallized and fluid 

630
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,334
intelligence and fluid intelligence 
would be roughly the ability to learn 

631
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,423
and crystallized intelligence would be 
roughly a measure of how much you've 

632
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:13,964
learned.
Now those are separate to some degree 

633
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:18,260
and here's why.

634
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,900
They're separate.
As you age,

635
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,460
your capacity to learn decreases.
It's quite ugly.

636
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,833
So by the time you're about 24 you're 
starting to get stupider from the 

637
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,544
perspective of being able to learn.
And that's just pretty much a linear 

638
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:36,740
trip downhill until you depart the 
world.

639
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,070
So it's,
it's,

640
00:35:38,071 --> 00:35:41,700
it's nasty to see cause it's quite a 
steep degeneration.

641
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,743
You can stave that off by the way with 
the cardiovascular and cardiovascular 

642
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:47,874
exercise and weightlifting.
So that's the best way to keep your 

643
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,533
learning capacity intact.
It's not to do cognitive exercises and 

644
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:57,060
stood in physical exercise and then as 
you age,

645
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,043
then the amount you know goes up.
And what happens is those two things 

646
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:05,970
actually tend to average out.
So now you might say,

647
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:09,450
well if I'm claiming that Iq,
is this a unitary thing,

648
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:10,284
how can I make the claim that you can 
divide it into two elements and that 

649
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,660
those elements are in some sense 
separate.

650
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,190
And I think the reason is for this,
so your,

651
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,140
your prefrontal Cortex,
roughly speaking.

652
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:24,720
So that's the part of your brain here 
forward.

653
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,943
You can think about,
in part it's the part that does the 

654
00:36:27,991 --> 00:36:30,930
programming of motor activity,
voluntary motor activity.

655
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,153
But it also seems to be,
so let's say you're doing something new 

656
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,563
and you're pretty clunky and awkward at 
it and then you do it more and more and 

657
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,374
you get smoother and smoother and 
smoother at it and you know what you 

658
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,021
have taught,
monetize it.

659
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:43,854
What happens is you're using your 
prefrontal cortex and to some degree 

660
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,670
your whole right hemisphere when you're 
first doing it.

661
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,680
And then as you get better and better at
it,

662
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,410
the ability shifts to the left and then 
it goes backwards.

663
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,873
Um,
so what's happening to some degree is 

664
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,114
your prefrontal cortex is programming 
the rest of your brain and you could 

665
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:07,350
think of fluid intelligence as a measure
of the ability of your,

666
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,680
of your brain to program itself and 
crystallized ability as a measure of how

667
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:15,930
much programming is there.

668
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,890
And then so are separate in that manner 
because they perform separate functions.

669
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:24,570
But then you can also understand that 
the better your program or is the better

670
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,020
the programming is going to be.
So that inflates the correlation.

671
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,423
And so you can have two separate things 
functional functionally that are even 

672
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:34,074
dissociable in terms of age.
But because they worked so tightly 

673
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,104
together,
it's like how fast can you dig a hole 

674
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,420
and how big is the pile of dirt?
Well,

675
00:37:42,421 --> 00:37:45,450
obviously those two things are different
in some important sense,

676
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:46,284
but they're going to be highly 
correlated because the faster you can 

677
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:50,910
take a whole,
the bigger the pile of dirt and so,

678
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:52,853
so anyways,
crystallized intelligence is often also 

679
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:55,914
often measured as verbal intelligence,
but the better measure s fundamentally 

680
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,590
is crystallized intelligence.

681
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,470
Now you know how we looked at the I the 
personality hierarchy,

682
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:11,130
right?
That was this

683
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,420
and what you see is three strata,
roughly speaking aspect,

684
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,540
trait super factor and it looks like the
super factors.

685
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,384
I would say
the validity of those super factors is 

686
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:28,764
not yet clear.
You can get a lot of useful prediction 

687
00:38:31,741 --> 00:38:35,260
by looking at the traits and there's 
more and more evidence.

688
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,170
There's about 400 studies now using the 
aspect.

689
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,633
There's more and more evidence that you 
can also derive additional useful 

690
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:47,671
predictive validity from differentiating
the personality down to the,

691
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,770
to the,
to the aspect level.

692
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,770
That's the highest resolution 
personality model we have.

693
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,893
There are people who claim that there's 
something at the apex which you might 

694
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:02,500
call good personality,
but I don't think so.

695
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:04,720
I think it's,
I don't think so.

696
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,180
You'd have to read the literature to 
understand the,

697
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,080
okay.

698
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,913
The dispute.
It's a statistical dispute roughly 

699
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:12,490
speaking.
But um,

700
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,013
we've found in our research that 
stability and plasticity early 

701
00:39:16,151 --> 00:39:18,280
correlated that 0.2 they're pretty 
separate.

702
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,520
So I'm going to stick with that for now 
even though it might be wrong.

703
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,103
What?

704
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,960
Okay.
So

705
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,240
see how I would explain this problem.

706
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:11,200
If you read the cognitive literature and
the neuropsychological literature,

707
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,840
you will find that neuropsychologists 
tend to assume that,

708
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:17,710
okay,

709
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,710
there are forms of cognitive ability 
that you cannot describe as Iq.

710
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,990
Okay.

711
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:28,470
And they make that claim because they'll
take a test and they'll,

712
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,463
they'll use the test to measure 
something and then they'll correlate 

713
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:35,200
that with Iq and the correlation will 
only be about 0.2 or 0.3.

714
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,453
And so they'll say,
well that's not a high enough 

715
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,500
correlation.

716
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,310
Okay.

717
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,390
To justify saying that those things are 
identical because the correlation should

718
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:45,460
be more like 0.8 for them to be 
identical.

719
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,750
But the problem is,
let's say I had a measure of your Iq and

720
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:51,910
your Iq and your Iq,
your Iq,

721
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,463
and then I asked you two questions and 
you and you and you and I summed your 

722
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,860
answers whether they were correct or 
incorrect.

723
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,113
Now what would happen is there'd be some
correlation between your total score on 

724
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:05,914
those two questions and your overall Iq.
Maybe it would be 0.3 but that wouldn't 

725
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,534
justify me in claiming that the two 
question Iq test is different than the 

726
00:41:16,011 --> 00:41:18,830
full scale Iq test.
It's just worse.

727
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,500
Okay?

728
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,333
You're going to run into this problem 
when you read psychological literature 

729
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:25,154
and if you ever do it,
do any research because it's very 

730
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:31,040
difficult to determine whether you get 
what's called discriminant validity,

731
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:31,874
which is this thing measures this,
this thing measures this thing and 

732
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,990
they're actually different,
or whether you just have a lousy measure

733
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:41,990
of this and the lousy measure this and 
so the correlation is low.

734
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:47,830
Now here's a neuropsychological test
and you could make the case that this is

735
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,583
measuring something different than Iq.
So imagine you see an array of 12 

736
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,440
pictures.
They're just drawings,

737
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,140
drawings of a telephone and a boot and a
chair.

738
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,700
Just calm and objects.
Okay,

739
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:05,534
so you see 12 of them and then you have 
to click one and then when you do that 

740
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,083
they move and then the next time you 
have to click one you haven't already 

741
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,074
clipped and then they move again and you
click and they move again and you click 

742
00:42:18,621 --> 00:42:21,860
and you'll see by the time you get to 
about eight of them,

743
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,410
you're starting to run into trouble 
because it's,

744
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,280
it's difficult to remember more than 
eight abstractions simultaneously.

745
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,430
Seven actually in some people claim it's
as low as four.

746
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:32,264
That's the capacity of working memory,
which is why we kind of like phone 

747
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,224
numbers to be seven digits long.
A lot of the things we want to just 

748
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:43,361
remember r s r seven units long and if 
we want to remember more than that,

749
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,670
we chunk.
Although you know,

750
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:48,260
if I show you some dots,

751
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,213
okay,

752
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,800
say,
well how many doors?

753
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:54,630
Three.
You don't have to count them.

754
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,520
You can see three dots.

755
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,813
You can see four dogs.
It's not obvious that you can see five 

756
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:05,804
dogs at that point.
You start to go three and two and then 

757
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:10,274
if there's six dots,
well that's how they would be arranged 

758
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:15,620
on a dice dice,
right?

759
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:16,454
The reason they'd be reached on a dice 
that way is because you could see two 

760
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,690
sets of three and for six,
you know,

761
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:25,100
if they're sort of randomly dispersed 
like that,

762
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,870
I say,
well how many dots is that?

763
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:28,100
One?
You have character.

764
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,910
And what that shows you is that your 
working memory,

765
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:34,280
which is really a function of fluid 
intelligence,

766
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,560
is a very,
very narrow thing.

767
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:38,180
And it's like your vision,
you know,

768
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,170
remember we saw the gorilla video,
right?

769
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:42,920
Then you can only pick up the thing that
you're attending to.

770
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,200
Well,
working memory is like that.

771
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:46,034
It's this narrow,
narrow form of attention and it's sort 

772
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:50,930
of specifies unitary phenomenon.

773
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,330
I mean that's not coining unitary,
but it's close enough.

774
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,270
And I think the reason that it does 
that,

775
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:56,104
it's like why is your attention so 
narrow is because often what you're 

776
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:02,690
trying to do as you work in the world,
just to make binary choices,

777
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,333
you know,
you don't want to choose between 20 

778
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:05,954
things you want to read.
You want to choose between two things 

779
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,730
because then when you choose between two
things,

780
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,100
you can actually act.
If it's still two things,

781
00:44:13,101 --> 00:44:15,050
you can't act.
If it's one thing you could act.

782
00:44:15,051 --> 00:44:15,884
So imagine you go into Chinese 
restaurant is a good example because 

783
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,210
Chinese restaurants virtually always 
have like 400 items on the menu.

784
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,150
And you might ask yourself,
well how the hell do you figure out what

785
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:26,984
you want?
And what you don't do is go through 

786
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:33,180
every single menu item and contemplate 
it because you'd be there for a week.

787
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,420
So what you seem to do is eradicate 
chunks.

788
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,613
So you might say,
well I'm not in the mood for anything 

789
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:42,420
but fish.
Okay Bang,

790
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,090
three quarters of the menu disappears,
you know,

791
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:46,260
and then you might go,
well I,

792
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,220
I don't want it branded whack.
And then another half is gone.

793
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,890
And now you're down to maybe eight 
choices and you know,

794
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:55,560
you reduce that to four and then to to 
perhaps,

795
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:59,220
well I'd like this or I'd like that,
but the waiter doesn't care about that.

796
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:00,443
The waiter wants to know which one you 
want because until it's reduced to one 

797
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,020
you don't get to act.
And so the reduction,

798
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:07,854
the reduced narrow strip that we use to 
perceive the world and partly as a 

799
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:13,044
consequence of processing inadequacy,
but it's also partly because we really 

800
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:19,110
are trying to reduce things all the time
to zero in one,

801
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:19,620
right?

802
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,260
Yes or no.
So okay,

803
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,094
so back to the,
this three stratum theory of cognitive 

804
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:26,010
abilities.
Now

805
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:33,080
you've got this array of 12 items and it
keeps shifting.

806
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:33,983
And what I would do is score you by the 
number of duplications you if you pick 

807
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:41,010
the same item more than once,
you lose a point.

808
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:43,590
So the maximum points you can get is 12 
and you know,

809
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,020
people usually make three or four 
mistakes.

810
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:48,600
And so I could take your score on that 
test.

811
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,000
Maybe I'd give it to you two or three 
times just to make sure.

812
00:45:51,001 --> 00:45:51,834
I have a reasonably stable indicator and
then I can correlate it with your full 

813
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:55,464
scale fluid Iq and I get a correlation,
but both put two five or 0.3 now if you 

814
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:03,390
don't know anything about psychometrics,
you'd say,

815
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:04,224
oh well that's obviously measuring 
something different than full scale Iq 

816
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,370
because it only correlates that 0.25 or 
0.3 but what it turns out is no,

817
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:15,390
it's more analogous to the problem that 
we were just talking about where I asked

818
00:46:15,391 --> 00:46:18,900
you three questions and tried to derive 
your entire icu from that.

819
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:19,943
It's just a bad measurement.
Now what happens is if you take the 

820
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:27,510
neuropsychological tests that people 
have developed that theoretically assess

821
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,490
the function of different parts of the 
brain,

822
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,770
so and you factor analyze them and you 
extract out a single factor,

823
00:46:34,771 --> 00:46:35,604
the single factor it looks exactly like 
fluid intelligence now is exactly the 

824
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:41,940
same as fluid intelligence.

825
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,223
It would be the onus would be on the 
person who claims it's not to 

826
00:46:48,571 --> 00:46:49,404
demonstrate the difference.
We did give university students have a 

827
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:57,231
very extensive battery of prefrontal 
cortical tests and measured their Iq.

828
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,224
And then we use the prefrontal cortical 
test average and the Iq to predict 

829
00:47:02,671 --> 00:47:03,504
grades.
And what we did find was the prefrontal 

830
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,730
tests predicted over and above the eye 
Iq,

831
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,660
but we thought maybe
if you don't,

832
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:17,580
the prefrontal average and the Iq and 
you added them to to predict grade,

833
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:22,080
say that's a regression analysis they 
both added in so they predict,

834
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:25,170
they predicted different parts of the 
variation.

835
00:47:25,171 --> 00:47:27,930
It added additional youth necessary 
information.

836
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:28,973
However,
if you took all the neuropsychological 

837
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,453
tests and all the individual Iq tests 
and you put them in one data set and 

838
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:40,510
then extracted out a single factor is 
that will be fluid intelligence,

839
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:43,690
roughly speaking,
that predicted grades very well.

840
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,030
And then what was leftover didn't 
predict it all.

841
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,770
So what we concluded was that 
neuropsychological tests,

842
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,590
prefrontal cortical tests,
test intelligence,

843
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:58,620
and they test a slightly different thing
than fluid intelligence tests do.

844
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:01,810
But that isn't because they're testing 
something different.

845
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:06,010
It's because fluid intelligence tests 
the way they're currently constituted.

846
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,110
Don't sample the universe of potential 
questions as well as they should.

847
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,650
So it wasn't that we discovered 
something different.

848
00:48:14,651 --> 00:48:15,484
We discovered a measurement error 
roughly speaking that only took five 

849
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:18,821
years.
By the way,

850
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:19,654
it took five years to figure that out.
It was very annoying because when we 

851
00:48:22,751 --> 00:48:25,990
started,
I was trying to predict grades,

852
00:48:25,991 --> 00:48:26,824
you know,
and I didn't know the ICU literature 

853
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:32,920
very well at that point because 
psychologist don't usually teach it very

854
00:48:32,921 --> 00:48:36,070
much because Iq bothers the hell out of 
everybody.

855
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,910
And so,
and the neuropsychologist who have their

856
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:42,140
own field are,
you know,

857
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:45,610
they are motivated to make the claim 
that they've discovered something new.

858
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:49,420
And I just took that on face value.
But then we tried to predict like,

859
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:50,254
okay,
if I'm going to predict how well you do 

860
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:51,904
at your job,
well I want to get a good cognitive 

861
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:57,460
measure because if it's a complex job,
because if it's a complex job that keeps

862
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:00,310
changing and you have to learn to keep 
up and if you can't do that,

863
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:01,144
you're not going to do very well.
So that would be bad for you and it 

864
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:04,144
would be bad for everyone around you.
And so we were trying to pick up 

865
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:12,450
additional information that would enable
that,

866
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,690
the accuracy of that prediction to be 
increased and looked at the neuroscience

867
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,553
literature.
But at most it was an ambivalent 

868
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,950
success.
Okay.

869
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,410
So how does that relate to this?
Well,

870
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,590
at the bottom tier where it's the most 
differentiated,

871
00:49:26,591 --> 00:49:27,424
you have single tests and there are only
correlated with each other at about 

872
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:32,680
point to maybe 0.3.

873
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:33,730
So you might say,
well,

874
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,460
they're all measuring different things.
It's,

875
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,413
they're not,
they're all measuring the same thing 

876
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:39,580
badly.
And then you might clump them.

877
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,510
So let's say I ask you,
Oh God,

878
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:45,200
maybe I give you a test that,
uh,

879
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,123
asks you,
tested your vocabulary with six letter 

880
00:49:49,121 --> 00:49:49,954
words and then I gave you another test 
that tested you vocabulary with seven 

881
00:49:52,271 --> 00:49:55,360
letter words and another one that tested
you vocabulary with eight letter words.

882
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,411
And I said,
well,

883
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,910
those are all different tests.
Well,

884
00:49:57,911 --> 00:50:00,700
they would correlate quite high,
not perfectly,

885
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,900
but I could clump them together and make
one sort of super test out of them.

886
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,734
And then I could take super test a and 
super testy and super test B C and look 

887
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:11,224
at the correlations between those.
Those would climb to about 0.5 or 0.6 

888
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:17,050
and then if I clump the super tests 
together,

889
00:50:17,051 --> 00:50:20,380
which would be happening by the time we 
got destroyed him to there,

890
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,633
then the correlation between the tests 
would start to rise to about 0.7 and 

891
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:28,520
then if I collapsed all the super tasks 
into a single measure,

892
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:29,803
then the correlation between any of 
those stratum to tests and g cause that 

893
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:35,210
would be the highest level thing.

894
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:36,043
G is general intelligence.
That's roughly speaking fluid 

895
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:41,690
intelligence.
The correlation between any of the super

896
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:46,670
tests and gene would be about 0.8 so the
point of all this,

897
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,913
there's no way of discussing this sort 
of thing without doing it statistically 

898
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:54,890
and technically because there's 
statistical and technical processes.

899
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:55,724
So what happens is is that now let's say
now you have a measure of fluid 

900
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:01,970
intelligence.
Okay,

901
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:07,030
you've got this measure and you take one
of the stratum two sets of tasks and you

902
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,620
use both to predict academic 
achievement.

903
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,540
What happens is that the super factor g 
kills the rest of them.

904
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,673
You're just not going to be able to find
any of the tests in the bottom strata 

905
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,140
that are going to add to the prediction 
of what the general factor can give you.

906
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,950
Now with with with personality,
that's just not the case.

907
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,813
You can't pull out a single factor that 
predicts how personality is going to 

908
00:51:32,391 --> 00:51:33,620
influence jobs.

909
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,350
You know,
performance across your life.

910
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,213
If you add neuroticism,
if you take the single factor and you 

911
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:41,684
add neuroticism,
neuroticism is going to kick the single 

912
00:51:43,821 --> 00:51:44,654
factor out.
Conscientiousness is going to kick the 

913
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:49,220
single factor out and so forth because 
there isn't a single factor.

914
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:50,683
It's not,
the tests aren't highly correlated 

915
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,460
enough to say that they're all measuring
the same thing to some degree.

916
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,440
The personality traits really are 
different.

917
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,393
You know,
you can clump them into plasticity and 

918
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:00,740
stability,
but even there,

919
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,710
your loot you,
you're maintaining a lot of validity.

920
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:04,783
So if I took stability and then he and 
used conscientiousness to predict job 

921
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,454
performance,
conscientiousness would wipe out 

922
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,070
stability.
It'd be a better measure.

923
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:13,904
But you never get that virtually.
Never get that with the lower tests in 

924
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:18,740
the EICU stratum.
Okay.

925
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:22,490
Now,
yeah.

926
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:24,200
Well,
I just talked to you about that.

927
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,180
So that's,
that's a,

928
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,360
that's a good representation of how 
these things are associated.

929
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:32,540
So at the bottom you have the single 
tests and then they,

930
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,750
they chunk into say sequential 
reasoning,

931
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,593
quantitative reasoning,
and induction on the fluid intelligence 

932
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:41,300
size side in general,
knowledge and language development.

933
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:43,760
On the crystallized intelligence side,
that's the red.

934
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,950
And then they're all subsumed underneath
fluid intelligence,

935
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,750
which is the measure that you really 
want to have.

936
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:55,070
Okay.
So what good is that?

937
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,353
Well,
it basically correlates 0.5 with major 

938
00:53:00,551 --> 00:53:05,050
life outcomes,
and that's 25% of the variance.

939
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:07,180
And maybe you can get it a bit higher 
than that,

940
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:11,560
but we'll just stick with 0.5 as a,
as a representation.

941
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,900
And so let's say,

942
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,820
let's say you take a bunch of students,
a hundred of them,

943
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,403
and you want to sort them into those who
will pass a class with a 50% failure 

944
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:28,950
rate.
Okay?

945
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,080
So you just pick the brandable,
you're going to pass,

946
00:53:31,081 --> 00:53:32,190
you're going to fail,
you're going to pass,

947
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,380
you're gonna fail.
So that's no knowledge.

948
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,030
I have no predictive dominant you 
whatsoever.

949
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:36,864
So my validity,
the validity of my classification is 

950
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:42,390
basically going to be equivalent chats,
zero,

951
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:43,603
right?
I'm only going to have a 50% chance of 

952
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:49,290
picking who passes and who fails.
If I used Iq,

953
00:53:49,291 --> 00:53:53,040
if I had all your Iq scores and I did 
the prediction,

954
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:58,041
I'd get right 75% of the time.
So it's a huge difference.

955
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:01,230
It cuts the failure rate in half by 
using Iq.

956
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:06,660
Iq is a very good predictor of health 
and it's a predictor of longevity.

957
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,870
It's a predictor of resistance to post 
traumatic stress disorder.

958
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,620
It's a predictor of obviously 
occupational status.

959
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:17,880
It's a predictor of educational success.
That's a predictor of income.

960
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,463
It's very powerful predictor.
And here's another way of 

961
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:28,911
conceptualizing its effect.
So imagine that you could choose how you

962
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:30,114
were going to be when you were born.
This is in North America because it's 

963
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:35,280
going to vary by society,
at least to some degree.

964
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,970
You get to be born into a family that's 
at the 95th percentile for wealth or you

965
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:44,640
get to be born at the 95th percentile 
for intelligence,

966
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,163
who's better off at the age of 40.
And that answer is the person who picks 

967
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:54,540
being born with an Iq in the 95th 
percentile at birth.

968
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,140
It's more powerful predictor of longterm
life outcome then familiar wealth.

969
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,480
So,
and it shows up everywhere.

970
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:06,690
Like one of the things we did recently 
was looking at disgust,

971
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:07,524
sensitivity.
We're going to talk a little bit about 

972
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,120
that when we talk about 
conscientiousness because orderly people

973
00:55:12,121 --> 00:55:15,450
seem to be more sensitive to discuss the
disorderly people.

974
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,720
That seems to be why they're orderly.
But the higher you are in Icu,

975
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:23,850
the less disgust sensitive you are.
Now,

976
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:26,580
we don't know exactly why that is.
Maybe it's because,

977
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:27,683
you know,
maybe you could make the inference that 

978
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:30,594
Iq is,
is in related in some way to the 

979
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,840
physiological integrity of the cortex.
You know,

980
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:39,210
rather than the limbic system,
which you know,

981
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,910
is the source of say,
emotions and motivations.

982
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:44,770
Um,
and the,

983
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:48,720
the more powerful it is,
the more inhibitory capacity.

984
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:49,554
It has over the more fundamental 
motivations and emotions you could make 

985
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:53,514
that case.
The problem is is that intelligent 

986
00:55:55,981 --> 00:55:59,370
people don't necessarily seem to be any 
less impulsive.

987
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,983
So,
and you can have pretty vicious 

988
00:56:03,721 --> 00:56:04,554
personality disorder that's 
characterized by extremely disorganized 

989
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:07,884
behavior and a complete inability to put
longterm plans into operation and still 

990
00:56:11,881 --> 00:56:12,714
have a high Iq.
So what are the things we really can't 

991
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,124
figure out?

992
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,993
It's just a hell of a thing to try to 
figure out is like the relationship 

993
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:23,980
between Iq and industriousness.
Zero.

994
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:26,343
And that just makes no sense to me 
because most of the brain models are 

995
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:30,484
predicated on the idea that your ability
to engage in longterm planning is a 

996
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,420
factor that's associated with 
intelligence.

997
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,220
But then industrious people seem to not 
only engage in longterm planning,

998
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:44,860
they seem to do it right so that if 
they're more industrious,

999
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,770
they put their plans into operation,
then the plan is actually work.

1000
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,480
But it's not correlated with Iq.
So then I can't figure out,

1001
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,314
well obviously the industrious person in
some ways able to regulate their own 

1002
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,280
behavior,
you know,

1003
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,340
well they're not procrastinating,
for example.

1004
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,593
And you'd think that that the ability to
not procrastinate would be a cognitive 

1005
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:08,440
feature,
but it doesn't seem to be and we have no

1006
00:57:08,441 --> 00:57:11,230
idea what makes people industrious and 
we can't figure it out.

1007
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,560
So it's this incredibly potent 
predictor.

1008
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:18,561
It's just about as powerful as Iq and we
have no idea what it is.

1009
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,170
So,
so if you,

1010
00:57:22,171 --> 00:57:22,960
you know,
if you think,

1011
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,793
if you have a smart idea about that and 
you want to pursue it like feel free 

1012
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:27,244
because there's a big mystery there that
no one's been able to crack and we'd 

1013
00:57:29,501 --> 00:57:33,610
been added for a long time and have had 
almost no success.

1014
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,513
You know,
we had people do things like give them 

1015
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:36,904
sentences of ends am's and use sort of 
randomly distributed and then we'd have 

1016
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:42,790
them count the use,
you know,

1017
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:46,120
like a whole page of sentences.
They're not sentences,

1018
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:48,430
they're just strings of letter count the
use,

1019
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,720
how useless.
You know,

1020
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,080
you'd think that someone industrious 
would do that better.

1021
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,570
It's like they don't,
that's an Iq test.

1022
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,240
And people who co can count the used 
faster have hierarchy,

1023
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,570
almost everything that you would do that
would,

1024
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,550
where it has to do with manipulation of 
abstractions of any sort.

1025
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,420
Even something that basic seems to be 
fundamentally associated with Iq.

1026
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:13,990
People with hierarchies have slightly 
bigger heads.

1027
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,350
If you control for body size,
they have slightly bigger brains.

1028
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,243
If you control for body size,
the axons on their neurons are a bit 

1029
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:22,474
thicker so that the electrical messages 
seem to travel a little bit more 

1030
00:58:25,721 --> 00:58:26,554
efficiency efficiently.
They are slightly faster in simple 

1031
00:58:29,651 --> 00:58:30,484
reflex tests.
So it goes right down to the level of 

1032
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,230
cause are simple reflex light goes on,
pushing buttons.

1033
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:38,050
There's not many neurons mediating that 
response.

1034
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:39,250
You know,
chains of neurons.

1035
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:42,550
There's only a few neurons communicating
so that you can do that.

1036
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,940
But even at that relatively simple 
processing level,

1037
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:50,530
Iq is associated with speed.
So there's a physiological component.

1038
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,633
You're less likely to develop 
Alzheimer's disease if you have a high 

1039
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:54,484
Iq.
And maybe that's because your brain is 

1040
00:58:55,961 --> 00:58:57,370
just more robust,
you know,

1041
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,204
so you could sustain damage,
say of up to 50% of your brain and you 

1042
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:05,200
wouldn't even show it if you're,
if you have a sufficiently high Iq.

1043
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:06,970
Whereas if you're,
you know,

1044
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:09,250
if you're on the bottom end of the Eicu 
distribution,

1045
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:11,680
you're much more,
you seem to be much more susceptible to,

1046
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:14,580
to physiological damage.
Um,

1047
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:17,350
nutrition is a big predictor of Iq 
variation.

1048
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,560
So,
and a lot of that's been hammered out of

1049
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:21,980
modern,
you know,

1050
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:22,814
so 150 years ago,
people's Iq was pretty tightly 

1051
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,550
associated with their nutritional 
status.

1052
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,540
But now,
you know,

1053
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,374
there are very few people in North 
America who don't have enough to eat 

1054
00:59:32,631 --> 00:59:36,770
even though there's some variation in 
quality of diet and that's flattened out

1055
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:39,230
a lot of the,
uh,

1056
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,500
cultural variability and an 
intelligence.

1057
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,950
Okay.
So this is a,

1058
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,710
um,
this guy named him.

1059
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:55,160
He'll did this paper to American 
psychologist a while back and one of the

1060
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,280
things he was interested in doing,
remember we talked about effect sizes,

1061
00:59:58,281 --> 00:59:59,114
right?
How big is an effect in psychology or 

1062
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:06,281
the social sciences in general.
And people have used rules of thumb that

1063
01:00:06,531 --> 01:00:09,980
0.5 was a moderate effect and 0.3 was a,
you know,

1064
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,290
a minimal effect.
And 0.2 was uh,

1065
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,470
you know,
starting to diminish to the point of non

1066
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:16,423
utility,
but what hand pld had instead of 

1067
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:20,330
guessing,
because that was just a gas,

1068
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:24,740
was actually go and look at papers that 
were published in psychology to see what

1069
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:28,970
effects sizes are we're being reported.
So it's an empirical analysis of how big

1070
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:33,380
the effects that psychologists and other
social scientists report.

1071
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,750
And so what he found was that

1072
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,393
mmm,

1073
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,260
the highest third of papers.
So that the third of papers that had the

1074
01:00:43,261 --> 01:00:46,950
biggest effects reported effects from 
0.35 to 0.78.

1075
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:49,980
Um,
the middle third from 0.2,

1076
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:53,820
one to 0.33 and the lower third from 0.2
to point to one.

1077
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:56,730
So then was there another,
yeah,

1078
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,673
if you look on the left side here,
you see that and are of less than 0.15 

1079
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:05,743
characterizes the first quarter of 
published studies and R of 0.15 to 0.35 

1080
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:11,754
the next core tile.
So 50% of psychological studies report 

1081
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:17,394
and are of less than 0.35
90% report and are of less than 0.5 and 

1082
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:29,630
only seven to 8% reported in our 0.5 or 
above.

1083
01:01:29,671 --> 01:01:34,560
So what that means is that the 
relationship between Iq and say academic

1084
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:35,394
performance or longterm life income is 
higher than that reported in all but 

1085
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:45,531
about 5% of psychology studies.
Okay.

1086
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:48,120
So here's an interesting,
you might say

1087
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,843
again,

1088
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,060
in order to determine whether something 
exists,

1089
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:56,490
you have to be able to measure it and 
then it has to be good for something.

1090
01:01:56,491 --> 01:01:57,324
So it has to be
grippable and it has to be usable as a 

1091
01:02:00,601 --> 01:02:01,830
tool.
We'll save for it.

1092
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:02,843
For the sake of argument,
what sort of Iq do you need for what 

1093
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:07,860
kind of job?
Um,

1094
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:08,753
this was derived from a company called 
wonderlic and wonderlic does employment 

1095
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:13,134
testing.
Psychologists usually don't use the 

1096
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:17,400
wonderlic test.
It's a relatively short Iq test and it's

1097
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:18,234
a good test,
I think don't use it because it was 

1098
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:23,460
developed commercially,
but we tested the the wonderlic code lot

1099
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,680
and it has excellent psychometric 
properties.

1100
01:02:25,681 --> 01:02:26,514
It's a very good Iq testing,
probably errors a little bit in testing 

1101
01:02:31,951 --> 01:02:32,784
crystallized Iq rather than fluid Iq,
but we won't argue about that for the 

1102
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:38,250
time being.
All right,

1103
01:02:38,251 --> 01:02:39,084
so if you have an Iq from 130 116 to 130
that puts you in the 86 to 95th 

1104
01:02:46,411 --> 01:02:47,910
percentile,
right?

1105
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:48,744
So that means you're minimally,
if there were eight people in a room on 

1106
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:53,580
average,
you'd be the smartest person.

1107
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,013
Okay.

1108
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,180
I should tell you,
just so you know that

1109
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:01,283
if you're a state college student,
we use the u s as an example because 

1110
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:05,664
there's more differentiation between the
American universities in terms of 

1111
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:10,500
quality.
Then there is the Canadian universities.

1112
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:12,950
If you're in an a,
if a,

1113
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,100
if you're in an average American 
postsecondary institution,

1114
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:22,130
your Iq is 115 and so you know,
you think that's not all that bright,

1115
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:29,450
but that's brighter than seven out of 
eight people in the general population.

1116
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,453
And so there are as many people,
if you look at the North American 

1117
01:03:34,951 --> 01:03:35,784
distribution,
so we have the 50th percentile in the 

1118
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:39,504
middle of the normal distribution.
You have the 85th percentile here and 

1119
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:42,624
you have the 15th percentile here.
It's about 70% of people fall between 

1120
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:49,140
the 15th and the 85th percentile.
All right?

1121
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,110
At the 50th percentile,
you're,

1122
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:52,023
you're not really very literate.
And so what that means is that in the 

1123
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:56,064
United States there's just as many 
people who aren't literate as there are 

1124
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:00,600
people who are in college.

1125
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,123
And what I would mean by literate is not
so much like here's a bare bones 

1126
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:11,700
definition of literate.
You could follow written instructions.

1127
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:15,690
And so what that means is it's kind of a
twofold issue,

1128
01:04:15,691 --> 01:04:16,380
right?
You can,

1129
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:20,040
you can make out the words and the 
phrases and the sentences,

1130
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,770
but then you can translate them into 
actual action.

1131
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,633
You can use the information and an 85 
you're going to have not a very good 

1132
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:27,774
time doing that.
And so when you're wondering things 

1133
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:36,480
about the way society is structured and 
white people you know are not,

1134
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,590
don't necessarily make the most 
intellectually sophisticated choices.

1135
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,890
One thing that's very much worth 
remembering is that there's just as many

1136
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:47,430
people who are functionally illiterate 
in North America as there are people who

1137
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:48,780
are in,
you know,

1138
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,050
tier one colleges.
It's quite shocking.

1139
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,311
Anyways,
okay,

1140
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:54,144
so you want to be an attorney,
a research analyst and editor and 

1141
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:58,140
advertising manager,
a chemist,

1142
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,980
an engineer and executive assistance 
analyst and auditor.

1143
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,350
So you're up in the profession levels 
there.

1144
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:10,370
You need an Iq of at least 116 and so 
130 would be better.

1145
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:11,993
My suspicions are that the average Iq of
people in this room is about one 20 to 

1146
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:19,090
one 25 it might be a little higher than 
that.

1147
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:20,253
It's hard to measure Iq in the ot 
population because a lot of people have 

1148
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:24,830
English as a second language.
And so that,

1149
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,770
that makes it harder to,
you know,

1150
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,840
it's harder to measure crystallized 
intelligence,

1151
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,820
obviously using an English language 
test.

1152
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:32,253
But that's,
we found when we've done our studies at 

1153
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:39,481
the uft that the average exceeds one 20 
so you know,

1154
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:41,074
so you guys have the cognitive power to 
basically pursue professional level 

1155
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:45,580
careers.
Um,

1156
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:51,610
from one 10 to one 15 manager,
supervisor,

1157
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:53,560
programmer,
teacher,

1158
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,720
general manager,
person,

1159
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,743
purchasing agent,
registered nurse sales account 

1160
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,234
executive.
These are actually empirically derived 

1161
01:06:00,071 --> 01:06:00,904
by the way.
So the wonderlic company has tested a 

1162
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:05,850
very large number of people.
And so these are the,

1163
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,670
the actual averages of the professions 
that they are describing.

1164
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:10,990
It's not hypothetical.

1165
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:13,423
Okay.

1166
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:21,173
108 to 103 two,
108 so that's the 60 to the 70th 

1167
01:06:24,091 --> 01:06:27,450
percentile clerk,
customer service Rep,

1168
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:29,700
computer operator,
medical debt collectors,

1169
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:31,980
secretary accounting,
clear general sales,

1170
01:06:31,981 --> 01:06:34,380
telephone sales,
assistant manager,

1171
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:35,610
credit clerk,
drafter,

1172
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:36,810
designer,
bookkeeper.

1173
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,303
There's a lot of white color,
like low level entry level white color 

1174
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:43,134
jobs in that particular category.
So that would be the brighter people 

1175
01:06:48,841 --> 01:06:53,841
among the high school students who 
didn't go to college and university Iq.

1176
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:57,720
This is dead average 50th to the 55th 
percentile.

1177
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,640
Police officer,
receptionist,

1178
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:00,474
cashier,
general clerical staff inside sales 

1179
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:05,850
clerk meter reader,
printer teller,

1180
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,400
data entry,
electrical helper,

1181
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:09,863
dispatcher in general office.
So that's right at 195 to 98 so that's 

1182
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:19,520
the 42nd to the 45th percentile.
Quality Control Checker,

1183
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:21,300
claims clerk,
security gardner,

1184
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,220
unskilled labor.
So look,

1185
01:07:23,221 --> 01:07:26,580
the unskilled laborers are up at 95th to
98 right?

1186
01:07:26,581 --> 01:07:29,490
So that's,
you're still at unt,

1187
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:30,324
the unskilled labor level,
you're still have an Iq that's higher 

1188
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:34,200
than 40% of the population.

1189
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:35,461
Arc,
welder,

1190
01:07:35,461 --> 01:07:39,870
diasend or mechanic medical,
dental assistant Iq,

1191
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:44,990
87 to 93 messenger factory production 
worker Assembler,

1192
01:07:45,271 --> 01:07:46,920
food service worker,
nurses aid,

1193
01:07:46,921 --> 01:07:48,180
warehouseman,
custodian,

1194
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:50,790
janitor,
material handler and packer.

1195
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,770
Okay,
so now what you see happening,

1196
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,460
the difference,
it looks to me like you can do job,

1197
01:07:56,490 --> 01:08:01,490
you can count conceptualize jobs most 
simply with a two by two matrix.

1198
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:02,813
Okay,
so there's managerial administrative 

1199
01:08:04,471 --> 01:08:08,010
jobs and creative jobs.
That's the first one.

1200
01:08:08,011 --> 01:08:10,020
And then there's low complexity.
High complexity.

1201
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:15,940
And so what you're starting to fall into
at the 21st to the 30 percentile.

1202
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,700
So that's still one person in three are 
low complexity,

1203
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:20,534
managerial jobs.
And so what I mean by that is that if 

1204
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:23,384
you're in a low complexity job,
imagine you're responsible for 30 

1205
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:28,970
things,
but roughly speaking,

1206
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,390
it's the same 30 things all the time.
And roughly speaking,

1207
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:35,150
they have to be taken care of the same 
way each time.

1208
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:40,420
So you have a finite domain of 
responsibility and you can master it and

1209
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:41,444
Iq will predict how fast you master it.
But once you master it will predict how 

1210
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:45,974
well you do.
What happens then in all likelihood is 

1211
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:49,670
that conscientiousness starts to 
predict,

1212
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:54,320
or maybe emotional stability starts to 
predict or some of the other personality

1213
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:56,780
factors start to become more important.
So,

1214
01:08:56,781 --> 01:09:01,370
but at 87 to 93 you're down at the level
of custodian and janitor.

1215
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:04,363
And then that's that.
And that's not so good because you have 

1216
01:09:09,921 --> 01:09:14,910
the bottom 15 to 20% of the population 
who aren't quite,

1217
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,793
who haven't,
who don't have the cognitive ability at 

1218
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:19,574
that level.
And so one of the things that you're 

1219
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:25,721
going to hear a lot about as you get 
older is reasons for unemployment.

1220
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,230
And one of the prime reasons for an 
employment in the future is increasingly

1221
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:31,064
going to be that there is just nothing 
for someone of that level of 

1222
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:34,814
intelligence to do.
And this is partly why people hate Iq 

1223
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,180
because you think that is a nasty,
nasty thing to conclude.

1224
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,493
I'd be telling you a story.
So I had a client at one point who I 

1225
01:09:45,951 --> 01:09:50,951
suspect he had a verbal Iq of about 85 
and a nonverbal Iq that was lower.

1226
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,680
Um,
he had other psychological issues,

1227
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:55,514
but,
but we'll just concentrate on that one 

1228
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,340
for the time being.

1229
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:04,190
And you know,
he had a hard time finding a job.

1230
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:06,710
He was socially anxious and that didn't 
help.

1231
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,290
But you know,
even if he could overcome that,

1232
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,633
it was very difficult for him to master 
the basic skills that were involved in 

1233
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:17,630
what you would consider even relatively 
straightforward tasks.

1234
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:20,600
So I spent a lot of time trying to find 
him a job,

1235
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:21,973
which is insanely difficult.
He went to the government first to get 

1236
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,310
help and they told him to,
you know,

1237
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,010
type up his resume on a computer and 
distributed.

1238
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:31,521
It's like,
well,

1239
01:10:31,521 --> 01:10:34,280
that wasn't very helpful because he 
didn't know how to use a computer and he

1240
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:36,740
wasn't going to type up his damn resume.
And you know,

1241
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,170
it was,
if you want to get a job,

1242
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,590
go out and do the things that it would 
take to get a job while yeah,

1243
01:10:42,591 --> 01:10:44,630
if you can do that,
then you don't have a problem.

1244
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:48,140
And so the government agencies were 
completely useless,

1245
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:48,974
you know,
and they were staffed by people who 

1246
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:52,820
would assume that if you didn't do what 
you were advised to,

1247
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:53,654
that you just didn't want to have a job 
instead of ever thinking that maybe you 

1248
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:58,610
couldn't do it.
It's not that easy to use a computer.

1249
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,190
You know?
So I,

1250
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:03,830
and then I tried to get him a volunteer 
job.

1251
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:04,723
Well,
you bloody well forget about that 

1252
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:08,810
because it's harder to get a volunteer 
job than it is to get a real job.

1253
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,093
And the reason for that is that you have
to step through a number of complex 

1254
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:15,540
bureaucratic hoops,
including having police check.

1255
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,100
And you know,
first of all,

1256
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:17,934
that's intimidating as hell for people,
even if they haven't done anything 

1257
01:11:20,071 --> 01:11:20,910
wrong.
And second,

1258
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:22,950
it's not that straight forward.
You know,

1259
01:11:22,951 --> 01:11:26,820
it involves maneuvering through a 
complicated bureaucracy.

1260
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,460
And that's not the only step.
There's all sorts of other steps.

1261
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:31,740
So volunteer work,
that's how it man,

1262
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,110
that's,
that's just not gonna happen.

1263
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:38,820
Not generally speaking.
And then I found him a job helping a guy

1264
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:41,100
out who had a,
a bicycle shop.

1265
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:42,240
Slash.
Bookstore.

1266
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:43,243
It was kind of a strange combination,
but it was a government subsidized 

1267
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,210
temporary position.
And then he did a good job at it.

1268
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:48,751
He could,
he,

1269
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:50,790
he,
he was reshelving books and that sort of

1270
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,624
thing.
And so he was reliable and he could do 

1271
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,650
that.
But you know,

1272
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,050
the subsidy program ended.
And of course if you run a bike shop,

1273
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,160
slash,
bookstore,

1274
01:11:59,161 --> 01:12:02,070
it's not like you have additional money 
to hire someone because you know,

1275
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:02,904
those are,
that's a store that's just not going to 

1276
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:05,004
be generating maybe any income.
But certainly not enough to hire 

1277
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:09,570
someone.
So that fell apart.

1278
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,510
Then I did a bunch of con,
I did,

1279
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:13,344
made a bunch of personal contacts with 
charity organizations to see if I can 

1280
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:21,240
get them a volunteer position.
I finally got him a volunteer position.

1281
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:22,300
So,
and uh,

1282
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,633
then I went with him to train him at the
volunteer position and that was so 

1283
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,174
enlightening.
So what he had to do was he had a stack 

1284
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:36,030
of pieces of paper here and then a stack
of envelopes here.

1285
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:38,580
And in principle,
the pieces of paper,

1286
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:42,330
which were letters were in the same 
order as the envelopes were.

1287
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:46,230
And so what he had to do was fold the 
pieces of paper three times and stuff,

1288
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,064
the folded piece of paper into the 
envelope and then seal the envelope and 

1289
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,364
then put it here.
But it was a bit more complicated than 

1290
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:53,544
that because sometimes the letters were 
in French and sometimes they were an 

1291
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:57,210
English.

1292
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,043
So what that meant was that he had to 
watch and see that the French envelopes 

1293
01:13:02,641 --> 01:13:05,670
went into this stack and the English and
envelopes went into that stock.

1294
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:07,710
So that's one degree of complexity,
right?

1295
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,113
But then it also turned out that those 
damn envelopes had to be run through an 

1296
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:14,700
automatic letter sorting machine.
Now you might think,

1297
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:15,534
well that doesn't matter,
but it does matter because those things 

1298
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:22,521
have very tightly defined tolerances.
And if you

1299
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,613
make a mistake,
imagine you fold a piece of paper and 

1300
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:28,494
the first time you fold it,
you made a mistake of an eighth of an 

1301
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:32,370
inch.
And then the next time you fold it,

1302
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:33,930
you make another eighth of an inch 
mistake.

1303
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,320
That means your piece of papers now one 
quarter inch out of true

1304
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:42,020
and then you stuff it in the envelope 
and folded,

1305
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,320
but you crinkle the envelope.

1306
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,860
And so then the envelope gets stuck in 
the automatic processing machine.

1307
01:13:47,861 --> 01:13:52,861
So I taught him probably 20 hours how to
fold this piece of paper into three,

1308
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:54,803
you know,
and he was a bit shaky and he just 

1309
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:01,440
didn't have the motor fine motor ability
or the cognitive ability to do that.

1310
01:14:01,441 --> 01:14:06,441
And then I'll end with this,
we need finally couldn't do it anymore.

1311
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:09,930
What happened was the letters came with 
photographs attached to them.

1312
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,483
And then he had the full,
the pieces of paper around the 

1313
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:13,714
photographs in a way that different 
crumpled the photographs so that they 

1314
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:19,060
could still fit into the envelopes.
And each photo was,

1315
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:24,040
you know,
stapled maybe half an inch different per

1316
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:24,874
piece of paper.
So then he had to fold them properly 

1317
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:30,700
with a different folding technique for 
every piece of paper.

1318
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:34,510
And he had to sort them into French and 
English and then also with the envelopes

1319
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:37,360
and the papers ever gone out of sync,
which they did now.

1320
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:38,193
And then he had to figure out how to 
sort the envelopes and the pieces of 

1321
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:43,090
paper to make sure that they were 
matched with the proper,

1322
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,003
you know,
who they were matched with the proper 

1323
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:47,260
envelope.
It's like no,

1324
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:48,123
that was the end of it.
And so I'm telling you the rest of his 

1325
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,740
story later.
So anyways,

1326
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:53,710
you know,
there,

1327
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:54,603
there is,
the moral of the story is if you're 

1328
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,930
smart,
you're privileged and it's thank God,

1329
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,793
make use of it.
And if you're on the low end of the Iq 

1330
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,680
of distribution,
man,

1331
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:06,730
you've got one tough life ahead of you.
It has nothing to do with willingness to

1332
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:08,890
work or virtually nothing.
So,

1333
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,280
and it's a good thing to know,
even though it's horrible.

1334
01:15:11,281 --> 01:15:12,114
Yeah.

1335
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,270
Entrepreneurial.
Yeah.

1336
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:24,770
Yup.
No problem.

1337
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,403
I just want.
