1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,970
Then the meme stream and then they later
kind of took a joyless turn.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,380
Yeah,
yesterday on today.

3
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:12,610
Right now.
Yeah.

4
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:13,960
Well it's amazing.
Yeah.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,890
So here's the strange thing.
So I kind of played,

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,143
let's say night on white horse.
And so the Guardian yesterday published 

7
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:28,060
the
astounding,

8
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:28,894
really reprehensible article about your 
boot know about the channel for 

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,680
interview.
Um,

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,191
no,
they,

11
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,320
they've done some nice interviews about 
my book.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,303
Um,
so it'd been kind of all over the place 

13
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,074
with me,
you know,

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,200
but the channel for people claim that 
Kathy has been targeted with threats.

15
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:45,853
No,
I'm a torrent of online abuse by 

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,610
Internet trolls.
It's like 50,000 trolls,

17
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,870
you know,
that's a lot of trolls.

18
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,060
You might start thinking maybe they're 
not old trolls,

19
00:00:55,061 --> 00:00:59,950
but in any case,
overwhelmed by Ms Dot logistic abuse and

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,813
threats and that they had called in a 
security specialist to assess the level 

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,484
of threat.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,473
And so it was the beginning of the 
attempt to twist the story around so 

23
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:15,820
that the story became
Kathy Newman,

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,343
poor embattled channel four newscaster 
was merely trying to do her job even 

25
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:23,980
though she might've been a bit 
provocative,

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,293
interviewed alt right hero,
Dr Jordan Peterson in an honest manner 

27
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,950
to,
to expose his agenda,

28
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,383
posted the results to youtube,
and was immediately mobbed by his army 

29
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,410
of Internet trolls.
Right?

30
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,244
So she went from.
So my sense is she went from a 

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:51,570
journalist playing a variety of 
complicated games to,

32
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,500
to,
to,

33
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,493
to target of criticism online to heroin,
embattled heroin in the panoply of 

34
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,460
martyrs to whom similar things have 
happened in the past and what's terrible

35
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,510
about it.
So,

36
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,403
so.
And I inadvertently I would say 

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,590
contributed to that because when the 
Guardian story came out,

38
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:22,120
I read it and the story purported to be 
about the threats that she had received.

39
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,313
But really the story because the story 
opened with a description of me and the 

40
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:28,420
description was,
let's call it far from flattery.

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,430
You know,
it was the same old thing.

42
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,680
Dr Peterson,
he's a provocateur.

43
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:37,240
He's has an army of trolls.
If anybody ever dares to challenge him,

44
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:40,150
let's say I know all they're doing is 
honestly challenging.

45
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:43,300
The trolls come out and then they have 
to fear for their lives and that was.

46
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,120
That was the story,
the threat,

47
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:51,121
the threats were just the pre requisite 
for the story and then yeah,

48
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:57,241
like a dozen UK news media sources that 
the newspapers in particular have picked

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,180
us up some even more critical of me than
that.

50
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,460
Some in a slightly more balanced 
fashion,

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,600
but and see when the Guardian story 
broke,

52
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,330
I tweeted something.
I said,

53
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,350
look,
if you're.

54
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,363
I've looked at the tweet or the youtube 
comments and most of them were merely 

55
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,194
criticism,
but if you're threatening her while 

56
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:23,360
stop,
you know,

57
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,460
because we had an exchange of words,
which is what we're supposed to do.

58
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,480
I think this message to your front row 
was one of the most liked tweet you ever

59
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,440
put out.
Yeah,

60
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,840
but here's the terrible thing about it.
You know,

61
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,703
what happened was that the fact that I 
tweeted that was instantly used as 

62
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,770
validation for the claim that there were
threats and that was just,

63
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,210
yeah,
that's what happened.

64
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,044
And See,
it's weird because when I wrote that I 

65
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:53,221
thought was part of me that thought
that thought that that might happen.

66
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,900
There was a little warning bell that 
went off that said,

67
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,734
look,
you know,

68
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,993
there's no evidence that these threats 
are credible and if you respond by by 

69
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,473
asking people to back off,
you're also implying that there are 

70
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,930
people who,
who should back off that this is real.

71
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,011
And I thought,
no,

72
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,670
I'm going to do it anyways because she 
has been targeted.

73
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,923
She has been subject to a very large 
number of very vitriolic comments and 

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,430
maybe that's enough.
And so you know,

75
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,320
it's okay to come out and say that's 
enough.

76
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,890
But the thing is it wasn't okay because 
as soon as I did it,

77
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,143
then the fact that I did it was used as 
proof that all of these claims were 

78
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,970
valid and that that just floored me.
Like I was very

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,393
distraught,
I think is the right word about that 

80
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,420
this morning because I didn't,
I didn't see that coming.

81
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,510
But were there threats against her?
Have you seen them?

82
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,493
Defined threat?
There's no threats that were sufficient 

83
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:51,760
to get the police involved.
