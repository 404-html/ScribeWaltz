1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,090
Anyways,
so you're always in a situation,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,600
and this is occurs across multiple
levels of analysis because I could say,

3
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,010
well,
when are you in the garden?

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,720
And one answer could be,
well,

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:16,020
when you're in a beautiful house or in a
beautiful hotel or in a well functioning

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:20,010
institution or in a city that's working,
but I can also say you're in a garden

7
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:25,011
when your conception of the world is
sufficient that when you enacted it

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,070
allows the world to be fruitful.
That's a garden too,

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,460
right?
Because so your internal psychological

10
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,920
structure,
the conceptions that you use first of

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,960
all,
there obviously analogous to culture,

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,100
but they're also analogous to a garden
in that way and light culture,

13
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:45,530
they can be disrupted.
So you know what it's like people,

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,560
they say this all the time.
I wish that hadn't happened and what

15
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:55,611
they mean by that is Jesus.
I was in a pretty good place before that

16
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,480
event occurred.
You know,

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,650
on a big moral eric and really do that
to you.

18
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:01,380
You know,
you do something that you really think

19
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:05,370
is stupid and you know you.
You're just shattered.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,410
Really sometimes sheltered enough to
develop post traumatic stress disorder

21
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,490
so you can't get rid of the snakes.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,830
That's the first idea in the story.
Well then the issue is,

23
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,940
well,
what do you do with the stakes?

24
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:26,350
What God basically told even Adam not
well,

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,710
he didn't really tell them not to
interact with the snakes and he put a

26
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:32,170
snake in there.
I think it's partly because in a sense

27
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:35,410
it's not possible to create a garden
without having a snake in it because you

28
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:38,230
can't keep everything out.
It's not possible.

29
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,750
Okay,
so the snake comes along and it says,

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,120
well,
if you do this thing that God

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,230
for bade a lot of wonderful things will
happen.

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,270
Well,
this is where it gets.

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,760
It gets extraordinarily complicated.
You know,

34
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,290
let me finish this part of the story and
then we'll go back.

35
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,630
The serpent said unto the woman,
you shall not surely die for God knows

36
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:08,720
that in the day you eat thereof,
then your eyes will be opened and you

37
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,520
will be as gods knowing good and evil.
Okay,

38
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:12,920
so what can we conclude from that?
Well,

39
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,750
first thing is,
is that their eyes were closed because

40
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,910
if they weren't closed and how could
they be opened and the second thing is

41
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:24,710
they didn't know the difference between
good and evil.

42
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,820
Okay?
So that explains the whole shame naked

43
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,310
and not ashamed issue because if your
eyes are closed,

44
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,880
while that's irrelevant and if,
you know,

45
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,880
if,
if there's no moral knowledge,

46
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:39,380
there's obviously no shame.
So what's happening here is that there's

47
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,243
a very,

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:42,643
um,

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,090
profound distinction being made between
the before fruit eating state of being

50
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:55,141
in the after fruit eating state of being
or the before fruit eating and snake

51
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,020
interacting mode of being and the after
fruit eating and snake interacting mode

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,300
of being.
And I think it's reasonable to think of

53
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,030
that on a historical timeline.
You know,

54
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:09,031
that that is one of the major.
Those are two of the major forces that

55
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:13,150
shaped our evolutionary history and the
idea that things were different before

56
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,850
that and after that is a perfectly
reasonable presupposition.

57
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,200
Something put us on the path to very,
very rapid cortical development.

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,930
Vision is certainly one of those
factors.

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,330
So,
and the fruit eating element,

60
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,900
well that's where we have color vision,
so when it isn't obvious exactly what

61
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,170
that did,
but it did a lot and things so.

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,050
And then the next thing is,
well there's no moral knowledge now

63
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:40,100
that's interesting because it implies
that there's some tight link between

64
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:42,500
having your eyes closed and not having
moral knowledge.

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,010
So to have your eyes closed just to not
to be able to see.

66
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,140
So there's a kind of unconsciousness
about it.

67
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,700
And when the woman saw that the tree was
good for food and that it was pleasant

68
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,930
to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
make one wise,

69
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,950
she took of the fruit thereof and did
eat and gave also unto her husband with

70
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,850
her.
And he did eat

71
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,140
and the eyes of both of them were opened
and they knew they were naked and they

72
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:11,720
sewed fig leaves together and made
themselves aprons.

73
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,510
Okay.
So that's quite an interesting sequence

74
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:16,640
of events.
So they're tempted by this thing that's

75
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:21,641
subtle and dangerous and the consequence
of the temptation is the ingestion of

76
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,930
something.
The incorporation of something with

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,650
transformative properties.
And the transformation is profound.

78
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,490
What happens is they open their eyes.
Well,

79
00:04:31,491 --> 00:04:34,940
that's coming to consciousness.
That's exactly what that is.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,710
You know,
when a kitten opens its eyes,

81
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,600
it finally enters the world.
You know,

82
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,110
so people had their eyes closed before
this event.

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,493
Well,
so they weren't.

84
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:53,020
They weren't conscious in the same way.
And that would account for the unity of

85
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:55,450
experience.
They're not separated from.

86
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,800
They're not separate beings on the
ground of existence.

87
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,870
That's one way of thinking.
But they have the same kind of life as

88
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,800
animals too.
You know,

89
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,850
they're,
they're just unconscious or at least non

90
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,810
self conscious entities of nature.
There's no nakedness,

91
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,460
there's no knowledge of good and evil.
I mean,

92
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,650
do you,
you don't blame a lion for eating it,

93
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,220
for eating a sheep.
Yeah.

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,360
They used to eat sheep in the Middle
East,

95
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,150
right?
You don't think that's an evil.

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,480
They don't think of the lion is evil.
You just think that that's what lions

97
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,700
do.
Now someone comes along and steals your

98
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,200
sheep.
Well that's a whole different issue.

99
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:32,140
All of a sudden there's a moral issue
that's overlaid upon that and you say,

100
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:32,741
well,
you might say,

101
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,390
well,
why is all of a sudden there were moral

102
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,060
issue and then the answer to that would
be,

103
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,220
well,
the person either does know the

104
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,770
difference between good and bad or
should know it,

105
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,810
you know,
and if he says,

106
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,460
well,
I'm just acting like a lion,

107
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,720
that's just,
there's just not gonna.

108
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,200
No one's gonna accept that as an excuse.
And the reason for that is there's a

109
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,490
basic assumption that there's something
that you know that lions don't and why?

110
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,870
Well,
it's because your eyes are open in a

111
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,440
different way.
Okay,

112
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,860
well that seems to be reasonable.
So they opened their eyes and bang,

113
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,080
they know they're naked.
Now.

114
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,600
That's an interesting juxtaposition.
Okay,

115
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:10,601
so let's say you develop a higher form
of consciousness and that makes you self

116
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:12,710
conscious.
So there's two things happening here.

117
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,660
There's an elevation of consciousness,
but out of that spring,

118
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:18,050
self consciousness,
and then you've got to think,

119
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:19,610
well,
what does selfconsciousness mean

120
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,070
exactly?
Well,

121
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,980
because you're not fully self conscious
and the reason you're not fully self

122
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,070
consciousness because you don't know
everything about yourself,

123
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,510
right?
So you're,

124
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,610
you're ignorant of a lot of your own
being,

125
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,930
but there's a lot of your being.

126
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,240
You're not ignorant about.
Well,

127
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,960
hey,
you can identify yourself as an

128
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,440
individual,
so you've got the identify yourself in

129
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,780
the mirror trick down,
which is kind of the standard trick for

130
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,920
animals,
self consciousness,

131
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,830
but that's only the beginning.
It's the bear,

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,040
beginnings of self consciousness.
If you're so.

133
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,470
If you're self conscious,
you know where your boundaries are

134
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,530
because what's inside the boundary is
you and what's outside isn't you?

135
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,170
But then there's other boundaries that
you have.

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,070
There's a temporal boundary.
There's,

137
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,720
there's the time when you weren't,
and there was the time when you won't

138
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:04,940
be,
and so there's a boundary of space,

139
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,570
but there's a boundary in time and that
means that as soon as you become self

140
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:10,820
conscious,
you know that you're going to die.

141
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,960
And so that's the type link between the
fruit of the tree of knowledge of good

142
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,760
and evil and the and death in the Old
Testament or in the genesis story.

143
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,150
So and you might say,
well you were going to die before

144
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,890
and fair enough,
but there's a big difference between a

145
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,560
death,
that death of a self conscious entity

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,970
and death in the one case.
It's a natural process that you know

147
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:37,370
that that's natural death,
let's say.

148
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,300
And the other one,
it's a,

149
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,830
it's a catastrophe of being for the self
conscious individual.

150
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,110
You know.
And so the other thing that happens is

151
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,820
in the genesis story that that discovery
is portrayed as a permanent rift in the

152
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,520
structure of Ba.
That's why it's such a deep sin.

153
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:56,330
It's like all of a sudden everything is
different and it will never be the same

154
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,830
again.
No matter what happens,

155
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,550
you know when you might say,
well obviously God was an enemy of

156
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:03,330
higher consciousness.
It's like,

157
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,000
well,
there's lots of interpretations of

158
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,290
generous.
That took exactly that.

159
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,950
Stats said,
well God was an enemy of higher

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,793
consciousness.

161
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:13,400
You wanted things to remain in an,
in an unconscious paradise and that it

162
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:15,060
was human,
um,

163
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,670
unwillingness to behave and curiosity
that God has sent to the problem that

164
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,070
we're in and it's actually actually a
catastrophe,

165
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,680
you know?
And then other people who were sort of

166
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,200
high that had more say,
admiration for the illumination and self

167
00:08:29,201 --> 00:08:33,110
consciousness elements said that the
thing that tempted human beings was a

168
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:36,020
greater God than the God that originally
did the creation.

169
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,380
That was a gnostic idea.
You know.

170
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
So the serpent therapy becomes an agent
of revelation in a sense,

171
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,560
you know,
but anyways,

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,060
this,
they've laid out the problem,

173
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,790
this is the problems.
All of a sudden people woke up and when

174
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,920
they woke up,
they noticed who they were and they

175
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,930
weren't happy about it.
So what do they notice?

176
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,470
They're naked.
Okay,

177
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,940
well,
so what?

178
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,751
Well,
you know,

179
00:08:57,751 --> 00:08:58,590
you see,
so what?

180
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,990
Instantly,
because the first thing they do is make

181
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:01,824
fig leaves.

182
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,800
They make
clothing out of fiddly and cover

183
00:09:06,801 --> 00:09:08,720
themselves up.
While you know,

184
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,370
that's,
that's culture and you think,

185
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,740
well what's good?
What is the utility of culture?

186
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,530
But that's easy.
Culture is the barrier between us and

187
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,200
our own nakedness.
It's the barrier between our nakedness

188
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,240
and the natural world.
It's like,

189
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,970
why do you put on clothes so you don't
freeze to death,

190
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,760
you know,
so you're not as easily attacked.

191
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,300
It's like as soon as you know you're
naked and vulnerable and you're self

192
00:09:32,301 --> 00:09:34,250
conscious,
you extend yourself across time,

193
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:36,800
you discovered time,
you know that not only are you

194
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:39,050
vulnerable now,
but you're going to be vulnerable in the

195
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:41,180
future.
So are your children and their children.

196
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,870
It's like the whole nature of being.
It's like you've added a dimension to

197
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:48,140
the nature of being.
You've added time to it and it's a

198
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,880
radical transformation.
You might say,

199
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,890
well that's good because lions don't eat
you as often.

200
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,540
It's like,
yeah,

201
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,160
the zebras don't seem that upset on the
plains of the Serengeti when the lions

202
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,980
are around.
One's going to pick one off now and

203
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,150
then,
but the lion,

204
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,310
the zebras aren't running around,
you know,

205
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,700
with anxiety disorders,
popping value them all the time because

206
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:10,730
the lions are there,
but that's not the case with human

207
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,170
beings.
We see a line and we think,

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,810
oh yeah,
some at some point that line's going to

209
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:18,650
want to eat one of us and so,
and lions in general will do that.

210
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,800
So not only do we have to solve the
problem of that line right now,

211
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,190
we have to solve the problem of all
lions for all time,

212
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,310
which we actually seem to be doing a
very good job of now because soon there

213
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,690
won't be any of them,
but you know,

214
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,420
so that sort of thing can get out of
hand.

215
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:33,800
But,
but you get the point.

216
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,540
So okay.
So they sewed fig leaves together and

217
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,360
they made themselves aprons.
So

218
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,960
you know,
the sexual element of it too is I think

219
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:51,961
also that the reason sexuality is tied
in there so tightly is because the most

220
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:56,680
sexual parts of a human being are also
the parts that are the most vulnerable.

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,390
So.
So it's not only,

222
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,070
you know,
vulnerability to judgment

223
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,540
and vulnerability to exploitation,
which is a huge deal,

224
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:08,830
especially in the case of women.
But it's also the fact that just from a

225
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:11,770
purely physical perspective,
those are the most delicate tissues.

226
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,890
And so the fact that they are fully
exposed is really a big problem.

227
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,520
So okay,
so now they're naked.

228
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,050
They got aprons on.
It's like,

229
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,700
no,
they're not in unconscious paradise

230
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,350
anymore.
So then what happens?

231
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,160
And they heard the voice of the Lord God
walking in the garden in the cool of the

232
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,720
day,
and Adam and his wife hid themselves

233
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:33,390
from the presence of the Lord God
amongst the trees of the garden.

234
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,570
I can't imagine how you could possibly
pack more meaning into two sentences.

235
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:40,050
You know,
it's,

236
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,880
you can tell people have been at this
for like 25,000 years because see what

237
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:47,650
happens here is that there's an idea to
begin with,

238
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,700
that there's a complete unity between
God and his creation,

239
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,950
let's say,
so that there's the natural order is

240
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,050
undisturbed and all of a sudden that's
fractured.

241
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,300
And so what happens is that human beings
are divorced from the divinity.

242
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,840
It's.
And not only are they divorced from it,

243
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:09,100
they're unwilling to expose themselves
to it.

244
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,750
So,
so think about.

245
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,460
Think about this.
I will take a take a side step for a

246
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,294
minute.

247
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,521
You might say,
well,

248
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:32,521
imagine that you could exist in a manner
that was on perfect.

249
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,770
The question might be,
well,

250
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,190
what would stop you from doing it?
Well,

251
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,790
one thing might be that you couldn't
envision something as useless as you are

252
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:45,620
actually managing that you know,
so you,

253
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,490
you know.
If you think about what stands in the

254
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,870
road of people as obstacles to their
full self realization,

255
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,180
the easiest way to encapsulate that is
that they view themselves as inadequate.

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,700
Now there's other things as well.
They don't want to take the

257
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:05,050
responsibility and so forth,
but you know it's very difficult to heat

258
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,650
a divine call.
Let's say when you're stuck in this

259
00:13:08,651 --> 00:13:13,651
little ratty contraption that is prone
to disease and I'm prone to shame and

260
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,250
prone to age and prone to death,
and it's like how can you continue in

261
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:21,610
some divine manner when you've come to
the realization that there are,

262
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,990
you are,
you know,

263
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,200
and people,
certainly people derive the conclusion

264
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:29,230
fairly frequently that there are so
appalling,

265
00:13:29,231 --> 00:13:32,620
but it would be better if they were
obliterated along with everyone else.

266
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,390
It's not as if the realization of the
nature of our own physical being was

267
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,810
something that freed people up to be
courageous.

268
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,760
You know,
it was quite the reverse.

269
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:45,940
Although I think people can still be
courageous in front of it and in spite

270
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,950
of it,
but it's definitely in spite of it.

271
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,370
You know,
all the classic definitions of true

272
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,100
courage aren't that you're not afraid.
It's that you're afraid,

273
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,990
but you do it anyways.
It's like,

274
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:57,560
well,
you that fear is,

275
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,360
and shame is an integral part of you.
As soon as you realize that you're

276
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,320
vulnerable to social evaluation and
natural degeneration,

277
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,720
you're stuck with it,
and so then bang,

278
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,360
you're divorced from your divine mode of
being,

279
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,210
we'll say partly at least because you're
just afraid to manifest it.

280
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,740
So anyways,
that's what happened.

281
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,830
So Adam and Eve hide from God.
Now it seems to be really

282
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,040
counterproductive because you might
think that if they didn't hide from God,

283
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,240
then there wouldn't be a problem.

284
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,740
They can be naked and no problem,
but that isn't what happened and the

285
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,900
Lord God calls onto Adam.
It says unto him,

286
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,340
where are,
where are you?

287
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,280
And Adam says,
I heard your voice in the garden,

288
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:37,090
so there's a call there,
and I was afraid because I was naked.

289
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,400
Well,
that pretty much explains it and I hit

290
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:41,170
myself.
Okay?

291
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,050
And God said,
who told you that you were naked?

292
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,950
Have you eaten of the tree whereof I
commanded thee that thou shouldn't show

293
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:50,770
this naughty?
Who told me that that was naked?

294
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,980
I believe women told men that.
I think that's a very accurate summation

295
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,630
of the relationship between men and
women.

296
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,740
What all we develop consciousness across
the span of evolutionary history.

297
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,390
And I believe it for a couple of
reasons.

298
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,120
Number one,
sexual selection is a huge factor in,

299
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,880
in what created human beings.
And women primarily do the selection.

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,030
They're the bottleneck and they're the
bottleneck.

301
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Because women can't have that many
offspring,

302
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,280
they can only have a few.
So that makes them the bottleneck by

303
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:22,970
definition.
And women are so choosy about men that

304
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,220
twice as many women have children as
men.

305
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,360
Okay?
So what that means is on average means

306
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,850
that I know it's kind of hard to
understand,

307
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,970
but imagine every single woman has one
child.

308
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,170
And then imagine half the men have zero
and half of them have to.

309
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,720
Okay,
that's the case.

310
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,530
So statistically speaking,
half man,

311
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,980
half of all men were write offs.
Now it's actually worse than that

312
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,700
because some men have so many offspring
that is not even funny,

313
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,470
you know.
So that Kinda cuts,

314
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,850
it cuts the number of successful men
down by many.

315
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,480
So women are a bottleneck and they do
judgment and and rightly so and they

316
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:07,730
judged them according to their
insufficiency.

317
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,910
And that is what makes men
unselfconscious obviously.

318
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,970
And it's the thing that makes them more
self conscious than anything else.

319
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,540
Now to men's credit,
let me tell you about the bower birds.

320
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,430
Okay.
So bowerbirds,

321
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:23,000
they're very cool.
They live on the ground and the males

322
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,960
make these incredibly.
First of all,

323
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,200
we've a nest.
It's sort of like a hammock.

324
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:29,630
It's real soft.
And then they hang that into tree and

325
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:33,350
then they sweep out their front yard and
then they decorate it with bits of like

326
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,850
the blue leaves are over here.
And then there's some red leaves here

327
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:37,460
and there's a nice display of green
here.

328
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,450
And maybe there's some glass there and
it's like this little art work,

329
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,460
you know,
and the bower birds have these more or

330
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,030
less enroll say in the same territory.
And then the females come hopping along

331
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:50,060
and they take a look at this thing and
if they like it,

332
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,760
well then they're willing to become a
little more friendly with that

333
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,720
particular bowerbird.

334
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,490
And if they don't,
they fly away.

335
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,250
Well.
So if the male bowerbird has three

336
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,710
female visitors and nothing pans out,
then he,

337
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:02,750
you know,
he has a little fit and erases all

338
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:04,820
creation that he asked to do another
one.

339
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,590
And so like you just have to think about
that for 15 minutes and it pretty much

340
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:14,591
explains human beings just like men.
One response that man could have had was

341
00:17:14,991 --> 00:17:17,660
just to go hide in a shell.
And some of them do that.

342
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,360
That is absolutely a common response.
And to never come out and spend the rest

343
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:24,410
of his life playing video games in the
basement and eating Cheetos,

344
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,010
you know?
But then you know,

345
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,820
the other responses,
well,

346
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,670
all better transform myself into
something that isn't going to produce

347
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,730
that response.
And that's a central part of,

348
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,040
that's a central part of male
motivation.

349
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,410
It's a central element of male
motivation.

350
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,130
So if you're ever wondering why men are
the way they are,

351
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,670
that real answer to that is because
that's how they evolve to oppress women.

352
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,620
So because obviously if that wouldn't
have happened,

353
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:53,550
given that sexual selection is such a
powerful selecting force among human

354
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,710
beings,
well it wouldn't have worked out.

355
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,500
So men,
women don't make men self conscious,

356
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,810
you know,
when it's more than that too,

357
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:05,220
because you could see a positive
feedback loop emerging as we got more

358
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,560
cognitively sophisticated.
You know,

359
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:10,260
when you can think of that.
Maybe that was an arms race between men,

360
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,050
women and snakes,
something like that.

361
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,260
You know,
as we got more cognitively

362
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,570
sophisticated,
one of the prices we paid for that was

363
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:22,200
that our hand expanded and one of the
prices women paid for that was that

364
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,550
childbirth became increasingly difficult
and the babies kept getting born

365
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:28,560
younger.
And so that meant that women became

366
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:28,890
more.

367
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,330
As we became more cognitively able,
paradoxically,

368
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,290
women became more vulnerable at certain
key points of their lives because they

369
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,440
had increasingly fragile babies.
Now,

370
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,270
how did women deal with that?
Well,

371
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:47,271
I think they shamed men into becoming
caregivers of children because how else

372
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:51,330
would it have happened?
Like the typical mit mammo mail doesn't

373
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,870
hang around provisioning the litter,
you know,

374
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:57,540
in fact,
some of the males will eat the comms.

375
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,140
You don't want a black male.
Black bear around wolves are an

376
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,500
exception to this and you know there are
animals that are an exception.

377
00:19:04,501 --> 00:19:06,810
It happens in other species other than
human beings,

378
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:11,220
but human beings have this incredibly
long period of dependence that also

379
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:15,210
requires a relationship for that
relationship to the remain in tact.

380
00:19:15,211 --> 00:19:18,210
There has to be a fair bit of integrity
in the communication between the

381
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:20,790
partners.
So there's a real moral demand there as

382
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,624
well.

383
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,210
So anyways,
Adam doesn't show himself here as a

384
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,320
particularly courageous individual
because,

385
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,260
which I think is quite comical when God
says,

386
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,030
hold,
who told you that you were naked?

387
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,000
Have you eaten of that tree?
Which I told you not to.

388
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,870
The man says,
the woman who you gave to me,

389
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,510
she gave me the tree,
the tree,

390
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,790
and I did eat,
which is it doesn't say much for his

391
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,660
moral character because he rats out the
first chance he gets so,

392
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,870
which I also think isn't like the comedy
of that is underrated in this story.

393
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,840
That's a very funny sequence of events
so

394
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,640
and so the God talks to the woman who
says,

395
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,870
well,
what's this that you did?

396
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:05,220
And the woman said,
the serpent.

397
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,220
It was the serpent's fault.
The serpent beguiled me and I did eat.

398
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:13,610
Let me show you out.
I think I've showed you this picture

399
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:15,530
before,
but it's such a crazy cool picture.

400
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:16,580
I want to show it to you again.

401
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,690
Okay,
well,

402
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,880
for whatever reason this just doesn't
seem to be working.

403
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:40,610
So I'll tell you about the picture and
still it's a very car with

404
00:20:40,611 --> 00:20:44,720
representation and Christian iconography
and what it basically shows us that Mary

405
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,450
is holding up this incident.
You know,

406
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,240
up off the ground.
She's got her foot on a snake or a

407
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,270
lizard.
It's like,

408
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,110
well,
it doesn't take a biological genius to

409
00:20:53,111 --> 00:20:56,020
figure out what that means.
It means like the good mother keeps the

410
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,690
baby away from predatory reptiles,
you know,

411
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:02,320
and so you can see that as part of this
feedback loop that developed,

412
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,440
so there's predation,
it's particularly focused on women and

413
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:07,060
children,
which is exactly what it would be

414
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:11,560
focused on.
So and then in order for that to not be

415
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,980
to not the catastrophic,
then the women are appealing to the men

416
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,860
for protection and that starts to
increase because the women gets more

417
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,260
vulnerable as we get smarter and the
babies get smaller.

418
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,260
And so there's this triadic,
positive feedback loop that occurs that

419
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,090
wraps up brain development and we need
it.

420
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,520
There has to be a reason for the brain
development.

421
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,550
This is called a baldwin effect by the
way,

422
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,890
in biology,
the Baldwin effect is where something

423
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:39,610
happens to produce an outcome,
something biological happens that

424
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,300
produces a cultural outcome that
increases the probability that that

425
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:46,510
biological adaptations will serve
fitness.

426
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,900
So for example,
beavers cut down trees.

427
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,970
So,
and what that means is that the beavers

428
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:54,820
that are more adapted to aquatic
environments do better.

429
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:58,660
So as the beavers get more adapted to
aquatic environments and cutting down

430
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,430
trees,
they cut down more trees and make more

431
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:03,460
aquatic environments,
and so the thing spins until you get an

432
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,730
animal that's really,
really well adapted to doing precisely

433
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:07,990
that.
Well,

434
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,690
something happened to our cortex up and
very,

435
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:13,170
very short order and it was shorter or
you know,

436
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,440
it was so short that the human female
pelvic structure could barely keep up,

437
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,550
which is why birth is so rough.
And why so many children die in

438
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:22,384
childbirth.
I mean,

439
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,810
it doesn't happen much anymore,
but it used to happen a lot.

440
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,840
But before that,
middle of the 20th century,

441
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:30,910
women were dying in childbirth all the
time.

442
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,320
Plus it's extraordinarily difficult.
So even though the baby is born

443
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,810
premature,
for all intents and purposes,

444
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,090
it's still hell.
And the reason for that is the hand is

445
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:43,930
so big and it's even compressible
because the baby's head isn't fully

446
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:46,390
formed when it's born.
Bones have gaps in them.

447
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:50,650
So the baby's head compresses and like,
like mad visibly.

448
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,933
So,

449
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,820
so the woman says,
well,

450
00:22:57,821 --> 00:23:00,570
it was the serpent's fault,
so you know,

451
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,000
when you could almost,
you could also say this ties into the

452
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:07,450
issue of women induced selfconsciousness
among men.

453
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,500
So like if the woman's primary primary
problem is predation,

454
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,560
you know,
for her and the infant because of her

455
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,670
being burdened with the infants and the
infant's complete and absolute inability

456
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:22,120
to defend itself,
then it's going to drive the probability

457
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,390
that she's going to select someone for a
partner who can get rid of the damn

458
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,430
snakes.
And then you know,

459
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,610
when you see that echoed over and over
and human iconography,

460
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,920
it's like the hero is the person who
confronts the Dragon.

461
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,870
Okay,
well what do you do when you confront?

462
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,040
Drag it?
You get the girl.

463
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,000
That's the first thing.
But more importantly,

464
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,890
you get something of value.
And that's a real transmutation.

465
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:45,890
It's so interesting because what
happened was not only we figure out how

466
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:50,690
to defend ourselves against predators,
we figured out that going after them

467
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:54,380
voluntarily was unbelievably useful
because you might ask,

468
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,640
well,
what the hell transformed,

469
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,880
you know,
frugivores into carnivores.

470
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,543
It's,
you know,

471
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,890
chimps will eat and they do hunt,
they will eat monkeys,

472
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,040
but they primarily live on leaves,
which is pointless,

473
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:08,690
you know,
because the leaves have no calories

474
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:10,190
whatsoever.
Well,

475
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:13,880
human beings like we got transformed.
We are primarily fruit eaters and we

476
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:16,370
turned into hunters and we're thin and
fast,

477
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:21,371
which is very unlike a chimpanzee.
So not only were women selecting men who

478
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:25,520
were able and willing to protect
themselves against predators,

479
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,760
but that got translated even farther
into selection for,

480
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,580
for partners who would go out partly to
protect and partly also didn't want to

481
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,550
bring something back.
So I know it's pretty,

482
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,800
it's a pretty smart arrangement.
All things considered.

483
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,200
But the problem is,
you know,

484
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,240
one of the prices that women pay for
that is that they're partly selecting

485
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:49,400
for male aggression.
You know,

486
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,160
because the males aren't going to go,
they're not going to be able to do that

487
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:56,090
sort of thing unless they're tough and
they're not going to go out and do it

488
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:57,890
unless they're relatively fearless.

489
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,200
So you know,
and then you end up with a,

490
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,400
you got this weird balance between
needing a semi Predator and needing

491
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,310
someone who's going to be able to
integrate themselves into the household.

492
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,160
So that's the beauty and the beast thing
as far as I can tell.

493
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,990
So.
Okay.

494
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:16,760
So the law God says to the serpent,
because you've done this,

495
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:21,620
you're cursed above all cattle.
Cattle were generally animals and above

496
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,740
every beast of the field,
upon thy belly you will go and dust you

497
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:26,300
will eat all the days of your life.
Okay?

498
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:29,600
So the serpent scoped a problem there.
And uh,

499
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,360
be interesting to find out exactly why
those damn things lost their legs

500
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,090
because you know that snakes,
snakes,

501
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,680
lizards aren't snakes that grew legs.
Snakes are lizards that lost their legs.

502
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,990
The question is,
why did the hell did they lose their

503
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,330
legs?
Like what was it about the specifics of

504
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:51,530
their environment and their diet and
their locale that meant that legless

505
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:52,640
movement was better?

506
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,720
Well,
they're sneakier,

507
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,700
you know,
they can slither through the grass,

508
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:58,430
they can climb trees to.
Although he does do that,

509
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,510
but I don't know enough about snakes to
know exactly why it was that they lost

510
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:06,410
their legs,
but be interesting to find out and unto

511
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,920
the woman,
and I will put enmity between Dow and

512
00:26:08,921 --> 00:26:13,130
the woman and between seed and her seed,
it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt

513
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,240
bruise his heel.
Okay,

514
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:17,930
so it's just another representation of
the fact that there's going to be enmity

515
00:26:17,931 --> 00:26:22,931
between human beings and predatory will
say predatory reptiles under the woman.

516
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:24,021
He said,
oh,

517
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,600
greatly multiply that I sorrow and thy
conception.

518
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,310
That's not hard to figure out in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children and thy

519
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,370
desire shall be to thy husband and he
shall rule over thee.

520
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,500
Notice that doesn't say should it just
says Shell,

521
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,210
and that's not the same thing at all.

522
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,650
Remember,
this is a curse.

523
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,010
It's not a.
it's not a proposition about how the

524
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:49,800
world should be optimally structured.
It's far different than not.

525
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:50,341
It says,
look,

526
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,830
there's been a sequence of events and
this is going to be the outcome.

527
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:56,430
Childbirth is going to be hell.
It's going to be really difficult to

528
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,960
raise children and you're going to be
subject to the oppression of men.

529
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,681
It's like,
yeah,

530
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:04,670
well that's definitely what happened.
And then to Adam,

531
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:06,740
he says,
because you listened to your wife and

532
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,700
ate of the tree,
which I told you not to,

533
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,200
the ground is cursed for your sake.
You'll eat it in sorrow all the days of

534
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:17,940
your life.
It'll bring up thorns and thistles and

535
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,910
you'll eat the herb of the field.
So that's the introduce deduction of the

536
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:22,770
necessity of agriculture,
right?

537
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,130
You're no longer living in a garden
where things are just growing for free.

538
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,950
You're out there like dig in with a
stick and planting things,

539
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:31,080
which is work.
You know when you think,

540
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:33,720
well,
do animals work and the answer that is

541
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:37,020
no human beings work.
The answer to that is yes.

542
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,710
Why do human beings work?
How about because we discovered time,

543
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,610
right?
Because work means why do you work while

544
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:46,560
you worked for the future?
Obviously,

545
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,040
and you don't have the future unless
you've discovered time and you don't

546
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,140
care about the future unless you know
you're vulnerable.

547
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:56,160
So these things are tangled together and
so the cost of self consciousness is

548
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:00,780
that we're life becomes work,
life becomes suffering and work.

549
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:05,910
So it doesn't necessarily seem like a
particularly good deal in the sweat of

550
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:09,240
value face you shall eat bread until you
return to the ground for out of it.

551
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,900
You were taken for your dust and unto
dust you will return.

552
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,100
And Adam called his wasting eve because
she was the mother of all living and add

553
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,350
unto Adam also and to his wife did the
Lord God make coats of skins and clothed

554
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,101
them.
So okay,

555
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,934
well,
you know,

556
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:26,670
that's certainly part of the origin of
clothing,

557
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:28,530
especially in the colder climates,
right?

558
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:32,250
It's like you get the animal,
maybe it's a Predator and you wear it

559
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:33,540
to.
And to begin with,

560
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:35,750
we lived inside of them,
you know.

561
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,580
So I suspect,
although I don't know this for sure,

562
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:42,660
although I know it fairly well,
the earliest dwellings were mammoth

563
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:47,580
skins with mammoth bone poles.
And you can see,

564
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:49,260
see how that might've come about,
right?

565
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,640
Because you're out there hunting a
mammoth.

566
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,220
Maybe you're living in a cave or
wherever the hell people live,

567
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,490
or maybe you made something out of,
you know,

568
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,300
grasp Heidi and I don't know what the
Paleolithic people were living in,

569
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,710
but it starts to get cold.

570
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,600
Maybe the ice age starts creeping up,
right?

571
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:06,540
And so you stab yourself a nice mammoth
and a storm comes up.

572
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,330
What are you going to do?
What you've skinned it out,

573
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,390
at least in principle.
So you carry the meat home.

574
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,180
The logical thing to do is to get the
hell underneath the skin and after a day

575
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:17,460
or two in his throw them underneath
erotic mammas skin,

576
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,303
you might think,
well,

577
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,320
it wouldn't be a bad idea to like do
something to the skin so that it's not

578
00:29:22,321 --> 00:29:26,130
quite as intolerable to live under as it
might be if that's a tent,

579
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,960
like a tent.
His skin with bones,

580
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,390
you know?
And then the movement from that to this

581
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:31,680
is,
well,

582
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,600
it's a matter of degree rather than
kind.

583
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:38,490
So
and then the Lord God sent the man and

584
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:41,860
woman or the Lord God says,
behold the man is become one of us to

585
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:42,694
know good and evil.

586
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,390
So that's the sign of divinity,
to know good and evil,

587
00:29:47,391 --> 00:29:51,080
to have a moral sense,
and now lest he put forth his hand and

588
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:53,750
take also of the tree of life and eat
and live forever.

589
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,130
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
from the garden of Eden to till the

590
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,160
ground from whence he was taken.
So we drove out the man and he placed at

591
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,730
the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims
and a flaming sword which turned every

592
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:08,660
way to keep the way of the tree of life.
Well,

593
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,970
the last part of that,
it's very difficult to understand,

594
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,380
you know,
the tree of life issue.

595
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,570
So the idea there is that there's,
there's at least in principle,

596
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,030
a substance capable of,
of what,

597
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,060
of conferring and mortality,
but we don't have access to that.

598
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,240
And so,
and you know,

599
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,160
part of the return to Eden,
which is also the movement towards

600
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:33,380
heaven,
which is also the perfection of life,

601
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:37,340
is to defeat death.
Obviously into find the elixir of

602
00:30:37,341 --> 00:30:39,440
immortality,
which by the way was the goal of the

603
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:43,430
entire l chemical pursuit and that's
what turned into science and well,

604
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:45,560
what's the goal of science?
Well,

605
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:48,470
it's to make us healthy,
wealthy and live,

606
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,390
you know,
conceivably forever.

607
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,140
So you know,
it's not like people aren't continually

608
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:56,480
trying to get the fruit of the tree of
life.

609
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,460
Now there's a lot more to it than that,

610
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,500
the,
the ending of that,

611
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,680
but,
but what you have there is the expulsion

612
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,280
of human beings from an unconscious
paradise into history.

613
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,830
And that's exactly how the Bible is
structured.

614
00:31:10,831 --> 00:31:14,460
Like what happens is there's these
stories in genesis that are very,

615
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,770
very old.
There's the these stories.

616
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:19,770
There's the story of Cain and Abel.
There's the story of,

617
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,430
of a Babel,
the tower of Babel.

618
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,660
There's the story of Noah.
Then roughly speaking,

619
00:31:27,661 --> 00:31:31,230
although it happens a bit with no
history starts because then when you get

620
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,320
past that you get to the post flood
period,

621
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,390
select the pre flood period is so back
in prehistory that it's all archaic

622
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:43,440
mythology and the post flood period,
which basically starts with Abraham,

623
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,440
starts to become a history of the
culture of Israel.

624
00:31:46,441 --> 00:31:48,240
So it's actually,
it's actually literally

625
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,870
it's the history of a culture instead of
the mythologizing nation of radical

626
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,420
prehistory of the past.
So

627
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,320
no,
I think I'll,

628
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,860
I'll also just tell you briefly the Cain
and Abel story because we're there and

629
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:07,610
we might as well do it.
And this is,

630
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,110
this story is

631
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,790
roughly speaking 12 sentences long.
So,

632
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,170
okay.
So adamant.

633
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:24,330
Any habit child came and add and eve
says,

634
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:27,360
I have gotten a man from the Lord.
And again,

635
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:30,900
she bore his brother Abel and Abel was a
keeper of sheep,

636
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:35,040
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
So there's some antagonism between the,

637
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,620
um,
the shepherds and the farmers.

638
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,870
And that's like there's always an
between shepherds and farmers because of

639
00:32:40,871 --> 00:32:44,000
the shepherds,
the sheep to graze all over the place.

640
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,880
And that farmers want the shape to stay
the hell out of the,

641
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,430
out of the fields,
you know,

642
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,560
and that was all played out again in the
American west.

643
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:53,360
There was huge,
you know,

644
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,750
conflict between the farmers and the
ranchers for exactly the same reason.

645
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,530
So,
and it came in process of time.

646
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:03,230
It came to pass that cain brought of the
fruit of the ground,

647
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,520
an offering unto the Lord.

648
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,320
All right,
so this is a strange thing.

649
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,740
So we've already talked about the
discovery of time and the necessity for

650
00:33:09,741 --> 00:33:10,940
work.
Okay?

651
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:11,774
So,
you know,

652
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,560
we don't exactly know how people
conceptualize if those ideas.

653
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,230
It wasn't like they were cave men are
all sitting around the fire one day and

654
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:18,681
they said,
hey,

655
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:21,500
you know what?
I just discovered tomorrow we should do

656
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,180
something about that.
We should get to work.

657
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:26,990
It was God only knows how that happened.
It came out of the inarticulate,

658
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,970
biological substructure that is our past
and started to manifest itself.

659
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,460
God only knows and imaginative ideas,
but one of those,

660
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:37,220
imagine that the ideas is the idea of
the sacrifice.

661
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,590
You know,
it's the conceptualization of God.

662
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:43,670
The father as that,
which extends across time and judges,

663
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,470
then you make sacrificial offerings to
that which could be of your labor.

664
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:52,100
This is the fruits of your labor,
but the difference is trivial.

665
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,900
It's like,
look what I've done.

666
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,180
Is this good enough for you?
And believe me,

667
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,160
you guys are asking that question all
the time.

668
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,850
It's like it's just nonstop.
Is this good enough?

669
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,190
Is this good enough?
Is this sacrifice enough,

670
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,080
you know,
and what are you hoping for while you're

671
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:08,120
hoping for the blessings of.
Well,

672
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,890
I would say for all intents and
purposes,

673
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,990
you're hoping for the blessings of God
the father.

674
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,420
Now you might think about it in pure
cultural terms.

675
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,780
That's fine.
From a psychological perspective,

676
00:34:17,781 --> 00:34:22,070
it hardly makes any difference at all.
The point is is that to conceptualize

677
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,810
culture across time as a judgmental male
is a really smart idea.

678
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,460
It's a really,
really smart idea.

679
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,640
So.
And then it's just judgmental mail that

680
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:33,440
you have to make offerings to.
It's like,

681
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:33,891
yeah,
yeah,

682
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:36,200
that's,
that's pretty much exactly right.

683
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,390
Okay,
so that's what's happening and so people

684
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,170
are acting this out.

685
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:44,170
You have to make sacrifices.
Cane brings some vegetables and fruit

686
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,000
and,
and,

687
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,330
uh,
able brings no,

688
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:51,710
he brings like some lamps and these are
the high quality labs right there,

689
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:56,711
the choice cuts and uh,
we know that partly because the

690
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,690
firstling of the flock,
so that's the first born,

691
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,820
um,
say lambs,

692
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,510
they're there,
they had a reputation as the most

693
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:08,990
valuable and partly because of the
firstborn son was the most valuable.

694
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:12,890
It's the same kind of idea and there's a
reason the first born son was most

695
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,940
valuable and part of the reason is,
is that unless you give all your land to

696
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:21,941
one of your children by 12 generations,
all of your offspring are living on

697
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:25,670
something the size of a postage stamp
and they're all starving to death.

698
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,480
So it's unfair in a sense that it only
goes to the firstborn son.

699
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,070
But if it's an agricultural community,
there's no better solution.

700
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,670
And then at least you can tell your
second born son like,

701
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,900
well,
yeah,

702
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,490
you're a fine guy.
And you know,

703
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,300
it would be wonderful if you could get
something but you don't get it.

704
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:45,330
And it's not your fault.
It's not a mindful leader.

705
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:48,780
It's just that's just the rule and so
that's a good deal for everybody.

706
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:49,980
You know,
you don't get the farm,

707
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,160
you have to go make your own way,
but at least there's no enmity

708
00:35:53,161 --> 00:35:55,890
associated with it necessarily.
So anyways,

709
00:35:55,891 --> 00:36:00,891
cane makes this offering that looks like
it's about equality and God is happy

710
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:07,290
about that
and the Lord had respect unto Abel and

711
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,580
to his offering.
Now the book,

712
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,090
the story that makes this ambiguous say
you can kind of guess that the reason

713
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,970
that Abel gets away with it is because
while a,

714
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,250
he's bringing neat rather than
vegetables.

715
00:36:17,251 --> 00:36:18,600
Okay,
so that's higher quality,

716
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,970
much more,
much more nutrient dense.

717
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:25,560
It's much higher quality offering a food
and then it's also the of the meat.

718
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,890
It's the highest quality and so,
and then the next thing that happens is

719
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,500
it's acceptable to God.
So you know,

720
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,890
it might be the enabled just got it
right and God was happy or maybe God's

721
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:38,260
happy about able for some completely
arbitrary reason it out it and it

722
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,910
actually doesn't matter at all.
You get value out of both

723
00:36:41,911 --> 00:36:43,200
interpretations.
I mean,

724
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,250
I would say to err on the safe side that
offered the most valuable things is

725
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:50,500
probably your best bet,
but there is an art.

726
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,970
There's some respect for the arbitrary
nature of God to hear too.

727
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:57,840
You can't exactly be sure why he's not
happy with Kane.

728
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,750
So anyways,
it doesn't matter until Cain and his

729
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,540
offering,
he had not respect and Cain was very

730
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:06,600
wroth angry that his and his countenance
fall.

731
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,820
So like this is a permanent
disappointment for him.

732
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,880
He's angry,
resentful,

733
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,050
unhappy,
miserable.

734
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,680
All of those things he's failing.
That's what it says.

735
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,050
Fundamentally,
like if God isn't pleased by his

736
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:21,510
offerings,
what happens is he's failing and this

737
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,990
makes him very angry.
And then the Lord says,

738
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,730
what?
What's up with you?

739
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:30,180
Why are you angry and why has your face
fallen the way it has?

740
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,490
And uh,
he says more,

741
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,400
and this is where it gets.
It seems.

742
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:38,850
The story seems to reveal that this
actually has something to do with Kane

743
00:37:38,851 --> 00:37:41,670
rather than something to do with God.
So God says,

744
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,770
if you do well,
won't you be accepted?

745
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:45,930
Well,
that implies he wasn't doing well.

746
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:50,430
And if you don't do well,
then it's your fault.

747
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,370
And so God is saying,
don't,

748
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,950
don't bring your damn problems to me,
buck.

749
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:56,491
Oh,
it's like,

750
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:59,580
if this isn't working out for you,
it's because you're just not doing it

751
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,250
right.

752
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,130
You know you're,
you're not into this properly,

753
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:05,580
you're not doing well.
And also you're blending things that

754
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:08,250
shouldn't be blamed.
Now there's an interesting part of this.

755
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:13,050
So
the way that the story is sin lies at

756
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:16,110
your door was told,
it was told in a metaphorical structure

757
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:20,940
and sin was something that was
conceptualized as I lustful predatory

758
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:25,560
animal like a cat.
And so it was probably at Kane's door.

759
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:28,980
That's the metaphor.
And the idea is that cane allows this

760
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:33,981
thing in to have intercourse with him.
So there's this participation in like a

761
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,070
sexualized merger.
And so there's a,

762
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,170
there's an implication there.
And the implication is not only is

763
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,000
there's sin out the door,
but cain invites it in.

764
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:50,350
And how's it creative relationship,
like an intimately creative relationship

765
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:53,500
with it.
Now that's ridiculously smart because

766
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,860
that's what happens if people are
resentful because their offerings were

767
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,700
either second rate or got rejected,
you know,

768
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,160
one of the pathways is first they get
very,

769
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:06,460
very angry and their accountant is false
or they're resentful and hostile and

770
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,720
then the next thing is,
you know,

771
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:12,721
the little resentful fantasy start to
emerge and instead of thinking,

772
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:15,730
Huh,
that's not a very productive way to go

773
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:16,990
because it is like a door.

774
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,410
They think,
oh,

775
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,350
let's just see where we can go with
this.

776
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,240
And like after five or six years of
that,

777
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,940
you're in a prime position to go shoot
up Dawson College.

778
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,630
No,
you can go very far down that rabbit

779
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:29,650
hole.
And it's,

780
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,000
it's,
it's clearly motivated by the rejection

781
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:36,220
of the fruits of your being by
existence.

782
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:37,750
That's how you're going to interpret it

783
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:40,663
so

784
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,870
well.
And then so,

785
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,480
so kane obviously he's not happy with
that response.

786
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:49,750
Not In the least because it says exactly
the opposite of what he would like it to

787
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:50,290
say.
You know,

788
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,390
first of all,
that it's his own fault that he could do

789
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:55,720
something about it and then he doesn't
get to blame being and God,

790
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,430
so ken goes and has a chat with Abel and
it came to pass when they were in the

791
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:04,340
field that Cain rose up against Abel,
his brother and killed him.

792
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,730
Well,
the first story about real human beings

793
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,380
in the Bible is a murder.
It's a fratricide and it's.

794
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,560
It's the.
It's the antagonistic brothers,

795
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,770
one who is an archetype of good that's
able,

796
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,980
the others who have an archetype of evil
and those develop across time.

797
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,650
It's an it's an echoing or appreciate
doing.

798
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,100
That's another way of thinking about it.
If the battle between Christ and Satan,

799
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:32,840
because those are more.
There are more purely archetipal figures

800
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:35,750
and much more fleshed out,
but it's the earliest manifestation of

801
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:38,690
that idea.
The hostile brothers and what you get.

802
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:43,691
It's so sophisticated because basically
what it says is that if you do badly or

803
00:40:44,271 --> 00:40:49,271
you work hard either way and God rejects
your offerings and you become angry and

804
00:40:49,761 --> 00:40:51,950
resentful,
the first thing you're going to do is go

805
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,190
after the best thing you could possibly
imagine and do your best to wipe it out

806
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,631
and you might say,
well,

807
00:40:56,631 --> 00:40:57,710
why would you do that?

808
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,060
Well,
if there's a bunch of reasons,

809
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,310
well first of all,
it would feel good.

810
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,060
Second,
you get revenge against God because of

811
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:07,550
course this is God's favorite,
so if you can take him out of the

812
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,170
equation,
it's like that's a great deal.

813
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,470
Third,
the ideal against which you're

814
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:16,880
negatively contrasting yourself is now
gone because that's the problem with

815
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:19,310
having an ideal.
If you have an ideal,

816
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:24,370
then you're unworthy and it that's okay.
If you think the ideal is attainable or

817
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,170
even if you can move towards it,
but if all of a sudden the ideal is

818
00:41:27,171 --> 00:41:31,400
unattainable and you're sort of cast
among the damned the probability that

819
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,020
you're going to be able to view that
ideal.

820
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,280
Anything other than your enemy is very
low and so cain kills them,

821
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,690
so that's interesting because that
really means that's the end of it.

822
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:44,630
For cain,
he's destroyed his own ideal.

823
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,310
Well,
how do you live then?

824
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,260
How do you live?
If you've destroyed your own ideal,

825
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,620
you've got nowhere to go,
and so kane is so angry that he's

826
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,080
willing to destroy his own ideal to
obtain revenge and and,

827
00:41:55,081 --> 00:41:55,914
and,
and that's

828
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:02,650
12 lines story right at the beginning of
history and that's the layout for the

829
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,960
spirit of humanity.
It says,

830
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,140
we became self conscious,
our eyes open,

831
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:11,890
we became self conscious.
We recognized our vulnerability and an

832
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,340
attempt to overcome that.
We started to work and sacrifice,

833
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,830
but the problem with that is sometimes
that didn't work.

834
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:21,620
Maybe because God was feeling
particularly arbitrary that day or

835
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:23,570
because we're kind of useless either
way.

836
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:27,050
When it doesn't work,
that's not good because it's our only

837
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,660
remaining defense.
And so then what?

838
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Well then it's a choice.
It's more,

839
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,210
it's more choice right there between
good and evil.

840
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,190
And that's all foreshadowed in the first
story.

841
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,350
So now I'll add one more thing to this.
It took me a long time to figure out,

842
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:42,741
I thought,
well,

843
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:45,890
what the hell is the connection between
the knowledge of good and evil and

844
00:42:45,891 --> 00:42:49,100
nakedness and vulnerability and an
awareness,

845
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,560
and I thought,
okay,

846
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,160
there's,
there's production and there's evil,

847
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:59,360
so the lion kills the foreign and eats
it.

848
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,550
It's rough.
That's a tragedy.

849
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,390
Do you capture an enemy?
And then you keep them alive for three

850
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:13,010
weeks in pain before you kill them.
There's a lot more there than tragedy

851
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,070
that's malevolence.
And then he might say,

852
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,780
well,
how is it that you can come up with

853
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:20,480
malevolence?
And I would say as soon as your self

854
00:43:20,481 --> 00:43:22,560
conscious,
you can come up with malevolence because

855
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,120
if I know how I'm vulnerable and I know
that you're like me,

856
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,590
all I have to do is figure out what the
worst possible thing would be for me and

857
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:35,030
then I can do it to you.
And so you don't get the knowledge of

858
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:40,031
self conscious vulnerability without
instantly also obtaining the Norwich of

859
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:43,610
the difference between good and evil.
And that's also another thing that

860
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:47,150
really distinguishes people because we
can do things that are so terrible that

861
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:51,470
they make any of the things that animals
do look positively forgivable.

862
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:56,870
So you know that long without self
consciousness comes this tremendous

863
00:43:56,871 --> 00:44:01,871
widening of the capacity for fracture
from just natural tragedy,

864
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:07,010
let's say just natural life to this
whole spectrum of the ultimate in good

865
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,860
and the ultimate evil.
And then as soon as that happens,

866
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:13,340
the first thing we have is a display of
that in in dramatic form.

867
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,500
And that's the Cain and Abel Story.
Now,

868
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,800
interestingly enough,
and this is the last thing that I'll

869
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:21,270
tell you,
God doesn't kill Cain.

870
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,420
We can talk about why that is later.
But cain has children and s and keynes

871
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:30,890
descendants,
I think three generations down.

872
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,630
So if you killed one again,
sons,

873
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,020
he killed seven of you.
They kill seven of you.

874
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,720
And if you kill one of keynes
grandchildren,

875
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:44,660
then they killed 49 of you and then and
so forth until you get to this guy named

876
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,000
Tubal Kane who is either the grandson or
the great grandson.

877
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,550
I don't remember which.
And in tradition,

878
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,830
he's the first person who makes weapons
of war.

879
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,600
So there's this idea that the sacrifice
fails and that produces this descent

880
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:04,911
into murderous resentment.
And then that can amplify across a

881
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:10,560
culture and possess more and more people
until what happens is it finally erupts

882
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,090
in full,
full scale war.

883
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:14,130
And that's more than territoriality,
right?

884
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:18,210
It's more than a territorial dispute
because you can understand territorial

885
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:20,670
disputes.
This is territorial dispute with

886
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:22,530
malevolence.
And you know,

887
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:23,850
that's something that you,

888
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,660
that doesn't need any explanation.
We,

889
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:30,320
everyone understands what that is.
