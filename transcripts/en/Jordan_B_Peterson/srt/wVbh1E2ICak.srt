I'm making this video to say hi to my 
viewers and listeners in China and also 

2
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:06,924
to wish them happy new year.
I was prompted to do so by Ms Dot

00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,123
Mangee,
a Chinese students studying in Germany 

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,600
who has worked diligently to translate 
and subtitle a number of my videos.

00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,980

description of this video.

people to work on the translations.
