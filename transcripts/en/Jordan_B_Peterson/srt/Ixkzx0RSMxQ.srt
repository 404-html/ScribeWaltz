1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
Yeah,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,213
did you see the news?
Professor Jordan Peterson of the 

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,233
University of Toronto,
the professor who's been fighting so 

4
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:10,094
valiantly for free speech and academic 
freedom and against political 

5
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:16,910
correctness.
He has had his scholarly funding cut off

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,570
his grant application to continue as 
academic research.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,890
It was rejected for the first time in 
his career 10 times.

8
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:29,240
He's applied 10 times as being granted.
He's a successful professor,

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,570
beloved by his students,
huge popular following,

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,613
lots of published research.
He'd normally be treated like an 

11
00:00:35,811 --> 00:00:36,644
academic star,
but as soon as he was attacked by the 

12
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:42,380
forces of political correctness and he 
refused to submit to them.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,480
Well,
just by coincidence,

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,480
he was cut off by an anonymous 
government committee.

15
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm sorry,
I'm not buying it.

16
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,400
Just to be clear,
this research money isn't his salary,

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,383
it's the budget he needs to do his 
research to hire graduate students and 

18
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,380
other out of pocket expenses to pursue 
his scholarships.

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,220
That's what's being rejected.
They've cut off his studies,

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,750
which just happens to include studying 
the psychology of political correctness.

21
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,210
So I said to professor Peterson,
I said,

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,943
we can raise some money ourselves.
We don't need to depend on the 

23
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:17,060
government and they're anonymous 
bureaucrats.

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,000
I know for a fact that hundreds of 
thousands of people,

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,760
millions actually have watched his 
videos,

26
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,860
read about them in the news,
support them.

27
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,550
What if everyone chipped in a little bit
for his research ourselves.

28
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,090
What if we set up a 
website@wwwdotsupportpetersonresearch.com

29
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,000
and he said,
sure,

30
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,440
let's give it a try.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,553
I don't know why my research application
west rejected the reviews are anonymous 

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,933
and all the reasons are not yet in,
but it's the first time my funding 

33
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,024
request is being rejected in 20 years of
applications and I think it's important 

34
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,044
research.
It's basic science and more rarely it 

35
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:01,270
has immediate demonstrated public 
applicability,

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,583
which is hypothetically one of the 
social sciences and humanities research 

37
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,370
councils,
mandates.

38
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,743
I requested funding to continue research
into the fundamentals of personality 

39
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:14,260
psychology by not published a paper in 
2007.

40
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,900
Dr Colin de Young was the primary 
author,

41
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,610
the differentiated the standard big five
personality model into 10 aspects.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,010
That's extroversion,
neuroticism,

43
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,320
agreeableness,
conscientiousness and openness.

44
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,240
How we differentiate each of them into 
to some some traits we call them aspects

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,040
and that's become very widely used among
scientists as has the work we've done on

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,883
creativity.
We need to understand everything we can 

47
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:38,674
about personality as it's an important 
predictor of human behavior and I want 

48
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,690
to do the fundamental research property.

49
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,183
We've also been assessing the 
relationship between personality and 

50
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,670
political belief,
liberal,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,833
conservative and now politically correct
and it's the first time the latter has 

52
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,034
been investigated scientifically.
Those beliefs are having a huge impact 

53
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,230
on our culture and we believe it's 
important to understand.

54
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,383
Finally,
we've been producing online 

55
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,990
interventions such as the self authoring
suite.

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,033
You could see that@selfauthoring.com and
that's helped thousands of students get 

57
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,324
better grades and stay in school.
We've raised the grade point average of 

58
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:17,080
students 25 percent drop the dropout 
rate by about 20 percent and that's been

59
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:17,914
especially useful for men and also for 
non Western ethic minority students and 

60
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:24,550
we want to continue the basic research 
upon which such programs depend.

61
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,610
I should know too that none of this 
salary,

62
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,800
none of this research money goes to me,
none of it.

63
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,820
It doesn't supplement my salary,
doesn't pay any of my personal expenses.

64
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
It's pretty much all spent on the celery
and tuition of my three graduate 

65
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,960
students and I have three excellent 
graduate students and helps me support a

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,943
postpartum postdoctoral student.
The remainder pays research subjects 

67
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,790
with a bit leftover for travel.
We're supposed to present the results of

68
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,624
our research at scientific conferences.
We spend a little bit on computer 

69
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:54,310
equipment.
It's bare bones funding.

70
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,020
Am I live is very efficient in spending,
so the rejection of my grant application

71
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,854
primarily hurts my students as well as 
bringing the research effectively to a 

72
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,530
halt,
so I'd like to try to crowd fund it.

73
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:08,830
I think that would be interesting for 
people who support my work,

74
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,310
who've watched my videos or listening to
my podcasts are for anyone interested in

75
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,144
the research that I'm doing.
I guess I could invite you to join us 

76
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:17,350
and be part of it.
Doing so.

77
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,183
It would also help me learn whether that
sort of funding for scientists as 

78
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:21,484
possible because I've already been 
contacted by others whose research was 

79
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,830
curtailed for what appeared to be 
political reasons,

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,873
so if it can be done for me,
perhaps it can be done on a more 

81
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,304
permanent basis for others.
It'd be interesting to investigate that 

82
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,334
and see if it's possible.
My application was for a five year 

83
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,784
grant,
but it's less daunting if we do it one 

84
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,570
year at a time.
Anyways.

85
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,413
You can see anyone interested,
conceived by a full proposal and a 

86
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:44,734
shorter summary of it beneath this video
and now also app support Peterson 

87
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:51,070
research.
Don't come back to you.

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,700
Israel.
Thanks Professor

89
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,190
Peterson.
I'll chip in the first $100.

90
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,640
It's the least I can do in the name of 
free speech and academic freedom.

91
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,530
Now,
if that's too much for you,

92
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:05,190
well please consider $10.
If you can do more than $100,

93
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,024
please do.
Anyone who contributes $100 will get 

94
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:14,030
access to an exclusive thank you video 
from Professor Peterson for just $100.

95
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,104
Donors and anyone who contributes $250 
will be invited to a reception where he 

96
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,364
and his students will discuss his 
progress and if you contribute the 

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,950
thousand dollars,
you'll get all of the above as well as a

98
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:33,570
bound copy of the finished research 
personally autographed by him.

99
00:05:33,571 --> 00:05:38,571
So let's do this.
Go to support Peterson research.com.

100
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,733
We'll send all of the net proceeds 
directly to professor Peterson 

101
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,163
specifically for this research project.
Let's show the university and the 

102
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,320
government panel that rejected this 
project.

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,603
The Canadians believe in Professor 
Peterson and his research and we're not 

104
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,460
willing to let him or his work be 
silenced.

105
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,550
Let's show Canada and the world that our
universities are still free.

106
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Go to support Peterson research.com and 
let's help a great professor and scholar

107
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,520
complete his work.
Thank you.
