1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,130
Yeah,

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Dr Warren Farrell is the author of books
published in 17 languages and they 

3
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,540
include two award winning international 
bestsellers,

4
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,980
why men are the way they are.
Plus the myth of male power.

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,540
Warren has been chosen by the Financial 
Times as one of the world's top 100 

6
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,161
thought leaders.
He is currently the chair of the 

7
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:41,190
commission to create a White House 
council on boys and men.

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,720
He's the only man in the u s to have 
been elected three times to the board of

9
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:49,710
the National Organization for women now 
in New York City.

10
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,670
Dr Farrell has appeared repeatedly on 
Oprah today.

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,850
Good morning,
America and has been the subject of 

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,981
features on 20 slash 20 in Forbes,
the Wall Street Journal People Parade 

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,170
and the New York Times.
His Co author of his newest book is Dr 

14
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,340
John Gray.
The author of men are from Mars.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,250
Women are from Venus.
Once again,

16
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,240
this is the book we're going to talk not
only about the book today,

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,590
the new one,
the boy crisis,

18
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:21,591
but also about Dr Farrell,
his career and his goals and his aims 

19
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:22,860
and all of that.
And so I'd like to introduce everyone to

20
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,130
Dr Warren Farrell and ask him to tell us
what he's up to and why.

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,600
Well,
I guess what I'm up to sort of the 

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,550
evolution of maybe all that time since 
1969.

23
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,840
And uh,
when the women's movement surfaced,

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
I was very interested in it and we felt 
that women really need it to be able to 

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,180
be equally respected and enter the 
workplace and have options open.

26
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:47,800
And I was upset that women were not 
playing sports to the degree that I felt

27
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:51,400
that was creating the benefits to them 
of sports.

28
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:56,401
And so I started articulating this and 
started talking to my doctoral 

29
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:01,321
dissertation advisors about doing this.
And their first reaction was war in the 

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,230
women's movement.
It's just a fad.

31
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,460
And I said,
I don't think so.

32
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,410
I think this is the beginning of the 
change of,

33
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,140
of gender roles from both men and for 
women.

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,560
And so I will talk with them about that 
eventually convinced them that I could 

35
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,851
change my dissertation and that led me 
to being seen by now as someone who was 

36
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:23,941
a man who was receptive at a time that 
the feminist movement was getting a lot 

37
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:25,420
of accusations of being man haters.

38
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,390
And so I think I served the purpose of 
here's a,

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,900
here's a man,
a real life flesh man who advocates,

40
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,610
but we're advocating here,
um,

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:38,611
get up and say what we're saying.
It's going to be harder to call you a 

42
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:38,611
man hater.
And so,

43
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,120
um,
the,

44
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,450
I started doing that and then ended up 
speaking all around the world on women's

45
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:48,451
issues and the value of,
of women being secure enough and 

46
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,790
competent enough to be able to share the
breadwinning burdens that men handle.

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:57,100
Um,
and that was my focus for until the mid 

48
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,260
seventies.
And in the mid seventies I began to see 

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,350
that the feminist had made a great deal 
of progress.

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,380
And was.
Everyone was sort of getting on board 

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,801
who was in,
at least in the sort of middle class 

52
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,460
above an educated.
And so,

53
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,510
um,
that was,

54
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,110
but it was also a huge number of 
divorces occurring.

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,530
And so I began to say it's important for
the children to have both parents after 

56
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,940
divorce and,
uh,

57
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,970
Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem and a 
woman named Karen necro agreed with me,

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
but I'm now the board.
I was on the board of now at that time 

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,811
had gotten elected as a result of 
advocacy to the board of now and my 

60
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,590
fellow,
um,

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
and you know,
female co workers on the board of now 

62
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,031
said we were at a dilemma here.
And the dilemma is that the women are 

63
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,961
writing us saying they're gonna withdraw
from now if they don't have the option 

64
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,580
to determine what happens with the 
children after divorce.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,360
And we do,
we don't want to lose now membership 

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,150
because it's not only important for 
family purposes,

67
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,720
but for all the other agendas we have.
And so I said,

68
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,721
well,
the important thing is not women's 

69
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:09,721
rights or men's rights.

70
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,630
The important thing is knowing what's 
best for the children.

71
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,120
And they said Yes,
Warren,

72
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,130
great theory,
but we really need to focus on 

73
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:17,440
empowering women and at a broad 
spectrum.

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,800
And so they ended up all voting in terms
of giving women the option to be fully 

75
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,390
involved with the children or not,
depending on the,

76
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,490
under the guise that women know the best
though the children the best and 

77
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:31,690
therefore they know what's best for the 
children.

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,930
And so now,
and I began to have a significant amount

79
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:39,931
of tension over that point.
And Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem 

80
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:40,990
didn't weigh in.
They weren't on the board of now.

81
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,510
And then all the other boards of nows,
um,

82
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,040
around the country began to go the same 
way that the New York City now went.

83
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:53,041
And so that led to my disengagement.
And also I started forming hundreds of 

84
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:56,680
men's groups,
one of which I think,

85
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:58,360
you know,
was joined by John Lennon.

86
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,010
And um,
and that was a,

87
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:05,011
that had a big impact on both the people
in the groups that I began to see what 

88
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:09,880
memes pain was.
And so I began to articulate men's pain 

89
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,340
in as well as women's pain in my,
um,

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,400
in my presentations and when I was only 
articulating women's pain and women's 

91
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:22,561
challenges,
I would always almost always get 

92
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:25,231
standing ovations and maybe an average 
of three invitations for a new speaking 

93
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:28,240
engagement.
And that was helping me live financially

94
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:29,470
very well.
Um,

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
but then when I started to integrate the
perspectives and feelings of men from 

96
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:34,930
the men's groups,
uh,

97
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,020
there was a lot of,
um,

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,540
I think I didn't see those standing 
ovations.

99
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,950
Why not?
Why not

100
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,560
for new speaking engagements went from 
three to two to one,

101
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,910
and then eventually to zero.

102
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,040
Well,
it seems,

103
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,100
it seems self evident in some sense that
if you're articulating truthfully and 

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,250
carefully what would be good for either 
sex in some sense,

105
00:05:56,251 --> 00:06:00,500
you have to be articulating what would 
be good for both and unless you view the

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,600
battle,
unless you view reality as a battle 

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,650
ground between the sexes.
And then as an,

108
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,670
as a zero sum game,
we can't have an intelligent 

109
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,410
conversation about what's good for women
or what's good for man.

110
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,710
We have to have a conversation about 
what's good for men and men and women 

111
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,600
and women and men and women.
And so why do you think,

112
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,900
what was your sense of why it was when 
you started to raise these other issues 

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
that you were,
that you were admitted immediately 

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
unpopular.
Two questions.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,770
Why do you think that made you unpopular
and why is it that you saw early 

116
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,960
cottoned onto the fact that there was 
something going on that wasn't exactly 

117
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,050
kosher in relationship to now push for,
for,

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,500
for a particular kind of family 
structure and a particular view of 

119
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:50,500
women's rights?

120
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,490
Yes.
I think what happened for me was,

121
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,830
um,
I,

122
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,530
I just,
when I started focusing on what was best

123
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:03,531
for children and then I began to,
we only had minimal amount of research 

124
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,750
for that at that point in time.
This is your early seventies and,

125
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,810
but we had enough for me to make a case 
to the board and when I saw the 

126
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,090
resistance,
the degree to which there is,

127
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,290
there was two things happening.
One is we don't want to lose our power 

128
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,661
base.
We don't ever want to have a woman say 

129
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,870
whatever options she wants should be 
close to her,

130
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,200
and so I began to see that the women's 
movement was caring more about women 

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,500
than they were caring about the 
children.

132
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,140
That was the first disillusionment that 
I had.

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,630
Okay,
so you're a first year,

134
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:40,631
first ethical point in some sense is 
that when you're speaking about families

135
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:44,540
and you have to balance the rights and 
responsibilities of men,

136
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:49,541
women and children,
that it makes sense to you to put 

137
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:53,110
children's wellbeing first and foremost,
and then to place men and women as 

138
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,360
individual say or may perhaps even as a 
couple below that.

139
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,730
Yes,
exactly.

140
00:07:57,731 --> 00:08:01,480
What I was saying was that freedom of 
choice is wonderful,

141
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,650
but when you make the freedom of choice 
to have a child,

142
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,730
you then start prioritizing the needs of
the child you made,

143
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,240
but you knew that those needs were going
to be the child's needs first.

144
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,660
When you made that free choice,
so it wasn't like you were coerced into 

145
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,961
the,
into or pressured into making that 

146
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:23,500
choice.
You made the free choice to have a child

147
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,480
that incorporates the need to put the 
child's perspectives before yours.

148
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:30,040
That's part of your free choice.

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Right?
So it's basically the freedom there is 

150
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,341
the freedom to take on a certain kind of
relatively permanent responsibility and 

151
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,460
then to abide by that come hell or high 
water essentially into the future

152
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,200
that the children should not respect the
parents needs because part of what I 

153
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,830
talked about in the crisis is that ain't
nobody happy,

154
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,760
that everybody has to be happy at a 
family and that and that part of 

155
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,630
choosing a child to be responsible is 
teachers and the child not just to have 

156
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,440
its needs met,
but to also a care about what,

157
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,340
what,
what,

158
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,860
what their moms or dads needs are being 
met as well.

159
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,780
And that has to be very primary and 
primal and introduced early.

160
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,130
Um,
but that the,

161
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,600
uh,
and then secondly,

162
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,690
um,
I also felt to end and Betty Friedan and

163
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:20,691
felt this way also that the,
the women's movement would never go as 

164
00:09:20,691 --> 00:09:25,011
far as it could go unless the,
unless men were equally involved and 

165
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,490
proud of being involved in the fathering
role because a woman who has to take on 

166
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,351
the entire response,
a woman who wants to break glass 

167
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,340
ceilings and go as far as she can but 
also wants children can do that.

168
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,290
All of the man is working full time and 
she's working full time.

169
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,560
Either the children get neglected or um,
you know,

170
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,140
or something,
something has to go.

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,340
And so,
uh,

172
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,820
when we will often say to me,
you know,

173
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,460
I want to be a habit or a woman and I 
say,

174
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,040
you can be a habit.
All women revere.

175
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,690
Find a man who wants to be home full 
time with the children and let's reshape

176
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,590
society.
So we're saying that,

177
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,780
that men are not only worrier warriors,
that we,

178
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,220
that we praise and call heroes when they
go to war and they die for us,

179
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,650
but they're also warriors if they 
choose.

180
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,680
If you,
if you choose a man who wants to be 

181
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,081
fully involved with the child,
let's honor him and respect him because 

182
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:21,681
we know that the social bribes that we 
gave men to die allowed men to be 

183
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:25,730
willing to sacrifice their lives in 
exchange for being called hero.

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,580
Uh,
well,

185
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,480
if we,
if we read frame being a father as being

186
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:34,590
a different type of hero,
men will follow because men basically go

187
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,200
wherever the praise goes.
Okay?

188
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,910
Okay.
So in the seventies,

189
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:42,910
so you started to put forward the case 
for children and to some degree as well,

190
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:47,911
simultaneously the case for fathers.
And you received a fair bit of 

191
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:51,661
resistance as a consequence of that.
And it sounds like the way you're 

192
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:53,590
setting up the argument is that the 
conflict.

193
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:59,010
What was the conflict though?
Was it that the women who were being 

194
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,031
appealed to by now wanted untrammeled 
freedom of choice for them under all 

195
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,190
circumstances?
Because the reason I'm asking is because

196
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,580
if you have children,
obviously half the children you have or 

197
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,091
female,
and you assume that if it was a matter 

198
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,650
of of women's opening up,
what would be best for women in any kind

199
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:22,651
of medium to longterm manner that the 
concerns about daughters would be 

200
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,420
perhaps even if it isn't concerns about 
psalms,

201
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:29,020
it would be concerned about daughters 
that would emerge is paramount even over

202
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,880
the concerns of the mother.
So.

203
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,970
So what is it that was.
I still don't exactly get why it was 

204
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,800
that you weren't being successful 
because it doesn't make sense

205
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,430
because the car,
the priority.

206
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,490
There was two things happening 
simultaneously.

207
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,820
One was such a strong emphasis on 
freedom and the freedom manifested in 

208
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,651
two areas.
One is in the area of divorce in 

209
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:53,651
divorce,
that women were often saying,

210
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,960
I don't like my husband.
I want to start a new life.

211
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:59,830
I want to be able to move out of state 
if I wish to to get a job that I want or

212
00:11:59,831 --> 00:12:02,350
my new husband,
my new husband or boyfriend has a.

213
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,650
has a wants to move out of state.
And so I want to be able to take my 

214
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,560
children or child with me,
um,

215
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,620
because,
and,

216
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,550
and,
and I know what's best for my child,

217
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,820
which would be like the medical 
community saying we don't want women to 

218
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,391
be participating in the medical 
community because we know what's best 

219
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:21,490
for the patient and not,
not I,

220
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,800
not that women might have separate,
um,

221
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,360
a contribution to make.

222
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,370
On the other hand,
there was the,

223
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,760
there was women who wanted to have the 
freedom to be able to have children 

224
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,170
without being married.
Um,

225
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,200
and so 53 percent of women under 30 
today who have children in the United 

226
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,080
States have children without being 
married.

227
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,350
And the belief was again,
that women knew what was best for the 

228
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:46,350
children.
So we could,

229
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,050
they,
they could take this on if they want it 

230
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,050
to and they couldn't find a man that 
they really wanted a,

231
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,651
that they can raise a child by 
themselves with the children that 

232
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:55,651
themselves.
So,

233
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:59,150
so part of it was actually driven by 
questioning the necessity of the nuclear

234
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:04,621
family.
I was the smallest viable unit and part 

235
00:13:04,621 --> 00:13:04,860
the.
That's correct.

236
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,040
And B,
uh,

237
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,110
the,
the feminist community started,

238
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,110
um,
when I,

239
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,560
when I would go to a feminist rallies 
and so on,

240
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,820
there would be many books about,
you know,

241
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,880
then in the nuclear family being the,
the patriarchal that were oppressing 

242
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:21,340
women.

243
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,980
And so there,
so I think the feminist,

244
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,940
the feminist movement grew out of two 
huge iterations.

245
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,110
One was the civil rights movement where 
there was an oppressor and oppressed.

246
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,880
Then there was the,
um,

247
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,180
the,
the,

248
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,890
the movement of not just civil rights,
but um,

249
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,600
after the,
after the civil rights movement came 

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,220
the,
the Marxism and the belief that there 

251
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,250
were oppressors and oppressed in among 
Marxists.

252
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,890
And a lot of the feminist movement,
the early feminist movement was very.

253
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,130
We had groups like red stockings and 
many other groups like that that were 

254
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,250
socialist worker,
party type feminists that very much 

255
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,131
believed in Marxism.
And they had the dichotomy of oppressor 

256
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:07,030
versus oppressed.
So when it came to men,

257
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,240
men,
because we earned more because our 

258
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,150
biological,
not our biological parents socialized 

259
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,850
and biological responsibility was to 
earn the money and do that.

260
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,880
That type of nature of providing the 
feminists movement looked at the fact 

261
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,180
that we earned more money once we had 
children and so therefore we must be the

262
00:14:25,181 --> 00:14:30,181
oppressor like those,
like the porch was he a of Marxism and 

263
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:30,880
women must be the press.

264
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,520
So we have two things happening 
simultaneously.

265
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:38,521
This belief that the oppressors are 
wanting to be equally involved with the 

266
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,360
children.
And then secondly,

267
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,510
men having no idea why they had value.
Third men who are very few men that did 

268
00:14:48,761 --> 00:14:53,761
study the value of being a father,
how important it was to children didn't 

269
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:56,870
speak up about it and women can hear 
what men don't say.

270
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,230
So we had this world then where women 
were sharing the burden of a bread 

271
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,190
winning,
but no one was even interested in asking

272
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:11,600
the question about whether men could 
share the burden from women of,

273
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:13,460
of,
of earning a [inaudible],

274
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,610
providing equally for the family.
And,

275
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,740
and women weren't even interested in 
that because there are so focused on 

276
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,650
their freedom and so men as the 
oppressor.

277
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,920
And so there was no space to articulate 
the value of fathers and men in the 

278
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:28,040
family.

279
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,600
Okay.
So,

280
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:29,290
well,
you know,

281
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:33,070
your terminology is interesting too,
because you're attributing the,

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,780
the desire of the women who were pushing
against what you were saying,

283
00:15:37,781 --> 00:15:42,040
say you're attributing that to a desire 
to freedom,

284
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:47,041
but it seems to me that you could easily
use irresponsibility as a terminology 

285
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:47,670
there,
you know,

286
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,820
because free,
free,

287
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,821
well freedom without concern,
for the medium to longterm consequences 

288
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:56,380
of your actions,
especially when you're bringing in,

289
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:01,270
when you're dealing with minors,
when you're dealing with children,

290
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,880
that's not freedom.
That's irresponsibility.

291
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,110
That is absolutely a responsibility.
And that is where we as a society have 

292
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,930
failed to come in and say,
um,

293
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,000
you know,
first of all,

294
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,990
whenever either sex wins,
that is a woman wins custody,

295
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,600
for example,
whenever either sex winds,

296
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:21,910
both sexes lose.
And it's worse than that.

297
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,010
Whether they're whenever either sex 
winds,

298
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,990
both sexes,
Lewis.

299
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,250
And in the case of,
of family,

300
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,430
the children lose enormously.
And we also need to sort of understand 

301
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,230
exactly what is it that,
that leads to children and doing so much

302
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:40,580
better when they have fathers involved.
I was,

303
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,820
I started researching that and it ended 
up,

304
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,590
as you know,
with the boy crisis,

305
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
ended up with more than 70 different 
ways that when children have their 

306
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:54,760
father involved in about an equal way 
that they do so much better than.

307
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:54,820
Yeah.

308
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Well it would be a lovely thing if you 
could detail out some of that now and 

309
00:16:59,880 --> 00:16:59,880
then we'll go back to the,
the,

310
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,350
the political ideological story here,
but,

311
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,710
but see,
one of the things that's happened in 

312
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,620
Ontario recently is that we've,
our,

313
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:13,710
our government is introduced legislation
that is predicated on the idea that all 

314
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:20,611
families are equal and the,
the idea behind that you could argue is 

315
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,370
laudable.
I,

316
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,850
I wouldn't argue that,
but you could argue it,

317
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,140
that you know,
people have a variety of ways of solving

318
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:34,180
the problem of having children and that 
there's a variety of viable solutions to

319
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:39,181
that problem and that no one family 
organizational type should be privileged

320
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,070
above the others.
I mean,

321
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,400
I suppose with the exception of 
multi-partner marriages,

322
00:17:45,401 --> 00:17:50,401
which we still don't approve of,
let's say the problem with that as far 

323
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:55,491
as I can tell is that it does appear 
from the research that the nuclear 

324
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,810
family is the smallest,
smallest viable unit,

325
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:03,050
which is not to say that there aren't 
single mothers or single fathers who do 

326
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,590
an admirable job under trying 
conditions,

327
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,110
but part of the problem,
this is a deep problem,

328
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:10,110
is that whenever you.

329
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,600
Whenever you pause it,
something as a value,

330
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,500
so you might say,
well,

331
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,590
we want intact families,
mother and father.

332
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,740
That's that.
That's the value we're heading for 

333
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:21,740
because that seems to be best for the 
children.

334
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,700
Then you produce a rank order of 
accordance with that and the people who 

335
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,541
aren't in accordance with that value.
You can easily make a case that they're 

336
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:32,541
being discriminated against and we're in
a situation in our society now where 

337
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,610
even if the discrimination occurs,
let's say,

338
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,220
because of the pursuit of an admirable 
value,

339
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,460
it's regarded as prejudicial and I think
that's fed by that underlying hypothesis

340
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:48,651
that was anti nuclear family.
That any sort of hierarchical structure 

341
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:54,021
is part of the tear radical patriarchy.
It's something like that that's running 

342
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:54,021
underneath it.
So anyways,

343
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:56,490
let's review if you would be very 
helpful.

344
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:01,491
I think for everyone,
some of the many ways that it's 

345
00:19:01,491 --> 00:19:04,821
necessary for children to have fathers,
why that's better and perhaps also for 

346
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,390
for society as well,
not just for children.

347
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Absolutely.
Children that have a lot about an equal 

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,240
or more than equal father involvement 
have a number of things in common as a 

349
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,600
rule.
Then obviously there's reversals of this

350
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,180
and not that everyone gets this,
this,

351
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,260
this pattern,
but the first is they're far more likely

352
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:27,580
to have postpone gratification and I'll 
elaborate on that a little bit more.

353
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,910
Postpone gratification is probably the 
single most important quality to 

354
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,040
becoming successful and becoming 
successful,

355
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:41,041
especially being employed in a job that 
has some meaning for you is one of the 

356
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:45,811
most important ingredients in happiness 
and a sense of purpose and a sense of 

357
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:51,331
motivation and a sense of willingness to
get up in the morning and so I'm in a 

358
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,771
little while.
I'll be happy to just trace back how 

359
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:56,530
that postpone gratification happens more
when you have a father.

360
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,590
Yeah,
cause I'm really interested in hearing 

361
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,590
about that.

362
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,680
Second.
Second layer is for children that have 

363
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,080
an equal amount of father involvement 
are far less likely to be depressed.

364
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:11,081
They're far less,
more likely to be assertive and not 

365
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:14,651
aggressive,
which is something you usually think of 

366
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:17,261
men as being aggressive,
but actually the children of both girls 

367
00:20:17,261 --> 00:20:21,671
and boys whose fathers are involved are 
far more likely to understand the 

368
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:25,661
distinction between being assertive and 
being aggressive and choose 

369
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:25,661
assertiveness.
Boys,

370
00:20:25,661 --> 00:20:28,000
another surprising one for me,
um,

371
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,260
and doing the research was finding that 
boys and girls who are raised with about

372
00:20:33,261 --> 00:20:38,261
an equal amount of father involvement 
are far more likely to be empathetic 

373
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:42,760
because I always thought of empathy 
coming predominantly from moms and I'll 

374
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,230
be happy to explain in a bit why it does
come more from moms,

375
00:20:45,231 --> 00:20:49,180
but why the outcome for the is not more 
empathy.

376
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,320
The outcome for the child is less 
empathy.

377
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,110
So a little bit more on that later.

378
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,150
Far more likely.
Both boys and girls should drop out of 

379
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,520
school.
If there isn't far father involvement,

380
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,150
I'm far more likely when a,
when a,

381
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,240
when a relationship breaks up,
um,

382
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,470
a child that has not had significant 
father involvement is much more likely 

383
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,000
to be depressed and be withdrawn and b,
feel alienated.

384
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,270
I'm far more likely to be addicted to 
video games,

385
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,880
far more likely to be addicted to video 
porn.

386
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,810
I'm far more likely to have few social 
skills,

387
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:28,000
few emotional skills to do worse in 
every academic area,

388
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,030
but especially in reading and writing,
which are the two biggest predictors of 

389
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,220
success are far more likely to have a 
lower sperm count have.

390
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:37,960
Um,
and here's an amazing thing.

391
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:42,961
I just discovered toward the end of the 
research for the boy crisis I saw in 

392
00:21:42,961 --> 00:21:47,701
pediatrics magazine,
and that children who by the age of nine

393
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,400
don't have a significant amount of 
father involvement.

394
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,330
Both girls and boys are likely to have 
shorter telomeres.

395
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,650
And as most of us know,
the telomeres are pivotal in predicting 

396
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,850
life expectancy.
So boys and girls,

397
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:08,851
the average shorter telomeres for a nine
year old boy or girl without father 

398
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:13,000
involvement was 14 percent a w,
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:18,001
It was a 14 percent shorter,
but the boys tell it mirrors were then 

400
00:22:19,481 --> 00:22:22,150
again,
40 percent shorter than the girls.

401
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,450
So here this was predicting about a 14 
percent shorter life expectancy for the 

402
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:31,720
average child without father involvement
by the age of nine already.

403
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,070
And yet the boys were suffering more.
So two things fascinated me.

404
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:37,310
There is,
you know,

405
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,090
all the things like,
you know,

406
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,250
dropping out of school and things like 
that.

407
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I asked myself,
well maybe this is because boys with 

408
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,800
father involvement,
I'm just have better,

409
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,490
you know,
better neighborhoods.

410
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:50,250
Um,
they,

411
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,210
they,
the father's earned more,

412
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:57,211
the families are more,
maybe it's a matter of poverty versus 

413
00:22:57,211 --> 00:22:57,211
poverty.

414
00:22:57,211 --> 00:23:00,660
So I started looking at a boys and girls
growing up in and good quote,

415
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:05,911
good neighborhoods with good schools and
comparing them with boys and girls 

416
00:23:05,911 --> 00:23:09,691
growing up in poor neighborhoods in poor
schools and found that the boys and 

417
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:15,061
girls growing up in good neighborhoods 
with poor schools that did not have 

418
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:19,080
significant father involvement.
Did about the same as boys and girls 

419
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,410
growing up in poor neighborhoods with 
poor schools that did have father 

420
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,600
involvement.
That father involvement was really as,

421
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,420
as good a predictor of success,
um,

422
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:33,550
as the quality of the school system,
the quality of the neighborhood and the 

423
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,440
socioeconomic class.
And this is what's led to,

424
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,830
um,
uh,

425
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,330
to the psychologist I'm gathering 
together behind people like worship 100 

426
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,380
psychologists and researchers saying,
you know,

427
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,200
this is not a correlation.
The involvement of father,

428
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:51,140
this is not a matter of socioeconomic 
issues.

429
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,620
This is a matter of actual father's,
father's,

430
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,090
father's involvement.

431
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,800
Especially the biological father's 
involvement actually makes a significant

432
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,801
difference.
We have been wrong about the assumption 

433
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:05,801
that this was probably just a 
correlation.

434
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:10,690
And so the more I looked,
the more I found just every nightmare of

435
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,810
a parent to be so increased,
uh,

436
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:17,420
when there was not a significant amount 
of father involvement.

437
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,450
And I was seeing,
I was dating between before I married 

438
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,400
lives.
The woman you just met just before we 

439
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,680
got on a,
before we got married 14 years ago,

440
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,930
um,
I was dating a number of women.

441
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,210
Almost every woman had a,
was a single mother,

442
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,660
and these,
every single woman was working her rear 

443
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,171
off line to balance her life.
Every woman used the word overwhelmed by

444
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,710
the way she felt.
Um,

445
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,380
every,
almost every woman said,

446
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,660
well,
I'd like my dad and the dad involved,

447
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:49,430
but um,
but when the.

448
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,640
But I started listening to the butts of 
the women and then listening to men who 

449
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:59,951
had,
wanted to be more involved with their 

450
00:24:59,951 --> 00:25:01,580
children and listening to what the 
differences were between what the Mit,

451
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,620
what made the men feel,
not wanted,

452
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,950
what made the men feel excluded and why 
the women felt that they needed to not 

453
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,770
have the man involved.

454
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,780
And I saw this entire set of 
misunderstandings here and if I hope the

455
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,900
boy crisis does anything,
it's just sort of explained,

456
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,290
you know,
here are the 10 major things that Dad's 

457
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,621
do that that's sort of a noi.
Women or make women feel that they're 

458
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,270
not protecting their children 
adequately.

459
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,600
Which when they understand the purpose 
of these things and dads get their 

460
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,010
homework done enough to articulate to 
the moms the purpose of these things 

461
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,840
that will realize that the,
that these are necessary ingredients in 

462
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:43,840
a child's life.

463
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,810
Okay,
so that's a good,

464
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:49,790
that's a good place to go next.
So you laid out a whole slew of reasons,

465
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,020
a slew of consequences of fatherlessness
and will return back to the causal 

466
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,920
relationship between men do and these 
beneficial outcomes.

467
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:02,921
But if you could go on now to tell us 
what it is that men are doing at a micro

468
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:08,201
level than we could return to the causal
link between that and not positive 

469
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:09,650
outcomes.
And you said that those also caused some

470
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,060
contention in the household?

471
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,450
Yes.
I'll give one example of,

472
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:18,451
for example,
will be I'm a father is rough housing 

473
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,871
with the kids and the moms looking over 
and saying looking askance and thinking,

474
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:24,250
okay,
when should I interfere?

475
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,010
When should I not interfere?
And the mom saying to herself,

476
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,900
I'm Jimmy,
you know,

477
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,660
um,
please keep the kids away from the,

478
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:34,800
the Credenza.
They are paid the kids away from the the

479
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,660
couch because they could hit their head 
there.

480
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Why don't you wait,
have they to tomorrow when you can take 

481
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,270
this outside.
I feel much safer the kids,

482
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,890
and then the mother is sort of 
hesitating to not be overly controlling 

483
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:53,660
and yet at the same time she's feeling 
she has to monitor the husband as well 

484
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,311
as monitor the husband with the kids and
she's feeling in the back of her mind 

485
00:26:58,311 --> 00:26:59,880
like I sooner or later that's going to 
be,

486
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,280
there's going to be an accident here and
I'm going to be upset with myself for 

487
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,300
not being stricter,
but on the other hand,

488
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:08,870
the kids seem to be having fun,
so I should let things go.

489
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,430
Well,
you know,

490
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:14,431
there's A.
There's a cycle biologist named Jaak 

491
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:17,790
Panksepp who was one of the world's 
great biological psychologists and he 

492
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,840
studied rough and tumble play in in 
animals.

493
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,240
So rats,
for example,

494
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,410
a huge part of the socialization process
that's key to the development of the 

495
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:32,440
prefrontal cortex in juvenile male 
routes in particular emerges and matures

496
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,360
as a consequence of rough and tumble 
play.

497
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,450
And one of the amazing things that 
Panksepp discovered it,

498
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,550
and this truly is an amazing thing,
is that,

499
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,530
um,
if you,

500
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,830
if you pair two rats together and then 
let them play repeated bouts,

501
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,510
the big rat will dominate the little rap
to begin with in the first bout.

502
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,900
But if the big rat doesn't let the 
little rat win about 30 percent of the 

503
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,220
time in repeated play boats,
then the little rat won't play anymore.

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,760
So you get an emergent morality in 
emergent play centered morality even 

505
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,990
among rats as a consequence of rough and
tumble play.

506
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,420
And that rough and tumble.
I did a fair bit of research on rough 

507
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:13,810
and tumble play about all,
it's probably 20 years ago now,

508
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:18,811
15 years ago anyways.
And it's really quite clear that rough 

509
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:22,621
and tumble play helps children 
parameterize their bodies so that they 

510
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:23,470
know how they extend and,
and,

511
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,490
and also what limits there isn't the use
of physical interactions with another 

512
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,500
person.
What's fun,

513
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,380
what's provocative,
what's pushing it too far,

514
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,490
what's painful?
And of course kids love rough and tumble

515
00:28:36,491 --> 00:28:39,580
play as well.
They're just absolutely starving for it.

516
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:43,150
And we've squeezed it out of the 
kindergarten is the nursery schools,

517
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,250
the elementary schools,
the junior high schools,

518
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,080
all of that and for and for bid.
And what Panksepp also found was that if

519
00:28:50,081 --> 00:28:54,340
you deprived juvenile routes,
have the opportunity to engage in active

520
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:59,341
rough and tumble play,
that they showed symptoms that were 

521
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:02,770
broadly analogous to those have 
attention deficit disorder in human boys

522
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,040
and that you could also treat that with 
Ritalin the same way in routes as you 

523
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,040
could with boys.

524
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,420
So there's that rough and tumble play 
issue,

525
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,570
you know,
when you might think to the question is 

526
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,600
one question is why might a mother be 
distrustful of the rough and tumble play

527
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,930
episode?
And some of that might be sensitivity 

528
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,350
with regards to the kids.
But huge part of that also was trust on 

529
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,550
her trust with regards to the father,
you know,

530
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:33,790
because it's rambunctious and noisy.
And if she trusts,

531
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,440
let's say that that act of masculinity 
that plays rough,

532
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,200
then she'll stay away and let the fund 
happen.

533
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,570
But if there's distrust running through 
the family,

534
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:47,410
then then she'll stand between the kids 
and the father.

535
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:52,411
And then he won't get to involve himself
in that way and then he'll turn off and 

536
00:29:52,411 --> 00:29:52,630
I've seen that happen.
Many,

537
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,190
many families.
Okay.

538
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,410
So there's rough and tumble play.
That's a big one.

539
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,120
What else?
What else do you see?

540
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Let me take the.
The evolution of how rough and tumble 

541
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,480
play goes in all the dimensions of the 
slippery slope that it leads to.

542
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,010
So the,
the father,

543
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,060
the what the mom,
when the mom or the dad knew is that 

544
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,280
this rough and tumble play leads to the 
types of things that you just mentioned,

545
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,710
but you're also evident in,
you know,

546
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,730
an elephants and so on.
But it also leads to the distinction 

547
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:26,291
between a child being able to 
distinguish between being assertive 

548
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:26,291
versus aggressive.
So the.

549
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,860
So the kid starts,
for example,

550
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:32,861
maybe I'm kicking the dad and the wrong 
place or poking the data and the eyes 

551
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:33,980
are pulling the dad's hair.
And the dad says,

552
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,990
sweetie,
you can fake.

553
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,080
You can fake.
I contacted the left and then move to 

554
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,080
the right to win in this wrestling 
match.

555
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,010
Or you can,
um,

556
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,860
you know,
you can do this,

557
00:30:42,861 --> 00:30:46,610
this and this.
But you can't do these things and if you

558
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:48,950
do do these things will stop the rough 
housing.

559
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,850
Yeah.
So there.

560
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,730
So there is a really important issue 
there.

561
00:30:51,731 --> 00:30:54,010
So two things there.
So imagine that.

562
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,910
Imagine that a rough and tumbled boat is
like a dance.

563
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,240
Okay.
And the point of the dances so that both

564
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:06,241
people are having a good time while it's
happening because otherwise it's not 

565
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:09,961
play right.
And then as soon as either party is no 

566
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:11,030
longer having a good time,
you've actually snapped out of the cycle

567
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:16,031
biological function of the play circuit.
So basically what you're telling the 

568
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:20,041
child by putting those rules on is we 
can interact physically within a very 

569
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:24,871
limited set of parameters and you,
you have to learn to do is to be sophist

570
00:31:24,961 --> 00:31:27,760
as sophisticated player within that set 
of parameters.

571
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,950
And you want to learn how to push the 
boundaries,

572
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:34,951
right?
Because the most fun rough and tumble 

573
00:31:34,951 --> 00:31:35,560
play is right on the edge between 
assertiveness and aggression.

574
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,660
So.
And you can see kids,

575
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:40,980
like I used to work in daycare centers 
when I was a kid when I was 18,

576
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,790
19 and the kids would line up to rough 
and tumble play with me because that was

577
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,860
still allowable then and they were so 
desperate for it,

578
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:52,861
it was just ridiculous and I could 
really tell the difference between the 

579
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:57,181
kids who had engaged in that sort of 
play and the ones that hadn't and the 

580
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,871
ones that hadn't were painfully awkward 
and they would hurt themselves and you,

581
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,180
when you wrestled with them,
they put their thumb in your eye or.

582
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,200
And they would cry often too when they 
got surprised but not hurt,

583
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,700
you know,
because they couldn't tell the 

584
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:13,700
difference between just being startled 
and being hurt.

585
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:18,120
And so they were fragile.
And that also made them not fun to play 

586
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,211
with.
And the thing that's so interesting 

587
00:32:21,211 --> 00:32:23,551
about that too is piaget talked about 
this when he talked about the 

588
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:24,080
development of children is that,
you know,

589
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,100
the more sophisticated pretend play and 
then sophisticated cognitive play that 

590
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:35,011
emerges say between five and seven.
And then with the cognitive play older 

591
00:32:35,011 --> 00:32:39,121
than that is that unless you have that 
underlying cycle motor embodied dance 

592
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:45,011
down,
you don't get to really proceed in a 

593
00:32:45,011 --> 00:32:48,551
sophisticated way to those higher levels
of play because other people don't want 

594
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,930
to play with you.
So the rough and tumble play,

595
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,090
the importance of that can hardly be 
overstated.

596
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:53,660
So

597
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,990
absolutely.
And the framework here is that when you 

598
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,950
set up a system where you said that men 
are part of the patriarchy,

599
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:01,750
their,
their,

600
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,760
their,
their desire is to dominate women and 

601
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,930
make rules to benefit the expensive,
the benefit men at the expense of women.

602
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:13,430
You have a framework or an emotional 
setting which does not,

603
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:18,431
is not conducive men saying,
here's my value or women's saying,

604
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,650
let me see what the checks and balances 
of parenting is that leads to the best 

605
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,310
of you coming out.
And the best of me coming out,

606
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,610
all of that has sort of skipped over and
inherent sense of father knows best to 

607
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,560
father knows less.
Um,

608
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,200
and,
and,

609
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,120
and so the,
the,

610
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,400
the,
the process that I'll be sharing in a 

611
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
moment of what rough housing leads to 
and the slippery slope that happens when

612
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,430
it doesn't happen,
um,

613
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
is,
is what is not even been nurtured as a 

614
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,670
possibility to be articulated in this 
culture at the.

615
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,190
I also think too,
you know,

616
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:57,750
that if you have a partner who hasn't 
been played with,

617
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,890
then that partner can't tell the 
difference between Boisterous 

618
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,851
rambunctiousness and aggression and if 
there's a hypothesis about domination 

619
00:34:08,251 --> 00:34:11,220
and the patriarchy running its course 
underneath that,

620
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,460
then there's going to be conceptual 
confusion about the physical 

621
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,401
interactions that have the appearance of
submission and dominance because that's 

622
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:22,180
part of the rough housing play routine.
That,

623
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:27,210
that is going to be viewed through a 
lens of tyrannical interaction rather 

624
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,341
than just good fun.
I mean you can tell the difference 

625
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:32,610
because if the kids are rough and tumble
playing,

626
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,650
they're unbelievably enthusiastic about 
it and engaged and laughing and giggling

627
00:34:37,651 --> 00:34:41,070
and like they'll play right to the point
of exhaustion because they need it.

628
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,100
They need it so much.
But that's a hard thing to observe from 

629
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,680
the outside.
If you're not accustomed to that,

630
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:49,590
and if you don't have that framework of,
of um,

631
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,930
of men having a dad's having a value to 
begin with,

632
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:54,550
absolutely no.
So here's,

633
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:59,580
here's maybe what might bring,
be helpful for a mom to understand that 

634
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:04,741
the rough and tumble play we now know 
helps children distinguished between 

635
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:10,171
being assertive and aggressive,
but a number of other things off also 

636
00:35:10,171 --> 00:35:13,921
happened during that play,
which is a bond that is created between 

637
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:18,180
the father and the child.
And in almost every I've been doing 

638
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,810
expert witness work to help children 
have both parents.

639
00:35:19,811 --> 00:35:24,811
You have to divorce.
I've observed more than 50 families and 

640
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:27,781
um,
and usually the father interacting with 

641
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:27,781
the,
with the children.

642
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:28,450
And in almost every case,
every case,

643
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,350
I try believe that I have seen this,
this,

644
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,600
this bond is used by the father to say 
things like,

645
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:36,820
okay,
we no more rough housing.

646
00:35:36,821 --> 00:35:39,510
Now tell you what,
you get your homework done.

647
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,060
You get your chores done,
you get all ready for bed,

648
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:42,900
brush teeth,
teeth,

649
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:43,460
brush.
Well,

650
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,310
and the bedtime is 9:00.
Whenever you get all that done,

651
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,970
we'll have between the time you get it 
done and the time of 9:00

652
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,280
in order for you to have some more fun 
either with rough housing or reading my 

653
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,030
favorites,
favorite story or whatever.

654
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,740
Whatever you prefer.
It's your choice.

655
00:35:58,930 --> 00:35:59,510
Well,
you know with,

656
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,840
with Panksepp's work too,
he found that the little rats,

657
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:07,870
the rats will work to enter a play arena
because because play,

658
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,510
you think play is a so panksepp 
established very,

659
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:15,260
very clearly that there is a primary 
place circuit in mammals.

660
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,390
It's a separate cycle,
biological circuit.

661
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:22,391
It's not exploration.
It's a whole different motivational 

662
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,900
drive,
but that the activity in that circuit is

663
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:28,901
intrinsically pleasurable and part of 
that appears to be because it's so key 

664
00:36:28,901 --> 00:36:33,461
to proper socialization that it.
It's regarded by my children and by 

665
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:39,221
social mammals as intrinsically valuable
and so it makes perfect sense that that 

666
00:36:39,221 --> 00:36:40,610
can be used as a source of primary 
reward.

667
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:45,611
And I think your comments about the the 
man and the kids binding themselves 

668
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:49,460
together through play is also really 
important because one of the things that

669
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:51,520
I do with young man who,
you know,

670
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,530
I think young men tend to be somewhat 
alienated from infants who are under 

671
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:00,641
about nine months old because they're 
not really equipped to know what the 

672
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:00,641
hell to do with them.

673
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:02,420
I mean they can learn and they can be 
good at it,

674
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:06,260
but it's not their domain of natural 
expertise.

675
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:11,440
But once a kid hits about nine months 
and starts to be able to imitate and to 

676
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,611
pound end to end to play and to respond 
to gentle teasing like that's a perfect 

677
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:20,891
time for the father to swoop in.
Just very helpful for a mother by the 

678
00:37:20,891 --> 00:37:24,371
way,
who wants to have another child and to 

679
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,471
start really cementing a relationship 
that's based on that interest in 

680
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:29,630
combination of,
of high energy fun.

681
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,930
Plus the disciplined interactions that 
are necessary as a precursor to that.

682
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:40,241
And if you interfere with that,
then you stop the farther from being 

683
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:41,150
able to form that pro from liking his 
kids.

684
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:42,230
Really.
You know,

685
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:44,200
because that's how the liking comes 
about is,

686
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,270
is through play and so it's,
it's crucial.

687
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:48,860
It's crucial significance.

688
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,760
Absolutely.
And thank you.

689
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,430
The,
the,

690
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:56,600
the,
the additional framework that you're 

691
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:56,600
placing on this has really deepened my 
own understanding of the

692
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,800
neuroscience written by Jaak Panksepp.
It's on my reading list on my website 

693
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,360
because he lays out the findings from 
the animal literature on the primary 

694
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,390
place circuit.
It's really,

695
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,530
he should have won a Nobel prize for it.
I mean discovering an entirely new 

696
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,060
motivational system in the brain,
a major,

697
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:22,061
major contribution and to also.
The other thing that he did that was so 

698
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:25,961
cool and sort of reminded me of John 
Piaget's work a little bit is he made a 

699
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:30,341
very strong case that out of play 
emerges an ethic and you know that.

700
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:36,791
That's why I was so interested when you 
mentioned that interactions father 

701
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,260
actually increase empathy because you 
know,

702
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,790
if someone has empathy for you,
that means that,

703
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,610
I mean that can lead to a certain kind 
of narcissism,

704
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:50,611
right?
Because you're always the center of 

705
00:38:50,611 --> 00:38:51,931
attention.
You're not empathic unless you learn 

706
00:38:51,931 --> 00:38:54,660
that you're not any more important than 
the next person and particularly the 

707
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:54,730
person that you happen to be playing 
with.

708
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,540
So.
Okay,

709
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,850
so let's continue with,
with what fathers are doing.

710
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,460
Yep.
Yep.

711
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,690
So in that rough housing,
what happens is that the bond that is 

712
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,970
created by the dad allows the dad to 
say,

713
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:13,300
you know,
here's will continue the rough housing 

714
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,030
if you get between 8:30
and nine,

715
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,470
if you,
if you have everything done,

716
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,220
um,
but so that the child learns to postpone

717
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:24,221
gratification from doing the what it 
loves to do right then and there that is

718
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:30,220
the rough house with and deal with what 
it has to deal with before it gets more 

719
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,270
of what it needs.
And so,

720
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:32,700
but the.

721
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,380
So That's interesting.
So you,

722
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,210
you actually think,
and I wonder if there's been any,

723
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,510
any.
See we don't know much about the origin 

724
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,870
of the trait conscientiousness,
which is at least in part,

725
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:48,010
the ability to delay gratification.
And it is after intelligence.

726
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,320
It's the best predictor of longterm life
success,

727
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:55,321
especially in managerial and 
administrative jobs and algorithmic 

728
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:55,321
jobs.
It's not associated with creativity,

729
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,980
but that's.
That's a side issue.

730
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:02,310
So your hypothesis is that the primary 
way men are socializing that is by using

731
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,250
work to play as a.
As a,

732
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,030
as a bridge,

733
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:07,760
yes.
The,

734
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:09,850
the.
That that play creates a bond.

735
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:13,730
So a lot of the problem is when,
when moms often say,

736
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,980
you know,
you have to do this,

737
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:16,120
you have to do that,
you have to do this,

738
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:21,121
you have to do that.
The mother is often experienced by the 

739
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:24,010
child has sort of the disciplinarian 
who's always making him or her do things

740
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,040
and there's a seeds of rebellion start 
to occur of sort of like how much am I 

741
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,030
going to be myself?
How much am I going to do what mom does?

742
00:40:31,031 --> 00:40:34,340
Do I want to be a mama's boy?
Or it doesn't even have to know.

743
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,360
You're just sort of feel like you're 
being pushed down by all the rules.

744
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,940
But with dad,
the bone that is,

745
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,100
or moms who rough house with the 
children,

746
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,070
a bond is created and from the end and 
you want to return to that,

747
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,140
that connection.

748
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,140
So you.
It's like a child going on a 

749
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,140
rollercoaster,
you were,

750
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,800
you know,
there's an enormous amount of safety but

751
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,400
you also,
and excitement,

752
00:40:54,401 --> 00:40:59,401
but it also an enormous amount of safety
and so you trust the data to combine 

753
00:40:59,401 --> 00:41:00,490
that both and you want to return to 
that.

754
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,230
So you're willing to focus on getting 
done what you need to do your homework,

755
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:06,580
your chores,
your brush,

756
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,640
his teeth or whatever in order to get 
what you want to do,

757
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,410
which is,
you know,

758
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,300
of postpone gratification.
But now let's take the slippery slope 

759
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,360
when this doesn't happen.
So.

760
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,210
Okay,
so let me,

761
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:19,100
let me just add one more thing to that.
Well,

762
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:24,370
the thing that's so cool about that is 
that you've also provided a really 

763
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:24,890
intelligent piece of parenting advice 
for,

764
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,420
for fathers.
It's like,

765
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,000
because you're so,
let's say bf skinner,

766
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:34,001
who was the famous animal behaviorist 
demonstrated quite clearly that you 

767
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:38,351
could train animals with reward more 
effectively than with threat or 

768
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:38,351
punishment.
Now,

769
00:41:38,351 --> 00:41:43,061
threat or punishment is necessary.
Obviously we wouldn't have biological 

770
00:41:43,061 --> 00:41:47,351
systems,
subserving those emotions if they 

771
00:41:47,351 --> 00:41:49,391
weren't necessary,
but but reward is harder to use because 

772
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:53,351
you have to be much more attentive and 
intervene when something good happens 

773
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:56,390
and so you really have to be watching.
But your hypothesis here is look,

774
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:01,810
father's,
spend a bunch of time playing with your 

775
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,961
kids and having as much fun as you can 
with them because I formulating that 

776
00:42:04,961 --> 00:42:05,990
bond.
You can use that as a,

777
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:10,730
as the source of reward that will be 
appreciated by the child with regards to

778
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,790
disciplinary strategies.
So it's,

779
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,250
it's,
it's a,

780
00:42:13,251 --> 00:42:17,060
it's a twofold victory.
One is it's fun and you get to like your

781
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:22,061
kids and have a good time with them,
but the second is you have a very 

782
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,320
positive means of disciplining them in 
the best sense,

783
00:42:24,321 --> 00:42:26,720
encouraging them and disciplining them.
So that's,

784
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,560
that's a really useful thing to know 
product

785
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,640
thickly.
So deepening the trust to the kids like 

786
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,920
that.
Like you're playing and you're right on 

787
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,031
the edge that you were talking about,
but there's dad to make sure that the 

788
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,510
fund doesn't get too hard for you,
for him,

789
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,020
for your sister.
And so on and so that that's all 

790
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,840
happening at the same time.
Now when the right and that's embodied,

791
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:49,270
you can see that two ways,
that's embodied trust.

792
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:51,940
So if you toss a little kid up in the 
air and catch them,

793
00:42:51,941 --> 00:42:56,080
I mean it's very exciting to them both 
being tossed up because of the threat,

794
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:59,830
but then the relief that occurs because 
of the safety that's put in there,

795
00:42:59,831 --> 00:43:02,690
so it's not abstract.
It's really demonstrated.

796
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,170
And then our dad taught you that child 
up and,

797
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,650
and then in fact missing the child,
quote unquote,

798
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:12,130
and the child lands on the bed and 
weren't like,

799
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,770
Oh yeah,
I was missed.

800
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,820
You going to catch me.
But also recognizing as well that shows 

801
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,550
that that shows that things can happen 
that aren't entirely what you predict,

802
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,280
but within the confines of a trusting 
relationship,

803
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,490
that's still okay.
And then you could also imagine if the,

804
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,820
if the dad is wrestling with more than 
one kid at the same time,

805
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,050
then he's also acting as just referee.
Right?

806
00:43:35,051 --> 00:43:40,051
So,
and then the kids learn how to be 

807
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:40,180
judicious in the distribution of 
attention.

808
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:42,070
They learn how to play.
Fair,

809
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,310
they learn how everybody,
how everybody can have a turn and 

810
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:50,101
everybody wins out the same time and so,
and that bonding is what is part of what

811
00:43:51,491 --> 00:43:54,850
creates,
just everything you just said is part of

812
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:57,100
what leads the child to have empathy 
training.

813
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,660
And the empathy training came from.
No,

814
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,130
you were too rough on your sister there.
If you try it again,

815
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,950
you can't be that rough.
Oh,

816
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,720
you still continue to be that rough.
Okay.

817
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:10,230
Let's no more play.
That's right.

818
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,240
Play stops when everyone isn't having 
fun.

819
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:12,600
What?

820
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:19,600
My kids were little,
we had this couch that was a sectional 

821
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,891
in six pieces and so we could put the 
couches facing each other and then we 

822
00:44:22,891 --> 00:44:23,770
put up the,
the uh,

823
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:27,400
the backs all the way around it.
So it was like a little wrestling rate.

824
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:32,830
And so then I would take the kids in 
there and just wrestle them half to 

825
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:32,830
death,
you know.

826
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:36,410
But one of the things I used to do was 
if one of the kids was rough with the 

827
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:41,130
other and made them cry,
then I noticed that the kid who made the

828
00:44:41,131 --> 00:44:44,100
other kid cry wouldn't look at the 
crying kid.

829
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,640
They look away and avoid.
And so I always used to say,

830
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:47,940
no,
no,

831
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:49,620
no,
you look,

832
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,620
you look and you see what happened 
because that,

833
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:57,940
that triggers that embodied empathy.
And then you can easily have a 

834
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:57,940
conversation and say,
look,

835
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,330
you know,
is that how you want the game to go or 

836
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,450
do you want everybody to have fun?
And the thing is,

837
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:08,451
once the kid actually looks,
then they've got it right because they 

838
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:09,750
can't escape from that empathic 
identification.

839
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:10,890
And so

840
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,530
yeah,
when the child doesn't have that said,

841
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,540
we have all this data now these 70 
different areas where children do so 

842
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,460
much worse when they don't have a father
involvement.

843
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,840
So let's look at the next stage of that.
When,

844
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:29,100
when,
when that father does not do this 

845
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,280
roughhousing housing and as just one 
example of many and um,

846
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,860
and does not as not enforcing 
boundaries,

847
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,120
the child then doesn't learn to have 
that postpone gratification.

848
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,980
So we have hard data on this that 
children grow.

849
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:45,100
Children raised predominantly by dads,
are only 15 percent likely to have adhd,

850
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,000
children raised predominantly by moms,
so 30 percent likely to have adhd.

851
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:51,130
So if we looked at what we just talked 
about,

852
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,460
the children that are raised by the dads
are learning that they have to postpone 

853
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:59,170
that gratification you see in order to 
get the reward that they want.

854
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,860
Now you take that capacity to postpone 
gratification to school.

855
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,080
The child without postpone gratification
assigned a homework assignment,

856
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,360
doesn't really feel,
is oftentimes distracted by a text 

857
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:13,750
that's come in,
distracted by,

858
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:18,751
um,
the opportunity to play video games 

859
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:19,840
distracted by wanting to exchange notes 
with other kids is distracted,

860
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:20,260
distracted.

861
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,600
Well,
yeah.

862
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:26,260
If the distraction thing about the disc,
there's no need to explain adhd.

863
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:30,580
What there is a need to do is to explain
why every kid doesn't have it.

864
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,060
And the answer is,
the answer that you just laid out is 

865
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,640
that some kids learn how to control 
their district.

866
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:41,850
Distractability doesn't require an 
explanation because people are 

867
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:42,310
distracted by what's immediately 
rewarding.

868
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,590
And that doesn't require an.
It's like addiction.

869
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,740
Actually,
addiction doesn't require explanation 

870
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,871
either.
What requires explanation is the 

871
00:46:51,871 --> 00:46:54,601
development of the resources that allow 
you to withstand addictive pressures in 

872
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,270
the face of the fact that they're 
always,

873
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,100
they're everywhere and they're powerful.
So it's,

874
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,010
it's,
it's development of control.

875
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:02,170
That's,
that's really the curious issue.

876
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:07,530
And I've never heard this,
I've never heard anyone make this 

877
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,450
connection between the use of play as a 
reward.

878
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:12,460
And that delay of gratification.
Now it's a very,

879
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:14,800
very interesting idea.
That's very interesting.

880
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,000
And then let me take it another step 
further.

881
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,400
So when this delayed gratification is 
happening or does not happen,

882
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,040
and then the boy isn't able to finish 
homework,

883
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:28,800
he started speaking,
beginning to feel ashamed of themselves,

884
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,560
or if he's athletic and his parents 
believe that it's really going to be 

885
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,760
helpful to the child to have beautiful 
dream.

886
00:47:35,761 --> 00:47:40,761
Sweetie,
you want to be an NBA player and you're 

887
00:47:40,761 --> 00:47:40,761
tall and you know,
you continue practicing.

888
00:47:40,761 --> 00:47:42,480
You can be an NBA,
NBA player,

889
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,520
you can have your dreams,
but he doesn't have that postpone 

890
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,791
gratification.
So cannot do the boring repetition that 

891
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:55,021
comes with all success,
including being an Olympic star or an 

892
00:47:55,021 --> 00:47:55,070
NBA player or anything else

893
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,470
playing the piano or learning to read or

894
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,830
great example.
Certainly the violin.

895
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,490
Um,
and so you,

896
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:05,840
so anything that is his dream,
the bigger the dream,

897
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:10,841
the bigger the disappointment and it's 
not just disappointment that he fears 

898
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:11,740
will happen to his parents.
Uh,

899
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:16,280
but also the sense that he says he's 
gonna do one thing in school.

900
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,290
His P,
his teachers,

901
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:21,380
his peers are not respecting him as 
much.

902
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,660
He,
um,

903
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,760
he,
the cheerleaders aren't going first and 

904
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,071
10 and a concussion again to him,
they're doing it to somebody else at 

905
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:30,940
first and do it again.
The um,

906
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,250
and so the,
the boy is beginning to feel shame.

907
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:34,800
Yeah.
Well,

908
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:36,000
you think,
you think shape.

909
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,310
Look here.
Here's the precondition for shame.

910
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:43,790
So let's say that you are attracted by 
goal naturally.

911
00:48:43,861 --> 00:48:46,170
And you know,
maybe that's scaffolded by your parents,

912
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:49,710
maybe it's scaffolded by your peers,
but it's something that you're naturally

913
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:52,440
turning your attention towards.
It grips you in some sense.

914
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,250
Okay?
And and we'll assume that it's a 

915
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,901
difficult goal.
And so then there's an ethic that 

916
00:48:59,901 --> 00:49:02,871
emerges out of that,
which is that if that goal is valuable 

917
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:06,231
and it's difficult,
then there's sacrifices that have to be 

918
00:49:06,231 --> 00:49:09,201
made,
delays of gratification that have to be 

919
00:49:09,201 --> 00:49:10,470
implemented in order for you to be 
worthy to attain that goal.

920
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,690
Okay?
That's all part of the game.

921
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:17,691
If you think about it as a game,
well then then if you observe yourself 

922
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:20,400
unable to play the rules of the game,
play by the rules,

923
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,140
then how can you not have any?

924
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,200
How can you not suffer shame and self 
contempt because you've already adopted 

925
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,120
an ethical framework,
which is this is worth attaining.

926
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:35,450
And if you observe in yourself,
then the inability to attain it because 

927
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:39,171
you're constantly being distracted,
then you're going to have contempt for 

928
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:42,240
yourself.
There's no way out of that.

929
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:47,370
This is something I learned from nature.
Here's the terrible thing about that 

930
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:50,130
because that's a great pathway.
Denial isn't because let's say you pause

931
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:55,131
it for goals in succession that you find
valuable and then you observe yourself 

932
00:49:55,561 --> 00:50:00,561
unable to discipline yourself to attain 
the goals while the most after four 

933
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,910
successive failures,
it's like,

934
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,830
ha,
homer Simpson said to bark,

935
00:50:04,831 --> 00:50:06,360
he said to Bart,
um,

936
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,560
you tried and you failed,
and then you tried and you failed again.

937
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:11,970
What did you learn?
And,

938
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:16,800
and homer says to Bart,
the conclusion is never try.

939
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,910
Right?
And so if you fail a few times,

940
00:50:20,911 --> 00:50:24,060
that's at attaining something of 
importance because you see that you have

941
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:29,061
no discipline,
then the logical response to that is to 

942
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:30,860
cease positing goals.

943
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:32,650
Absolutely.
And that's a,

944
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,550
that's exactly what happens.
And,

945
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:39,551
but we have through technology,
so to have a perfect escape and that 

946
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:44,651
escape is into video games where you can
identify with the hero and you can lose 

947
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:47,390
the game as often as you wish to with 
nobody noticing.

948
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,570
And then as you begin to get better with
certain,

949
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,070
you know,
certain manipulations,

950
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,850
you can play that game with certain 
types of people and increase your,

951
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,220
your skillset at the game,
but you're never able to translate that 

952
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,770
into everyday life,
uh,

953
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,970
where you know,
uh,

954
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,810
and so you start becoming addicted to 
that game,

955
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:09,850
which is,
you know,

956
00:51:09,851 --> 00:51:14,851
which are designed to increase your 
dopamine without having to actually 

957
00:51:14,851 --> 00:51:14,950
achieve anything.

958
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,660
Well,
the thing about the games that's,

959
00:51:16,661 --> 00:51:18,610
that's different,
like the video games,

960
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:21,470
what's different?
So again,

961
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:24,310
for a little kid has to be immediately 
rewarding.

962
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:27,610
That's why rough and tumble play works,
for example,

963
00:51:27,611 --> 00:51:31,630
has to be immediately rewarding.
And then the game shades into real life.

964
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:35,650
But as the game shades into real life,
what happens is the rewards are deferred

965
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:39,760
and you get more and more disciplined at
not being immediately rewarded.

966
00:51:39,761 --> 00:51:43,150
Like when you're learning to read or 
play the piano for the longterm goal.

967
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,420
The thing about video games is that they
do require the development of skill but 

968
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:53,930
be there,
but the immediate reward is built in 

969
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,731
along with the delayed reward because 
otherwise the game wouldn't be fun for 

970
00:51:56,731 --> 00:52:00,811
someone who's learning.
And so the problem is is that a lot of 

971
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:04,021
real life games aren't necessarily fun 
while you're learning them because you 

972
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:06,460
have to attain a certain level of 
mastery and that requires discipline.

973
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:11,640
That's also what's wrong with the idea 
that children can just learn in keeping 

974
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,390
with what they're spontaneously 
interested in.

975
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,780
It's like there's some truth in that 
because why not file follow a child's 

976
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:18,880
interests,
but the problem is,

977
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:23,881
is that many highly skilled endeavors,
virtually any endeavor that it's going 

978
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:29,311
to be of economic or productive utility 
requires a apprenticeship where there's 

979
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:35,340
a lot of grinding.
There's a lot of just disciplinary 

980
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,370
disciplined repetition.
And so,

981
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,480
okay,
well alright,

982
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,740
so,

983
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,570
and then one more dimension of that is 
that as the boy gets to boy,

984
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:44,560
girl age,
if he's,

985
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,990
if he begins to sense that he's 
heterosexual,

986
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:52,580
he noticed is that the girls are far 
more interested in going out with the 

987
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,621
quarterbacks.
So the student body presidents or the 

988
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:57,850
performer type boys that are sort of 
honored in the school system and in life

989
00:52:57,851 --> 00:53:02,851
in general,
and so he begins to start withdrawing 

990
00:53:02,851 --> 00:53:03,040
and fearing that he can attract those 
girls,

991
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:06,130
especially the ones he's most 
biologically addicted to.

992
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:11,190
Beautiful ones that cheerleaders,
he starts withdrawing into porn and porn

993
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,660
is not a huge issue,
but the porn basically,

994
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:20,820
his stimulus is based on,
uh,

995
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,340
the dopamine increasing with each new 
stimulus.

996
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,780
And so as,
as it gets addicted to that dopamine,

997
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,960
he begins to get addicted to only being 
able to be stimulated when the risk 

998
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,330
taking is higher and higher.

999
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,870
So finally,
he succeeds in one girl,

1000
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:40,740
woman being able to come over to his 
house and be sexual with her,

1001
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,070
but he's so unable to be turned on just 
by the mere maybe light touch of a hand,

1002
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,590
um,
or turned on by just being fascinated by

1003
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:54,591
what she's saying.
And the interaction or some combination 

1004
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:57,000
of the drama of being with her combined 
with a little bit of touch is so used to

1005
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:01,950
a huge amount of stimulus that occurs.
And when he gets to be trusting of her a

1006
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:03,000
little bit,
she said,

1007
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,590
he says,
can you be this way?

1008
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,180
Can you do this?
Can you act this way?

1009
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:11,420
And she feels like just some piece of 
object that is being traded in for the 

1010
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:11,970
poor and eventually gets disgusted with 
him,

1011
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:14,720
withdraws and he begins to say,
you know,

1012
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,740
all right,
this convinces me I him as worthless as 

1013
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,611
I thought I was,
and the only thing that will give me 

1014
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:22,611
satisfaction is back to the porn.

1015
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:26,990
And what became a little bit of an 
addiction becomes more of an addiction 

1016
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,470
even as he's also becoming 
simultaneously frequently addicted to 

1017
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:34,320
video games at the same time.
And so all of this is that slippery 

1018
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,881
slope from the the rough housing that 
the father is not able to articulate to 

1019
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:43,671
the mother about the value of that 
combined with the trust that you were 

1020
00:54:43,671 --> 00:54:46,310
integrating with.
That combined with the lack of post,

1021
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:51,380
the bond,
a combined with the postpone 

1022
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,531
gratification being taught.
And then when the Postgrad postpone 

1023
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:57,830
gratification is not taught the slippery
slope down the hill to shame,

1024
00:54:57,831 --> 00:55:02,270
self disgust and fear that if that.
If he tries anything,

1025
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:07,450
he's just going to prove to himself and 
to everybody around him that he's one 

1026
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:10,310
more failure and the degree to which he 
articulates that desire to try something

1027
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:15,290
is the announcement publicly to a group 
of people that he's pretty much going to

1028
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:20,890
say today,
I'm going to try this and tomorrow it's 

1029
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,610
gonna be a failure until he,
until he becomes enormously shamed.

1030
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:26,930
In worst case scenarios,
this can lead to such depression that it

1031
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:31,931
creates a,
a desire to commit suicide and in the 

1032
00:55:31,931 --> 00:55:32,720
very worst case scenarios.
It's a belief.

1033
00:55:32,721 --> 00:55:35,420
I believe we've seen the school shooter.
Yeah.

1034
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,060
Yeah.
Well that bruise resentment.

1035
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:42,090
Absolutely man.
That bruise resentment and anger like 

1036
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,090
nothing else

1037
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:46,000
and and who they have resentment and 
anger about who were the people that 

1038
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,760
have rejected him,
who were the classmates?

1039
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:52,900
It's the teachers.
Nobody appreciates that sweet 

1040
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,750
sensitivity inside of him and sees him 
well,

1041
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,770
I am so angry at that and one day I just
want a.

1042
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,430
I have a desperate need to get their 
attention and say I count.

1043
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:04,290
I matter.
Pay attention to me.

1044
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,320
And you know,
at the worst case scenarios,

1045
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,290
only a very small percentage,
but in worst case scenarios,

1046
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,420
you can understand the school shooting,
shooting,

1047
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:13,290
emerging from that.

1048
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,360
Yeah.
Well for every,

1049
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,520
for every kid who goes and shoots up a 
school,

1050
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:20,540
there's a thousand who were fantasizing 
in a direction that's headed that way,

1051
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:21,820
you know,
and not.

1052
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,400
And some of that's at the beginning of 
that,

1053
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:29,401
it's something like,
while I'm very angry at people because 

1054
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:32,071
they don't see the value in me,
but if they get to the point where 

1055
00:56:32,071 --> 00:56:34,921
they're doing something like fantasy,
extreme violence there are so far past 

1056
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:36,880
that even they think they've developed a
real hatred for everything.

1057
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:37,640
And,
and,

1058
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,370
uh,
wish to see it obliterated.

1059
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,690
And,
and that's,

1060
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,410
you know,
that's.

1061
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,520
Well obviously that's the most terrible,
terrible outcomes that might be 

1062
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:46,520
generated.
Okay.

1063
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,391
So you talked about,
you talked about rough and tumble play 

1064
00:56:51,391 --> 00:56:53,350
and delay of gratification.
You tied empathy into that.

1065
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:58,390
What are their other cardinal things 
that you're seeing fathers do?

1066
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,520
Because that's pretty early on in life,
right?

1067
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:05,521
So you're looking at the interaction 
with kids there between say a year old 

1068
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:06,460
and five,
six years old,

1069
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:08,020
seven years old,
something like that.

1070
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,060
Um,
what do you,

1071
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:15,090
what else do you see happening with 
fathers both out the early stages and 

1072
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:15,090
then also later on?

1073
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,070
Yes.
Another important thing is,

1074
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:22,130
is the concept of hangout time now for,
for a mom listening to this who has a 

1075
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:22,670
daughter,
uh,

1076
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:27,770
we now know that children who have 
daughters who have a significant amount 

1077
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:28,760
of hangout time with,
with,

1078
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,920
with your dad's,
that creates more psychological 

1079
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,870
centerdness than any other single 
phenomenon with,

1080
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:36,710
uh,
with boys.

1081
00:57:36,711 --> 00:57:38,750
It's also very important.
So for example,

1082
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:44,190
um,
let's say you're in a divorce situation 

1083
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:45,950
and a father has the child for a short 
period of time,

1084
00:57:45,951 --> 00:57:50,951
let's say on a Saturday.
And he picks his child up from a soccer 

1085
00:57:50,951 --> 00:57:54,410
game and says to,
let's say Josh,

1086
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,120
Josh,
how did the game go?

1087
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:59,150
The and the kid is more,
especially if more likely to say,

1088
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,580
okay,
it was okay,

1089
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,480
well tell me more josh.
It was just okay dad.

1090
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,780
And so,
but if he can.

1091
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:12,810
So if at that time the dad has to drop 
the boys off to the moms because it's 

1092
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:17,870
the end of visitation time,
there's nothing that happens beyond that

1093
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,210
is going to be,
you know,

1094
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,960
people,
kids in particular,

1095
00:58:21,961 --> 00:58:24,660
I think although it also happens with 
couples is that,

1096
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,550
you know,
one of the things that you do to the 

1097
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:31,920
person that you're with to task if they 
care,

1098
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,520
is to be somewhat withholding of 
information that might be relevant to 

1099
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,230
see to what degree you will be pursued.
Because,

1100
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:45,470
you know,
if you asked me whether I've done 

1101
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:45,470
something,
how it went,

1102
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:47,850
one of the things I'm going to want to 
know is do you really care?

1103
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,970
And if you're my father,
I'm really gonna want to know that?

1104
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,200
And so one of the ways I can I can gauge
that is by asking you,

1105
00:58:55,201 --> 00:59:00,201
but that that's,
that assumes that your answer is going 

1106
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:04,341
to be reflective of your actual being.
And there's no reason to assume that a 

1107
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:09,141
better way of doing it is for me to be a
little bit withholding and a little bit 

1108
00:59:09,141 --> 00:59:10,830
resistant because then I can see,
you know,

1109
00:59:10,831 --> 00:59:13,290
are you going to poke me a bit?
Because that's a fun thing to do.

1110
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,630
If you're Kinda Tz you can say,
look kid,

1111
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:18,090
you know,
poke him in the chest a few times.

1112
00:59:18,091 --> 00:59:20,760
It's like loosen up and talk to me,
you know?

1113
00:59:20,761 --> 00:59:23,570
And usually if you do that with a kid or
even an adolescent,

1114
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:26,960
they'll laugh and kind of push your hand
away and go dad.

1115
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,910
But they're happy to have that 
additional product,

1116
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,800
right?
To bring them out of their shell.

1117
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:37,130
And it's a demonstration that the kid 
actually cares.

1118
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,690
And you do need time for that.

1119
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,600
So.
So you see the kid,

1120
00:59:42,601 --> 00:59:46,890
if he's done well or she's doing well,
I'm very happy to say,

1121
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:48,990
Oh,
I scored three goals today.

1122
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:51,450
That's more than it's ever been scored 
in the history of our school.

1123
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:53,310
Is that incredible?
No problem.

1124
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,520
They'll share that right away.
But the reason for the hesitation on 

1125
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,130
saying something that they're ashamed 
of,

1126
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,400
like I remember one father was saying 
that the boy came home and he had been 

1127
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,130
the goalie the week before,
but the following week he was not chosen

1128
01:00:11,131 --> 01:00:12,960
to be goalie and he couldn't understand 
why.

1129
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:18,260
And so he hesitates to say something for
his dad because he doesn't want the data

1130
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,500
to sort of either lecturing him or 
disapprove of him or be disappointed in 

1131
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:23,920
him and,
or be,

1132
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:24,470
um,
you know,

1133
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,430
sort of like feel like that's not my 
son,

1134
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,680
you know,
I want my son to have scored the goals.

1135
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,230
Um,
so with all those fears,

1136
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,440
the child,
especially the boy when it comes to 

1137
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,021
performance,
will keep any failure to perform 

1138
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:39,021
effectively to himself.
But now if,

1139
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:43,440
if the dad drops the child off at mom's,
that never gets sorted through.

1140
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,320
If the dad has hanging out time with the
children,

1141
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,560
let's say they're doing homework 
together and dad maybe is watching the 

1142
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,771
TV and the kid is doing homework and 
then they appear about the same time 

1143
01:00:54,771 --> 01:00:58,851
getting something from the refrigerator 
and they have a little discussion about 

1144
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:02,121
what he wants for dinner and they and 
the data asks him to help make dinner 

1145
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,840
with them rather than just sit and do 
take no responsibility,

1146
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:08,841
which does tend to do so.
They asked the children to be helpful 

1147
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:12,111
with the dinner making and preparing,
not just serve them and so in that 

1148
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:15,660
process of the child chopping up stuff 
and doing that type of boring the thing,

1149
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:17,490
the child will tend to say,
you know,

1150
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:18,540
dad,
you know,

1151
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,180
I was goalie last week but I wasn't 
going this week.

1152
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:26,181
What's that about?
And the data will and what the FA and 

1153
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,960
the child might say that to the mom even
more quickly,

1154
01:01:27,961 --> 01:01:32,961
but the child's expectations with the 
mom is the mom will give the child 

1155
01:01:32,961 --> 01:01:34,540
assurance the end and say,
sweetie,

1156
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,720
it's no problem.
You're fine.

1157
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:38,570
You're wonderful.
You're a very good goal.

1158
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,800
Maybe the coach wanted to give the 
other,

1159
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,110
the other kids a chance because you're 
so good,

1160
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:43,860
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1161
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,040
Whereas expect from data bit more 
confrontational questioning.

1162
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,140
Okay.

1163
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:53,270
Well,
one of the things I've noticed in 

1164
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,801
talking to my clinical clients about 
their intimate relationships is I've 

1165
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:58,380
been trying to gauge rules of thumb for 
minimal necessary interaction,

1166
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:02,370
time to maintain a relationship.
And with couples I've observed that they

1167
01:02:02,371 --> 01:02:07,371
need like one or two sessions of 
intimate time together a week at 

1168
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:12,471
minimum,
something like that or things start to 

1169
01:02:12,471 --> 01:02:12,510
go south,
but they also need,

1170
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:17,570
as far as I've been able to tell about 
90 minutes of communication time across 

1171
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:22,731
a single week.
Just keep each other updated in 

1172
01:02:22,731 --> 01:02:23,730
relationship to their stories.
And so,

1173
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:25,830
two questions.
One is,

1174
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:30,831
do you have some sense of how you would 
characterize hangout time and how much 

1175
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:36,531
of it there is,
how much of it there needs to be in 

1176
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:36,531
order to not go below,
you know,

1177
01:02:36,531 --> 01:02:41,481
a dangerous minimum.
And then the other thing I'd like to 

1178
01:02:41,481 --> 01:02:42,510
pick up on is you had talked a little 
bit about,

1179
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,850
um,
the more confrontational approach that a

1180
01:02:46,851 --> 01:02:51,851
father might take when discussing a 
failure or an inadequacy or something 

1181
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:54,330
like that on the part of the child.

1182
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:59,540
And so I wanted to relate something that
I've learned about talking to majority 

1183
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:02,280
male audiences in the last year and a 
half,

1184
01:03:02,310 --> 01:03:05,130
two years about responsibility and 
discipline and all of that.

1185
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:10,790
See,
you might think that calling someone on 

1186
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,120
their failure is harsh and judgmental,
but,

1187
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:17,330
and it is in a sense,
but it's not harsh and judgmental about 

1188
01:03:17,330 --> 01:03:18,770
their potential,
you know.

1189
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,640
So if your kid comes to you and says,
you know,

1190
01:03:20,641 --> 01:03:23,100
I screwed up and here's what I did,
and it did go so well,

1191
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:24,540
and you say,
that's okay,

1192
01:03:24,541 --> 01:03:29,541
you're a wonderful kid.
Then the kid stuck in a bind because 

1193
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:31,470
they're not feeling so wonderful and 
they failed.

1194
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,820
But if you say,
well look,

1195
01:03:32,821 --> 01:03:33,470
you know,
you're,

1196
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,890
that was stupid.
Like,

1197
01:03:34,891 --> 01:03:37,350
what the Hell's wrong with you?
Here's what you could do.

1198
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,080
Like,
you're better than that man.

1199
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:44,120
Get it together a little bit.
Let's come up with some strategies so 

1200
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,120
that you can figure out how that's never
going to happen to you again,

1201
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:49,800
and so instead of putting your faith in 
who the child is right now,

1202
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:55,010
which I would say in some senses,
the heart is the hallmark of impulsive 

1203
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:59,211
empathy.
You put your faith in who the child 

1204
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:00,220
could be and that's encouragement and I 
would say in,

1205
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:05,250
in circumstances of failure,
especially where the child is motivated 

1206
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:05,820
to try again,
encouragement,

1207
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:09,930
beats,
it beats impulsive,

1208
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:14,931
empathy,
hands down as a mark of faith and who 

1209
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:14,931
the child might be.

1210
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:19,990
Yes.
And it takes a while for the child to 

1211
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:23,440
both reveal its vulnerability and also 
to have a faith that the,

1212
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,110
that the parent,
um,

1213
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:30,220
that,
that the child tends to open up like a 

1214
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,691
flower to the,
to the degrader she went when she or he 

1215
01:04:33,971 --> 01:04:38,971
realizes that the security that the 
father is creating by being with them 

1216
01:04:38,971 --> 01:04:41,800
and talking the problem through,
is there now an ideal setting,

1217
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:44,770
a father who's wise or a mother who's 
wise,

1218
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,820
I will not give a solution right away,
what we'll ask the kid.

1219
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:49,780
Something like,
um,

1220
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:55,050
so what did you observe?
What's your best guess as to what 

1221
01:04:55,050 --> 01:04:57,130
happened last week versus this week?
What do you think was the judges?

1222
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,150
It was the coaches best intent,
um,

1223
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:05,430
and let the.
And oftentimes inside of the child is a 

1224
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,440
willingness or is a sense of probably 
what really did happen.

1225
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:13,830
But a fear of acknowledging it to 
himself or herself and especially 

1226
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:16,600
acknowledging it to anyone else because 
the person who they might acknowledge it

1227
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,520
to will not have respect for them.

1228
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,880
And so being able to sort of have the 
hangout time facilitates enough time to 

1229
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:29,791
feel both that large basket of those 
large arms of security and nurturing 

1230
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,610
surrounding him or her,
uh,

1231
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:35,440
the,
the fact that the father is not going to

1232
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:36,990
give up on time,
uh,

1233
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:38,060
with me,
uh,

1234
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:43,090
we'll be here for me and I can.
And then when the father or the mother 

1235
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:47,791
facilitates the exploration inside of 
himself about what the problem might be.

1236
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:51,010
Let's say the help in,
in a Carl Rogers,

1237
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,900
yeah,
Rogerian type of sense,

1238
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:53,760
um,
uh,

1239
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:54,390
to,
to,

1240
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,100
to find out the part of him that already
knows the answer.

1241
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:02,370
Then the child is experiencing both 
respect and a willingness to be 

1242
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:05,770
confronted by a.
If I don't have the answer inside of me,

1243
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:10,270
my father will tell me the truth about 
what I might be a need to do next.

1244
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:15,510
And he'll have an that telling me the 
truth about what he needs to do next is 

1245
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:17,830
his way of respecting me without even 
paying.

1246
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:22,831
He's respecting may because he wouldn't 
be confronting me with the truth if he 

1247
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:22,831
didn't respect me.

1248
01:06:22,831 --> 01:06:24,040
Yeah.
And more specifically,

1249
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:29,820
not even more specifically than me,
if he didn't respect my intrinsic 

1250
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:32,020
ability to overcome obstacles and to 
grow,

1251
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:33,700
right,
which is the best,

1252
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,460
the best answer to someone who says I 
have a problem,

1253
01:06:36,461 --> 01:06:37,240
is,
well,

1254
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:40,350
I have faith that you can overcome that,
right?

1255
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:43,270
Not that you don't have a problem or 
that you're okay the way you are.

1256
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:43,810
It's like,
yeah,

1257
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:45,010
yeah,
that's the problem man.

1258
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:46,750
But you know,
and then you know,

1259
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:51,751
there's another thing that you're 
talking about that's very much in 

1260
01:06:51,751 --> 01:06:52,480
keeping with,
I would say standard,

1261
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:55,390
but relatively deep clinical wisdom,
which is that,

1262
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,900
um,
people are much more likely to follow a 

1263
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,470
set of injunctions if they generate them
themselves.

1264
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:08,330
And so we've had some really interesting
experiences with the program we 

1265
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:08,330
designed,
designed,

1266
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:12,841
called the future authoring program.
And it helps people come up with a life 

1267
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:12,841
plan.

1268
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:17,440
So they have to craft a vision for their
operations across the six or seven basic

1269
01:07:17,441 --> 01:07:22,441
dimensions of life,
like intimate relationships and family 

1270
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:24,520
and career ambitions and education and 
resistance to temptation,

1271
01:07:24,521 --> 01:07:26,980
drugs and alcohol care of mental and 
physical health.

1272
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:29,200
And so on.
Those fundamental dimensions,

1273
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:34,260
use of productive use of time outside of
work to ask themselves what they would 

1274
01:07:35,561 --> 01:07:38,950
want if they could have what they wanted
to need along those domains,

1275
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:42,640
three to five years down the road to 
craft a vision based on that,

1276
01:07:43,090 --> 01:07:46,270
um,
on that array of wants and desires,

1277
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,580
and also to write a counter vision which
is,

1278
01:07:48,581 --> 01:07:51,070
where could you be if you allowed 
yourself to fail,

1279
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:52,450
catastrophic,
where,

1280
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,380
what might that look like in three to 
five years and then to produce a plan.

1281
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:01,180
And it's had remarkable effects.
Particular now young men are doing worse

1282
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:03,550
than young women in academic 
environments.

1283
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:07,330
So the program doesn't seem to have as 
much effect for young women,

1284
01:08:07,331 --> 01:08:09,400
but that might be because they're 
already doing better,

1285
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:12,220
but it has a walloping effect on young 
men.

1286
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:17,490
In fact,
for Vo in vocational junior college 

1287
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:20,591
settings,
our latest piece of data which was 

1288
01:08:20,591 --> 01:08:22,901
generated was published last year,
showed that we could reduce dropout 

1289
01:08:22,901 --> 01:08:27,101
among young men,
especially aimless ones who hadn't done 

1290
01:08:27,101 --> 01:08:29,591
very well in high school.
We could drop their dropout rate 50 

1291
01:08:29,591 --> 01:08:32,591
percent and so and,
and one of the things I've observed 

1292
01:08:32,591 --> 01:08:36,701
about young men,
and this might be because they're more 

1293
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:36,701
disagreeable and confrontational than 
young women,

1294
01:08:37,010 --> 01:08:40,790
is that unless they have formulated 
their own plan,

1295
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,390
they're unlikely to do something.
So when you're talking,

1296
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,890
I think this is true with,
with,

1297
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,230
with young women as well,
you want to talk to them and say,

1298
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:48,800
well,
look what,

1299
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:52,100
what do you think about what happened 
and how you're going to get out of it?

1300
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,220
Which is an excellent question because 
it says to the child,

1301
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:00,400
you can think about what happened and be
accurate and you can think of a way out 

1302
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,370
of it.
And that's the encouragement,

1303
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,590
right?
And that's what you want is to,

1304
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,690
you don't want to protect your shelter,
your child.

1305
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,020
You want to encourage them.
And so that collaborative problem 

1306
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:11,060
solving is a great way to do that.

1307
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:12,890
Absolutely.
Right.

1308
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:18,280
And I've seen this over and over again 
and certainly the data that I gathered 

1309
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,320
for the boy crisis very much,
um,

1310
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,690
uh,
shows that as well.

1311
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:23,300
And you said the hangout time is part of
what helps to do that,

1312
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:24,870
but also the,
the,

1313
01:09:25,330 --> 01:09:30,330
the checks and balances of parenting is 
so pivotal for mothers and fathers to 

1314
01:09:31,391 --> 01:09:33,620
understand.
And right along the lines of what you're

1315
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,020
talking about is,
is um,

1316
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,850
so mother and father,
let's say,

1317
01:09:38,150 --> 01:09:42,050
have the child come home from school and
say m and S.

1318
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,600
and the child says,
you know,

1319
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,920
Mrs Meyers,
she hates me.

1320
01:09:45,921 --> 01:09:46,880
She hates me.
I,

1321
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,430
I can't,
I can't be okay in school.

1322
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,640
And maybe the child's in second or third
grade and a mother is sort of reaction 

1323
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,210
will tend to be more likely to be 
something like,

1324
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,980
oh sweetie,
let me hear more.

1325
01:09:57,981 --> 01:10:02,420
And then when child complains more about
how much Mrs Meyers hates the child,

1326
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:05,660
the mom will tend to come up with a 
solution like,

1327
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:10,990
let me talk,
wait till next week on Monday I'll talk 

1328
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:14,171
to,
I'll make an appointment with the 

1329
01:10:14,171 --> 01:10:15,581
principal and we'll talk about seeing 
whether you can get into a different 

1330
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:16,610
class than Mrs Meyers a dad will.

1331
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:19,310
Dad's will tend to say to a greater 
degree,

1332
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,360
um,
sweetie,

1333
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:25,361
in life,
you have to learn to get along with 

1334
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:25,361
people who can't get along with you.
Um,

1335
01:10:25,361 --> 01:10:29,480
what do you think is making Mrs Meyers 
upset about you and the child may or may

1336
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:32,150
not be revealing.
And so the child will say,

1337
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:32,780
well,
you know,

1338
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:37,781
um,
do you want me to talk to Mrs Meyers 

1339
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:37,781
about it?
No,

1340
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:37,781
no,
no,

1341
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:37,781
no,
no.

1342
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:37,781
Uh,
so,

1343
01:10:37,781 --> 01:10:39,170
well if I talked with Mrs Meyers about 
it,

1344
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:41,390
you know,
what do you think Mrs Meyers would say,

1345
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:46,720
and then the child under the threat of 
possibly the dad talking or the mom 

1346
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,130
talking with Mrs Meyers will begin to 
say what a little bit of what Mrs Meyers

1347
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:50,970
fields and then,
um,

1348
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,590
and then negotiate a,
a,

1349
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:58,660
an opportunity to talk to Mrs Meyers and
then bring this as Myers and the child 

1350
01:10:58,660 --> 01:10:59,510
together have a discussion together.

1351
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:04,750
And so to see whether the child did Mrs 
Meyers can work out and understanding 

1352
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:05,960
where the child begins to understand.
No,

1353
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,180
it is not the Mrs Meyers inherently and 
hates,

1354
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:13,870
hates Jimmy.
It is that there's something else going 

1355
01:11:13,870 --> 01:11:16,991
on here.
And so the result of working all that 

1356
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:16,991
through,
um,

1357
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:21,060
is a way of facilitating the child to 
discover,

1358
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:26,360
um,
it's almost solutions to a problem 

1359
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,731
talking rather than getting a solution 
rather than being enabled by the,

1360
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:34,040
by the system to,
and by the parent who will eventually 

1361
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,491
disappear from the child's life or worse
yet not disappeared from the child's 

1362
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:38,020
life.
And uh,

1363
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,740
and so,
and so these,

1364
01:11:41,741 --> 01:11:42,820
um,
these are,

1365
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:46,310
but oftentimes the mom says,
you know,

1366
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:48,830
the child is having a problem here.
Uh,

1367
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,970
why are you being so insensitive?
What are you blaming,

1368
01:11:52,540 --> 01:11:53,630
you know,
Jimmy,

1369
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,660
for,
for creating this problem.

1370
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:56,570
Um,
he's,

1371
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,950
he's telling you that not only does this
is Myers hate him,

1372
01:11:59,951 --> 01:12:04,951
but he also,
she had other kids hate Mrs Meyers as 

1373
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:07,831
well,
and so it's not Jimmy's fault that I 

1374
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:10,240
use.
And so the mom will feel dad as being 

1375
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,781
insensitive.
What in fact dad is being differently 

1376
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:12,781
sensitive.
Um,

1377
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:13,200
and,
and,

1378
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:16,770
and sort of longterm postpone 
gratification sensitive.

1379
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:17,550
Yeah.
Well that's,

1380
01:12:17,551 --> 01:12:19,800
that's the thing.
And not that's a lot colder,

1381
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:21,270
a virtue,
you know,

1382
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:26,271
because it also sounds very much like 
it's grounded in these psychobiological,

1383
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:30,390
at least partially cycle biological 
differences between men and women.

1384
01:12:30,391 --> 01:12:35,391
So women are higher in negative emotion 
and the more empathic and that's that 

1385
01:12:35,391 --> 01:12:39,531
short term empathy.
And so that's perfectly in keeping with 

1386
01:12:39,531 --> 01:12:40,350
the approach that you just described and
the advantage.

1387
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:45,410
See,
that's a particularly advantageous 

1388
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:45,410
approach to very,
very young children,

1389
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:48,810
especially infants,
because to be wired properly,

1390
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,050
to take care of infants,
the infant is always right.

1391
01:12:52,230 --> 01:12:57,230
Hey,
up until about nine months of age or 

1392
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:57,230
maybe a year of age,
the right response to your infant,

1393
01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:01,440
if that person is crying,
is there's something you should do about

1394
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:06,441
it as fast as possible.
We've talked a fair bit about what 

1395
01:13:06,441 --> 01:13:10,311
fathers can do to,
to help their children learn to delay 

1396
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:15,291
gratification and so on.
We've talked a little bit about what 

1397
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:15,330
might,
what mothers can understand about how to

1398
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:18,120
facilitate that and how to trust it.
Um,

1399
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:23,450
maybe we could talk a little bit about 
what families might do in order to 

1400
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:26,520
improve the,
improve the performance of their boys.

1401
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:31,521
And their girls,
you talked a little bit in your book 

1402
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:31,521
about a family dinner nights and their 
importance.

1403
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,150
Yes,
the most important.

1404
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:40,590
We,
we already know that family dinner 

1405
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:41,690
nights are important,
but what makes family dinner nights even

1406
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,560
more valuable is when they don't become 
family dinner,

1407
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:49,160
nightmares and knowing how to structure 
them so that they don't become family.

1408
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:50,520
Dinner Nightmares.
Uh,

1409
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:53,330
when somebody comes up to me after a 
presentation and says,

1410
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:57,830
know I can't get my children to give up 
electronics at dinner.

1411
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,100
I already know the beginning of the 
problem.

1412
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,420
That is that the children are in charge 
of the parents.

1413
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,250
Um,
and well,

1414
01:14:04,300 --> 01:14:07,490
what can I do to encourage my children 
to get involved with,

1415
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:08,310
you know,
to,

1416
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,520
to leave the,
the,

1417
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,980
um,
the behind.

1418
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,090
And,
you know,

1419
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:17,290
number one answer is to require them to 
get what is not an option to sit down at

1420
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:22,291
dinner.
But maybe some nights you'll want it to 

1421
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:22,291
be,
some nights not.

1422
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:22,450
But if you're having a family dinner 
night,

1423
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,760
especially structured family dinner 
night,

1424
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,700
the number one rule is no electronics at
dinner.

1425
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:33,620
If that rule is violated,
then the electronics are taken away for 

1426
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:37,081
a reasonable period of time and to take 
it away right away for a reasonable 

1427
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:37,960
period of time.
Once the rule is understood,

1428
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:43,510
right,
and you could imagine that instigating 

1429
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,510
wars in various households.

1430
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,510
Yes,
exactly.

1431
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,330
And so,
um,

1432
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:49,340
and then you begin to structure that 
family dinner nights so that everyone 

1433
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:54,191
has an opportunity to talk and everyone 
has at the beginning I'm a structured 

1434
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,940
amount of time that they can check in,
just say how their week went or how that

1435
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:03,941
week was going since the last time.
So everyone knows that it's not 40 

1436
01:15:03,941 --> 01:15:06,140
minutes for so and so.
And one minute for me,

1437
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,910
the interest in family dinner night be 
zero for the one that's one minute.

1438
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:16,770
Well,
that's an extension of the idea of a 

1439
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:16,770
fair game too.
And a refereed fair game.

1440
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:20,370
Everyone has that.
As a family,

1441
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:24,360
our job is to make sure everyone's needs
are being handled,

1442
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:25,950
thought of,
and cared about,

1443
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:30,540
which is the way empathy is created.
Empathy is not created by a parent who's

1444
01:15:30,570 --> 01:15:33,370
always empathetic with files,
needs or desires.

1445
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,250
When a parent is always empathetic with 
each child's needs and desires,

1446
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,580
the child becomes narcissistic,
not apathetic,

1447
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,140
and that's one of the things that we 
have made a mistake with.

1448
01:15:42,570 --> 01:15:45,210
You could say that three or four times 
in a row I think,

1449
01:15:45,211 --> 01:15:48,600
and that would be really good,
right?

1450
01:15:48,601 --> 01:15:52,230
Because that's so crucially important 
because you know if,

1451
01:15:52,470 --> 01:15:57,470
if what you're learning is to put other 
people's feelings at the same level of 

1452
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:02,301
importance as your own,
then obviously that's associated very 

1453
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:06,261
tightly with delay of gratification with
learning how to listen with turn taking 

1454
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:09,420
with fair play with a,
with a refereed interaction,

1455
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:11,750
all of that and so,
so the other.

1456
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,550
The other thing that happens too and you
see this with couples,

1457
01:16:14,551 --> 01:16:19,551
is that if they have that time together,
something analogous to family dinner 

1458
01:16:19,551 --> 01:16:20,820
night.
Although I think the family dinner ideas

1459
01:16:20,821 --> 01:16:25,821
are really good.
One for reasons I'll mention here in a 

1460
01:16:25,821 --> 01:16:27,651
moment is that what you're doing.
Imagine your family has a story and the 

1461
01:16:28,261 --> 01:16:33,261
story is where we came from,
where we are and where we're going 

1462
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:36,321
together as a unit and then so and then 
each of the individuals within that 

1463
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:40,620
story has a story and then what you're 
doing in those family dinners.

1464
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,800
That interaction time is you're taking 
the individual threads of the individual

1465
01:16:45,801 --> 01:16:50,801
story threads and you're weaving them 
together to make the collective story 

1466
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:55,070
and that keeps everyone up to date and 
on the same page and and able to unable 

1467
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:59,150
to empathize and also a deep manner.
Because if I don't know where you are,

1468
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,160
what you're up to,
I can't figure out what you're thinking 

1469
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,621
or feeling.
And so I have to know what story you're 

1470
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:07,500
acting out right now and so to you.
And in order for you to know that.

1471
01:17:07,501 --> 01:17:12,501
For me to know it.
You have to be able to tell your story 

1472
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:12,501
and I have to be able to ask you 
questions about it.

1473
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:17,390
And then I think the other thing that's 
really important about the shared meal 

1474
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:17,390
is that,
you know,

1475
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:21,460
human beings are really weird creatures 
because we seriously share food and 

1476
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,190
we're social eaters.

1477
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,020
People don't eat well if they eat on 
their own.

1478
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:28,460
And so it's deeply rooted into us that 
idea of sharing food.

1479
01:17:28,461 --> 01:17:33,461
And so part of the extended process of 
socialization is to get everybody to sit

1480
01:17:33,801 --> 01:17:38,801
down around food,
to be polite and thankful for the fact 

1481
01:17:38,801 --> 01:17:39,500
of the food,
to enjoy that,

1482
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:44,650
but then also too,
to be able to give and take well that's 

1483
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:44,650
being shared.
And that's,

1484
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:49,420
I would say if the most fundamental 
element of socialization is something 

1485
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,840
like the embodiment of rough and tumble 
play,

1486
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:56,200
the next layer on top of that would be 
the ability to sit down and share food 

1487
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,400
and have a civilized and have civilized 
discourse.

1488
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:03,750
So literally,
and that civilized discourse really 

1489
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:04,450
needs to have the respect for story is 
so,

1490
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:07,730
so pivotal.
So I teach,

1491
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,490
as you probably know,
a couple of communication courses around

1492
01:18:10,491 --> 01:18:14,960
the country and one of the,
one of the dimensions of the single most

1493
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:15,840
important,
um,

1494
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:21,430
thing that kills marriages are almost 
all relationships are biologically 

1495
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:25,870
oriented,
inability to handle personal criticism 

1496
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:25,940
without becoming defensive.
Uh,

1497
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:30,941
so my first job is to teach couples how 
to get around that biological propensity

1498
01:18:31,341 --> 01:18:33,170
to become defensive when they hear 
criticism,

1499
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:37,220
one of the many steps in that process,
which is much too long to go into now,

1500
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:41,960
but to give them a picture of,
of a picture of a person,

1501
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,690
happens to be Mario Cuomo,
the former governor of New York.

1502
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:47,600
That was the,
that was done by four artists,

1503
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:51,250
have a picture that was taken at the 
exact same time,

1504
01:18:51,251 --> 01:18:52,210
same place,
et cetera.

1505
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:57,570
And there are four different types of 
artists that paint a picture of him like

1506
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:00,700
Andy Warhol and Modigliani and so on.

1507
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:03,990
And so the end work with every couple 
of.

1508
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,580
To understand that when you hear your 
partner's story,

1509
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:12,030
you will owe,
even though you're all looking at the 

1510
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,041
same thing,
there will be a different picture that 

1511
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:16,591
is being.
That is being created by each person at 

1512
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:19,471
the table.
And so the job of couples is to 

1513
01:19:19,471 --> 01:19:22,560
understand how much of a sacrifice each 
person would make so that the other 

1514
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,241
person would live and yet how we're 
often not able to handle personal 

1515
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:30,751
criticism and to sort of reorient 
ourselves before we handle personal 

1516
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:33,520
criticism,
to move ourselves into a place of really

1517
01:19:33,521 --> 01:19:36,650
being fascinated by our partner story,
but at a fail,

1518
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,120
but at a family dinner table,
um,

1519
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:42,640
that has to happen with every single 
member of the family that,

1520
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,160
that when I say,
why,

1521
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:47,910
what,
when person a says let some things,

1522
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,780
what would,
what were you talking about in school?

1523
01:19:50,140 --> 01:19:51,280
And somebody says,
well,

1524
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:54,310
we're talking about the me too movement.
And person a says,

1525
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:55,390
oh,
the me too.

1526
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:58,030
Movement is stupid.
So person besides the me too.

1527
01:19:58,031 --> 01:20:03,031
Movement is the best,
most progressive thing that's ever 

1528
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:03,031
happened.
Um,

1529
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,350
and so it is,
it is very important that the person who

1530
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:10,351
says it's the best thing that ever 
happened is listened to fully by the 

1531
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:12,720
person who is a who believes is stupid 
and vice versa.

1532
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:18,020
And that there is no,
there is that there is facilitative 

1533
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:20,010
questions that the family trains people 
to ask.

1534
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:21,090
Now this is

1535
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:26,370
right.
So part of it is know the story before 

1536
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:26,370
you offer criticism.
No,

1537
01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,820
Carl,
Carl Rogers had good advice about that a

1538
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,170
and,
and you probably already know this,

1539
01:20:32,171 --> 01:20:34,390
but it's worth reiterating for people 
who don't.

1540
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,990
So Roger's rule was when you're 
listening to someone,

1541
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:44,160
then first of all,
don't assume that either you or they 

1542
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,671
know what they're talking about or what 
they're going to say because people 

1543
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:50,941
think people think by talking,
so you've got to give them a chance to 

1544
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:54,700
get it all out before you jump on it 
because they might change their own mind

1545
01:20:54,701 --> 01:20:56,050
in the mid,
in mid stream,

1546
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:57,820
but so.
So that's important.

1547
01:20:57,821 --> 01:21:01,480
Let them formulate the problem before 
you jump in with a criticism.

1548
01:21:01,870 --> 01:21:04,060
But then the next thing is,
and this I really love this,

1549
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:09,080
I think it's really useful,
which is that once the person has laid 

1550
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:10,930
out their story,
you get to say,

1551
01:21:12,250 --> 01:21:14,170
this is what I heard you say.

1552
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:19,830
Do you agree with my formulation?
Because that stops the list.

1553
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:24,960
First of all,
it indicates to the speaker that the 

1554
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,870
listener actually listened,
or if if if there's an error,

1555
01:21:25,871 --> 01:21:28,480
then the speaker can say no,
that's not what I meant at all,

1556
01:21:28,481 --> 01:21:30,130
and then there can be some 
clarification,

1557
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:35,460
but it also forces the listener to not 
turn the speaker into a straw man 

1558
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:39,610
because it isn't only that.
I have to summarize what you said.

1559
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:44,790
I have to summarize what you said in a 
way that you agree with and you know 

1560
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:49,591
that that's also a useful technique if 
there happens to be some wide variation 

1561
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:51,970
in verbal ability among the participants
and there might be because of age,

1562
01:21:51,971 --> 01:21:53,710
for example.
And so you know,

1563
01:21:53,711 --> 01:21:58,300
because it might be that even if you're 
a somewhat incoherent and stuttering and

1564
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:01,950
impartial in your formulation.
If I'm an older sibling,

1565
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:05,980
say I might be able to summarize it back
for you in a way that's actually helpful

1566
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:08,950
to you from the perspective of a 
cognitive scaffold.

1567
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:10,990
And so,
yeah,

1568
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,120
so,
so the thing you know,

1569
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:18,450
we know that human beings organize their
personalities at the highest level 

1570
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:22,291
through narrative and that narrative is 
not only thought it's spoken and so you 

1571
01:22:23,921 --> 01:22:28,921
speak your personality into being in 
these sorts of shared environments that 

1572
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:32,491
you're describing and without that your 
story is fragmented and incoherent and 

1573
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:36,871
so were you.
And so you can see why those shared 

1574
01:22:36,871 --> 01:22:40,110
social look,
if shared meals weren't so damn 

1575
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:43,321
important,
people wouldn't evolved the capacity to 

1576
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:43,321
engage in them.
Right?

1577
01:22:43,321 --> 01:22:47,461
I mean there are central to our social 
life and to have that abandoned in a 

1578
01:22:47,461 --> 01:22:48,730
family is really a catastrophe.
I think so

1579
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,410
really is everything you said?
Absolutely.

1580
01:22:52,411 --> 01:22:54,990
Every part of it.
I so agree with you and we know when you

1581
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:57,480
say did that historic something,
oftentimes someone will say,

1582
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,840
I'm repeat what they heard.
They say and then the person you asked 

1583
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:05,070
to die distort anything and the person 
says,

1584
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,340
yes,
I think you just sort of this.

1585
01:23:06,341 --> 01:23:07,840
And then the other person will argue and
say,

1586
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:08,950
no,
I said that.

1587
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:14,340
And you know,
the rule of the game is the person who 

1588
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:17,560
is speaking whatever makes them feel 
heard,

1589
01:23:17,890 --> 01:23:22,510
that's when you have a distorted 
anything and it's your job,

1590
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,300
it's your job to assist is like the 
customer's always.

1591
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:25,600
Right,

1592
01:23:25,690 --> 01:23:30,690
right.
But that doesn't mean you have to agree 

1593
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:32,591
with them.
It just means you have to have got the 

1594
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:32,591
damn story straight.

1595
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:32,591
That's right.
And that's.

1596
01:23:32,591 --> 01:23:37,580
So that's also important.
Some people really do make the mistake 

1597
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,700
of thinking that if I get correct what 
they,

1598
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:42,820
that they had said that means I agree 
with them.

1599
01:23:42,870 --> 01:23:47,870
No,
it doesn't mean it only means you've 

1600
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:47,870
heard them.
And then,

1601
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:51,400
you know,
part of what a family dinner tonight is 

1602
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:51,400
about is having a chance to have 
somebody,

1603
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:55,221
if it's a personal criticism or be able 
to respond to that and have the person 

1604
01:23:55,221 --> 01:23:55,570
who,
um,

1605
01:23:56,160 --> 01:24:01,160
who is listening to what made the 
criticism to begin with here that 

1606
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:04,581
response and ask if there's any 
distortion on what they've heard to 

1607
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:04,581
begin with.
And the,

1608
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:07,170
the,
the biggest challenge for people.

1609
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,350
Almost everybody.
I remember I was interviewed once by NPR

1610
01:24:10,351 --> 01:24:11,010
and they said,
you know,

1611
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:12,570
how can you,
you know,

1612
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:15,930
some of the people who are allied with 
the men's movement.

1613
01:24:15,931 --> 01:24:16,400
They are,
yeah,

1614
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,880
they seem like hateful people.

1615
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:18,810
And I said,
well,

1616
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,960
if you're,
if you're calling yourself progressive 

1617
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,130
as opposed to a as we do,
because I consider myself more on the 

1618
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:27,490
liberal side of most things.
Um,

1619
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:32,500
and then our first job is to listen.
When people feel heard,

1620
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:37,470
they stopped painting and you know,
hating is,

1621
01:24:37,471 --> 01:24:41,490
comes from a buildup of not being seen,
not being heard,

1622
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:46,410
being distorted,
being blamed or caricature in a negative

1623
01:24:46,411 --> 01:24:49,410
way before your,
before your heard it.

1624
01:24:49,411 --> 01:24:52,260
So that is the job of every,
you know,

1625
01:24:52,290 --> 01:24:57,290
every person that calls themselves 
progressive is to start hearing rather 

1626
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,170
than arguing first.

1627
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:04,480
Well then at least you can figure out 
what to argue about because one of the 

1628
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,221
things that happens with,
with Kristalina communication in the 

1629
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:09,410
family when the stories are being 
unfolded,

1630
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:12,980
as you can identify what the problems 
are and what they're not like.

1631
01:25:12,981 --> 01:25:13,760
If you,
you know,

1632
01:25:13,761 --> 01:25:18,761
you might be irritated at having to 
listen to your spouse layout in the 

1633
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:20,330
stumbling and they're stumbling manner,
a particular problem,

1634
01:25:20,331 --> 01:25:25,331
but if you understand at the same time 
that they might be dispensing of 98 

1635
01:25:25,331 --> 01:25:28,400
problems and only focusing on two,
it's worth the wait.

1636
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,760
So,
okay,

1637
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,300
one other,
another question for you.

1638
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:37,620
Um,
there are people who aren't in the 

1639
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:38,150
position where they can have male 
involvement with their children,

1640
01:25:38,151 --> 01:25:39,650
let's say.
And so what,

1641
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:41,900
what do you recommend,
if anything,

1642
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:47,080
for single mothers who are trying to do 
the best job they can with their kids 

1643
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:48,710
but are having a hard time pulling in 
male attention,

1644
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:52,490
what do you think they can manage for,
first of all,

1645
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:55,610
acknowledge yourself for the enormous 
amount of,

1646
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:55,880
um,

1647
01:25:56,590 --> 01:26:01,590
faceted job.
You're either taking a second as you 

1648
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:06,571
look through the differences,
mothers and fathers to ask yourself 

1649
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:11,741
whether there's any way you have maybe 
not valued your former husband in a way 

1650
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,060
that can,
um,

1651
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:16,730
that would,
that would draw him into the fold.

1652
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:19,370
But at the answer to those questions are
in no,

1653
01:26:19,371 --> 01:26:22,460
I have value at him and I still can't 
draw him into the fold.

1654
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:24,710
Essentially a deadbeat.
Sorry about that.

1655
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,840
Um,
then here's some options.

1656
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,390
The number one,
the,

1657
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:34,460
the greatest amount of evidence is it 
involving your children with cub scouts 

1658
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,230
is a very,
um,

1659
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,800
has a very well developed program for 
developing character,

1660
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,050
motivation,
integrity,

1661
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:43,750
loyalty,
um,

1662
01:26:43,751 --> 01:26:46,190
a sense of making promises that you 
keep.

1663
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,990
Um,
so very good.

1664
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:51,530
Studies have been done,
have children involved in cub scouts for

1665
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:56,531
two years or longer,
but this means not just getting your 

1666
01:26:56,531 --> 01:26:57,980
child involved in cub scouts here or 
there.

1667
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,000
Um,
but,

1668
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:01,340
and if your child doesn't like something
that's happened,

1669
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:06,580
making sure your child gets back into 
the fold and deals with what,

1670
01:27:06,690 --> 01:27:11,690
um,
know that it shouldn't be your child's 

1671
01:27:11,690 --> 01:27:13,630
choice to go to cub scouts or not.
Go to cub scouts as part of your 

1672
01:27:13,630 --> 01:27:16,340
parental responsibility to get him there
later to boy scouts.

1673
01:27:16,341 --> 01:27:18,740
Or it doesn't have to be cub scouts or 
boy scouts.

1674
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:19,700
Uh,
the y's.

1675
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:23,020
Some y's have good,
good programs also for,

1676
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:27,560
for young boys of mankind.
Project has good programs for young boys

1677
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:31,240
now for the first time,
they have a real good help,

1678
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,380
assistance to help boys with fathering.
Um,

1679
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,880
the boys clubs have some good programs 
with young boys.

1680
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,460
Get Your,
get your child,

1681
01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:43,670
um,
that a male mentor try to get your child

1682
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:48,671
to a school that has a significant 
number of males in at the age that your 

1683
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:51,350
child is,
especially if your child is very young.

1684
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:56,710
It's very important that a child not go 
from a mom only home to female only 

1685
01:27:56,991 --> 01:28:01,991
schools because the child will start 
searching for an identity from somebody 

1686
01:28:01,991 --> 01:28:06,761
that's usually destructive,
like a gang leader that will give a 

1687
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:11,090
false identity.
And so these are just some of many,

1688
01:28:11,091 --> 01:28:12,040
many things.
If you see it,

1689
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,930
we often think that a child needs a male
mentor.

1690
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,300
Yes,
a child does need a male mentor.

1691
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:20,150
Try to vet the mentors carefully,
obviously,

1692
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:25,430
um,
or you get your child to have faith if 

1693
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,430
you're at all involved in faith based 
communities.

1694
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,650
And even if you don't believe in God,
God or not,

1695
01:28:28,910 --> 01:28:32,570
not get your child involved in a faith 
based community,

1696
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:35,420
uh,
where there's a good male counselor,

1697
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,810
um,
who has groups for children,

1698
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:44,560
for young people,
oftentimes young people that are having 

1699
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:44,560
troubles,
um,

1700
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:44,560
the,
the,

1701
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,390
the ability to be encouraged to express 
your feelings to other males and see 

1702
01:28:49,731 --> 01:28:54,731
that your son is not just having the,
is not isolated in the problems he's 

1703
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:54,731
facing.

1704
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:55,060
Um,
but,

1705
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:59,030
but there's many other boys his age that
are having the same problems.

1706
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:02,070
Getting him to be able to express his 
feelings about that,

1707
01:29:02,071 --> 01:29:05,030
his fears about that to see me,
to have a,

1708
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:09,630
have a little experience has done where 
he paints a mask for themselves and what

1709
01:29:09,631 --> 01:29:10,990
the mask says.
And then what,

1710
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:12,960
what is really being said underneath the
mask.

1711
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,380
A good fiscal male facilitator can be a 
wonderful encourager of a boy to express

1712
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:23,180
his feelings rather than repress his 
feelings in a society that is as well.

1713
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:28,410
And then we,
what we all have a need to do is to get 

1714
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:32,211
out there and say something very 
damaging has happened in our society in 

1715
01:29:32,311 --> 01:29:37,311
the last 50 years.
We've had what I started this work with 

1716
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:41,961
the government,
with the commission to create a White 

1717
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:44,390
House council on boys and men.
I started that after a call from the 

1718
01:29:44,390 --> 01:29:47,310
White House to say asking if I wanted to
be an advisor to the White House Council

1719
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:52,311
on women and girls because of my 
background with the National 

1720
01:29:52,311 --> 01:29:52,311
Organization for women.
And I said,

1721
01:29:52,311 --> 01:29:53,850
absolutely,
but there also needs to be a White House

1722
01:29:53,851 --> 01:29:55,560
council on boys and men.
Well,

1723
01:29:55,561 --> 01:30:00,561
for eight years we work to make that 
happen and now we're working with the 

1724
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:00,570
trump administration to make that 
happen.

1725
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:05,930
And no one is getting on board yet.
But the importance of making that happen

1726
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:11,750
is that there has to be entire change in
attitude and atmosphere,

1727
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:17,300
that we are not just living in a 
patriarchal world dominated by a 

1728
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:21,801
patriarchy.
That the world was dominated by a need 

1729
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:21,801
to survive.

1730
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:21,801
Yeah,
right.

1731
01:30:21,801 --> 01:30:22,110
Absolutely.

1732
01:30:22,510 --> 01:30:27,510
Well,
there is a mother's both sacrificed so 

1733
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,730
much of their lives in the hope that 
their children would have better lives.

1734
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:34,970
Women made sacrifices of careers,
meant dads or dads made sacrifices in 

1735
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:40,911
their careers.
There are very few dads have multiple 

1736
01:30:40,911 --> 01:30:44,241
children that that followed the glint in
their eye because you usually fulfilled 

1737
01:30:44,241 --> 01:30:46,980
occupations that make you fulfilled,
um,

1738
01:30:46,981 --> 01:30:51,981
are not occupations that pay well.
So most of our fathers gave up 

1739
01:30:51,981 --> 01:30:53,640
fulfillment in order to do the things 
they needed to do,

1740
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:59,360
like be a fire,
a fire fighter or a coal miner or being 

1741
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:02,691
willing to be disposable in war in order
to be able to make their generation 

1742
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:06,810
safer and have more options and to have 
all the sacrifices that our fathers made

1743
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:12,170
called male privilege or male dominance 
or is such an underserving of men so 

1744
01:31:13,141 --> 01:31:15,210
that,
that entire attitude,

1745
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,480
it's also an underserving of women to 
state that the entire cultural structure

1746
01:31:19,481 --> 01:31:21,640
to date has been patriarchal in origin.

1747
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:23,660
That's right.
And you know,

1748
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:26,690
you could argue what the definition of 
Patriarchy is,

1749
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:32,020
but just understand that your father and
grandfather and great grandfather all 

1750
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:37,130
all did the exact same thing as your 
great grandmothers and so on.

1751
01:31:37,131 --> 01:31:42,131
Did they?
They gave their lives in the hope that 

1752
01:31:42,131 --> 01:31:46,091
they're your life and their children's 
lives would be better with greater 

1753
01:31:46,091 --> 01:31:48,380
amounts of opportunities and most of 
them sacrificed a great deal.

1754
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:53,390
My father managed the company and my 
mother was very unhappy and aiden had 

1755
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:53,780
his,
his company in Europe.

1756
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,260
My mother was very unhappy living in 
Europe rather than in the United States,

1757
01:31:57,261 --> 01:32:02,261
which was more comfortable for her.
So my father eventually gave up his job 

1758
01:32:02,261 --> 01:32:06,121
and so fluid brushes from door to door 
for a year in order to be able to make 

1759
01:32:06,121 --> 01:32:08,200
sure we had enough money at least to go 
to a state college.

1760
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:12,070
And then my mother had a decent home 
over ahead and so that the children.

1761
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:12,490
And so

1762
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,570
yeah,
well that's all associated with a little

1763
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:17,340
bit of gratitude for the past.

1764
01:32:17,650 --> 01:32:18,940
It really is.
We should be,

1765
01:32:18,941 --> 01:32:23,140
instead of criticizing the world is 
being patriarchal or as parents as being

1766
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:26,650
stupid.
We should really be saying,

1767
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:27,610
mom,
dad,

1768
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:28,720
Grandpa,
grandma,

1769
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:34,050
thank you for making our mastery of 
survival enough so that we didn't have 

1770
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:38,881
to focus so much on survival,
but let us not misuse our opportunities 

1771
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:43,060
by blaming men for the world that they 
created that was destructive.

1772
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:48,310
Uh,
understand that we're living a 50 

1773
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:48,790
percent longer now than we were 120 
years ago.

1774
01:32:49,110 --> 01:32:49,750
And,
um,

1775
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:53,800
and that serves as a result of all the,
all the progress that you have made.

1776
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:55,160
Um,
and so yeah,

1777
01:32:55,180 --> 01:32:56,660
this is why we're,
you know,

1778
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:01,680
I worked so hard to create this White 
House Council on boys and men and why 

1779
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,801
we've created a patriotic count to be 
able to sort of make a begin to raise 

1780
01:33:04,801 --> 01:33:07,520
some money to be able to make this 
happen.

1781
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,810
Whether it happens by the patriotic 
count or some other way,

1782
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:15,970
we need to have a total revisiting of 
the belief of women.

1783
01:33:15,971 --> 01:33:19,000
Good men,
bad women are oppressed men oppressors.

1784
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:22,660
And instead of the monologues of Hashtag
me too.

1785
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:27,960
We need to have dialogues and said human
resource centers becoming a h,

1786
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,470
e,
r rather than hr.

1787
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:31,120
That is all focused on her,
not,

1788
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:36,360
not him in her.
We really need to have dialogs at work 

1789
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:36,880
about what's working for women,
what's not working for women,

1790
01:33:37,120 --> 01:33:40,510
what's working for men and what's not 
working for men and so we really need to

1791
01:33:40,511 --> 01:33:43,060
have a fundamental revisiting of um,
male,

1792
01:33:43,061 --> 01:33:45,380
female and um,
and all,

1793
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:47,620
all of our gender roles in the past.

1794
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:53,190
That's an excellent,
that's an excellent place to bring our 

1795
01:33:53,201 --> 01:33:55,150
conversation to a close,
I would say,

1796
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:00,360
look,
I'd really like to talk to you again 

1797
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,420
about probably about pay gap at some 
point.

1798
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:06,600
We really concentrated on,
on what you've been outlining in this 

1799
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,651
book and your new book and the boy 
crisis and I would certainly recommend 

1800
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:13,180
people who are interested in this sort 
of thing to go out and pick it up.

1801
01:34:13,181 --> 01:34:18,100
It's full of facts and that's kind of 
Nice and it's concentrating on something

1802
01:34:18,101 --> 01:34:23,101
that's of crucial importance.
And I think maybe that people are 

1803
01:34:23,101 --> 01:34:24,310
starting to recognize as crucial as of 
crucial importance.

1804
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:29,311
I certainly hope so and so your work has
been very useful to me and I appreciate 

1805
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:32,080
it very much.
The time that you spent today being able

1806
01:34:32,081 --> 01:34:36,520
to talk to me and I hope we get a chance
to talk again,

1807
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:42,220
I would love to talk about the pay gap.
It's really impossible to believe that 

1808
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:47,021
there is not a patriarchal world if you 
believe that men are in more money than 

1809
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:49,850
women do it for the same work.
And so one has to really start with that

1810
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,980
fundamental understanding that it's 
much,

1811
01:34:51,981 --> 01:34:53,840
much more complex than that.
Um,

1812
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:59,050
and a very,
very different story than pretty much 

1813
01:34:59,050 --> 01:34:59,050
anybody perceives.

1814
01:34:59,050 --> 01:34:59,050
Yes,
absolutely.

1815
01:34:59,050 --> 01:35:00,870
So will,
we will definitely schedule that in.

1816
01:35:00,871 --> 01:35:02,070
So.
Okay.

1817
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:03,210
Well thank you very much.
