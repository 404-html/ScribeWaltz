1
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,640
I don't know if any other personality
course in North America talks about

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,800
Vince Wanger and boss anymore.
Maybe not.

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:23,430
But I think their ideas are extremely
interesting and so I'm going to talk

4
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:26,550
about them.
Um,

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,890
they were influenced very much by Martin
Heidegger who was one of the 20th

6
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:37,321
century's greatest philosophers.
I would say probably this school of,

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,260
this is part of the phenomenological
school was more influenced directly by a

8
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:45,160
philosopher than any other school.
And just to reiterate,

9
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:48,260
cause you might keep wondering why,
um,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,310
I discussed so many philosophers in this
course.

11
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:56,311
It's because
clinical psychology in particular is

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
not strictly a scientific enterprise.
It's because it's oriented towards

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
values.
As far as I can tell,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,790
I don't,
I don't see that there's any way of

15
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:10,210
getting around that and that because
what you're trying to do as a clinical

16
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:13,210
psychologist and perhaps what you're
trying to do with your own life is to

17
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,830
figure out how to live properly.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,640
Now you can construe that as the absence
of illness,

19
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:21,160
which is,
that's about as close as you get to a

20
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:26,020
scientific model of living well.
So you don't have any illnesses.

21
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:30,340
But even the idea of illness is an idea
that's not precisely scientific.

22
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,360
It's,
it's an,

23
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,720
it's an amalgam of scientific concepts
and ethical concepts.

24
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,080
So there's no escaping it.
And if you're in the domain of ethics or

25
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:42,460
values,
then you're in what is more or less a

26
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:46,060
philosophical domain.
But also if you're a scientist,

27
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,820
if you're a scientist who's interested
in personality,

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,660
it's also something you have to grapple
with conceptually because people live

29
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,570
within an ethic and the ethics
structures their perceptions.

30
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:58,150
And so even to study human beings as
objects,

31
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,530
you still have to take into account they
ensconced themselves within a value

32
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,090
system.
And you have to understand what that

33
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,590
means.
So for me,

34
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,680
it's easier and more straightforward
just to get right to the root of the

35
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:09,520
matter to begin with.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
And these people also had insanely
interesting ideas.

37
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,610
They're really useful to know.
And so this,

38
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,630
I would say maybe these th the
philosophy that underpins this might be

39
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,270
the most complex of all the philosophies
that we're going to,

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,450
that we're going to discuss.
And that's really saying something

41
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:27,370
because there's no shortage of
complexity.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,990
Say a noon.
So Oh and it's,

43
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:34,360
it's very difficult to,
to portray what these people were up to.

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,650
I started by telling you when we
discussed rogers a little bit,

45
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:42,310
that the,
the f the phenomenologists were

46
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:47,311
interested in the fact that people live
within a self defined perceptual world.

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,450
That's,
that might be one way of thinking about

48
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,284
it.

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,630
Part of the,
part of the way to,

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,870
to start to conceptualize what that
means is to consider for a moment,

51
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,480
just consider for a moment how many
things there are in this room that you

52
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,780
might look at.
And the answer to that is there's an

53
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:09,070
infinite number of them depending on how
you're going to scale your perceptions.

54
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,960
You could spend,
if you were a painter,

55
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,660
you could spend a month painting that
tile,

56
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,010
painting representation of that tile
because it's infinitely complex to get

57
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,720
the colors right to get the patterns
right.

58
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,070
There's no end to it really,
because to make a representation that

59
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,080
was accurate,
it would have to be as detailed as the

60
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,990
thing itself that's crazily detailed
and,

61
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,700
but you don't concentrate on that sort
of thing.

62
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,600
So you think you're surrounded by an
infinite number of potential things to

63
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,480
apprehend,
but that isn't the world you live in.

64
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,280
The world you live in is a very,
very constrained subset of those things.

65
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,780
And part of the question is then what's
the nature of that constrained subset?

66
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,600
That's what you inhabit,
that's what makes up your experience.

67
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,760
And also how is it related to the,
to the infinitely complex objects that

68
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:57,160
are around you.
And that's really what these people were

69
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:00,760
trying to figure out.
So you're in this perceptual frame.

70
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,730
That's one way of thinking about it.
That's the design by the way,

71
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,550
that's the,
that's the existential frame or the

72
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:10,300
phenomenological frame because you can't
think about it nearly as perception

73
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:14,650
because it contains also all of the
things that you experience subjectively,

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,970
the emotions and the,
and the f and the quality that you know,

75
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,370
call Leah is a,
as an element of being that say

76
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:25,060
philosophers are scientists of
consciousness have a particularly

77
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,090
difficult time with,
and it's like it's the quality of pain.

78
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,960
She doesn't seem reduceable to a set of
objective facts or the quality of color

79
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,980
or the quality of beauty or the quality
of love or the quality of sorrow.

80
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:39,370
Those things seem your reduceable to
some degree in and of themselves.

81
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:41,500
Like what?
What is pain made of?

82
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:43,360
It doesn't even seem like a reasonable
question.

83
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,440
I mean you can say,
how do you decompose the neurological

84
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:50,320
circuits that are involved in the
experience of pain?

85
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,740
Fine,
but to ask what pain consists of her

86
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:57,070
compose is composed of,
or what beauty is composed of or love

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,560
seems to be.
There's something wrong with that,

88
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,580
with the formulation of that question
because those things sort of manifest

89
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:08,260
themself as raw facts of existence.
And so their constituent elements of,

90
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:10,900
of this,
of your field of experience,

91
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:14,160
you're phenomenal,
phenomenal logical frame or this das

92
00:05:14,161 --> 00:05:16,570
sign,
which is the way that that heidegger

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,280
conceptualize it.

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
That's big there with you at the center
of the center of your what realm of

95
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,710
experience.
So

96
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,600
now here's some characteristics of the
data side.

97
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:35,710
The thing that you,
the thing that makes up you the past and

98
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,790
the present are implicit in it.
Well,

99
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,760
what does that mean?
Well,

100
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,900
say you have a particular emotional
response to something,

101
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:45,760
maybe it's a negative emotional
response.

102
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,980
And you,
you see this very frequently with

103
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,140
arguments with people.
You're having an argument with someone

104
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,340
you love,
like a family member.

105
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,640
That's a good example.
So let's say it's the same damn fight

106
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:57,410
you've had with your mother 50 times.
Okay,

107
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:02,390
well that's interesting because what it
means is that all of those 50 times that

108
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:05,420
you fought with your mother are implicit
in this fight.

109
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,860
So although it's taking place right here
and now the past is shaped it,

110
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,940
and if you wanted to investigate the
fight come completely,

111
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,660
you'd have to get to the bottom of that
entire train of interactions you've had

112
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:18,170
with your mother.

113
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,910
So it's implicit in your current,
in your current and your current

114
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,740
experience.
That's one way of thinking about it.

115
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,940
But the future's implicit in it too.
Because what you're doing right now,

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,390
it's as if the future is folded up and
what you're experiencing right now and

117
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:37,220
it unfolds as you interact with it.
And so the reason that it's conditional

118
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:42,221
to some degree on you and your past is
because it's your past and you that are

119
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,920
determining the actions that you
undertake right now that determine how

120
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,660
the future is going to unfold around
you.

121
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,110
Now,
not,

122
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,430
not completely obviously,
because you don't have complete control

123
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:57,431
over how things unfold,
but you seem to have some ability to

124
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,190
determine how things unfold.
So one of the ways I've sort of

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,890
conceptualize the phenomenological
viewpoint,

126
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,960
this is,
this is one way of thinking about it,

127
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,970
I believe,
is that instead of thinking,

128
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:12,380
and it does mean you have to
reconceptualize your idea of of objects,

129
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,810
like an object seems like a unit
dimensional thing.

130
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,050
In some sense it's an object.
But most of the things that people

131
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:21,470
interact with aren't like that at all.
So here's an example.

132
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,290
Let's say you have,
yeah.

133
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,380
Let's say you get a,
you,

134
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,490
you're writing the m cat,
you want to go to medical school,

135
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,740
you've written the Mcat,
you get the envelope in the mail,

136
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,710
it tells you what your score is,
you hold the envelope.

137
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,530
What are you holding?
Well,

138
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,480
if you think about it from an objective
perspective,

139
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,770
it's an envelope.
Who Cares?

140
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:41,240
It's just a little piece of paper,
right?

141
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,790
It's a little,
it's a rectangle of paper,

142
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,920
but that isn't what you're holding at
all.

143
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,250
That's not what that thing is.
That's how you see it,

144
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,080
but it's not what it is at all.
It's not even,

145
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,930
and you know that your body knows that
because you're shaking.

146
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,041
It's like,
well,

147
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,570
what are you scared of the envelope?

148
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,760
Well,
the,

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,750
the fact that you see it as an envelope
is only an indication of just how narrow

150
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:06,740
your perceptions actually are because
it's a portal,

151
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,020
right?
It's a portal through which you're going

152
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,130
to walk into one of two worlds,
one in which you're in medical school

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,810
and the other in which you're not.
And it also actually contains the past,

154
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:19,580
which is really strange because you
think,

155
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,900
well,
you already know what the past is.

156
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:21,800
It's no,
you don't.

157
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,270
Whatever that score is in there
determines what your past was.

158
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,860
And you,
you know that too.

159
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,350
You go watch a movie and a bunch of
things happen in the movie and then

160
00:08:30,351 --> 00:08:34,430
something twisted happens at the end and
all of a sudden everything that you

161
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:39,350
thought about the movie was a wrong and
a whole new path for the movie pops into

162
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,460
being.
Well,

163
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,730
are you a premed student,
a valid premed student?

164
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,340
Well,
the score will determine whether or not

165
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:49,400
you were very strange,
very strange.

166
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,700
Because you think of the past is fixed.
You know when you think of the things

167
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,670
that you're interacting with as the
things that you see and they're not,

168
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,120
and your body is smarter than that,
way smarter than that because it

169
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,240
responds to,
you could say this is sort of a Rogerian

170
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,580
perspective.
Your body is more likely to respond to

171
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:09,150
what the thing actually is than how it
is that you see it.

172
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,130
So,
okay,

173
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:15,360
so the past is implicit in the current
being and the future is implicit in the

174
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:18,870
current being.
And so the past and the future sort of

175
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,260
folded up inside it and you can unfold
them and take a look at them.

176
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:34,580
Now here's the next thing.
So from a classic scientific

177
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:36,530
perspective,
there's the world of independently

178
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:38,870
existing objects and there's the world
of subjects.

179
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,210
And the subject is really in a secondary
relationship to the object because the

180
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:47,540
objective world is what's real.
But one of the things that the

181
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,040
phenomenologists were,
were concerned about that is that well,

182
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,840
you run into this problem again of
exactly how it is that you define the

183
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:57,860
object.
Because

184
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,660
just as the envelope with the scores in
it can't be reduced to the paper.

185
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,930
So the object that you're interacting
with only reveals what it is as a

186
00:10:11,931 --> 00:10:14,030
consequence of the way that you interact
with it.

187
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,750
So for example,
if you take a complex object like

188
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,920
another person,
it's like,

189
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,020
well,
what is it that you are?

190
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,410
While a huge part of that is going to
depend on exactly how I interact with

191
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:28,700
you because you could be a raging beast
if I interacted with you one way and you

192
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,290
could be a perfectly,
you know,

193
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,210
cooperative entity,
uh,

194
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,540
that was very pleasant if I interacted
with you the other way and another way.

195
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,810
And so partly what's happening,
you could think of what you're

196
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:41,690
interacting with is something that's
really multifaceted,

197
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,340
truly multifaceted,
and you're,

198
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:44,960
you say,
well,

199
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,320
you're trying to determine what it is,
but the problem is,

200
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:52,130
is that what it is manifested itself
only in accordance with how you behave

201
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,920
towards it.
And it's actually the case with even

202
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,150
even objects that you reduce right down
to their constituent elements.

203
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:02,210
So you might say like,
let's talk about subatomic particles.

204
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,460
Hypothetically,
the most objective thing there is,

205
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,130
well,
it turns out that whether they're a wave

206
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,860
or a particle depends on the way you set
up the experiment.

207
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,990
Now,
I don't want to make quantum analogies,

208
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,050
but what I'm saying is that the object
is a very,

209
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:18,710
very complicated thing.
And so even defining what it is means

210
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,040
that you have to adopt a frame of
reference with regards to it and you

211
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,620
undertake only some procedures and not
others.

212
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,320
So when you're defining an object,
even scientifically,

213
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,330
you actually don't find,
define the object.

214
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,750
What you say is here's the
multidimensional entity.

215
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,960
If you approach it in this manner,
that's the procedure,

216
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,823
right?
The methods,

217
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,910
if you approach it in this manner,
it will manifest that set of traits.

218
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,420
But the problem is is that there's all
sorts of other traits that it could

219
00:11:44,421 --> 00:11:47,510
manifest just as well if you treated it
a different way.

220
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,150
And so the object itself is not
something that it's,

221
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,150
it's not something easily reducible to a
single set of properties.

222
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,020
I was talking to one of my students
yesterday had a pretty smart thing to

223
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:02,740
say about images.
We were talking about deep images,

224
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,360
you know,
the sorts that you might see in a really

225
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:08,920
high quality museum.
So maybe they're voted offs 15th century

226
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,550
or 16th Century Renaissance
masterpieces.

227
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,210
They're inexhaustible to some degree,
which is why they're in museums and

228
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,510
people go look at them decade after
decade.

229
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,500
And it's partly because

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,400
every time you look at them,
you're different.

231
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,470
You go in one week,
you look at it,

232
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,240
you see something,
you go in the next week,

233
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,650
you look at it,
you see something else.

234
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,410
Well,
it's partly because you're bringing

235
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:37,150
something entirely different to the
situation and the image is complicated

236
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:40,300
enough to allow it to reflect something
new to you.

237
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,110
Depending on the stance you take in
relationship to it and lots of things

238
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,490
are like that.
Lots of things.

239
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,800
I'd like that.
A book you read when you were 16 is

240
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,720
going to be an entirely different book
when you read it.

241
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:52,420
When you're 35 say,
well the book's the same.

242
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,330
It's like,
it depends on how you define the book

243
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,030
because it isn't even obvious where the
book is.

244
00:12:58,031 --> 00:12:58,990
Exactly.
Well,

245
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:00,760
it's,
it's on my shelf in the library.

246
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:01,750
It's like,
no,

247
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,700
that's a chunk of paper that's on your
shelf in the library where exactly the

248
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:07,480
book is.

249
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,430
That's a much more difficult question
to,

250
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,850
to consider.
So it depends on how you define the

251
00:13:12,851 --> 00:13:15,280
book.
So without a subject,

252
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:19,030
nothing at all would exist to confront
objects and to imagine them as such.

253
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,100
True.
This implies that every object,

254
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,480
everything objective in barely merely in
being merely objectifies by the subject

255
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:28,300
is the most subjective thing possible.
Well,

256
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,410
you also know this.
Again,

257
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,760
when you're in an argument with someone,
it's you know it's you know it's you.

258
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,210
It's like you don't know.
Are you being biased or are you,

259
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:39,460
are you looking at the situation
incorrectly?

260
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,430
The person you're arguing with is going
to convince you that it trying to

261
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:44,560
convince you that it's your problem.
You could think,

262
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,210
no,
you made me angry.

263
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,770
It's like,
hmm.

264
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,490
An interesting statement.
You know as if you could do that,

265
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:54,580
but it does seem that way.
You were being provocative while you're

266
00:13:54,581 --> 00:13:56,050
just too sensitive.
It's like,

267
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,150
hmm,
how are we going to settle that?

268
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:02,080
Well,
it's a continual argument and that that

269
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,520
again,
has to do with the crazy entangled

270
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:09,910
dynamic between subjective perception
and our objective perception.

271
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,920
I've showed you this before.
I actually think this is a pretty good

272
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,920
schematic representation of what's meant
by Das side.

273
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,380
And this is a complicated little
diagram,

274
00:14:22,381 --> 00:14:24,510
although it,
the diagram itself is quite simple,

275
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,500
but it,
it,

276
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,060
it,
it makes it,

277
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,470
it's predicated on the following
assumptions is that you need to narrow

278
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:35,700
down your world and what you're doing is
narrowing it down from let's say an

279
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:39,870
infinite set of possibilities to a
finite set of manageable possibilities.

280
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,630
And you do that a bunch of ways,
partly merely you can't,

281
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,620
your senses aren't acute enough to
detect everything.

282
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,800
So pure stupidity in some sense stops
you from being overwhelmed.

283
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,570
You don't have eyes in the back of your
head,

284
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,190
for example.
So you don't have to worry about all

285
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,110
those things you're not looking at
behind you.

286
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,190
But then it's far more than that.
You just can't handle that full

287
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:01,820
complexity.

288
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,110
So there's a continual narrowing process
and then you exist inside that narrowed

289
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:08,300
reality.
Like if I look at you like that,

290
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,680
there's not a hell of a lot of
difference between that and looking at

291
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,710
you like that.
I can't really see these people.

292
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,860
I can tell their people.
That's all I can see your face.

293
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
I've got just about all of it right
there.

294
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,110
So that's a very narrow,
and you know,

295
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:28,550
you're moving your eyes around and
inhabiting this constant narrow space.

296
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,713
Well,
what,

297
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,110
what's that space?
What does that space you inhabit consist

298
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:33,950
of?
Well,

299
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,020
that's dazzle and that space that you
inhabit.

300
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,970
And so we could say it's something like
this.

301
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,140
You have implicit in that perception,
a sense of where you are and what you're

302
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:45,650
doing right now.
It's in the perception and then in the

303
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,910
perception as well is what you're aiming
at because you're not just sitting here

304
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,580
passively or you'd be asleep or you'd be
unconscious.

305
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,090
You're sitting here doing nothing,
you know physically,

306
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,330
but you have an aim in mind.
And the aim is what you're pointing your

307
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:01,970
eyes at.
The aim is what's structuring your

308
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,170
perceptions.
They aim is what's revealing that part

309
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,720
of the world,
that that is being revealed to you,

310
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,050
to you.
That's the revelation of the world.

311
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,470
It also structures your emotions.
It also primes your behaviors.

312
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:18,440
So it's not a drive,
it's not a goal.

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
It's not a,
it's not a motivation.

314
00:16:20,481 --> 00:16:21,060
It's,
it's,

315
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,400
it's,
it's more than that.

316
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:25,250
It's all of that at once.
That's sort of what your personality is,

317
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,670
but you see the phenomenologists don't
really think about personality.

318
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,820
They think about the manifestation of
your reality.

319
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,080
It's not exactly your personality.
It's that you're the center of a reality

320
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,660
and you,
you constitute that reality.

321
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,720
But all your elements of experience
constitute that reality.

322
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:43,200
And so it's something like it's simple.

323
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,760
Its element is something like where you
are,

324
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,770
where you're going and the embodied
actions you undertake to relate those

325
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:53,960
two things,
which would include your eye movements.

326
00:16:53,961 --> 00:16:56,930
Cause of course perception is an active
phenomena.

327
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:59,930
You are shaking your eyes back and forth
unbelievably rapidly.

328
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,550
Otherwise give,
you can,

329
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,850
if you can make your eyes stand still,
which you can do with great

330
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,090
concentration,
everything we'll black out because you

331
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:11,420
have to move your eyes back and forth so
that the light hits different cells

332
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:15,500
because the cells get exhausted and then
they stop reporting.

333
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:20,501
So you're just whipping your eyes back
and forth in micro micro way constantly.

334
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,470
And as well as moving them around
voluntarily and involuntarily.

335
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,290
So even perception,
his perception is a lot more like

336
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:30,680
feeling things out with your fingers.
Even when you're using your ears or your

337
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:33,890
eyes very active.
There's no passive perception.

338
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,180
It's a motor act to perceive.
And so that motor act is determined by

339
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:40,640
your hierarchy of values.
That's one way of looking at it.

340
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,570
So another way of thinking about it,
that's also how the past and the future

341
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,720
implicit in it,
you're a very active perception is

342
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:49,650
determined by your entire value
structure.

343
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,090
So it's implicit inside of it.
It's folded up inside of it.

344
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,270
You can tell that too,
because if something violates it,

345
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:59,550
again,
maybe an argument with someone,

346
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,370
because people are,
it's good to think about people as the

347
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:05,670
thing you interact with the most as as
the canonical object because they're so

348
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:08,280
damn complicated and they get in the way
all the time.

349
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:10,380
And when someone gets in the way of what
you're doing,

350
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,690
you know,
it isn't obvious what they're

351
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,870
interfering with.
It might be the little micro routine

352
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,180
that you're undertaking right now.
You know,

353
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,360
maybe you go home and you make a nice
dinner and the person you're making it

354
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:23,280
for is all rude about it.
Okay.

355
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,620
So what exactly are they getting in the
way of?

356
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,580
Well,
they're certainly getting the way in the

357
00:18:30,581 --> 00:18:34,780
way of your expectations of having a
nice emotional time for the next hour,

358
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,940
but you have no idea how indicative that
is of some serious flaw in you or them

359
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:43,660
or the relationship or the situation or
the way you've conducted your whole life

360
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,850
or the way they've conducted their whole
life.

361
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,930
And all of that's packed in there.
It's sort of like the unconscious of the

362
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:51,880
psychoanalysts,
but it's more,

363
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:52,840
it's more,
it's,

364
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,530
it's not the same conceptualization.
It's another way of looking at the same

365
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:57,970
phenomena.
So,

366
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,560
okay.

367
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,290
All right.
So the two people we're going to talk

368
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,790
about most are made our boss,
and he was influenced by Martin

369
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,080
Heidegger,
who was a great philosopher,

370
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,590
taken to task often because he turned
out to be tangled up with the Nazis more

371
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:14,910
than he should have been.
And Husserl.

372
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,640
That's Edmund Husserl who was actually,
if I remember correctly,

373
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,421
mark,
Mark Martin,

374
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,960
heidegger's teacher that's living being
swagger.

375
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,340
And they were,
both of these two people were influenced

376
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:24,650
both by Freud and Yung.

377
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,240
Okay.
So here's one of been swaggers claims.

378
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:31,850
I love this claim.
It's such a cool idea and I think

379
00:19:31,851 --> 00:19:34,640
there's neurological support for it.
Neuropsychological support,

380
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,320
what we perceive our first and foremost,
not impressions of taste,

381
00:19:39,321 --> 00:19:39,981
tone,
smeller,

382
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:42,140
touch.
Not even things or objects,

383
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,950
but meanings.
Well that's an interesting idea because

384
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,100
your claim,
they,

385
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,300
you know,
it's been said that every person is an

386
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:53,900
unconscious exponents of some great
philosopher's presuppositions.

387
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,810
Well,
mostly the way you think about the way

388
00:19:56,811 --> 00:19:59,210
you perceive is that there are objects
in the world.

389
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,090
You see the objects,
you think about the objects,

390
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,970
you evaluate the objects,
you decide how to act on the objects,

391
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,610
and then you act right.
It's from,

392
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:08,810
okay,

393
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,730
object sense,
perception,

394
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,140
emotion,
cognition,

395
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,790
action.
That's wrong.

396
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,690
That isn't how it works.
It's partly not the way it works because

397
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,750
you're actually,
the way that you interact with the world

398
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:22,160
exists at multiple levels.
So,

399
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:24,500
for example,
you have reflexes.

400
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,120
So if I,
if I,

401
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,670
if I poke you hard,
you'll react like that.

402
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,740
He'll jerk back.
And that you do that without thinking.

403
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,770
That's part of a neurological circuit
that's very deeply embedded and that's

404
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,970
virtually automatic.
It's reflexive,

405
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:43,250
it doesn't require conscious perception
at all.

406
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,470
It's too slow for starters.
And so you have multiple layers,

407
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,050
there's multiple levels of you
interacting with the world.

408
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:53,350
And at one level you're seeing objects,
you're thinking about them,

409
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:56,080
you're planning what to do,
but you're doing all sorts of other

410
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:59,740
things that are way faster than that and
other things that are way slower at the

411
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,520
same time.
Now what,

412
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,920
what Ben Weighing Wanger claims is that
what you see in the world,

413
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,020
our meanings and that.

414
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,710
So it's the meaning detection first and
the object recognition second.

415
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,960
Now that's a hell of a claim that is,
but,

416
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,980
but there's definitely levels of your
nervous system that operate in that

417
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:19,570
manner.
So for example,

418
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,170
here's a good example.
People have blindsight there,

419
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,240
dad,
their core visual cortex is damaged.

420
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,700
They can't see objects.
So they think they're blind.

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,110
But if you show them an angry face,
they'll manifest a change in the skin

422
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:35,440
conductance.
They'll orient and it means that the

423
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:40,420
eyes are still mapping the face onto the
Amygdala and the Amygdala is mapping the

424
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:44,650
pattern onto the body.
No object perception pattern,

425
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,300
pattern,
pattern,

426
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,960
no object perception.
And so the meaning is what's,

427
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,290
what's the meaning is what's being
perceived first and foremost,

428
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,190
you have to perceive meetings first
because you actually want to stay alive.

429
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,180
That's the trick.
So the world is full of these things

430
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:04,030
that have meanings to you,
that are relevant to your survival and

431
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:06,670
what you're,
what you're perceiving first is the

432
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:09,220
relevance of the pattern to your
survival.

433
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,760
And the idea that you can conceptualize
that as a set of objects.

434
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:16,060
Well first of all,
that's a pretty new idea technically

435
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:16,871
speaking,
right?

436
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:20,680
Because technically speaking,
we didn't really start to conceive the

437
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:25,390
world as subject in an objective world
until we really formalized science.

438
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,820
Now,
science was implicit long before it

439
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,520
became explicit,
but it didn't become explicit until

440
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:34,450
about 500 years ago.
So you react to meanings.

441
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,060
So here's an example.
Babies.

442
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,480
If you,
if you have two surfaces and you put a

443
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:44,020
piece of glass between them,
they're elevated and you put an eight

444
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:47,950
month old baby on one surface or so,
they can crawl,

445
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,860
the baby can crawl,
it won't crawl across the space.

446
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,890
And you might say,
well it's sees a hole and we'll walk.

447
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,070
Won't crawl across it.
But that isn't what it sees.

448
00:22:57,071 --> 00:23:00,640
It sees a place to fall off direct.

449
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,010
That's direct perception.
So when I see this,

450
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:07,330
for example,
my eyes see that as a pattern.

451
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,500
That patterns on my retina,
it's propagated through my optic nerve.

452
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,730
It's propagated into my brain.
It's propagated on to my motor cortex

453
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,560
and the propagation is this,
that right?

454
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,130
So I can pick it up and as soon as,
when I look at that,

455
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,390
this is implicit.
That's implicit in the perception.

456
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,490
You think,
well why do you see that at the size and

457
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:32,890
resolution you see it at?
That's why.

458
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,720
So the fact that you see it that way has
this implicit in it and is it that you

459
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:39,490
see the object and match your hand to
it?

460
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,390
It's that matching your hand to it.
Is part of the perception of the object.

461
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,360
It's what gives the object meaning and
so you see actually you perceive the

462
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,560
meaning of the object.

463
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,970
It's part of the perception and you
can't not see the meaning of the object

464
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,490
while you can.
If you're a scientist,

465
00:23:55,491 --> 00:23:58,550
you can sort of separate the out the
object from its meaning.

466
00:23:58,551 --> 00:24:02,000
That's actually what science does.
It tears the object away from its

467
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:06,220
meaning and then of course there's
nothing meaningful left and so sorry and

468
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,540
sands up value free,
but that's because of the meaning has

469
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,750
been torn out of it.
Now there's technical reasons for doing

470
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:14,090
that,
but Ben swingers point is don't kid

471
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,590
yourself.
You see the meaning first.

472
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:18,980
Here's an example.
You Watch the trade taller towers fall.

473
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,750
What did you see

474
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,211
while you could say,
well,

475
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,560
you saw the towers fall.
It's like,

476
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:26,840
why are you in shock for two days
afterwards then?

477
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,090
Well,
because the towers aren't,

478
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,170
what are the towers exactly?
As long as they're standing and

479
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,230
operating their towers,
as soon as they fall,

480
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,710
God only knows what they are.
Maybe they're the beginning of the next

481
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,640
war.
You know?

482
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,020
Who knows what they are.
And so everyone was in shock for three

483
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:50,021
days because what they saw was the
indeterminate meaning of that event and

484
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:52,940
it opened all sorts of gateways.
It's like,

485
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,830
well,
the towers fell.

486
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:57,230
There's gateways open everywhere.
We don't know what's going on.

487
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,550
We don't know what's going to happen
next.

488
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:02,150
We don't know where we are.
And that's direct perception mapped onto

489
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,170
your body.
Bang,

490
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:06,680
you're in shock.
You see the meaning first and while you

491
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:09,770
constrain it down to well,
why are you so upset while the towers

492
00:25:09,771 --> 00:25:12,200
fell?
It's like that's the best you can do for

493
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,360
a verbal utterance.
It's,

494
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,740
it's what your perceptual systems
reported to you,

495
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:20,600
but God only knows what happened.
We still don't really know what it meant

496
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,110
that they fell.
Now most things have put themselves back

497
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,130
together,
but,

498
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,120
and then you think,
well,

499
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,700
what does it mean?
What does it mean that what you see

500
00:25:31,701 --> 00:25:35,180
first is the meaning?
And that's a really tricky question

501
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:37,010
because he might say,
well that's,

502
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:40,070
that's when you get back to the problem
of what constitutes real.

503
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,930
So I could say,
well,

504
00:25:41,931 --> 00:25:46,340
you've evolved to see the meaning.
Well then we might ask,

505
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:48,890
well,
if you've evolved to see the meaning and

506
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:51,260
that's kept you alive,
is there anything more real than the

507
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,150
meaning?
Because it's somebody who's a

508
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,230
materialist would say,
well no,

509
00:25:54,231 --> 00:25:55,970
the object is more real.
It's like no,

510
00:25:55,971 --> 00:26:00,200
it depends on how you define real.
It might be that the most real thing

511
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:04,340
about the visual cliff is that that's a
falling off place and that it's

512
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:06,200
secondary description has a,
you know,

513
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:08,210
an object,
a hole or something like that.

514
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,000
That's just a,
that's something you paint over top of

515
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,700
the primary reality and so

516
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,550
well here's the and here's the practical
application of it.

517
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,770
Or at least one of the things that I
think is practical.

518
00:26:20,771 --> 00:26:23,560
You know,
you can have experiences that did differ

519
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,440
in their,
let's call it high quality meaning you

520
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:28,240
know,
so you get engaged and engrossed in

521
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:30,730
something and you're happy about that.
It's not that you're happy,

522
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,590
it's that you're engaged and engrossed
in it.

523
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,540
You would do it again even though it
might take,

524
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,660
take effort.
You can tell that where you are is

525
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:39,250
meaningful.
Well,

526
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:44,010
I think what happens in that situation
is that you're in a pia jetty and place

527
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:48,210
where many of the games that you're
playing are stacked sort of isomorphic

528
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,270
Lee on top of one another,
and the experience of meaning is the

529
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,860
fact that you're playing the small game
properly nested inside a larger game.

530
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,260
You're playing it properly,
nested inside a larger game,

531
00:26:58,261 --> 00:27:00,450
you're playing it properly to et cetera.

532
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,840
All the way out past is balanced,
future is balanced,

533
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,080
everything is stacked up and there's a
report coming from your being telling

534
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,970
you that that's why you're engaged.
Might say,

535
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,140
well,
maybe that's real.

536
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,280
Maybe it's more real than anything else.
It's a strange thing because if you

537
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:21,510
think that meaning is separate and
secondary from the real objective world,

538
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
then the reality is the object,
but it isn't obvious that the reality is

539
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,710
the object.
It's certainly,

540
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,490
it's certainly not how we act.
It's not how we perceive,

541
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,050
and so did we evolve to perceive
reality?

542
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,030
It depends on what you mean by
perceived.

543
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:43,320
Perceived might mean,
did we evolve mechanisms that allowed us

544
00:27:43,321 --> 00:27:46,920
to survive in the face of that reality?
Yes.

545
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:50,430
Is that what's real?
What enables you to survive in the face

546
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:52,890
of reality?
It's a definition.

547
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,610
It's a perfectly reasonable definition.
Unless you can come up with a better

548
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,300
one.

549
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,500
Meanings are primary.
Now that brings up,

550
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,100
that brings up a strange issue.
So what determines the meaning of what

551
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:06,690
it is that you're perceiving?
Well,

552
00:28:06,691 --> 00:28:10,620
this is where been swagger and boss
disagree.

553
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Then Wagner says it's,
it's the a priori ontological structure,

554
00:28:16,201 --> 00:28:18,720
the world design or matrix of meaning.
Okay,

555
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:20,670
so what does that mean?
Well,

556
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,500
you have a particular history,
biological and cultural and individual

557
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,250
and you're viewing the world through the
lens of that,

558
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,120
of that set of particular already.
So it's almost as if you're behind a

559
00:28:33,121 --> 00:28:37,320
curtain and the curtain has certain
holes in it and you can see through the

560
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:41,010
holes in the curtain and the curtain is
your construction.

561
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:45,600
So the curtain with the holes determines
what you see.

562
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,250
Well,
boss would say no.

563
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,470
It's the opposite in in a very strange
thing.

564
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:54,120
It's that the meaning of the world
manifests itself to you more or less of

565
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:59,121
its own accord,
and it's a tougher one to explain.

566
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,500
Disclosure of meaning boss,
the revelation of the object,

567
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,870
the emergent emergence of the
phenomenon,

568
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,020
the numinous,
the very word phenomena is derived from

569
00:29:10,021 --> 00:29:13,770
famous thigh to shine forth to appear to
unveil itself,

570
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,990
to come out of concealment or darkness.
Okay,

571
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:18,510
here's an example.
You see someone beautiful,

572
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:24,830
your perception or is it your perception
or does the beauty exist?

573
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,070
That's the difference between Vince
Wanger and boss has been swagger would

574
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:29,904
say,
well,

575
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,000
the reason that that thing appears to
you as beautiful is because of the way

576
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:35,040
you're filtering it,
and boss would say,

577
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:38,550
no,
the beauty is in Hay inheres in the

578
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:43,551
object itself and manifest itself.
It's forth and so I really liked this

579
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:44,790
concept,
this,

580
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:47,830
this cannot concept of phenomenon.
That's why they're phenomenologists

581
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:51,940
famous die means to shine forth from,
from the phenomenological perspective,

582
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,610
you pursue those things that shine
forth.

583
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:00,330
Now remember,
this is kind of a parallel idea.

584
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,130
I suppose it's a parallel of union
ideas.

585
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,560
You remember in Harry Potter that when
they're playing quidditch,

586
00:30:05,561 --> 00:30:09,070
he's always chasing the snitch and you
remember how if,

587
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,610
if I've got this correctly,
quidditch is basically two games at the

588
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:13,510
same time,
right?

589
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,240
There's the standard game and then
there's the game that the seekers play.

590
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,010
Yes,
I've got that right.

591
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,050
What happens if the secret gets the
snitch?

592
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,100
Game's over,
right?

593
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,250
They win.
Very interesting.

594
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:26,390
It's brilliant.
She has a brilliant imagination that a

595
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,890
woman rolling.
So the idea is that in every game

596
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:31,630
there's two games going on at the same
time.

597
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:34,750
There's the ordinary game and there's
the game that the seekers play and the

598
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:38,230
secrets chase,
the thing that shines out and that's

599
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,470
what that little thing is the snitch.
It's a round circle with wings.

600
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,820
It's a very,
very old,

601
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,230
old,
old symbol.

602
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,730
It's a symbol of what?

603
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,800
It's a symbol of reality before it's
fractionated into its parts.

604
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,170
I don't know how to say it anymore
clearly than that.

605
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,840
It's a symbol of,
it's a symbol of what?

606
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,910
Managing that.
There are things that move forward to

607
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,320
make you curious and you were trying to
figure out what was common among all the

608
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:06,070
things that made you curious.
That thing that Harry Potter is chasing,

609
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:08,050
that's a symbol of that.
It's golden,

610
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:10,720
like the sun,
it flits around and attracts your

611
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,720
attention and it's always moving.
And if you're seeking,

612
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:17,170
you chase it.
So that's the phenomenological idea.

613
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:19,450
That's the disclosure of meaning.
You say,

614
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:21,790
well when you're curious about
something,

615
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:24,280
why are you curious about that?
Is it,

616
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,000
is it calling to you or is it something
that you're interpreting?

617
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,830
Well,
I would say it's both.

618
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,860
I think that's the way to resolve this
puzzle.

619
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:38,080
It's that there isn't a perceiving
entity without a structure and your

620
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,800
structure has been evolving itself for
three and a half billion years.

621
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:44,260
There's no perceiving entity without a
structure,

622
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:48,430
but by the same token,
the thing that's being perceived also

623
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,400
shines forth with its own potential
manifestation.

624
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,280
And you need to think of it both ways at
the same time.

625
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,340
But the curiosity issues,
it really,

626
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,550
it's fascinating.
One,

627
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,110
because curiosity pulls you forward.
It's not random.

628
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:05,500
That's the thing that's so cool.
You can't really control it,

629
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,590
but it's not random.
If your curiosity is random,

630
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:11,860
your schizophrenia and,
and I mean that technically because one

631
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:15,250
of the things that happens to
schizophrenia is that the mechanisms

632
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:19,120
that establish relevance become
pathologized and they see meaning

633
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:21,850
everywhere randomly,
and that's partly why they generate

634
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:26,350
delusions because they,
the incoherent manifestation of meaning

635
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,860
calls out for a representation.
They develop a paranoid delusion if

636
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,690
they're intelligent enough to put
everything together,

637
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,150
but so you're curious and something
pulls you forward will you can,

638
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,290
you can interact with the curiosity and
you can follow it,

639
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,820
but you can't really direct it.

640
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,690
The question is where is it taking you?
So that little ball,

641
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,970
that was a manifestation of what the
Greeks referred to Greeks.

642
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,180
Is that right?
We're curious is Roman and Greek God,

643
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:55,490
we're curious.
The spirit Mercurius is this thing.

644
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,160
It's the messenger of the gods,
the winged messenger of the gods.

645
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,380
It flits around.
You say,

646
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:03,290
well,
the curiosity pulls you forward to where

647
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,660
while to whoever,
wherever it wants to take you.

648
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,880
Well,
that's a union idea as well.

649
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:12,110
Is that your curiosity?
Is like the manifestation of yourself to

650
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:13,820
the ego,
right?

651
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,780
It's,
it's,

652
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:18,650
it's the thing that you could be in the
future calling you forward.

653
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,320
Something like that.
Very strange ideas.

654
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,660
Very interesting.
See,

655
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:28,220
when you start to understand that you're
not in control of what makes you

656
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:31,340
interested in things,
the whole world shifts around on you.

657
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:33,980
Because the question is if you're not in
control of that,

658
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,110
what the Hell is directing it?

659
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,350
What's going on?
It's not you.

660
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,440
It's not under your control.
It's not random.

661
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,390
It's alive.
It's dynamic.

662
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,130
It has an orientation towards something
that's the union self or that's the

663
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:51,260
manifestation of meaning.
Yes,

664
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,550
very strange.
I told you this already.

665
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,260
See there's a,
there's an old representation of very

666
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:59,480
old representation of the snitch right
there.

667
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,160
Now this is old symbol a.
You've got this dragon of chaos here.

668
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,240
It's kind of like an octopus as well.
That twist and its tail refers to

669
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:11,360
infinity dragons.
Almost always have an infinite tail like

670
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:13,250
that.
It's got the claws of a bird,

671
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,700
maybe a bird of prey,
the body of an animal and the head of a

672
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,910
snake.
And then down here you see it's got the

673
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:22,490
sun up there.
So it sort of aiming at upward towards

674
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,790
the sudden this thing.
And then down here is this thing called

675
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,750
the round chaos.

676
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,840
It's an old l chemical system.
And if you look that dragon is

677
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:33,140
fertilizing this and that has potential
in,

678
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:35,780
it's like an egg.
It's full of potential.

679
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,370
And so it's matter and spirit at the
same time.

680
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,860
It's sort of like it's,
it's a,

681
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:46,370
it's a representation of that which
you're exploring because you could say,

682
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:48,200
well,
the thing that you're exploring sort of

683
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,900
a constructivist idea,
you explore something new,

684
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,200
what you generate from the exploration
you,

685
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,320
because as you explore it,
you learned things that changes you.

686
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:59,630
So you generate psyche out of the
exploration,

687
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:02,540
that spirit,
and he also generate the world out of

688
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:04,130
it.
But the thing to begin with,

689
00:35:04,131 --> 00:35:08,090
his psyche and world at the same time,
and that's what this thing represents

690
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:11,930
and that's what Harry Potter is chasing.
That's what makes him a seeker.

691
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,700
Very strange ideas.
Now I'm going to tell you a dream and it

692
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,580
was a dream I had when I was working on
these ideas and I'm going to tell you

693
00:35:19,581 --> 00:35:20,750
the dream for two reasons.

694
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,980
One is because it bears directly on
these ideas and two because while we

695
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:29,120
just covered psychoanalytic thought and
I want to show you how a dream can work

696
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,120
because it's not easy to find a dream
that you can interpret in a way that's

697
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:36,020
public that makes sense because they're
usually so tightly defined contextually

698
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,350
you can them in the therapeutic context
context cause you know so much about the

699
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:43,230
person.
It's very hard to pull that out and make

700
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:45,750
it meaningful outside of that context.
But this dream works.

701
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,550
Okay,
so I was dreaming,

702
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:50,730
I was dreaming that there was a small
object,

703
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:54,150
it was a circle,
a sphere about this big and it was

704
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,480
floating on top of the Atlantic Ocean.
And I was,

705
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:01,530
I had a kind of a bird's eye view of it
and I was following it along like maybe,

706
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:03,270
you know,
like a drone would follow behind an

707
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,600
object and it was floating and it was,
it was really zipping along,

708
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:06,840
man.

709
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,160
It was really,
really fast.

710
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,300
And then the scene shifted to a bunch of
scientists.

711
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:16,110
They were sitting inside a room full of
television monitors and they were

712
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:17,940
watching this thing move across the
ocean.

713
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,980
And so it was here and then there were,
it was,

714
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:22,530
it had four hurricanes beside it,
one here,

715
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,450
one here,
one here and one here.

716
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,400
So it was in the center of four
hurricanes.

717
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,630
So whatever it was was like some bloody
potent thing was zipping across the,

718
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,460
it was zipping across the ocean.
Then the scientists got a hold of it,

719
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,980
I guess in the scene shifted.
And I was in a museum,

720
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:41,280
like an old Victorian museum and this
thing,

721
00:36:41,281 --> 00:36:46,281
this ball was now inside a wood.
So imagine a would stand with a glass

722
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:49,890
case on top of it.
It was inside the glass case and it was

723
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,720
floating and it was sort of pulsing a
little bit.

724
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,350
And so inside the room there was Stephen
Hawking

725
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,350
and the American president,
I don't remember who it was.

726
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,060
He was sort of faceless,
but Steven,

727
00:37:03,061 --> 00:37:05,370
I thought Stephen Hawking,
what the hell?

728
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,500
Disembodied intellect that Stephen
Hawking.

729
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:11,340
So that's what that meant.
And the president,

730
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:15,150
well he's just dissemble of order.
And so this thing,

731
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,840
whatever it was that was surrounded by
these winds had been placed into a

732
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:20,060
category system,
right?

733
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,260
It's in a museum.
It was boxed in.

734
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:25,950
It had been conceptualized in
categorized partly by disembodied

735
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:28,320
intellect.
That was Stephen Hawking and partly by

736
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:31,290
social order.
And so there's a bin Swinger boss thing

737
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,900
going on there.
The thing pulses and is alive.

738
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:38,901
So it's got its own power,
but it's also encapsulated in a category

739
00:37:39,331 --> 00:37:41,730
system.
So I'm a third person observer in there.

740
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:43,200
I'm not in the room,
I'm just seeing this.

741
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,960
So that was fine.
So the next thing that happened,

742
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:48,660
oh he has one of them described the
features of the room.

743
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,870
It's walls were seven feet thick.
They didn't want this thing going

744
00:37:51,871 --> 00:37:54,990
anywhere and it was made out of titanium
dioxide.

745
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,340
And I thought,
what the hell is that?

746
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,600
Well,
it's a paint,

747
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,180
it's a paint substance,
but it's also what the hall of the

748
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,480
starship enterprise is made out of.
So,

749
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,850
so my dream was saying,
well what's the hardest substance there

750
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,980
is as well?
It's titanium dioxide.

751
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:11,970
It's not getting out of that box.
The walls were designed to permanently

752
00:38:11,971 --> 00:38:13,200
constrain the object.
Okay.

753
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:15,450
Now the next thing that happened was
this object was,

754
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,790
it was,
you could tell it was kind of alive and

755
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,490
it kept shifting around.
And at one point it turned into a

756
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:21,960
Chrysalis,
a cocoon.

757
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,600
And I thought,
what the hell does that mean?

758
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,660
And then so it,
it turned into a cocoon.

759
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,510
And I don't know if you've seen it
Chrysalis when it's just about to hatch,

760
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,690
but it's,
it twitches around day.

761
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,840
It's alive,
that thing.

762
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,720
So they're very strange things.
And then at the end it turned itself

763
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,850
into a pipe,
like a mirror show on pipe.

764
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,710
And I thought then it reformed itself
and do his fear and just shot right out

765
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,544
of the room.
Like,

766
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,090
like the walls weren't even there.
It was just decided it was gone.

767
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:49,990
Bang,
it was gone.

768
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,720
And I woke up and I thought,
what the hell?

769
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,110
What the hell does that mean?
It took me forever to figure this out.

770
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,530
So then about two years after
experiencing this dream,

771
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,980
I was reading Dante's inferno in the
ninth Canto,

772
00:39:02,981 --> 00:39:06,790
a messenger from God appears.
So Dante goes down into hell.

773
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,090
And it was,
Dante is attempt to describe.

774
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,780
It's brilliant.
It's so imagine that you go to a bad

775
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:15,370
place psychologically,
right?

776
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,550
So your life has collapsed,
that's terrible.

777
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,610
But then you're trying to figure out
what you did wrong and how you're to

778
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:22,444
blame for it.

779
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,430
And so what you do is a descent,
a descent into your own foolishness and

780
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,950
stupidity level by level,
by level.

781
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,840
And that's what Dante was trying to
explain.

782
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,440
That's what that hell was.
Levels of catastrophe.

783
00:39:35,441 --> 00:39:37,030
And there's something right at the
bottom.

784
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,450
And he found that it was betrayal that
was at the bottom.

785
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,650
So in any case,
I was reading that and there's a line in

786
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:47,170
there that made me remember the stream
cause I tried to figure out the stream

787
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:48,010
for years.
Hey,

788
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm in the ninth count to a messenger
from God appears in hell to open the

789
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:54,850
gate of Disse,
which is barring the divinely ordained

790
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,270
with a virtual in Dante.
The approach of this messenger,

791
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,490
an angel ms proceeded by a great storm
described in the following manner.

792
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,090
Suddenly they're broke on the dirty
swell of the dark marsh,

793
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,260
a squall of terrible sound that sent a
tremor through both shores of hell as

794
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:13,180
sound as if to continence of air.

795
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,190
One frigid and one scorching clashed
head on in a war of wins that strips the

796
00:40:18,191 --> 00:40:21,160
forest bare,
ripped off whole boughs and blew them

797
00:40:21,161 --> 00:40:25,480
helter skelter along the range of dust
it raised before making the beasts and

798
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:29,410
shepherds run for shelter.
So that was like a herald of the arrival

799
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:31,390
of this messenger.
It's a very powerful scene.

800
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,180
And I thought about this dream with this
thing with the four storms.

801
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,800
So the pipe thing that really,
that really,

802
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,790
that took me forever to figure out,
and I find the remembered this painting

803
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:45,070
by an agreed,
this is not a pipe,

804
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,560
right?
So what does that mean?

805
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,030
Well,
what it means is the representation is

806
00:40:54,031 --> 00:40:56,610
not,
the thing is a very famous painting,

807
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,370
right?
The representation is not the thing.

808
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,150
Well,
even the perception is not the thing.

809
00:41:03,151 --> 00:41:04,830
And that's what the dream was trying to
get at.

810
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:08,850
It's like this thing,
this thing that was so powerful and so

811
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:12,420
capable of transforming could be
encapsulated temporarily within a

812
00:41:12,421 --> 00:41:14,790
conceptual system.
But whenever it decided to leave,

813
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:19,440
it was just going to leave.
And so what it was referring to was the

814
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:23,070
potential that there is inside objects.
So for example,

815
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,620
and it's such a complicated thing to
explain,

816
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,020
nobody knew what cell phones were going
to do.

817
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,830
You make the cell phone,
you think you know what it is,

818
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,060
you don't know what it is.
No one knew what the birth control pill

819
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:36,860
was going to do.
You make it,

820
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,290
you think you know what it is.
You have no idea what it is.

821
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,230
And it's going to do some of the things
you think it will do and it's going to

822
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,720
do a bunch of things you have no idea
about.

823
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,650
And that's because the things are more
complex than they look.

824
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:52,220
They're multidimensional and they have,
I wouldn't say a life exactly,

825
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:56,930
but they have an intrinsic complexity
that tends to unfold across time and

826
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,440
it's only somewhat predictable.
And so you have things under your

827
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,230
control and in your grasp to some
limited degree,

828
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,050
but at any point,
it's like the switch and the Yin Yang

829
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,400
symbol.
At any time,

830
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:11,240
chaos can collapse into order or the
order can collapse into chaos.

831
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:12,740
And that's what that dream meant.

832
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,650
Another painting by him,
a Greek trying to express the same

833
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:18,484
thing,
right?

834
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,560
All men in suits,
all uniform,

835
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:22,930
all thinking the same way,
same haircuts,

836
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:27,010
completely socialized,
blinded by their own perceptions.

837
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,590
That's us because you think,
well,

838
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,440
your perceptions aluminate and bring you
information.

839
00:42:32,441 --> 00:42:36,670
It's yes and no.
They also constrain to equal degree.

840
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,200
I dreamed much later about a year later,
this was a very cool image too.

841
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:46,380
You know that image that I think it's,
is it Da Vinci or Michelangelo of the

842
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:48,770
manned inscribed in the square?
Inside the circle.

843
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,140
It's a very famous image.
What it was like that,

844
00:42:51,141 --> 00:42:56,141
except it was a cube but not a square.
And so there was a kind of a faceless

845
00:42:56,601 --> 00:42:58,700
person,
almost like a mannequin inside this

846
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,880
cube.
And he was suspended about two feet off

847
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:05,750
the ground.
And on the front wall it was like

848
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,210
wallpaper designs.
There was these little squares about

849
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:11,900
this big and they were Mandela's square
with a circle inside them.

850
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,310
And then inside the circle there was a
little snake tail that was out and the

851
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:19,730
whole wall was covered with the snake
tails and the person,

852
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,580
when the person walked forward,
the wall would move forward.

853
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,900
And when he moved,
walked backwards,

854
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:27,740
the wall would move backwards.
It was always this far away and he could

855
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,620
reach out and pull any of those snakes
into being.

856
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,680
And so that was another dream of the
same sort of idea.

857
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,560
What do you have in front of you?
A world of objects?

858
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,483
No,

859
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:42,880
you have a world of potential in front
of you and you can interact with any

860
00:43:42,881 --> 00:43:45,580
aspect of that potential and while
you're doing so,

861
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,620
you realize it,
you,

862
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,050
you pull something into being that
wouldn't have been there before and what

863
00:43:50,051 --> 00:43:53,050
you see in front of you is a a wall of
potential.

864
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,110
The potential is not infinite because
you're constrained,

865
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,420
but it's still,
it's,

866
00:43:58,421 --> 00:44:01,030
for all intents and purposes,
it'll do you just fine.

867
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:05,200
It's more potential than you could ever
need and so the dream see dreams.

868
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,090
Dreams are at the forefront of thinking.
They get there before you.

869
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,430
The creative imagination is at the
forefront of thinking.

870
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,010
It's trying to you.
If you think that you're moving out into

871
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:22,670
the unknown to gather new information,
what gets there first is the

872
00:44:22,671 --> 00:44:25,850
imagination.
Obviously that's what Piaget said about

873
00:44:25,851 --> 00:44:28,220
children as well.
You imagine at first,

874
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,070
then maybe you can represent it in
speech and dream is part of that

875
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:34,920
imaginative process.
That's what artists are doing.

876
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,930
They're take going out into the unknown
and representing it imaginatively and

877
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:40,141
said,
well,

878
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,480
what does that painting mean?
While if the artists knew that,

879
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:45,000
he'd just write it down,
right?

880
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:49,440
The art is beyond what's what's
articulable otherwise it's not art.

881
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:52,740
It's just propaganda.
So the artists and the dream,

882
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:54,240
they're out on the frontier,
right?

883
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:57,630
That's the open imagination.
And so when you're conceptualizing new

884
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,150
things,
the dream in the imagination can bring

885
00:45:00,151 --> 00:45:02,700
you places that you don't even know that
you can go.

886
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,590
And it's a mystery too.
It's like,

887
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:06,480
I don't know how I figured this out.
I didn't.

888
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:10,560
It was as if the figuring out manifested
itself inside me because that's the

889
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:11,820
experience in a dream,
right?

890
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,670
You don't feel,
I dreamed this up.

891
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,840
You feel I had a dream.
Where did that come from?

892
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,740
Springs out of the unknown and offer
something to you.

893
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,720
Man's option to respond to this claim or
to choose not to do seems to be the very

894
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:34,200
core of human freedom.
Here's pathology has conceptualized by

895
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:37,950
the phenomenologists.
It's a very interesting way of thinking

896
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:40,740
about it.
Existential guilt and fear as debt to

897
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,330
possibility.
Well,

898
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:45,210
so there's this idea,
it's like an existential idea that you

899
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:48,600
have some problems,
that you have some problems in your

900
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,434
life.
Well,

901
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,090
the part of the design is the sense of
responsibility that you have to address

902
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:56,760
those problems.
It's part and parcel of the way that

903
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,590
human beings manifest themselves in the
world.

904
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,890
So part of your pathology would be
failure to bear,

905
00:46:01,891 --> 00:46:05,370
the responsibility for your being and
the sense that you have a debt to

906
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,860
existence,
and according to the phenomenologists

907
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:11,280
that's built right into the sense of
you're being failure to shoulder

908
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:13,770
existential burden,
results in neurotic,

909
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,010
guilt and fear.
It's a remarkable conceptualization,

910
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,180
unpaid debt to existence.
Clean up your room.

911
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,081
Right.
Well,

912
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:24,090
that's a good place to start.
Stop.

913
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,320
Okay,
good.

914
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,030
We'll see you in a week and a half.
