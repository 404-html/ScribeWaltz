1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:02,150
Yeah,

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,690
thank you.
So,

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,043
um,
I looked today and these lectures have 

4
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:27,380
now been watched by,
they've been viewed a million times,

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,680
so that's pretty amazing.
Really.

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,050
Thank you.

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,313
Or they've been,
they've been glanced at a million times 

8
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:43,480
that might,
that's also possible.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:44,890
Alright,
so,

10
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:48,340
well let's get right into it.
So last week,

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,233
um,
I think was mostly remarkable for the 

12
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,050
absolute dearth of content that was 
actually biblically related.

13
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:57,500
So that was,
um,

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,953
I'll just recap what I laid out in
so that it sets the frame properly for 

15
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,730
what we're going to discuss tonight.
And

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,410
I presented you with an elaborated 
description of,

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,573
of this diagram essentially,
which I spent quite a lot of time 

18
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:24,760
formulating probably about 25 years ago,
I guess,

19
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,970
which kind of accounts for its graphic 
primitiveness I suppose.

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,363
Um,
I was really pushing the limits of my 

21
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:34,210
four 86 computer to produce that I can 
tell you.

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,640
So,
and it's,

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,810
it's,
it's a,

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:38,913
it's a description or representation of 
the archetypal circumstances of life 

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,953
and,
and the archetypical circumstances are 

26
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:51,361
the circumstances that are true under 
all conditions for all time.

27
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,823
And so you can think about them as 
descriptively characteristic of the 

28
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:57,274
nature of human experience that's not 
exactly the same as the nature of 

29
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,000
reality,
but

30
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,223
because you can,
you can divide reality into it's 

31
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,770
subjective and objective elements and 
there's utility in doing that,

32
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,604
but these sorts of representations don't
play that game that they consider human 

33
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:20,840
experience
as con con,

34
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,830
constant constituted constitutive of 
reality,

35
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,280
and that's how we experience it.
And so we'll just go with that.

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,550
The idea basically is that we always 
exist inside a damage structure and that

37
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:39,241
structure is partly biological and it's.
It's partly socio-cultural.

38
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,100
It's partly what's been handed to us by 
our,

39
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
by our ancestors,
both practically in terms of 

40
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:50,350
infrastructure,
but also psychologically in terms of the

41
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,630
active learning content of our,
of our psyches,

42
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,060
and so that would include,
for example,

43
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:58,894
our ability to utilize language and the 
words that we use and the phrases that 

44
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,024
we use and the mutual understanding that
we developed as a consequence of 

45
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,690
interacting with each other.
Architecturally speaking,

46
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,920
that structure is always.

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,663
It's always been corrupt and the reason 
it's dad is because it was made by 

48
00:03:18,961 --> 00:03:19,794
people who are dead and the reason it's 
corrupt is because things fall apart of 

49
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:27,960
their own accord and the fact that 
people don't aim properly,

50
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,590
let's say speeds along that process of 
degeneration.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,813
And so what that means,
and I think this is something worth 

52
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,174
knowing.
Maybe I'll try standing back here and 

53
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:42,140
see if that problem goes away.
Um,

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,763
what that means is that young people 
always have a reason to be upset and 

55
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:53,140
cynical about the current state of 
affairs and,

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,050
and it's that way forever.
And,

57
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,270
and,
and so it's useful,

58
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,104
I think,
to consider such consideration sorts 

59
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,300
such conceptualizations as the pay of 
the,

60
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,850
as the patriarchy in that light because 
it's an archetypal truth that the social

61
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:06,684
structure is corrupt and incomplete.
And what that means is that it's 

62
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:14,610
something that you have to contend with 
every moment.

63
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:17,350
It's some sense of your life.
It's an,

64
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,260
it's a permanent fact of existence.
And to be upset that

65
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,493
the

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,160
structures,
social structures,

67
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,053
or even the biological structures within
which we live are incomplete and 

68
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:35,110
imperfect,
is to not take that personally,

69
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:35,944
that that's the worst part of it,
to take that personnel personally is a 

70
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,574
misreading of the existential condition 
of humankind because it's always the 

71
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:44,704
case that what you have been given and 
what you live in is degenerate and 

72
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,100
corrupt and in need of repair.

73
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,663
And it's easier just to accept that 
because there's also a positive 

74
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,700
development and the pause development as
well.

75
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,170
You've been granted something rather 
than nothing

76
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,503
and maybe you haven't been granted pure 
hell because especially in a culture 

77
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:12,510
like ours where many things actually 
functioned quite well.

78
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,630
So there's room for gratitude there.
Even if it's a broken machine,

79
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:16,464
it's not one that's completely 
devastated and it's not absolutely hell 

80
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:22,260
bent on at every second on your misery 
and destruction.

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,650
And it easily could be because many 
societies are like that.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,873
And so the fact that we happen to live 
in one that isn't corrupt beyond 

83
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:34,050
imagining is something to be eternally 
grateful for.

84
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,720
While.
So we live inside a damage structure and

85
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,450
we also bear responsibility for that 
damage because

86
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,360
we don't do everything we can to 
constantly repair it.

87
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,703
And you might say,
well that's actually one of the 

88
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,960
fundamental,
you know,

89
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:52,651
people say,
well,

90
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:53,484
what's the meaning of life?
What they really mean is what's the 

91
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:56,214
positive meeting of light?
Because as we've already discussed that 

92
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,840
negative meanings of life or more or 
less self evident,

93
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,273
well,
the positive meaning of life is to be 

94
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,870
found in noting the state of lack of 
repair,

95
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,900
of the,
of the walled city that you inhabit,

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,980
and then sally selling forth to do 
something about that,

97
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,981
to repair the breaches and to fix up the
walls and to make the structure that you

98
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:23,291
inhabit as secure and as productive as 
it possibly can be.

99
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,533
And

100
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,030
there's no shortage of opportunities to 
do that.

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,620
You can do that in your own mind.
You can do that in your own room.

102
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:37,840
You can do that in your own household,
in your local community,

103
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:41,160
you.
And maybe if you get good at doing it at

104
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,680
all those levels,
then you can start to look beyond that.

105
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,903
And so there's challenges.
That's the thing that's kind of 

106
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:47,484
interesting about this insufficient 
structure is that it has a set of 

107
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:50,754
challenges built into it because of its 
insufficiency and perhaps even because 

108
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:54,924
of its corrupt nature that calls forth 
the potential response from you of 

109
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:01,404
heroic adventure and the heroic 
adventure is to man the barricades and 

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,930
repair the city.
And you can always do that.

111
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:13,050
It doesn't matter what's your personal 
circumstances are.

112
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,590
There's always something that isn't 
right near you,

113
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,810
isn't correct,
isn't laid out properly,

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,030
that you could just fix if you want it 
to.

115
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,160
And one of the things that we're going 
to talk about tonight is the idea that

116
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,870
if you adopt the attitude,
an attitude that's like that,

117
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,880
that the rule that you should play is to
make things better wherever you are.

118
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:40,510
However you can.
That what would actually happen would be

119
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:44,140
that things would get better wherever 
you are in all sorts of ways.

120
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:47,470
And that we've really,
as a species you might say,

121
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,680
or maybe even as singular individuals 
we've,

122
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,150
we've explored that rarely.
It isn't something that's put forth as a

123
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:55,984
proposition that often.
And it's quite surprising to me and you 

124
00:07:58,631 --> 00:07:59,464
know,
I had an interesting experience the 

125
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,470
other day.
I went to the keg,

126
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,430
I go there because I have food allergies
and they're very careful with people who

127
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:07,264
have food allergies.
And the waiter took me to the table and 

128
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,044
he said that he had been watching my 
lectures and that's a very common 

129
00:08:14,531 --> 00:08:19,531
experience and he was happy about that 
and he said that he'd had two promotions

130
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:20,794
at the keg in the last four months 
because he'd been watching my lectures 

131
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:27,850
and like I really found that in 
affecting experience because,

132
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,721
you know,
you might say,

133
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:29,554
well,
he's working as a waiter at the keg and 

134
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:32,800
there's nothing particularly heroic 
about that.

135
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,653
And,
and I disagree with that actually 

136
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,050
because I don't care where you're 
located,

137
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:38,884
you can do a hell of a job.
And I mean that literally at whatever 

138
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,850
job you have,
you can,

139
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,450
you can take whatever job you have and 
you can make it a real nice little piece

140
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:49,750
of absolute misery.
Or you can do.

141
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,820
You can act like a civilized human 
being.

142
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,920
And notice that no matter where you are,
there's a,

143
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,160
there's a richness

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,920
and a complexity that's completely 
inexhaustible,

145
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,370
right at hand,
and then you can take that seriously and

146
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,270
you can say,
well,

147
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,580
I happened to be a waiter at the keg and
perhaps that's not what I expected.

148
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,414
And,
and he's a young guy and perhaps that 

149
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:13,800
isn't where I want to end up,
but it's not nothing,

150
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,280
it's a rich environment and I can make 
it a lot better if I want to.

151
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,114
I can get along properly with my 
coworkers and not gossip behind their 

152
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,264
back and I can treat my customers 
properly and if an opportunity comes my 

153
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:28,170
way I can take it and I can see what 
happens.

154
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,933
And so he said that's what he had 
started doing and that things were 

155
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,784
working out much better for him.
He was in a much better job than he was 

156
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,620
three months ago in three months.
That's nothing,

157
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:37,860
right?

158
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,693
I mean that's a nice trajectory.
It's an uphill trajectory and that's 

159
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:42,894
what you want really an uphill 
trajectory is actually even better than 

160
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,320
being somewhere good as far as I'm 
concerned because one of the things that

161
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,154
really makes your life meaningful is the
clear realization that you're headed 

162
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:53,754
somewhere better than you are now.
And then it's even better if you also 

163
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,324
understand that there's a direct causal 
relationship between the things that 

164
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,580
you're doing and the steepness of that 
inclined.

165
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,940
And so I get a lot of letters from 
people like that and they're more,

166
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,700
most frequently young men,
although not always.

167
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,840
And they say,
well,

168
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,674
you know,
I've been listening to these lectures 

169
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,330
and I decided that I'm going to try to 
take responsibility for my life.

170
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,164
And so I'm,
I've started to stop doing all the 

171
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,710
stupid things that I know that,
uh,

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,010
that are stupid that I know I shouldn't 
be doing.

173
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,113
And I've started doing some of the 
things that aren't stupid that I know I 

174
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,530
should be doing,
which seems pretty obvious really if you

175
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:29,364
think about it.
But it obvious though it may be that 

176
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:34,290
isn't necessarily what people do.
And then they write and say,

177
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,930
you can't believe what difference that 
makes.

178
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,883
And they're thrilled about it.
And so I'm thrilled about it when I get 

179
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,644
letters like that because I really don't
experience anything as better than a 

180
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,224
letter like that or a message like that 
because it's so good to see things that 

181
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,640
aren't so good,
replaced by something better.

182
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,860
And I really do think it's an open 
question.

183
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,694
I truly believe it's an open question.
To what degree we could make things 

184
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,850
better if that's what we actually aimed 
at doing.

185
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,800
You know,
in some of the stories that we've,

186
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,783
we've covered already the story of Cain 
and Abel in particular is really an 

187
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,150
analysis of that problem which is so 
remarkable that it occurs so,

188
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,310
so early in this document.

189
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,940
It's such a,
such a foundational story.

190
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,440
And it basically says,
well,

191
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,240
there's two modes of being in the world,
right?

192
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:26,241
There's one where you adopt the 
responsibility for living properly,

193
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,070
for being properly and you make the 
sacrifices necessary for doing that.

194
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:34,710
And then everything will flourish 
properly.

195
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,723
And the other one is a pathway of 
resentment and bitterness and rejection 

196
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:41,250
and murder.
And genocide,

197
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:46,251
and that just seems exactly right to me.
And so if the positive path beckons,

198
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:50,010
if you can actually see what it is,
if you can,

199
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,500
if you can lower yourself enough to see 
what it is.

200
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,363
Young Carl Young said once that modern 
people didn't see God because they 

201
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,320
didn't look low enough,
a phrase I really,

202
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,370
really like because people denigrate the
opportunities that are right in front of

203
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:04,204
them and there's no reason to do that 
because what's right in front of you is 

204
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,160
the majesty of being.

205
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,993
That's what's right in front of you.
It's inexhaustibly complex and full of 

206
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:13,954
potential.
And there's no reason to assume that 

207
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:20,290
wherever you happen to be isn't as good 
as starting place as anywhere else.

208
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:20,981
Now,
you know,

209
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,380
I know some people have terrible,
terrible lives.

210
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,050
They're in situations that are 
absolutely unbearable and,

211
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,153
but I also do know that even situations 
like that can be made a hell of a lot 

212
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:31,180
worse by the bat,
by,

213
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,820
by,
by the worst kind of attitude.

214
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,590
That's for sure.
So,

215
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,240
so anyways,
so that's where you are,

216
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,700
you're in a damaged structure,
you're a damaged structure,

217
00:12:39,701 --> 00:12:40,534
you're in a damaged structure,
but you know at least it's got some 

218
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,094
walls,
you know you're not being fed to the 

219
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,240
lions on a regular basis.
So that's a good thing and you can,

220
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,780
you can emerge forward,
you know,

221
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,683
heroically magically to confront the 
chaos that constantly threatens the 

222
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:58,204
structure within which you live and you 
can free something as a consequence of 

223
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:01,300
that.

224
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,150
You can learn something,
you can strengthen yourself.

225
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:04,984
That's the other thing,
because the way what you're actually 

226
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:10,720
made of in many ways that what informs 
you,

227
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,260
what you're made of is what you 
encounter when you voluntarily encounter

228
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,094
the unknown.
And so the more you voluntarily 

229
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,404
encountered the unknown,
the more you get made of and the more 

230
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:21,130
you get made of the more there is to 
you.

231
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:21,964
And then the more you're good at 
encountering the unknown and 

232
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,114
restructuring order and calling forth 
proper order out of the potential of 

233
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,300
being.
And God,

234
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:33,790
you got to think,
why wouldn't you do that?

235
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,550
Since you can do that,
and it's an endless mystery.

236
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,170
You know,
I think part of it is that people,

237
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,933
well,
it's also encapsulated to stumped some 

238
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:42,514
degree in the story of Adam and Eve 
because what happens to Adam is when he 

239
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:46,360
becomes self conscious,
right?

240
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,353
He,
he becomes ashamed of his self in 

241
00:13:49,091 --> 00:13:52,690
regards himself as a lowly sort of 
creature and there's endless reasons why

242
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:53,524
people would do that because of course 
were rife with imperfection and so he 

243
00:13:56,621 --> 00:13:57,454
hides from God.
And I think that's actually the answer 

244
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:03,640
to the conundrum,
which is that people don't aspire to the

245
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,474
highest good because they're deeply 
ashamed of themselves and their 

246
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:12,190
weaknesses and their insufficiencies.
And so it's,

247
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,070
it's not the only reason.
I mean there's,

248
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,073
there's the desire to avoid 
responsibility and there's all the 

249
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:18,784
negative motivations as well,
like resentment and hatred and the 

250
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:25,270
desire to make things worse.
I don't want to,

251
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,363
you know,
give us,

252
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,120
given us too much of a break,
but,

253
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,463
but it's something like that,
but it's okay to not be in a very good 

254
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:35,314
place if what you're trying to do with 
that not very good place is make it 

255
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:37,960
better.

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,793
And one of the things I really have 
learned as a clinical psychologist is 

257
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:45,380
that you just cannot believe how 
powerful incremental progress is you.

258
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,580
You can do the calculations like it's 
like compound interest,

259
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:49,414
you know,
if you make your life a 10th of a 

260
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,950
percent a week,
man in two or three years years,

261
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,940
you're in such a better place than you 
were,

262
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:56,774
that it isn't even like the same domain.
And if you keep that up for 10 years or 

263
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:02,181
20 years,
you know,

264
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:04,220
especially if you're young and you start
early,

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,120
you start to straighten yourself out and
fix the things that you can fix.

266
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,110
You can transform your lives in ways 
that are completely unimaginable.

267
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:12,944
And God only knows what the upper limit 
of that is in terms of human 

268
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,130
possibility.
Because we are amazing creatures,

269
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:19,964
you know,
when we really get our act together and 

270
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,720
stop running at 10 percent of our 
capacity.

271
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,300
So,
so,

272
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,860
so that's what you do.
You've got,

273
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,723
you know,
the fact that things aren't exactly the 

274
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:32,780
way they should be,
at least gives you something to do.

275
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,340
You know?
And that's,

276
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,031
that's and,
and,

277
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:35,864
and maybe something great to do because 
there's no shortage of suffering and 

278
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:43,211
trouble that besets the world that you 
could conceivably ameliorate in some way

279
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,684
and the utility and meaning the utility 
of that and the intrinsic meaning of 

280
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,084
that is self evident.
So it also makes me curious about 

281
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,890
nihilism,
for example,

282
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:55,724
in despair,
because I mean I understand those 

283
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:01,250
emotions and understand them deeply and 
the intellectual mindset that goes along

284
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,770
with it,
but they just see beside the point to me

285
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:04,604
in some sense,
because there are so many things that 

286
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:07,154
need doing that all you really have to 
do is open your eyes and look at them 

287
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:13,070
and then decide that you're actually 
going to do something about them.

288
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,970
And you might think,
well,

289
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,700
what's within my scope of,
of,

290
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,060
of is so trivial that it's not worth 
doing.

291
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:23,990
It's like it won't stay trivial for long
if you do it not at all.

292
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:25,670
And I don't think it's trivial to begin 
with.

293
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,563
I don't think that any.
I really don't believe that anything 

294
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:28,964
done right is trivial.
And my experience in my life has been 

295
00:16:31,851 --> 00:16:32,684
that anything I actually did paid off it
did didn't pay off necessarily in the 

296
00:16:38,181 --> 00:16:40,940
way that I expected it to pay off.
That's a whole different story.

297
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,090
But if it was genuine commitment to do 
something,

298
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,133
even if it went sideways and the outcome
was really something other than what I 

299
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,344
expected,
the net consequence over time was 

300
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:50,984
nothing but good.
So every new frontier that can be 

301
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:55,934
conquered is an advance forward and 
there's no shortage of frontier because 

302
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,130
we're surrounded by the unknown.

303
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,963
We're surrounded by our own ignorance 
and we can continually move into that 

304
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:08,000
domain,
into the domain of chaos,

305
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,540
or we can restructure pathological order
and that's,

306
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,640
that's the secret to proper being.
And so then you encounter chaos.

307
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
That way you know,
and then you can regard yourself as the 

308
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:21,530
sort of entity that despite its 
insufficiency,

309
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,270
has the capability to conquer chaos.
Despite the danger of that.

310
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,104
That's the other thing,
because the fact that you're fragile is 

311
00:17:29,121 --> 00:17:31,280
actually a precondition for your 
heroism.

312
00:17:31,281 --> 00:17:32,114
Because if you weren't fragile,
then there'd be nothing heroic about 

313
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,180
doing something difficult.
Right?

314
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:36,014
Because if you couldn't be hurt or 
damaged or defeated or or end up in 

315
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,360
failure,
then where's the.

316
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,750
Where's the moral courage in the 
endeavor it has.

317
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:49,380
It has to be that the fragility is built
into the courage and so it's not a.

318
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,810
it's not a reason not to engage in it at
all.

319
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,080
In fact,
quite the contrary and so

320
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,640
well and so then you know what do you do
while you put the city back together and

321
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,474
maybe the way you want it so that it's 
functional and efficient and beautiful 

322
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,124
and so the people can flourish there and
and and flourish in a manner that makes 

323
00:18:10,851 --> 00:18:14,430
them like,
that makes them what w?

324
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,293
W,
what would you say that makes them feel 

325
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:22,181
that the unbearable catastrophe of being
is worth it for the experience.

326
00:18:22,671 --> 00:18:26,060
That's what you're aiming at and it's 
not an impossibility.

327
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,360
It's not an impossibility,
and then not only that,

328
00:18:29,361 --> 00:18:31,580
not only do you repair the city when you
do that,

329
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:32,414
but you make yourself the sort of thing 
that continually repairs the city and 

330
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,560
that's even better.
That's the end goal because it's not the

331
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:41,180
repair of the city.
That's the goal.

332
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:42,014
It's the transformation of yourself into
the thing that continually repairs the 

333
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,424
city and so there's just no reason for 
that not to happen and the more it can 

334
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:53,990
happen,
the better.

335
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,393
Well there's A.
There's an under current to this story 

336
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:01,544
and that is also the story of the flood 
and that's the fact that you know the 

337
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:06,074
city can become corrupt because people 
don't engage in heroic endeavor perhaps 

338
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,900
because they engage in precisely the 
opposite of that,

339
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,734
which is outright destructive behavior 
and this is also something that's worth 

340
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,950
considering too because if you.
If you,

341
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,340
if you consider your your own manner of 
being,

342
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,303
no,

343
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,550
you can say things to people like tell,
tell the truth and be good,

344
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,020
and those are.
Those are cliches obviously,

345
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:36,510
and so they lack power because they're 
cliches,

346
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,344
but you can take them apart and utilize 
them in a manner that stops being a 

347
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:45,750
cliche and you do that by being more 
humble about them.

348
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,643
I would say because maybe you can't tell
the truth because you don't know what 

349
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:49,914
the truth is,
but one thing you can do is you can 

350
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:54,750
start saying things that you know to be 
untrue and you might say,

351
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,550
well,
how do I know that they're untrue?

352
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,470
And the answer to that is,
well,

353
00:19:58,471 --> 00:19:59,304
you need a whole philosophy of truth.
The elaboration of an entire philosophy 

354
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:04,920
of truth to answer that question and so 
we're not going to bother answering that

355
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,960
question because in some sense at the 
moment,

356
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:09,000
it's beside the point that isn't the 
issue.

357
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,043
The issue is there are times in your 
life where you know that the thing that 

358
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,910
you're saying is not true.
It's a deception.

359
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,773
It's a lie of some sort and you're using
it to manipulate yourself or another 

360
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,510
person or the world and you're also 
possessed,

361
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,344
fully possessed of the idea that you can
get away with it and there's a satanic 

362
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,214
arrogance about that.
If in fact that is the archetypal 

363
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,860
arrogance that's portrayed in the 
mythological character of Satan.

364
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:36,861
Because Satan is precisely the archetype
of the element of the mind that believes

365
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,930
that it can twist.
And,

366
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,010
and banned the structure of reality 
without paying the price for that.

367
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,830
And you can't imagine anything that's 
more arrogant than not because really do

368
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,664
you really think that you can twist the 
structure of a reality and that that's 

369
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:54,400
going to work out for you without it 
snapping back.

370
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,560
It's so obvious that that can't work,
that,

371
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,660
that everyone knows it,
but anyways,

372
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:01,480
back to the initial point is that,
you know,

373
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,440
buy it by the rules of the game that 
you,

374
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:05,274
yourself are playing,
that some of the Times you're violating 

375
00:21:08,131 --> 00:21:10,530
the rules of the game that you're 
playing.

376
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,903
And the first issue with regards to say,
stating the truth or behaving in a 

377
00:21:16,741 --> 00:21:17,574
responsible manner would be merely 
stopped cheating at whatever game it is 

378
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,004
that you've chosen to play.
That's a good start and that'll 

379
00:21:26,011 --> 00:21:28,230
straightened.
That'll straighten out your life.

380
00:21:28,231 --> 00:21:30,600
It'll start in the street and start to 
straighten out your life.

381
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,093
And so

382
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,610
well the flood.
What?

383
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,590
How does the flood tie into this?
Well,

384
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,483
you know,
we live in a corrupt structure were 

385
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,030
corrupt as individuals.
We live in a corrupt structure,

386
00:21:42,031 --> 00:21:44,460
and part of that corruption has just 
happenstance.

387
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,294
It's the way things fall apart,
but the other part of it is that not 

388
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:51,840
only are we not aiming up,
we're actually aiming down and the flood

389
00:21:51,841 --> 00:21:52,674
story is a warning and it's a very clear
warning and the warning is if you aim 

390
00:21:56,491 --> 00:22:01,230
down enough and then if enough of you 
aim down at the same time,

391
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,340
everything will degenerate into 
something that's

392
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,220
indistinguishable from the chaos from 
which things emerged at the beginning of

393
00:22:11,221 --> 00:22:13,160
time.
It's something like that because the,

394
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,103
the,
the cosmos that's presented in in 

395
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:18,690
mythological representations is chaos 
versus order.

396
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:19,980
Right?
The order is on top.

397
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:20,814
You might say in the chaos is always 
underneath and the chaos can break 

398
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:24,114
through or the order can crumble and you
can fall into the chaos and that chaos 

399
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:28,860
is intermingled,
intermingled potential,

400
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,100
and the way that you destroy the order 
and let the chaos rise back up,

401
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:36,840
which is exactly how it's portrayed in 
the flood story,

402
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:37,943
is by

403
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,860
well,
by inhabiting the corpse of your father.

404
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:42,694
That's one mythological motif and 
feeding on the remains and with no 

405
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:51,451
gratitude and no attempt to replenish 
what it is that you're taking from.

406
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,643
And the warning and the flood story is 
don't do that for very long because 

407
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:00,880
things will happen that are so awful,
you cannot possibly imagine it,

408
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,043
and that'll happen to you personally and
what happened to your family and it'll 

409
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:04,774
happen to your community.
And it's happened to people over and 

410
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,430
over throughout history.
And it's.

411
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,070
It's quite interesting.
You know it's.

412
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,650
It's very soon after the story of Cain 
and Abel.

413
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,580
When you see evil enter the world in the
story of Adam and Eve,

414
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,780
along with self consciousness and evil,
there is the ability.

415
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,500
That's the knowledge of good and evil.
That's the ability to hurt other people,

416
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,540
self-consciously,
to know what you're doing.

417
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,530
And then of course instantly cane takes 
that to the absolute extreme and he uses

418
00:23:29,531 --> 00:23:33,820
that capacity to,
to destroy really what he loves best.

419
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:37,120
He,
he gets as close as a human being can to

420
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:40,120
destroying the divine ideal because of 
course his brother is able,

421
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,090
enable,
is favored by God and and destroys them.

422
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:47,390
Which cane tells God at the end of that 
episode that his punishment is more than

423
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,030
he can bear.
And I think the reason for that is where

424
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:54,320
are you once you destroy your own ideal,
what's left for you?

425
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,650
There's nowhere to go.
There's no APP,

426
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,693
and when there's no APP,
there's a lot of down and you know 

427
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:06,140
there's an idea that was put forth very 
nicely in Milton's paradise lost when he

428
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:09,290
was describing from a psychological 
perspective.

429
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,620
Essentially what hell is hell is your 
inhale to the degree that you're distant

430
00:24:16,101 --> 00:24:16,934
from the good,
that that might be a good way of 

431
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:19,490
thinking about it.

432
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,323
And if you destroy your own ideal,
which you do with jealousy and 

433
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,590
resentment and and the desire to pull 
down people who you would like to be,

434
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,424
let's say,
then you end up in a situation that's 

435
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:33,590
indistinguishable from hell.
And the way the story,

436
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:35,460
the biblical story unfolds as well.
It's,

437
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,810
it's,
it's Cain and then it's the flood.

438
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,730
And so kane adopts this mode of being 
that's antithetical to being itself,

439
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,110
at least a positive being itself.
He does it voluntarily,

440
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,830
he does it knowing full well what he's 
doing.

441
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,083
And the net consequence of this,
that as it ripples through the entire 

442
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:56,360
social structure,
is that God stands back and says,

443
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,223
this whole thing has got so bad,
the only thing we can do is wipe it to 

444
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,700
the ground.
And that is,

445
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,300
that is no joke.
That's exactly how things work.

446
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,433
And one of the things that's 
extraordinarily terrifying about that 

447
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:10,910
sequence of stories,
and I believe this to be true,

448
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,803
I think I realized this independently of
any of the analysis that I was doing of 

449
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:17,084
mythological stories because I looked at
what happened in places like the Soviet 

450
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,223
Union and in Mao's China and in Nazi 
Germany and the most penetrating 

451
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,690
observers of those societies.

452
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,523
The people who are most interested in 
how it was that those absolute 

453
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:33,950
catastrophes came about,
all said the same thing.

454
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,660
It was rooted in the degeneration of the
individuals who made up the society.

455
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,160
You know,
you hear well,

456
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:42,230
people will fault were following orders.
It's like,

457
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:42,811
no,
that,

458
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:46,640
that explanation doesn't hold water or 
that you'd be punished if you resisted.

459
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:47,810
Well,
there was some truth in that,

460
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:49,580
but nowhere near as much as people might
think,

461
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:50,414
especially at the beginning of the 
process more it was that people decided 

462
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:54,794
each and every one of them to turn a 
blind eye to the catastrophes and to 

463
00:25:57,621 --> 00:26:01,760
participate in the lies and that worked 
the entire societies and they went,

464
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,594
as you know,
they,

465
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,643
they veered their way downward to 
something as closely approximating hell 

466
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,114
as you could hope to manage,
especially in places like Nazi Germany 

467
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:13,520
and well in all three of those places 
and in Mao's,

468
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:14,354
China and the Soviet Union,
and so the thing that's so frightening 

469
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:18,014
about,
one of the things that's so frightening 

470
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:22,580
about the stories in genesis is they say
something very clear,

471
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,414
which is that your moral degeneration 
contributes in no small way to the 

472
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:31,910
degeneration of the entire cosmos and 
you say,

473
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:35,090
well,
I would like my life to be meaningful.

474
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,850
People say that really?
Would you really?

475
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,740
You really would like your life to be 
meaningful.

476
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:43,100
You think maybe people would trade a 
little nihilism to not have to face that

477
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,720
realization,
and I think people do that all the time.

478
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,080
It's a terrible wait to to to realize,
but we are networked together in that.

479
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,140
That's the price of or let's say that's 
the vulnerability that's associated with

480
00:26:58,141 --> 00:26:58,974
our intense capacity to communicate and 
it is certainly possible that the 

481
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,363
ripples of our individual actions have 
consequences that are far beyond the 

482
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:14,370
limits of our immediate consciousness 
and I also think people know that too.

483
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:18,750
They know that in the way that people 
know things when they don't want to know

484
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:20,640
them,
which means they know them,

485
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,110
embodied,
they can feel them,

486
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:24,510
they can sense them.
They have an emotional response to them,

487
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,493
but there's no damn way they're going to
let them become articulate because they 

488
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:28,374
don't want to know and when you're 
feeling guilty and ashamed about the 

489
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,244
things you've done or not done,
and I know that can get out of hand as 

490
00:27:34,621 --> 00:27:35,310
well.

491
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,143
It's often because there is a crooked 
little part of you that's aiming at the 

492
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,610
worst possible outcome.
You know,

493
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,800
one of the things you said about the 
shadow,

494
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:44,634
you know,
that famous idea that everyone has a 

495
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:50,070
dark side and that that dark side needs 
to be incorporated and made conscious.

496
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,660
Young said to the shadow of the human 
being,

497
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,780
reaches all the way to hell,
and he actually,

498
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:58,763
that's the thing that's so interesting 
about interesting about reading Carl 

499
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:04,500
young is he actually means what he says.
It's not a metaphor.

500
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:05,334
It's like the part of you that's twisted
against being is aligned with the part 

501
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,173
of the cosmos.
Let's say the conscious cosmos that's 

502
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:19,500
aiming at making everything as terrible 
as it can possibly be and you know,

503
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,334
it's a terrible shock to realize that.
It's partly why people don't realize 

504
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,700
that it's something that people keep at 
an arm's length.

505
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,040
It's,
it's the same as recognizing yourself as

506
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,874
a Nazi concentration camp guard,
which is a very useful exercise because 

507
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,330
there's absolutely no reason why you 
couldn't have been or still could be one

508
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,160
so.
And if you think otherwise,

509
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:41,994
then all the more reason for assuming 
that you would be unable to resist the 

510
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:48,250
temptation if it wasn't in fact offered 
to you.

511
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:49,840
And if you don't think it's a 
temptation,

512
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,943
then

513
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,093
the then there's so much that you don't 
know about human beings that you're not 

514
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:57,650
even in the game.
Because if it wasn't a temptation,

515
00:28:57,651 --> 00:28:59,420
then people bloody well wouldn't have 
done it.

516
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,240
And plenty of people did it.
And it's no wonder.

517
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,750
So.
So things get serious in genesis very,

518
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,310
very rapidly.
And,

519
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,710
and the depth of the seriousness is 
ultimate archetipal.

520
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:18,650
That's it.
It gets as serious as it can get.

521
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:27,570
The story of Noah and the flood opens in
a fragmentary manner.

522
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:32,290
And I believe that these passages are 
part of a longer story,

523
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:37,291
that we only have bits and pieces of it.
And also one that's fragmented in its in

524
00:29:37,481 --> 00:29:38,314
its,

525
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,103
it's parts of than one story.
And it starts like this and it came to 

526
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:45,424
pass.
When men began to multiply on the face 

527
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:47,314
of the earth and daughters were born 
unto them that the sons of God saw the 

528
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:52,384
daughters of men,
that they were fair and they took them 

529
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:58,120
wives of all which they chose.
Now there's an idea there.

530
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,733
There's two ways of looking at the past 
and you can kind of see that in in the 

531
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,644
political landscape that we inhabit now 
on the more conservative end of the 

532
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:09,424
spectrum,
people regard the past as the land of 

533
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,190
giants,
right?

534
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,063
They were the heroes of the past who 
established the current conditions that 

535
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:16,984
we exist and then the people on the left
are more concerned perhaps with the 

536
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,830
what,
what would you call it,

537
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:24,664
with a lineage of corruption that's come
down through the centuries and both of 

538
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:29,230
those perspectives are are are accurate.

539
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,063
You can say,
well,

540
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,053
there were there,
there were the great heroes of the past 

541
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:34,774
who established our modes of being.
You can think of them as competent 

542
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,350
beings if you want.
That's fine.

543
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,330
That's a perfectly reasonable way of 
thinking about it,

544
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,370
and you can also think of the of the 
accumulation of corruption and evil.

545
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:46,204
That's come along the centuries as well,
and so you see both of those reflected 

546
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:52,210
in these initial few lines that the sons
of gods,

547
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:55,210
so those are the heroes saw the 
daughters of men that they were fair and

548
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:57,670
they took them wives of all of which 
they chose.

549
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,050
Then this
statement

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,790
comes in as somewhat of a non sequitur 
and the Lord said,

551
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:10,480
my spirit shall not always strive with 
man for that he is also flesh,

552
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,643
yet his days shall be 120 years,
and I looked at a variety of 

553
00:31:15,191 --> 00:31:16,024
interpretations of that line because it 
doesn't seem to follow so clearly from 

554
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:22,300
the previous line and and exactly what 
it means isn't obvious,

555
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,134
but it seems to be the first line talks 
about the heroes of the past and and 

556
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,090
this.

557
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,370
The second line says,
well,

558
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,253
wait a second.
There's something corrupt about the 

559
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,324
human mode of being,
and one of the consequences of that as 

560
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:41,920
far as God is concerned,
is that there are conditions under which

561
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,880
the divine spirit will not strive with.
Man.

562
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,743
What?
What that means is there are conditions 

563
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,084
under which let's say the.
I don't think there's any other way of 

564
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:54,723
putting it is the divine impulse towards
the good will abandon you because of 

565
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:59,164
things that you've done,
and then the secondary consideration 

566
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:06,340
here is that perhaps because of the disc
degeneration of people,

567
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,100
it's not so obvious here that our 
lifespans are limited,

568
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,973
that the,
that the spirit that inhabits us will 

569
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,144
only do so for a limited amount of time 
and that's tangled in a strange way in 

570
00:32:17,051 --> 00:32:17,884
with the idea of human moral culpability
and that's posed against the notion of 

571
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:22,684
the giants of the past,
and then it returns to the giant idea 

572
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,000
that narrative returns to the giant idea
and reads.

573
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,780
There were giants in the earth in those 
days and also after that,

574
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:32,614
when the sons of men came in unto the 
daughters of men and they bare children 

575
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:37,690
to them,
the same became mighty men which were of

576
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:39,470
old men of renown.

577
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,410
And that that's the end of that sequence
of fragments.

578
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:46,760
It's very
broken,

579
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,030
but you can see a dual narrative 
underneath it.

580
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,073
And,
and one of the narratives is that 

581
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,510
there's the kind of corruption,
despite the giant,

582
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,643
the nature of the giants of the past,
there's the kind of corruption lurking 

583
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,740
that would cause God to withhold his 
grace and allow men to deteriorate.

584
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,030
And that sets the stage for Noah and the
flood.

585
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,960
And God saw that the wickedness of man 
was great in the earth and that the,

586
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,853
and that every imagination of the 
thoughts of his heart was only evil 

587
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,530
continually.
You know,

588
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,420
one of the things I really didn't like 
about going to church when I was a kid,

589
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,390
I went to a pretty moderate church.
It was the United Church,

590
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,340
which has hardly even become a church 
now.

591
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,190
It's so moderate,
so to speak.

592
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,883
One of the things I didn't like was the 
constant harping by the ministry on the 

593
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,430
sinful nature of human beings like it,
it didn't speak to me properly,

594
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:51,440
partly because I really didn't 
understand what it meant.

595
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,140
Um,
and partly because it seemed

596
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,970
well sort of,
what would you say was self-flagellating

597
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:01,804
in an attractive way?
I don't know if there is an attractive 

598
00:34:04,451 --> 00:34:06,690
way to be self-flagellating,
but there was.

599
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,713
It was and there was something about it 
that was also wrote and fake that I 

600
00:34:12,401 --> 00:34:14,050
didn't like,
but you know,

601
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,363
in later years I thought about that more
and I started to understand that there 

602
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:23,731
was some real utility in asking people 
to keep the evil that they're doing

603
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,730
clear and conscious in the forefront of 
their imagination.

604
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:30,923
I think I mentioned to you guys last 
week that this little episode from what 

605
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:38,610
we know of Mesopotamian culture 
surrounding the emperor,

606
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,653
the New Year's festival,
they would take the emperor outside of 

607
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:44,550
the walled city and strip him of his

608
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,863
garb so that he was reduced to just an 
ordinary man and then humiliate them 

609
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:51,874
richly and then ask him how it was over 
the last year that he wasn't a 

610
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:57,784
spectacular embodiment of Marduk.
Marduk was the Mesopotamian daddy who 

611
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,893
made order out of chaos essentially,
and the emperor is supposed to sit and 

612
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:05,141
think,
okay,

613
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:06,450
well,
you know,

614
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,830
I'm emperor and everything.
I should be doing a good job.

615
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:09,664
Maybe I should even be doing a great job
and probably I'm coming up short and a 

616
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:13,744
bunch of ways and that actually happens 
to be important since I'm running the 

617
00:35:15,821 --> 00:35:17,950
entire show.
I should be very,

618
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:18,784
very cognizant of how I'm failing to 
live up to the ideal and that is what 

619
00:35:24,221 --> 00:35:28,000
that call that constant clarion call 
that's degenerated,

620
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,040
I would say an institutional 
Christianity.

621
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,320
That was actually the idea was,
look,

622
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:33,154
there's a bunch of ways that you're not 
being everything you could be and it is 

623
00:35:36,251 --> 00:35:39,270
not supposed to be a to to to knock you 
down.

624
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,210
Although maybe it's a whip to knock down
your pride.

625
00:35:42,211 --> 00:35:44,910
The pride that stops you from being 
aware of your insufficiencies.

626
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:48,510
It's more like a call to the opposite.
It's like,

627
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,673
well,
you should stop doing those things 

628
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:54,120
because you could be so much more than 
you are and that would be so much better

629
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,830
for you and everyone else.
That is just.

630
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,890
It's just not good that you continue 
doing these things.

631
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,170
Continue Breaking your own rules,
let's say,

632
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,740
because we could certainly,
as I said,

633
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:05,574
we could start this game by assuming 
that you should at least play the game 

634
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,364
that you're playing straight and so and 
it is the case that if you watch 

635
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:16,080
yourself,
it's a terrifying thing to do.

636
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,250
But if you watch yourself,
you'll see you lie a lot.

637
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,480
Like when I learned this to begin with,
I was in my twenties and I was.

638
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,403
I'm a smart person and I was very proud 
of that because I was also a small 

639
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,120
person.
I was moved ahead one year in school and

640
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,800
I was a small person

641
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:36,583
to begin with and so as a very small 
person in my classes and also very 

642
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:40,934
mouthy,
which might not come as much of a 

643
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:45,470
surprise and somewhat provocative and so
you know,

644
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:48,890
and I got pushed around a fair bit 
because everybody gets pushed around and

645
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:51,530
my weapon was to be mouthy and it was a 
fairly effective weapon.

646
00:36:51,531 --> 00:36:53,820
Although it tended to backfire because 
you know,

647
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,080
if you're really effectively mouthy with
large,

648
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:57,914
obnoxious people,
then they tend to respond in a 

649
00:37:00,231 --> 00:37:01,064
relatively negative physical way.
And so that sort of thing was happening 

650
00:37:03,741 --> 00:37:04,574
to me a fair bit and but I was quite,
I was quite proud of the fact that I 

651
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:10,190
was,
that I,

652
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,620
I was,
I had some intellectual power

653
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,563
and

654
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,233
Darren,
it was then in my twenties when I 

655
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:19,094
learned about some of the danger of that
because I started to read partly 

656
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:25,880
Milton's paradise lost and I started to 
understand the,

657
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,123
the,
the danger of the intellect and the 

658
00:37:29,151 --> 00:37:29,984
danger of the intellect as far as I can 
tell is that it tends towards pride and 

659
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:36,110
arrogance and it also tends to fall in 
love with its own productions.

660
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,180
And so that's actually Lucifer in,
in,

661
00:37:38,181 --> 00:37:39,320
in,
in paradise lost.

662
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:40,154
That's Lucifer.
Lucifer is the intellect that falls in 

663
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:42,674
love with its own productions and then 
assumes that there's nothing outside of 

664
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,830
what it thinks.
That's the totalitarian mentality,

665
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,693
right?
It's like we have a total system and we 

666
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:52,034
know how everything works and we're 
gonna implement it and that'll bring 

667
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:55,820
about heaven on earth.
Right?

668
00:37:55,821 --> 00:37:56,654
That's that say that.
That's the totalitarian mindset and 

669
00:37:59,391 --> 00:38:03,410
that's associated with intellectual 
arrogance and

670
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,900
another at the same time.
Another thing that was happening to me,

671
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:09,734
so I was noticing that I started to 
understand what that meant and I also 

672
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:16,910
started to understand that there was 
more to life than the intellect,

673
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:17,923
much more because I smoked too much and 
I drank too much and I weighed like 130 

674
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:23,670
pounds.
I wasn't in good physical shape and like

675
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,703
I had a lot of things to do when I went 
to graduate school to put myself 

676
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:27,854
together.
And at the same time I was trying to 

677
00:38:28,911 --> 00:38:32,990
understand why things had gone so 
crazily wrong with the world.

678
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,240
It's encapsulation in the cold and what 
role I might be playing in that,

679
00:38:37,241 --> 00:38:38,074
if any,
or what role any of us were playing in 

680
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:40,640
that.
Um,

681
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,510
at the same time I was working at a 
prison only a little bit.

682
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,040
I worked with this crazy psychologist.

683
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,440
Um,
he,

684
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,050
he used to put jokes on is multiple 
choice tests.

685
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,300
Uh,
he was a really eccentric guy,

686
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,134
but I really liked his courses.
He and he taught a course on creativity 

687
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:03,604
and he was also a prison psychologist 
and he was an eccentric guy and he for 

688
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,840
some reason liked me and maybe because I
was eccentric to and he invited me to go

689
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:13,600
out to the Edmonton maximum security 
prison with them a couple of times,

690
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,434
which I did.
And that was a very interesting 

691
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:17,770
experience because I was trying to 
figure out

692
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,843
what role each individual's behavior 
bore to the pathology of the group with 

693
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:28,234
something like that.
And I went out there and I met a little 

694
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,400
guy smaller than me.
I was a little bigger by then and he was

695
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:39,010
a pretty innocuous guy.
And uh,

696
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,250
what had happened was I was out in this 
gymnasium,

697
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,080
it looks like a high school,
the prison,

698
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,210
which is really quite telling in my 
estimation,

699
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,044
but,
and there were all these like monsters 

700
00:39:49,061 --> 00:39:51,130
in their weight lifting and like they 
were monsters.

701
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:51,963
I remember one guy who was tattooed 
everywhere and he had like a huge scar 

702
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:54,934
running down the middle of his chest.
It looked like someone had to hit them 

703
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:58,110
with an ax and you know,
and,

704
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,013
and I was in there and I had this Weird 
Cape that I used to wear that I bought 

705
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:04,040
in Portugal and some boots that went 
along with it and

706
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,850
yeah,
it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape

707
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:10,684
and it was really like,
it was from the eighties and nineties 

708
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:14,080
because this little village was up on a 
hill.

709
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,480
It was a walled city on a hill and they 
sold these things and I don't think they

710
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:18,314
changed the style since 1890.
And so I thought they were really cool 

711
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,560
and so I was wearing that,
which wasn't perhaps the most

712
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:30,150
conservative garb
to dawn if you're going to wear,

713
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,590
if you're going to go to a maximum 
security prison.

714
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,423
So anyways,
I was in the gymnasium and the 

715
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,303
psychologist,
the psychologist left and God only 

716
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,450
knows.
I mean that's what he was like.

717
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:43,900
And all these guys came or all these 
guys came around me,

718
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:44,734
you know,
and they were offering to trade their 

719
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:51,300
prison clothes for my cape and he was 
like,

720
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,010
I was being made an offer.
I couldn't refuse,

721
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:54,880
you know,
and so I didn't,

722
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,073
I didn't really know what to do and then
this little guy said something like 

723
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,293
that,
the psychologist sent me to come and 

724
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,060
take you away or something like that.
And so I thought,

725
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:08,110
well better this little guy then all 
these monsters.

726
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:12,850
So we went outside the gym through some 
doors,

727
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,420
like school doors.
We had outside the gym into the exercise

728
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:17,254
yard I guess,
and we're wandering along and he was 

729
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:20,710
talking to me and he seemed like a kind 
of an innocuous guy.

730
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:25,000
And then the psychologist showed up at 
the door and motioned us back and so,

731
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,163
which was kind of a relief.
And so I went into his office and he 

732
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:29,291
said,
you know,

733
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,000
that guy that you walked out in the yard
with?

734
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:31,661
And I said,
yeah.

735
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:33,130
He said he,
uh,

736
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,663
he took two cops one night and he had 
them kneel down and while they were 

737
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:38,354
begging for their lives,
he shot them both in the back of the 

738
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:41,054
head.

739
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,010
And I thought,
hmm.

740
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,313
That's.

741
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,873
See,
the thing that was so interesting was 

742
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:51,150
that he was so innocuous,
right?

743
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:54,960
Because what you'd hope is that someone 
like that would be very much unlike you,

744
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,823
let's say,
and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat 

745
00:41:57,661 --> 00:42:00,840
innocuous that you'd met.
What you'd want is that the guy would be

746
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:01,440
like,
you know,

747
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,220
half war wolf and half vampire so you 
could just tell right away that he was a

748
00:42:05,221 --> 00:42:06,960
cold blooded killer.
But no,

749
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:11,961
he was this sort of ineffectual little 
guy who was certainly not ineffectual if

750
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:13,890
you gave him a revolver and the upper 
hand.

751
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,820
And so.
So that made me think that made me think

752
00:42:17,821 --> 00:42:22,560
a lot about the relationship between 
being innocuous and being dangerous.

753
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:23,394
And then another thing happened.
I met another guy out there and then a 

754
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:31,050
week or two later I heard that he and a 
friend of his head held another guy down

755
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,950
and pulverized his left leg with a lead 
pipe,

756
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,800
like just pulverized it.

757
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,843
And the reason for that was that they 
thought that he was a snitch and maybe 

758
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:41,904
he was.
And that that time I did something 

759
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:47,310
different instead of being shocked and 
horrified by that.

760
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,290
Although I certainly was.
I thought,

761
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:53,130
how in the world could you do that?
Because I didn't think I could do that,

762
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,450
hey,
I didn't think that.

763
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,403
I thought that there was a qualitative 
distinction between me and those people 

764
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,233
and so I spent about two weeks trying to
see if I could figure out under what 

765
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:05,964
conditions I could do that,
like what kind of psychological 

766
00:43:08,401 --> 00:43:11,370
transformation I would have to undergo 
to be able to do that.

767
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:14,280
And so that was a meditative exercise,
let's say,

768
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:19,290
and it only took about 10 days for me to
realize that not only could I do that,

769
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,510
that it would be a hell of a lot easier 
than I thought it would be.

770
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,823
And that sort of where that wall between
me and what you describe is the shadow 

771
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,920
started to fall apart and that also was 
very useful because I started to read.

772
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,153
I started to treat myself as somewhat 
different entity because I hadn't been 

773
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:36,960
aware up to that point,
you know,

774
00:43:36,961 --> 00:43:37,794
because I thought I was a good guy and 
there's no reason for me to think that 

775
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,680
because you're not a good guy unless you
really made a bloody effort to be a good

776
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:44,880
guy.
You're just not.

777
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:45,953
It's not easy and so you're probably a 
moderately bad guy and that's a long 

778
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,650
ways from being an absolutely horrible 
guy,

779
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:55,680
but it's also a long ways from being a 
good guy and so,

780
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:56,723
but I had a little more respect for 
myself after that because I also 

781
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:04,161
understood that through is a monstrous 
element to the human psyche that re that

782
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,323
you needed to respect and that was part 
of you that you should regard yourself 

783
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:11,514
in some sense as a loaded weapon.
It's very useful around children to 

784
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,430
regard yourself as a loaded weapon 
because around children you are a loaded

785
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:18,264
weapon and the terrible experiences that
many children have with their parents 

786
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,190
are testament to that.

787
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,953
Anyways,

788
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,593
about the same time,
and I don't exactly know how these 

789
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:32,274
things were causally related.
I guess it was because I was trying to 

790
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:39,650
figure out
who I was and how that could be fixed.

791
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,673
Something like that.
I started to pay very careful attention 

792
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:44,124
to what I was saying.
I don't know if that happened 

793
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,754
voluntarily or involuntarily,
but I could feel it sort of split 

794
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:50,664
developing in my psyche and the split 
and I've actually had students tell me 

795
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:54,474
the same thing has happened to them 
after they've listened to some of the 

796
00:44:58,201 --> 00:45:01,140
material that,
that I've been describing to all of you,

797
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,940
but split into two,
let's say.

798
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,613
And one part was the,
let's say the old me that was talking a 

799
00:45:10,921 --> 00:45:11,754
lot and that liked to argue in that 
liked ideas and there was another part 

800
00:45:16,861 --> 00:45:17,694
that was watching that part,
like just with it's eyes open and 

801
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,313
neutrally judging and the part that was 
neutrally judging was watching the part 

802
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:29,850
that was talking and going,
that isn't your idea.

803
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,500
You don't really believe that you don't 
really know what you're talking about.

804
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,440
That isn't true.
And I thought,

805
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,700
hmm,
that's really interesting.

806
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:39,534
So now I've.
And that was happening to like 95 

807
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:43,470
percent of what I was saying and so then
I didn't really know what to do.

808
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:44,161
I thought,
okay,

809
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:47,550
this is strange,
so maybe I've fragmented and that's just

810
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:49,200
not a good thing at all.
I mean,

811
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,760
it wasn't like I was hearing voices or 
anything like that.

812
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:53,040
I mean,
it wasn't like that.

813
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:55,110
It was,
it was.

814
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,810
Well,
people have multiple parts,

815
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,900
so then I had a weird conundrum.
It's like,

816
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,450
well,
which of those two things are me?

817
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,240
Is it the part that's listening and 
saying,

818
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,220
no,
that's rubbish.

819
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,083
That's a lie.
That's you're doing that to impress 

820
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,410
people.
You're just trying to win the argument,

821
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,244
you know,
was that me or was the part that was 

822
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:18,750
going about my normal verbal business?

823
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:22,350
Me and I didn't know,
but I decided I would go with the critic

824
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,560
and then what I tried to do,
what I learned to do I think was to stop

825
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:28,404
saying things that made me weak and now 
that I mean I'm still trying to do that 

826
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:38,241
because I'm always feeling when I talk,
whether or not the words that I'm saying

827
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:41,850
are either making me align or making me 
come apart,

828
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,690
and I think the alignment.
I really do think the alignment is.

829
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:46,763
I think alignment is the right way of 
conceptualizing it because I think if 

830
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:52,350
you say things that are as true as you 
can say them,

831
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:55,560
let's say,
then they come up,

832
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,023
they come out of the depths inside of 
you because we don't know where it 

833
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:02,470
thoughts come from.
We don't know how far down into your sub

834
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:04,020
structure,
the thoughts emerge.

835
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,913
We don't know what processes have 
physiological alignment are necessary 

836
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,440
for you to speak from the core of your 
being.

837
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,080
We don't understand any of that.
We don't even conceptualize that,

838
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,680
but I believe that you can feel that and
I learned some of that from reading Carl

839
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,071
Rogers,
by the way,

840
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:17,904
who's a great clinician because he 
talked about mental health in part as a 

841
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:23,470
coherence between the,
the,

842
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,453
the spiritual or the or the abstract and
the physical that the two things were 

843
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:28,644
aligned and,
and there's a lot of idea of alignment 

844
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:34,360
in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.
But anyways,

845
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:35,194
I decided that I would start practicing 
not saying things that would make me 

846
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:42,310
weak.
And what happened was that I had to stop

847
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:44,910
saying almost everything that I was 
sick.

848
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,820
I would say 95 percent of it as a hell 
of a shock to wake up,

849
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,673
and this was over a few months,
but it's a hell of a shock to wake up 

850
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,540
and realize that you're mostly dead 
wood.

851
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,420
It's a shock,
you know,

852
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,171
and you might think,
well,

853
00:47:59,171 --> 00:48:00,820
do you really want all of that to burn 
off?

854
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,301
It's like,
well,

855
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,830
there's nothing left,
but a little husk,

856
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:04,210
five percent of you.
It's like,

857
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:07,870
well,
if that five percent is solid,

858
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,010
then maybe that's exactly what you want 
to have happen.

859
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,713
Well,
so I told you that story is an 

860
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:15,664
elaboration of this line,
and God saw that the wickedness of man 

861
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:18,454
was great in the earth and that every 
imagine have the imagination of the 

862
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,514
thoughts of his heart was only evil 
continually to question worth asking 

863
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,290
just exactly what are your motives?
Well,

864
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:30,213
you know,
maybe they're purer than mine were and 

865
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,614
it's certainly possible.
I don't think that I'm naturally a 

866
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:37,900
particularly good person.
I think I have to work at it very,

867
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:41,800
very hard and I don't necessarily think 
that everyone is like that,

868
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,700
but some people are worse than that and 
everyone's like that to some degree.

869
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,580
So it's worth thinking about just how 
much trouble are you trying to cause,

870
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,443
you know,
and the other thing you might think 

871
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:57,724
about is that if you're not doing 
something important with your life by 

872
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:00,724
your own definition,
because that's the game that we're 

873
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,274
playing,
you get to define the terms at least 

874
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:07,900
initially,
maybe you're prone to cause trouble just

875
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:08,734
because you don't have anything better 
to do because at least it's trouble is 

876
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,110
more interesting than boring.
You know,

877
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:16,120
that's something you learn if you read 
Dostoevsky.

878
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:18,250
Dostoevsky knew that extraordinarily 
well.

879
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,473
And so if you're not doing something,
if you're not pushing yourself to the 

880
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,790
limits of your capacity,
then you have plenty of leftover.

881
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,100
Um,
what would you say?

882
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,193
Willpower,
energy and resources to devote to 

883
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,310
causing interesting trouble.
And so well.

884
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,910
So I would say this is also an 
archetypal scenario.

885
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,043
God saw that the wickedness of man was 
great in the earth and that every 

886
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:43,360
imagination of the thoughts of his heart
was only evil continually.

887
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,363
That's something to meditate on
and it's not self destructive because 

888
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:53,080
what it is is an attempt to.
It's like the diagnosis of an illness.

889
00:49:53,081 --> 00:49:56,560
It's like if that does happen to be the 
case for you or to some degree,

890
00:49:56,561 --> 00:49:58,390
maybe it's only 10 percent of you or 
something,

891
00:49:58,391 --> 00:49:59,224
or maybe it's 90 percent,
well then coming to terms with that is 

892
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:02,854
excellent because then maybe you can 
stop doing it and what would be the 

893
00:50:06,011 --> 00:50:09,700
downside to that?
You'd have to give up your resentment,

894
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,380
obviously in your hatred and all of 
that,

895
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:13,870
and that's really annoying because those
emotions are very.

896
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:14,963
They're easy to engage in in there and 
they're engaging and they have this 

897
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:22,270
feeling of self righteousness with them 
and that goes along with them.

898
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,253
But
you're not doing this in order to put 

899
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:26,344
yourself down.
You're doing this in order to separate 

900
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:29,204
the wheat from the chaff and to leave 
everything that you don't have to be 

901
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:32,923
behind

902
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,750
and it repented the Lord that he had 
made.

903
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:43,760
Man on the earth and it grieved him at 
his heart,

904
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,100
and the Lord said,
I will destroy man,

905
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:48,050
whom I've created from the face of the 
earth,

906
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,393
both man and beast and the creeping 
thing and the fowls of the air for 

907
00:50:51,531 --> 00:50:53,330
repentance.
Me That I've made them.

908
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,550
What's the idea?
Well,

909
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:59,330
the idea is that the cosmos that God 
created had become corrupt.

910
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,643
And that's a funny thing because you 
know this is the other thing about 

911
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:07,460
genesis that always hits me,
is that that's also true.

912
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,450
I told you that the Mesopotamians 
believed that human beings were made out

913
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,900
of the blood of king,
knew who was the worst monster monster.

914
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:19,100
That the dragon of chaos could imagine.
That's a pretty harsh diagnosis,

915
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:19,934
but.
But the reason the Mesopotamians 

916
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:25,340
believed that is because they knew as 
did the authors of Genesis,

917
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:30,290
that human beings are the only creatures
in the cosmos.

918
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,880
Let's say the cosmos of being who are 
actually capable of deceit,

919
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,860
conscious deceit,
and malevolence.

920
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,653
And the question is,
to what degree does the expression of 

921
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:46,391
that conscious deceit and malevolence 
corrupt things so badly that it would be

922
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:48,740
better that they didn't exist?
At all,

923
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,240
well,
you see stories,

924
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:56,500
there's a story associated with this in 
the epic of Gilgamesh,

925
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,334
associated with the flood that has 
exactly the same underlying narrative 

926
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:00,761
structure.
In fact,

927
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,860
some people think the story of Noah was 
derived from it,

928
00:52:02,861 --> 00:52:03,694
where the gods who created repented of 
their creation and determined that 

929
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,233
erasing it would be better than allowing
it to propagate and you see the same 

930
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:18,331
thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth,
Enuma elish because the early gods,

931
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,330
so they're representatives of,
of the giants of humanity,

932
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:27,331
I would say make so much noise in are so
careless that the original creator God,

933
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:29,134
time out in her concert tie,
Matt decides to wipe them from the face 

934
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:34,390
of the earth.
And so

935
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:39,943
when you read something like this,
if you read it from an informed 

936
00:52:42,831 --> 00:52:43,664
historical perspective,
it starts to have a depth that makes it 

937
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,630
transcend the sort of archaic and fairy 
tale like element of the story.

938
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:54,104
It's like
I've read some very terrible things 

939
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:57,644
about what happened in Nazi Germany and 
what happened when the Japanese invaded 

940
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,450
China on just what happened generally in
the history of mankind and

941
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,283
things can get so bad that it takes the 
imagination of a very bad person to 

942
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:17,530
conceptualize them and when they get 
that bad,

943
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,230
this is the only kind of language that 
works to describe them.

944
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:21,683
You know?
That's another thing that I've 

945
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,733
discovered working with my clinical 
clients is when their lives are really 

946
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,640
not going well.
You know,

947
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,493
when they're close to suicide or when 
they're close to homicide or when there 

948
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,504
are things going on in the family that 
are so corrupt and terrible that they 

949
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:39,864
reached back generations and they're 
aimed at nothing but misery and 

950
00:53:42,241 --> 00:53:43,074
destruction.
The only language that suffices has a 

951
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:50,640
religious tone because there's nothing 
else that's available to describe what's

952
00:53:50,641 --> 00:53:53,010
happening with the proper level of 
seriousness,

953
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:54,143
and it might be that you've never 
encountered a situation that required 

954
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,044
that level of seriousness,
but that doesn't mean that those 

955
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,160
situations don't exist.

956
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,993
They exist.
You generally do everything you can to 

957
00:54:05,941 --> 00:54:06,774
avoid being ensconced in them,
but they certainly do exist in the 

958
00:54:09,721 --> 00:54:12,720
probability that you'll encounter a 
situation like that or two,

959
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,270
at some point in your life is 
extraordinarily high.

960
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,343
You'll tangle with someone who's 
malevolent right to the core and maybe 

961
00:54:19,921 --> 00:54:21,660
it'll be you.
That is,

962
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:25,200
and that'll be a big shock,
and then these sorts of things.

963
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,010
These sorts of poetic descriptors start 
to become much more real,

964
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,270
but noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord.

965
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,003
These are the generations of Noah.
Noah was a just man and perfect in his 

966
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,164
generations and Noah walked with God.
That's an interesting line because if 

967
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:45,960
you remember back in the story of Adam 
and Eve,

968
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,520
what happens to Adam once he eats the 
fruit of the tree,

969
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:54,150
of the knowledge of good and evil and 
wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,

970
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:54,984
become self conscious,
develops the knowledge of good and evil 

971
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:57,594
is he won't walk with God when God calls
him in the garden and so noah is Adam 

972
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:05,970
without the fall essentially,
and there's something that Noah is doing

973
00:55:05,971 --> 00:55:06,804
right that
motivates God to spare him or maybe to 

974
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:15,470
show him a pathway through the emergent 
chaos,

975
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:16,304
something like that,
and that's worth thinking about a lot 

976
00:55:18,861 --> 00:55:23,690
because there will be situations in your
life where what you face is the emergent

977
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,553
chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible
catastrophe inside your family or maybe 

978
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:31,670
it'll be something that's occurring on a
much broader social level,

979
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:32,773
but

980
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,590
the chaos is coming and what you're 
going to want to know,

981
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:37,424
unless you want to be a dentist in of 
the chaos or even a contributor to it 

982
00:55:39,981 --> 00:55:40,814
and perhaps that is what you want.
Because many people under those 

983
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:47,651
circumstances choose that.
What you want is to know

984
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,340
how you build an Ark and get through it.
That's what you,

985
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,180
if you're,
if you're interested in life,

986
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:00,014
if you're interested in proper being and
you're disinclined to produce any more 

987
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:06,650
suffering,
the necessary,

988
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:07,484
then you want to know how to conduct 
yourself when the catastrophe comes so 

989
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:12,920
that you have a reasonable possibility 
of

990
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,560
of moving through it and and starting a 
new.

991
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,090
So when,
when this old story says,

992
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:23,873
well,
God's not happy and he's going to wipe 

993
00:56:24,721 --> 00:56:26,340
everything out.
It's like,

994
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,290
well,
you might want to take that seriously

995
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,473
and then when it says,
but there's one person who had a motive 

996
00:56:35,001 --> 00:56:35,834
being that protected him from that.
That's also something you might want to 

997
00:56:38,181 --> 00:56:39,014
take seriously because you might want to
know what that mode of being is because 

998
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,733
you might need to use it,
and so these sorts of things are 

999
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:45,584
practical in the deepest possible sense.
They're real in the deepest possible 

1000
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,710
sense and practical in the deepest 
possible sense.

1001
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,140
So Noah walked with God.

1002
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,920
Now I'm going to switch way ahead here 
because

1003
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,510
I said at the beginning of the lecture 
series that

1004
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:09,900
the Bible is a hyperlinked text and 
everything refers to everything else and

1005
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:13,560
so there's utility in reading it in 
linear order,

1006
00:57:13,561 --> 00:57:16,100
but it's not a linear document.
It's a document that

1007
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,390
that you can move through in an infinite
number of.

1008
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,393
There's an infinite number of pathways 
that you can use to walk through it and 

1009
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,133
all of the document expands upon and 
refers to all of the rest of the 

1010
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:34,940
document and so I'm going to search 
switch to the sermon on the mount,

1011
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:35,774
which I think is probably the key 
document in the New Testament and I'm 

1012
00:57:39,321 --> 00:57:40,154
going to switch to it because I think 
it's the closest thing we have to a 

1013
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:45,314
fully articulated description of what it
would mean to walk with God so that 

1014
00:57:50,421 --> 00:57:52,850
you're in the Ark.
When the flood comes.

1015
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,150
It's the.
It's the most fully articulated

1016
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,930
realization of that idea that that leaps
out of the metaphorical.

1017
00:58:00,931 --> 00:58:02,220
Because if I say,
well,

1018
00:58:02,221 --> 00:58:05,520
you should conduct yourself like Noah 
and walk with God and build an Ark.

1019
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:06,354
Obviously those are poetic and 
metaphorical suggestions and it's not 

1020
00:58:11,131 --> 00:58:13,350
that easy to bring them into practice,
right?

1021
00:58:13,351 --> 00:58:14,184
It's the distance.
There's a big distance between you and 

1022
00:58:16,501 --> 00:58:17,334
the archetype.
It isn't obvious how to manifest it in 

1023
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:19,914
your own life and what has to happen is 
the archetype has to be differentiated 

1024
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:24,474
in articulated so that it becomes 
sufficiently practical and personal so 

1025
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:29,364
that you can actually implement it.
So I'm going to take apart some of the 

1026
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:32,214
sermon on the mount.
It starts in Matthew five and I'm not 

1027
00:58:34,921 --> 00:58:35,754
going to talk about Matthew Five.
I'm going to talk about the end of 

1028
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:42,681
Matthew six and most of matthew seven.
Consider the lilies of the field,

1029
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:45,300
how they grow.
They toil.

1030
00:58:45,301 --> 00:58:50,301
Not Neither do they spin,
and yet I say unto you that even Solomon

1031
00:58:51,241 --> 00:58:53,940
in all his glory was not arrayed like 
one of these.

1032
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,553
Wherefore,
if God so clothes the grass of the 

1033
00:58:58,091 --> 00:59:00,730
field,
which today is and tomorrow is cast into

1034
00:59:00,731 --> 00:59:03,730
the oven,
shall he not much more clothe you.

1035
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,800
Oh Ye of little faith.
Therefore,

1036
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:06,634
take no thought saying what shall we eat
or what shall we drink or wherewithal 

1037
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:10,774
shall we be closed?
Those are famous lines and that sort of 

1038
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:16,090
Christ the Hippie,
right?

1039
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,890
It's like,
Hey,

1040
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,350
let it all hang out.
That's an old phrase,

1041
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,160
doing your

1042
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,160
thing and everything will come to you 
and these lines have been interpreted in

1043
00:59:28,551 --> 00:59:29,384
that manner many times,
but that's seriously not the proper 

1044
00:59:34,881 --> 00:59:35,714
interpretation because there's a kicker 
with this injunction and the kicker is 

1045
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:45,670
this,
for your heavenly father,

1046
00:59:45,671 --> 00:59:47,920
know that you have need of all these 
things,

1047
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,863
but seek ye first the Kingdom of God and
his righteousness and all these things 

1048
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:53,464
shall be added unto you.
That's a lot different than the hippie 

1049
00:59:55,541 --> 00:59:57,250
thing,
right?

1050
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:58,930
Because there's a very,
very,

1051
00:59:58,931 --> 00:59:59,764
very interesting idea here.
It's certainly one of the most profound 

1052
01:00:02,531 --> 01:00:07,360
ideas that I've ever encountered
and the idea is this,

1053
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,283
is that if you configure your life so 
that what you are genuinely doing is 

1054
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,720
aiming at the highest possible good,
then the things that you need to

1055
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:25,850
to survive and to thrive on a day to day
basis will deliver themselves to you.

1056
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,040
That's a hypothesis and it's not some 
simple hypothesis,

1057
01:00:32,041 --> 01:00:34,290
right?
Because what it basically says is if you

1058
01:00:34,291 --> 01:00:37,290
dare to do the most difficult thing that
you can conceptualize,

1059
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:39,840
your life will work out better than it 
will.

1060
01:00:39,841 --> 01:00:42,060
If you do anything else,
well,

1061
01:00:42,061 --> 01:00:43,470
how are you going to find out if that's 
true?

1062
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:45,750
Well,
Kierkegaardian leap of faith.

1063
01:00:45,751 --> 01:00:48,240
There is no way you're going to find out
whether or not that's true unless you do

1064
01:00:48,241 --> 01:00:49,074
it so no,
no one can tell you either because just 

1065
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:56,670
because it works for someone else.
I mean that's interesting and all that,

1066
01:00:56,671 --> 01:00:58,380
but it's no proof that it'll work for 
you.

1067
01:00:58,381 --> 01:01:03,381
You have to be all in in this game and 
so the idea is seek ye first the Kingdom

1068
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,033
of God and his righteousness.
It's like that's actually a fairly 

1069
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:08,064
important caution when you're talking 
about not having to pay attention to 

1070
01:01:12,811 --> 01:01:13,644
what you're going to eat or what you're 
going to where it's like what it's 

1071
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,214
essentially saying is that those 
problems are trivial in comparison and 

1072
01:01:20,251 --> 01:01:24,180
the probability is that if you manifest 
yourself properly in the world,

1073
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,710
that those things will come your way is 
extraordinarily high and I believe,

1074
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,450
I believe that that's exactly right.

1075
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:31,300
I mean,
I,

1076
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,630
I've,
I've watched people operate in the world

1077
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:34,464
and I would say that
there is no more effective way of 

1078
01:01:39,271 --> 01:01:40,104
operating in the world than to 
conceptualize the highest good that you 

1079
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:47,871
can and then strive to attain it.
There's no more practical pathway to the

1080
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:55,050
kind of success that you could have if 
you actually knew what success was.

1081
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:57,263
And so that's what this,
that's what this sermon is attempting 

1082
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:04,430
to,
to pause it.

1083
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:07,490
It's like in,
in the story of Pinocchio.

1084
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:08,343
You know what happens at the beginning 
of the story of Pinocchio is that Japan 

1085
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:14,090
Eto wishes on a star.
We talked about that a little bit and so

1086
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:14,924
what you pedal does is align himself 
with the metaphorical manifestation of 

1087
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:20,160
the highest good

1088
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:20,993
he can conceptualize and say,
he says he makes sure he makes a 

1089
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:26,303
commitment.
Let's say he aims at the star and for 

1090
01:02:29,851 --> 01:02:33,570
him the star is the possibility that he 
can take his creation,

1091
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:34,613
a puppet whose strings are being pulled 
by unseen forces and have it transform 

1092
01:02:39,431 --> 01:02:42,660
into something that's autonomist and 
real.

1093
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,880
Yeah,

1094
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,713
well that's a hell of an ambition.
You know when we're wise enough to put 

1095
01:02:47,481 --> 01:02:48,314
that into children's movie,
but too foolish to understand what it 

1096
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:52,184
means.
It's such an interesting juxtaposition 

1097
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,630
that that we can both know that and not 
know it.

1098
01:02:56,631 --> 01:02:58,670
At the same time you can go to the 
movie,

1099
01:02:58,671 --> 01:02:59,504
you can watch it and it makes sense,
but that doesn't mean that you can go 

1100
01:03:01,821 --> 01:03:02,601
home and think,
well,

1101
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:05,360
I know what that meant.
While people are complicated,

1102
01:03:05,361 --> 01:03:07,160
right?
We exist at different levels and all the

1103
01:03:07,161 --> 01:03:08,750
levels don't communicate with one 
another,

1104
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:09,584
but.
But the movie is a hypothesis and the 

1105
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:13,304
hypothesis is there's no better pathway 
to self realization and the enablement 

1106
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:19,334
of being than to pause it.
The highest good that you can conceive 

1107
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:26,510
of and commit yourself to it.
And then you might also ask yourself,

1108
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:30,320
and this is definitely worth asking,
is do you really have anything better to

1109
01:03:30,321 --> 01:03:32,090
do?
And if you don't,

1110
01:03:32,091 --> 01:03:32,924
well why would you do anything else?
Therefore take no thought for the 

1111
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:38,664
morrow,
for the morrow shall take thought for 

1112
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:42,780
the things of itself sufficient unto the
day is the evil thereof.

1113
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:44,963
I spent a long time trying to figure out
what that too because it's another one 

1114
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:48,174
of those lines that

1115
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,150
can easily be read as
pro grasshopper and anti amped.

1116
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,203
You know,
you remember the old fable of the 

1117
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,930
grasshopper and the and maybe not.
I'm not going to tell it,

1118
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:01,803
but
band works and the grasshopper fiddles 

1119
01:04:05,891 --> 01:04:09,280
and the aunt has a pretty good time in 
the winter and the grasshopper dies.

1120
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:10,563
And so this is like a grasshopper line,
but it's not because it says something 

1121
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:14,854
else.
It says that if you orient yourself 

1122
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:18,154
properly

1123
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,380
and then pay attention to what you do 
every day that works and it.

1124
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,303
I actually think that that's in 
accordance with what with what we have 

1125
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:28,274
come to understand about human 
perception because what happens is that 

1126
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,260
the world shifts itself around your aim 
because you're a.

1127
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,103
you're a creature that has an aim.
You have to have an ame in order to do 

1128
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:41,120
something.
You're in aiming creature.

1129
01:04:41,121 --> 01:04:44,030
You look at a point and you move towards
it.

1130
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:47,210
It's built right into you and so you 
have an aim.

1131
01:04:47,211 --> 01:04:48,044
Well,
let's say your aim is the highest 

1132
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,484
possible ame.
Well then so that sets up the world 

1133
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:53,200
around you.
It,

1134
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,123
it organizes all of your perceptions.
It organizes what you see and you don't 

1135
01:04:57,171 --> 01:04:58,004
see.
It organizes your emotions and your 

1136
01:04:58,971 --> 01:05:02,360
motivations.
So you organize yourself around that aim

1137
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:03,194
and then what happens is the day 
manifests itself as a set of challenges 

1138
01:05:07,011 --> 01:05:09,620
and problems and if you solve them 
properly,

1139
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:10,723
then you stay on the pathway towards 
that eighth and you can concentrate on 

1140
01:05:13,581 --> 01:05:14,414
the on the on the day and so that way 
you get to have your cake and eat it 

1141
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,470
because you can.
You can point into the distance,

1142
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:23,530
the far distance and you can live in the
day

1143
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,463
and it seems to me that that's.
That makes every moment of the day 

1144
01:05:29,231 --> 01:05:31,300
supercharged with meaning.
That that's how.

1145
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:32,183
Because if everything that you're doing 
everyday is related to the highest 

1146
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:37,870
possible aim that you can conceptualize,
well,

1147
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:38,704
that's the very definition of the 
meaning that would sustain you in your 

1148
01:05:40,751 --> 01:05:41,920
life.
Well,

1149
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:42,754
and then the issue is well back to noah.
Well all hell is about to break loose 

1150
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:46,594
and chaos is coming.
It's like when that's happening in your 

1151
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:48,814
life,
you might want to be doing something 

1152
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:50,884
that you regard as truly worthwhile 
because that's what will keep you 

1153
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:54,784
afloat.
When when everything is flooded and you 

1154
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:02,890
don't want to wait until the flood comes
to start doing that,

1155
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:07,150
because if you're arcs half built and 
you don't know how to captain it,

1156
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,620
the probability is very high that that 
you'll drown.

1157
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:17,733
Take therefore no thought for the moral,
but for the morrow shall take thought 

1158
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:21,334
for the things of itself,
sufficient unto the day is the evil 

1159
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:25,114
thereof.
That's not a particularly optimistic 

1160
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:33,240
formulation,
judge.

1161
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:37,230
Not that you be not judged for with what
judgment you judge.

1162
01:06:37,231 --> 01:06:39,360
You shall be judged and with what 
measure you meet.

1163
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,890
It shall be measured to you.
Again

1164
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,340
to sensible piece of.
It's a sensible description.

1165
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:49,174
I wouldn't call it a piece of advice 
because I don't think that any of this 

1166
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:51,814
is advice.
It's a description of the structure of 

1167
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:53,884
reality that's not the same as advice 
and it basically says that you'll be 

1168
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:01,600
held accountable by the rules of the 
game that you choose to play

1169
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,353
and that I also think is perfectly in 
keeping with what we understand about 

1170
01:07:07,331 --> 01:07:09,930
human psychology.
Because you,

1171
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:10,803
you are playing.
You have to play a game that other 

1172
01:07:12,251 --> 01:07:13,084
people will allow you to play and that 
will cooperate with you while you're 

1173
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,170
playing and it will compete with you 
while you're playing it,

1174
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,213
but you have a fair bit of flexibility 
in setting up the parameters of the 

1175
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:21,874
game,
but you don't have any choice about 

1176
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:24,490
whether or not you're going to be in a 
game.

1177
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,013
You're in a game and you're going to be 
held accountable by the rules of the 

1178
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:30,094
game because that's how the game works 
and so you might want to pick a game by 

1179
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:39,370
whose rules you would be willing to be 
held accountable

1180
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:44,320
and why be hold us Dow,
the moat that isn't my brother's eye,

1181
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:49,321
but consider us not the beam that is in 
diagnosis or how will you say to that?

1182
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,463
My brother,
let me pull out the most of out of the 

1183
01:07:51,690 --> 01:07:54,070
NIH and behold,
a beam is in nine Onei.

1184
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:55,243
What you might be wondering what a beam 
is in a moat is the dust speck and a 

1185
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:05,541
beam is a very large piece of lumber and
so the issue is

1186
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:08,043
not so much the blindness of others.
Even though there's as much blindness 

1187
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:17,610
among others as there is
as there is for you,

1188
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:20,210
but the issue here,
the advice here,

1189
01:08:20,211 --> 01:08:21,044
the description here is you should be 
concerned about what's interfering with 

1190
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:24,884
your own vision first and you should 
leave other people the hell alone in 

1191
01:08:28,761 --> 01:08:29,594
relationship to that and so if you're a 
mode of being in the world is if you 

1192
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:36,440
would just act better,
things would improve for me.

1193
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,723
Or if you identify the evil and the 
catastrophe is something that's outside 

1194
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,153
that someone else needs to fix or that 
someone's responded someone else's 

1195
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,330
responsible for,
then

1196
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:55,803
then you're not going to fix that and 
you're going to remain blind to the 

1197
01:08:59,231 --> 01:09:03,550
things that you're doing and not doing 
that make things not go well and so it's

1198
01:09:03,551 --> 01:09:05,650
just better to think,
all right,

1199
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:06,484
I'm probably blind in many,
many ways and maybe there are some ways 

1200
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:10,893
that I could rectify that because it's 
highly probable that you're blind and 

1201
01:09:13,271 --> 01:09:14,800
all sorts of ways.
I mean,

1202
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:15,790
it's.
It's in fact,

1203
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:20,230
it's virtually certain and so it's just 
more useful to think,

1204
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,120
how is it that I'm wrong in this 
situation?

1205
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,990
I'll tell you something that I learned 
to do when I was arguing with my wife,

1206
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:28,824
which happened quite frequently because 
when you actually communicate with 

1207
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:33,984
people,
you find out that there's many things 

1208
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:35,784
that you don't agree on and that's 
because you are actually different 

1209
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:41,640
creatures and so if you're actually 
going to have a truthful conversation,

1210
01:09:41,641 --> 01:09:42,474
then you're going to find out that you 
don't see things the same way and then 

1211
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:49,930
you can either pretend that that's not 
the case in gloss over it and then ended

1212
01:09:49,931 --> 01:09:50,764
up in a 30 year silent war or you can or
you can have the damn fight when you 

1213
01:09:56,671 --> 01:09:58,830
need to have it and see if you can 
straighten it out.

1214
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,530
So now and then we'd get into a 
situation where we were at loggerheads.

1215
01:10:03,531 --> 01:10:08,420
We couldn't move and it would spiral up 
into hate speech,

1216
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:10,300
let's say.
Because yeah,

1217
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,353
everyone laughs because they know they 
manifest plenty of hate speech towards 

1218
01:10:14,061 --> 01:10:14,894
those they love.
So one of the things we learned to do 

1219
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:18,464
was when we hit an impasse was to 
separate and to go our own ways and to 

1220
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:25,370
go sit and think,
okay,

1221
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:26,840
look,
we're at this

1222
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,010
unpleasant situation.
We can't figure out how to move forward.

1223
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,340
I'd always think,
of course it's her fault.

1224
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:39,170
Obviously it's her fault.
Least 95 percent,

1225
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,500
but maybe there was something I did that
contributed like five percent to it.

1226
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:50,920
And so I would sit and think and ask 
myself a question which was,

1227
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,303
is there anything I did in the last six 
months that increase the probability 

1228
01:10:55,101 --> 01:10:59,000
that this impasse would manifest itself?
And I'll tell you,

1229
01:10:59,001 --> 01:10:59,834
you have no idea how fast your mind will
generate an answer to a question like 

1230
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:07,010
that because there's undoubtedly some 
idiotic thing that you did that you know

1231
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:07,844
that you remember that increased the 
probability that you're going to have 

1232
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:12,800
your hands around the throat of the 
person that you love.

1233
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,160
And then you can go tell them that and 
then you can have a conversation.

1234
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:18,990
Especially if they do the same thing.

1235
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:19,771
Say,
look,

1236
01:11:19,771 --> 01:11:20,604
you know,
here's how I'm an idiot in this 

1237
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,780
situation.
Now the person says,

1238
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,614
well,
yeah,

1239
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:27,020
it's,
here's how I'm an idiot,

1240
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:29,730
and then your two idiots and then maybe 
you can have a conversation.

1241
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:35,130
So thou hypocrite first cast out the 
beam of light out of I and I,

1242
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:38,790
and then shalt thou see clearly to cast 
out the mote of my brothers.

1243
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:39,624
I,
that's pay hard to argue with that ask 

1244
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,363
and it shall be given you seek and you 
shall find knock and it shall be opened 

1245
01:11:46,861 --> 01:11:47,694
unto you for everyone that Asketh 
receive it and he that seeketh findeth 

1246
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:55,770
and to him that hath it shall be opened.
That's pretty optimistic again,

1247
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:58,170
but,
but again,

1248
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:01,410
I think it's a description of the 
structure of existential reality.

1249
01:12:01,411 --> 01:12:02,970
And,
and by,

1250
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:04,050
by which I mean

1251
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:09,430
when I'm in my clinical practice and I 
observe,

1252
01:12:09,431 --> 01:12:11,100
and this is also the case with my 
students,

1253
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:15,270
is let's say people's lives aren't what 
they would like them to be.

1254
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:18,570
And so then you ask why?
Well,

1255
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,433
forget about tragedy and catastrophe 
because that's self evident and we're 

1256
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:23,904
not going to discuss that.
Although the degree to which you bring 

1257
01:12:26,071 --> 01:12:29,190
about your own tragedy is always 
indeterminant.

1258
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,233
But I would never say that every 
terrible thing that is visited on a 

1259
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:34,674
person is something they deserved.
I think that that's a very dangerous 

1260
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:39,204
presupposition,
especially because everyone gets sick 

1261
01:12:41,371 --> 01:12:42,204
and everyone dies,
but one of the main reasons that people 

1262
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:53,991
don't get what they want is because they
don't actually figure out what it is and

1263
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:55,970
the probability that you're going to 
get.

1264
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,410
What would be good for you,
let's say,

1265
01:12:57,411 --> 01:12:59,210
which would even be better than what you
want,

1266
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,330
right?
Because you know,

1267
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:03,320
you might be wrong about what you want 
easily,

1268
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:06,290
but maybe you could get.
What would really be good for you?

1269
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,280
Well,
why don't you.

1270
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,260
Well,
because you don't try.

1271
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,380
You don't think,
okay,

1272
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:16,750
here's what I would like if I could have
it.

1273
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:17,643
And I don't mean I don't mean in a way 
that you manipulate the world to force 

1274
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:25,630
it to deliver you good for status or 
something like that.

1275
01:13:25,631 --> 01:13:26,464
That isn't what I mean.
I mean something like imagine that you 

1276
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:30,074
were taking care of yourself like you 
were someone you actually cared for and 

1277
01:13:33,041 --> 01:13:33,880
then you thought,
okay,

1278
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:34,714
I am caring for this person.
I would like things to go as well for 

1279
01:13:37,271 --> 01:13:40,600
them as possible.
What would their life have to be like in

1280
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:43,960
order for that to be the case where 
people don't do that?

1281
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:45,410
They don't sit down and think,
all right,

1282
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:46,750
well let's,
let's figure it out.

1283
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,650
You're,
you've got a life.

1284
01:13:47,651 --> 01:13:49,180
It's hard.
Obviously.

1285
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:52,720
It's like three years from now you can 
have what you need.

1286
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,690
You got to be careful about it.
You can't have everything.

1287
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:57,973
You can have what would be good for you,
but you have to figure out what it is 

1288
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:02,180
and then you have to aim at it.

1289
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:06,140
Well,
my experience with people as being as if

1290
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:09,890
they figure out what it is that would be
good for them and then they aim at it,

1291
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,250
then they get it and it's strange 
because they don't know.

1292
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,433
It's a strange thing.
It's not quite that simple because you 

1293
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:17,693
know,
you may formulate an idea about what 

1294
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:19,504
would be good for you and then you take 
10 steps towards that and you find out 

1295
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:25,210
that your formulation was a bit off and 
so you have to reformulate your goal.

1296
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:29,290
So you're kind of going like this as you
move towards the goal,

1297
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:30,423
but a huge part of the reason that 
people fail is because they don't ever 

1298
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,563
set up the criteria for success.
And so since success is a very narrow 

1299
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:39,184
line in very unlikely,
the probability that you're going to 

1300
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:45,841
stumble on it randomly is zero.
And so there's a proposition here in the

1301
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:49,870
proposition is if you actually want 
something,

1302
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,100
you can have it.

1303
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,840
Now,
the question then would be,

1304
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,360
well,
what do you mean by actually want?

1305
01:14:57,970 --> 01:14:58,803
And the answer is that you reorient your
life in every possible way to make the 

1306
01:15:04,741 --> 01:15:08,490
probability that that will occur as 
certain as possible.

1307
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,290
And that's a sacrificial idea,
right?

1308
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:15,150
It's like you don't get everything,
obviously you obviously,

1309
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:16,733
but maybe you can have what you need and
maybe all you have to do to get it is 

1310
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,400
ask,
but asking isn't a whim or today's wish.

1311
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,910
It's like you have to be deadly serious 
about it.

1312
01:15:29,911 --> 01:15:30,960
You have to think,
okay,

1313
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:31,833
like I'm taking stock of myself and if I
was going to live properly in the world 

1314
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,384
and I was going to set myself up such 
that being would justify itself in my 

1315
01:15:41,731 --> 01:15:42,564
estimation,
and I don't mean as a harsh judge 

1316
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,240
exactly what is it that I would aim at?
Well,

1317
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:52,640
one of the things I've found is that in 
test of this theory,

1318
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:56,860
let's say
you could try this.

1319
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,683
This is a form of prayer knocking.
Sit on your bed one day and ask 

1320
01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:03,580
yourself,
oh,

1321
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:09,570
what's what remarkably stupid things am 
I doing on a regular basis to absolutely

1322
01:16:10,451 --> 01:16:14,380
screw up my life?
And if you actually asked that question,

1323
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,940
but you have to want to know the answer,
right?

1324
01:16:15,941 --> 01:16:18,040
Because that's actually what asking the 
question means.

1325
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:18,963
It doesn't mean just mouthing the words.
It means you have to decide that you 

1326
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:24,730
want to know.
You'll figure that out so fast.

1327
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:25,870
It'll make your hair curl,

1328
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,920
you'll you.
It's as if young thought about this,

1329
01:16:30,921 --> 01:16:31,754
he saw it.
He thought that people had two poles of 

1330
01:16:33,261 --> 01:16:34,094
consciousness in one was the individual 
consciousness that we each identify 

1331
01:16:37,011 --> 01:16:37,844
within.
The other was something he called the 

1332
01:16:38,511 --> 01:16:39,344
self and the self is the.
You might think about it as the divine 

1333
01:16:41,961 --> 01:16:44,330
within.
That's close enough approximation.

1334
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:47,180
It's the universal part of your 
consciousness.

1335
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:50,150
It's your conscience.
That's another way of thinking about it.

1336
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:54,020
Whatever your conscience is,
but it's something that you can consult.

1337
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:54,854
It's like the Socratic Damon.
Socrates said that the thing that made 

1338
01:16:58,041 --> 01:17:02,360
him different than everyone else in 
Greece was that he consulted his demon,

1339
01:17:02,361 --> 01:17:03,194
his genius.
He asked himself how it was that he 

1340
01:17:06,051 --> 01:17:08,960
should conduct himself in the world,
and then he did that.

1341
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:12,080
Whatever it was,
he didn't try to force a solution.

1342
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:14,240
You know,
he didn't try to force a solution.

1343
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:15,800
Selfishly,
he asked,

1344
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,520
I'm going to manifest myself in the best
possible manner in the world.

1345
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:22,400
I would like to do that.
What would that be?

1346
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:25,280
While you're perfectly capable of 
thinking,

1347
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:26,443
God only knows how you're perfectly 
capable of immense feats of imagination 

1348
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:35,270
and dreams and fantasies,
God only knows how you do all of that.

1349
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,690
What would happen if you consulted 
yourself about the best possible outcome

1350
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:41,150
for you?
You might get an answer.

1351
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,190
Well,
that's what this proposition is

1352
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,910
or what man is the review,
who if his son asks for bread,

1353
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:55,040
will give him a stone or if he asks for 
a fish,

1354
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:58,730
will give him a serpent if he then being
evil,

1355
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:00,740
know how to give good gifts unto your 
children.

1356
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:01,723
How much more shall your father,
which is in heaven give good things to 

1357
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:06,740
them that ask him,
well,

1358
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:09,380
this is a question about the fundamental
nature of being,

1359
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:15,100
I suppose and one of the hypotheses in 
the new testament which is different.

1360
01:18:17,730 --> 01:18:18,563
It's a different hypothesis in some 
sense than the one that structures the 

1361
01:18:20,631 --> 01:18:25,631
old testament is that
faith bakes being good.

1362
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:32,050
It's a very interesting proposition and 
so the notion would be,

1363
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,810
and it it's an action oriented issue as 
well.

1364
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:39,400
You act out the proposition that if you 
act properly in the world,

1365
01:18:39,401 --> 01:18:41,710
that being will reveal itself to you as 
benevolent,

1366
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:45,460
but you will not know.
You'll never know unless you do it.

1367
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:47,013
So this is a call to that.
Act out the proposition that if you act 

1368
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:54,100
properly,
that being itself is benevolent.

1369
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,320
There's no reason to assume the 
contrary.

1370
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,423
I mean to assume the contrary,
it would be to be as cynical and bitter 

1371
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:09,860
as possible and it's not like we don't 
have reason for that.

1372
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,710
It's not like I don't understand why 
that happens to people.

1373
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:19,620
Therefore all things whatsoever you 
would that men should do to you,

1374
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:20,483
do you even.
So to them for this as the law and the 

1375
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:26,640
prophets and that's a reciprocity issue,
right?

1376
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:27,474
It's like while imagine what would be.
This is another thing I learned from 

1377
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:34,080
young because young reverse this because
this is often read,

1378
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:37,950
it's the golden rule,
it's often read is be nice to be nice to

1379
01:19:37,951 --> 01:19:38,784
other people.
It's like that is not what this rule 

1380
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:40,734
means.
It doesn't mean that even a little bit 

1381
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,373
it means something like,
and we'll reverse it so that will 

1382
01:19:47,211 --> 01:19:50,060
concentrate on you rather than the other
person to begin with.

1383
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,073
It means something like
conceptualize how things could be great 

1384
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,453
if they were great for you,
if you were taking care of yourself and 

1385
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:03,290
then work to make that the case for 
everyone else.

1386
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,603
You know?
You see that in Buddhism because Buddha 

1387
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:08,430
reached Nirvana,
right?

1388
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:09,683
That's the theory and then he,
he was tempted with offer to stay there 

1389
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,233
and he rejected that offer and came back
to the profane world because he felt 

1390
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:24,210
that the attainment of nirvana was 
insufficient unless everyone attained it

1391
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:27,000
simultaneously and so it's something 
like that,

1392
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:32,390
but it's treat yourself properly.
That's a hard thing to do because you're

1393
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,720
a fallen,
shameful,

1394
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,030
cowardly,
deceitful,

1395
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,200
malevolent,

1396
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:42,663
mortal creature and so it's not easy and
you know it and it's not easy to treat 

1397
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:47,704
something like that properly and and,
and it isn't obvious that people treat 

1398
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:54,130
themselves better than they treat other 
people.

1399
01:20:54,131 --> 01:20:54,964
I don't think that's obvious at all,
but maybe you could start with yourself 

1400
01:20:57,221 --> 01:20:57,821
and think,
okay,

1401
01:20:57,821 --> 01:21:00,820
I'm going to take care of myself as if I
have value.

1402
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:02,373
What would that look like?
And then I'm going to work to extend 

1403
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:07,000
that courtesy to everyone else.
And that's.

1404
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:07,893
Well,
the hypothesis here is that if you take 

1405
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:15,640
all of the moral wisdom that mankind has
generated over,

1406
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:20,641
it's millennia of struggle,
evolved and then manifested metaphors,

1407
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:26,520
story and then codified into law,
articulated law,

1408
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:30,390
and you pick one principle that 
dominated all of that.

1409
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,860
This would be the principal

1410
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,293
and it's interesting too because it's 
the law and the prophets and the law is 

1411
01:21:40,781 --> 01:21:41,614
the rules,
but the profits or the process by which 

1412
01:21:43,061 --> 01:21:45,020
the rules are being updated,
right,

1413
01:21:45,021 --> 01:21:45,854
and so the profits are a superordinate 
in some sense to the law and the 

1414
01:21:49,031 --> 01:21:49,864
proposition that's set forth in this 
particular statement is that this maxim 

1415
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:54,933
which is optimize your own mode of being
and then work to do the same for 

1416
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:02,170
everyone around you,
is not only the thing that's at the core

1417
01:22:02,171 --> 01:22:04,360
of the law,
but it's at the core of the process that

1418
01:22:04,361 --> 01:22:06,130
generates it updates the law

1419
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:10,323
hell of a thing for someone to say,
enter Ye in at the narrow gate because 

1420
01:22:14,981 --> 01:22:15,814
that's what straight means.
Enter ye in at the straight gate for 

1421
01:22:18,011 --> 01:22:20,920
wide is the gate and broad is the way 
that leads to destruction.

1422
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:21,963
Well,
who in the world could possibly argue 

1423
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,300
with that?
Every one in their right mind knows that

1424
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:26,134
there's a million ways of doing things 
wrong and one way if you're lucky to do 

1425
01:22:28,871 --> 01:22:32,080
things right,
and so the notion that it's a very,

1426
01:22:32,081 --> 01:22:35,770
very narrow pathway that you tread upon 
if you're doing things right,

1427
01:22:35,771 --> 01:22:37,780
that's,
that's wisdom,

1428
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:40,323
that's the line between chaos and order 
that you're supposed to be on 

1429
01:22:42,641 --> 01:22:43,600
constantly,
right?

1430
01:22:43,601 --> 01:22:44,434
It's a very,
very thin line because if you're a 

1431
01:22:45,521 --> 01:22:46,354
little bit too far in one direction,
then it's too much chaos that if you're 

1432
01:22:48,791 --> 01:22:49,624
a little too far in the other direction 
that it's too much order and both of 

1433
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:52,480
those aren't good.

1434
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,313
It has to be.
Balance has to be exactly right and you 

1435
01:22:55,091 --> 01:22:55,924
can feel that and I truly believe you 
can feel that and I think it's your 

1436
01:22:58,541 --> 01:22:59,374
deepest instinct.
It's your deepest instinct and I mean 

1437
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:03,520
that.
I mean that biologically.

1438
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,533
I don't mean that metaphorically.
I think that your psyche is arranged to 

1439
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:12,010
exist in a cosmos that's composed of 
chaos and order.

1440
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:12,963
I think that's why you have the 
hemispheric structure that you have 

1441
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,663
this.
This is deeper than metaphor and then 

1442
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:22,120
when you feel as if you're meaningfully 
engaged in the world,

1443
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:23,343
when the terror of your mortality strips
away and you're engaged and it's 

1444
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:28,113
timeless,
that's the deepest instinct you have 

1445
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:31,953
telling you that you're in the right 
place at the right time and then what 

1446
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:39,250
you do is practice being their practice 
being there and that's that,

1447
01:23:39,380 --> 01:23:41,620
that narrow spot that's so difficult to 
find.

1448
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,420
You wander around it.
Maybe if you're lucky,

1449
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,130
you can watch,
you can watch.

1450
01:23:45,131 --> 01:23:45,964
This is an experiment.
Watch yourself for two weeks like you 

1451
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:50,340
don't know who you are because you 
don't.

1452
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,273
So watch yourself for two weeks and 
notice there's gonna be times when 

1453
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:56,170
things are proper,
their raid properly for you,

1454
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:57,253
you.
It's not easy to notice because when 

1455
01:23:58,661 --> 01:24:00,220
they're arrayed like that,
you're so engaged.

1456
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:02,050
You don't exactly notice,
you know,

1457
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:03,161
but you'll see,
oh,

1458
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:04,450
I'm in the right place.
It's like,

1459
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:06,250
okay,
how'd I get here?

1460
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,940
What am I doing right?
You know,

1461
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,170
how is it that this could happen more 
often?

1462
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,033
I'd like this to happen more often.
How would I have to conduct myself in 

1463
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:14,794
order for that to happen more often,
and then you practice that and then 

1464
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:20,290
maybe instead of 10 minutes a month or 
10 minutes a week,

1465
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:23,860
it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's
half an hour a day and then it's an hour

1466
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:26,470
a day and then it's four hours a day and
maybe if you're.

1467
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,513
If you're extraordinarily careful,
then you get to a point where you're 

1468
01:24:29,801 --> 01:24:30,634
like that a good proportion of the time,
because straight is the gate and narrow 

1469
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:39,450
is the way which leads to life and few 
there be that,

1470
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:40,284
find it.

1471
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:46,020
You were a false prophets which come to 
you in sheep's clothing,

1472
01:24:46,021 --> 01:24:46,854
but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
That's particularly good advice for 

1473
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:52,080
today's political situation.
I can tell you,

1474
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:58,290
you shall know them by their fruits.
Do men gather grapes,

1475
01:24:58,291 --> 01:24:59,124
have thorns or figs of thistles even so 
every good tree bringeth forth good 

1476
01:25:03,451 --> 01:25:04,284
fruit,
but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil 

1477
01:25:05,911 --> 01:25:08,270
fruit.
Well,

1478
01:25:08,271 --> 01:25:09,104
that's what I learned from studying the 
history of totalitarianism in the 20th 

1479
01:25:12,291 --> 01:25:15,590
century,
is that a corrupt tree brings forth evil

1480
01:25:15,591 --> 01:25:18,170
fruit,
and that's for sure.

1481
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,630
That's so funny.
You know,

1482
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,353
people who think when they're thinking 
about their relationship with divinity 

1483
01:25:27,291 --> 01:25:31,700
or their relationship with God,
they think it's a primitive and childish

1484
01:25:31,701 --> 01:25:34,190
way of thinking.
What if a miracle just manifest?

1485
01:25:34,191 --> 01:25:37,370
Why kind of miracle just manifest itself
and I would be convinced,

1486
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:39,800
and the funny thing is,
is first of all actually you wouldn't be

1487
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:40,634
if a miracle actually happened,
you would actually forget about it and 

1488
01:25:42,891 --> 01:25:43,724
about six months,
that's I mean you'd think that's not 

1489
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:46,341
true,
but it's true.

1490
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,950
You would actually forget about it 
because that's what people are like,

1491
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,370
but there are negative miracles that are
happening all the time,

1492
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,273
which actually lends some credence to my
supposition and we don't pay any 

1493
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:56,444
attention to that.
If we can't learn from what happened in 

1494
01:25:58,311 --> 01:25:59,144
the 20th century,
then we are absolutely incapable of 

1495
01:26:01,131 --> 01:26:01,964
learning because what in the 20th 
century was as bitter as set of lessons 

1496
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:11,270
as you could possibly imagine,
and it's associated precisely with this.

1497
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,940
A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil 
fruit.

1498
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:16,100
A good tree cannot bring forth evil 
fruit.

1499
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,590
Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth 
good fruit.

1500
01:26:22,990 --> 01:26:23,823
Every tree that bringeth forth that 
bring us not forth good fruit is hewn 

1501
01:26:27,701 --> 01:26:29,510
down and cast into the fire.
Well,

1502
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:34,511
that's a flood motif right there.
It's like we're constantly the archetype

1503
01:26:34,961 --> 01:26:37,090
of the tree.
That's the archetype of being.

1504
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:39,110
It's it's.
It's the archetype of the self.

1505
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:39,993
Often.

1506
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:47,040
What's the warning here is that if 
you're mostly dead wood,

1507
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:48,473
you're going to get,
you're going to burn up and you can 

1508
01:26:50,911 --> 01:26:52,470
think about that metaphysical.
You can.

1509
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:53,363
You can project that into eternity and 
you can think about that as a form of 

1510
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,174
hell.
And the funny thing is is that when 

1511
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:03,501
that's happening to you in real time,
it is like an eternity in hell.

1512
01:27:03,900 --> 01:27:05,970
It's a perfectly reasonable way of 
thinking about it,

1513
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:09,000
but you can strip the metaphysical 
elements off and you can say,

1514
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:11,670
well,
if you're mostly dead wood,

1515
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:16,650
then a spark will light you on fire.
And that's also very much worth thinking

1516
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:18,900
about.
Wherefore by their fruits,

1517
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:22,410
shall you know them.
Not everyone that say a thumb to me,

1518
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:27,030
Lord shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven,
but he that doeth the will of my father,

1519
01:27:27,031 --> 01:27:32,031
which is in heaven.
That's an interesting light and I think,

1520
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:36,900
I mean one of the proper critiques of 
Traditional Christianity,

1521
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:39,120
maybe this is the sort of critique that 
needs you to put forth,

1522
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:39,954
was that

1523
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,230
Christianity had degenerated and its 
moral mission.

1524
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,620
Young was a little bit more sympathetic 
and I'll tell you why in a minute,

1525
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:48,454
but niches idea was that Christianity 
had lost its way when it generated the 

1526
01:27:53,921 --> 01:27:58,921
presupposition that humanity was saved 
in some final sense,

1527
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:00,483
by the sacrifice of Christ.
It meant that the work was already done 

1528
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:05,700
and that,
and I'm,

1529
01:28:06,460 --> 01:28:07,293
I'm being.
I'm being harsh in my judgment for the 

1530
01:28:10,841 --> 01:28:11,674
purpose of rhetorical simplification,
but the idea was that if you just 

1531
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:18,160
professed faith that that had already 
occurred,

1532
01:28:18,161 --> 01:28:21,610
then you were
granted eternal salvation.

1533
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,800
It's like,
well,

1534
01:28:23,801 --> 01:28:24,634
it's not so straightforward and I think 
that that's what this line actually 

1535
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:27,910
represents.
It says,

1536
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,200
how do you enter into the Kingdom of 
Heaven?

1537
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:33,833
And again,
you can think about that under the 

1538
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,353
aspect of eternity or you can think 
about it as a psychological statement 

1539
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:41,980
and the answer is quite straightforward,
is that

1540
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:43,953
you

1541
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,410
do what Noah did to make him immune from
the flood.

1542
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:54,150
And that's to walk with God and that's 
what this sermon is about.

1543
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:59,880
It's laying out the practical elements 
of that and the practical elements are

1544
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,540
aim at the highest possible,
good and play that out in the world.

1545
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:07,643
And then

1546
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:09,393
you may have the opportunity to inhabit 
the highest possible good that you're 

1547
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,270
positing into existence.
Perhaps not,

1548
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,870
but you can't think of any more 
practical way of going about that.

1549
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:20,943
I mean,
if you build a house that maybe you can 

1550
01:29:21,821 --> 01:29:23,170
live in it,
if you don't build a house,

1551
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:24,430
you're not going to be able to live in 
it.

1552
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:25,264
If you build a good house,
then you'll be able to live in a good 

1553
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:28,870
house.
And if you build a perfect house,

1554
01:29:28,871 --> 01:29:30,370
then maybe you can live in a perfect 
house.

1555
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:31,443
But if you just say that the house has 
already been built for you and that you 

1556
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:38,320
can just say that the house is being 
built for you,

1557
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:39,423
well then the probability that you're 
going to be able to live where you need 

1558
01:29:42,221 --> 01:29:43,054
to live is there's no probability that 
you're going to be able to live where 

1559
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:48,310
you need to live.
Many will say to me in that day,

1560
01:29:48,311 --> 01:29:49,750
that's the Judgment Day,
Lord,

1561
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:52,270
have we not prophesied in thy name and 
the name,

1562
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:53,104
have cast out devils and in [inaudible] 
name done many wonderful works and then 

1563
01:29:56,171 --> 01:29:58,750
I will profess unto them,
I never knew you,

1564
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:02,020
depart from me you that work iniquity.

1565
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:05,660
See,
that's judgment day.

1566
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:06,494
You know?
That's an architectural idea and partly 

1567
01:30:10,631 --> 01:30:15,010
it's archetipal because everyday is 
judgment day and the part of you that

1568
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,070
the part of you that's equivalent to the
logo,

1569
01:30:19,071 --> 01:30:21,620
say the part of you that's your own 
ideal,

1570
01:30:22,190 --> 01:30:27,190
sits in eternal judgment on your 
iniquity and that's the.

1571
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:28,963
That's the source of guilt and shame and
and and withdrawal and then resentment 

1572
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:37,890
and then murderousness and then 
genocide.

1573
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,033
It's because you
can intuit the ideal and the problem 

1574
01:30:44,111 --> 01:30:44,944
with intuiting,
the ideal is that an ideal is always a 

1575
01:30:46,961 --> 01:30:47,794
judge.

1576
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:49,463
There are no difference between an ideal
and the judge and so you're eternally 

1577
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:53,790
judged by your own ideal.
If you have no idea,

1578
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:56,370
well then you've got no direction and no
meaning in your life,

1579
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:59,280
and then of course the more extreme,
the ideal,

1580
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:03,690
the harsher the judge.
That's actually why young young was very

1581
01:31:03,691 --> 01:31:04,524
curious about why the book of revelation
was tacked onto the Bible because the 

1582
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:11,910
book of revelation,
that's a very weird book and you know in

1583
01:31:11,911 --> 01:31:12,930
in,
in the Gospels,

1584
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:15,930
Christ is I would say perhaps primarily 
merciful.

1585
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:16,764
There,
there's a maybe a war in his character 

1586
01:31:19,201 --> 01:31:20,034
between truth and mercy,
but it's one of the two perhaps mercy 

1587
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:23,573
and Young's observation was the gospel.
Christ was to merciful and that's why 

1588
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:31,800
the book of revelation was tapped on,
tacked onto the new testament because in

1589
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:33,540
the book of revelation,
Christ,

1590
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,790
who's the ideal,
who's above the pyramid,

1591
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:36,624
right?
The transcendent ideal is nothing but a 

1592
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:39,354
judge and everyone fails,
and of course the ultimate ideal is the 

1593
01:31:43,261 --> 01:31:44,094
ultimate judge.
And so that's the archetypical reality 

1594
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:46,711
there.
And you can say,

1595
01:31:46,711 --> 01:31:47,544
well,
I don't want to be judged and so I'll 

1596
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:50,730
dispense with the ideal,
but then your cane,

1597
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:54,000
because cane is exactly the person who 
dispenses with the ideal.

1598
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:55,493
And so there's no escaping from it.
There's no escaping from eternal 

1599
01:31:58,411 --> 01:32:01,090
judgment.
That's the architectural story.

1600
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,133
You know,
people put a lot of work into these 

1601
01:32:05,101 --> 01:32:06,360
representations,
you know,

1602
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,630
and there's thousands of them.
They weren't messing around.

1603
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,020
These are serious pieces of work,
you know,

1604
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,943
we don't understand them,
but that doesn't mean that the people 

1605
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,910
who created them didn't know what they 
were doing.

1606
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,820
These were geniuses who created these 
pieces of work.

1607
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:21,833
It's not like they understood in an 
articulated manner exactly what they 

1608
01:32:24,241 --> 01:32:27,270
were trying to represent,
but what they were representing,

1609
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:30,030
where the metaphor is at the core of our
culture,

1610
01:32:30,031 --> 01:32:32,850
to the degree that our culture is 
functional and good.

1611
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:36,270
These are the metaphors upon which it's 
founded

1612
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,940
and they're not for the faint of heart.
You know,

1613
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:42,580
you say religion is the opiate of the 
masses.

1614
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:43,151
It's like,
yeah.

1615
01:32:43,151 --> 01:32:45,550
Then how do you explain this?
Exactly.

1616
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,170
You know,
because if it was opiates,

1617
01:32:47,171 --> 01:32:49,690
you're after.
You might just get rid of that panel.

1618
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:55,383
Especially when.
The other thing that's so interesting 

1619
01:32:56,711 --> 01:32:59,830
about the proposition,
if you look at revelations in revelation

1620
01:32:59,831 --> 01:33:00,664
and you look at the judgment,
almost everyone ends up on the right 

1621
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:05,794
side of this panel.
So if you were just conjuring up some 

1622
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:09,334
sort of pathetic wish fulfillment,
why in the world would you tilt the 

1623
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:18,370
scales in that manner you think that's 
supposed to make people feel good?

1624
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:19,323
I don't think so.
There's almost nothing about this 

1625
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:24,280
picture that should make people feel 
good.

1626
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:25,593
It should if you understand it properly,
it should terrify you to the depths of 

1627
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:30,700
your soul.
That's what the picture is for.

1628
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:33,433
Therefore,
whosoever heareth these sayings of mine 

1629
01:33:34,791 --> 01:33:35,624
and do with them,
I will liken him unto a wise man which 

1630
01:33:37,581 --> 01:33:38,414
built his house upon a rock and the rain
descended and the winds blew and the 

1631
01:33:41,961 --> 01:33:42,794
floods came and beat upon the house and 
it fell not for it was founded upon a 

1632
01:33:46,461 --> 01:33:51,280
rock
and everyone that hears these sayings of

1633
01:33:51,281 --> 01:33:52,114
mine and do with them not,
she'll be likened unto a foolish man 

1634
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:54,963
which built his house upon the sand and 
the rain descended and the floods came 

1635
01:33:57,610 --> 01:34:00,700
and the winds blew and beat upon that 
house and it,

1636
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:02,860
oh,

1637
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:06,310
I made a mistake and it fell for.
It was founded upon the sand

1638
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:11,960
and it came to pass.
This is a very interesting line.

1639
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:14,360
I really,
I really know now,

1640
01:34:14,361 --> 01:34:15,194
and then you run across lines in this 
particularly happens in biblical 

1641
01:34:19,941 --> 01:34:20,774
settings.
You run across lines that you cannot 

1642
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:23,203
believe actually exists.
You cannot imagine how someone could 

1643
01:34:26,331 --> 01:34:27,164
have imagined up and conjured up the 
line and these two lines are like that 

1644
01:34:30,201 --> 01:34:31,034
as far as I'm concerned and it came to 
pass when Jesus had ended these sayings 

1645
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,633
that people were astonished at his 
doctrine for he taught them as one 

1646
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:37,934
having authority and not as the scribes 
and that's something so interesting 

1647
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:42,763
because that was another thing that 
really I didn't really appreciate about 

1648
01:34:44,991 --> 01:34:49,460
the churches that I attended to and that
would be that the lessons were taught by

1649
01:34:49,461 --> 01:34:54,461
scribes and the words were mouthed,
but there was no power in them.

1650
01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:56,180
There was no meaning in them.
It was.

1651
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:57,193
It was as if while it was like when I 
was 20 years old and I was saying all 

1652
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:01,940
these things,
I didn't mean,

1653
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,680
you know,
they were words that sounded good.

1654
01:35:03,681 --> 01:35:06,320
They were like,
like gilded cloth.

1655
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:08,810
I suppose that you can that you can wrap
around yourself,

1656
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:09,644
but there is no substance to them and 
there's a big difference between 

1657
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:13,423
listening to something that has 
substance and listening to something 

1658
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:17,354
that is spoken because it sounds like it
should sound good and this line says 

1659
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,144
that whoever spoke the lines that we 
just described with someone who sounded 

1660
01:35:28,311 --> 01:35:29,144
like he knew what he was talking about 
and not someone who is just repeating 

1661
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:33,554
something for the sake of sounding good,
and it certainly seems to me that the 

1662
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:41,981
lines that we just reviewed have the 
awesome impact of authority

1663
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:48,980
act to noah,

1664
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:51,710
but Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
Lord.

1665
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:52,993
These are the generations of Noah.
Noah was a just man and perfect in his 

1666
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:56,954
generations.
Noah walked with God and Noah began 

1667
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:00,080
three sons,
Shem,

1668
01:36:00,081 --> 01:36:01,610
Ham,
and Japheth.

1669
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,840
The Earth was also corrupt before God 
and the earth was full of violence,

1670
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:10,220
filled with violence.
Any of you see the new NRA ad?

1671
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,570
You might want to look that up.
I would say that's the most

1672
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:17,923
shocking manifestation of political 
polarization in the United States that 

1673
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:23,120
I've yet seen.
Most of it.

1674
01:36:23,121 --> 01:36:24,720
I've seen on the left,
right,

1675
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:27,320
the real,
what's shocked me mostly has been on the

1676
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:29,540
left,
but the new NRA ad,

1677
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:30,913
that's a whole new thing,
so it's this attractive woman and doing 

1678
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:35,774
a voiceover.
She kind of looks like Demi Moore 

1679
01:36:36,990 --> 01:36:38,240
though.
She's kind of tough looking.

1680
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:39,253
I guess Demi Moore could look tough now 
and then and she has contempt on her 

1681
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:43,544
face
and that's a dangerous thing and in the 

1682
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:53,561
background there's nothing but images of
antifa riots and Berkeley riots and fire

1683
01:36:55,581 --> 01:37:00,581
and protest and she's describing that is
a conspiracy.

1684
01:37:02,450 --> 01:37:03,283
Essentially a conspiracy that involves 
the intellectual elite including 

1685
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:08,690
Hollywood,
which is named by name.

1686
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:15,910
The accusation is that there is a cabal 
of corrupt intellectuals,

1687
01:37:17,301 --> 01:37:18,134
let's say,
who are bringing the country to its 

1688
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:22,214
knees and that it's time to get your God
damn guns and so look up that and see 

1689
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:28,964
what you think because
there's lots of people who would be 

1690
01:37:34,151 --> 01:37:34,984
perfectly happy if that was the 
direction in which we were headed and 

1691
01:37:37,811 --> 01:37:38,644
one of the things that I'm hoping is 
that we might be able to talk our way 

1692
01:37:41,051 --> 01:37:46,051
through it,
but we're in a situation where every act

1693
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:51,241
of individually individual idiocy will 
push us one iota closer to the break and

1694
01:37:54,041 --> 01:37:56,610
that'll make the 15 of the population

1695
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:01,000
or 30 percent of the population who 
would love to see everything degenerated

1696
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:01,834
into chaos.
Perfectly happy because that's their 

1697
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,970
aim.
Theorists,

1698
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:07,953
Salsa was corrupt before God and the 
earth was filled with violence and God 

1699
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:11,640
looked upon the earth.
And behold,

1700
01:38:11,641 --> 01:38:15,240
it was corrupt for all flesh is 
corrupted his way upon the earth.

1701
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:17,220
And Noah said,
and God said unto Noah,

1702
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,233
the end of all flesh has come before me.
For the earth is filled with violence 

1703
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:21,720
through them.
And behold,

1704
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:26,721
I will destroy them with the earth,
make the an ark of gopher wood rooms,

1705
01:38:27,091 --> 01:38:31,140
shall thou,
making the arch and then pitch it within

1706
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:34,110
and without with pitch.
And this is the fashion which thou shalt

1707
01:38:34,111 --> 01:38:34,944
make of it.
The length of the art shell be 300 

1708
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:37,380
cubits,
the breadth of it,

1709
01:38:37,381 --> 01:38:38,214
50 cubits and the height of it.
30 cubits window shelf they'll make to 

1710
01:38:41,461 --> 01:38:42,294
the arc in a cubit shelldale finishing 
above and the door of the Ark shelters 

1711
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:47,880
set in the side there of with lower 
second and third stories.

1712
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:52,900
Shallow Banket and behold,
I even I do bring a flood of waters upon

1713
01:38:54,091 --> 01:38:57,840
the earth to destroy all flesh wherein 
is the breath of life from under heaven.

1714
01:38:58,110 --> 01:39:00,150
Everything that is in the earth shall 
die,

1715
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,420
but with the I will establish my 
covenant.

1716
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:04,583
And now she'll come into the ark.
Thou and thy sons and my wife and they 

1717
01:39:06,901 --> 01:39:07,734
sons wives with the.
That's a fairly optimistic twist on the 

1718
01:39:10,621 --> 01:39:15,240
story because not only is it noah,
but he gets to save his whole family and

1719
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:16,074
down a couple of generations.
And so that's a good thing to think 

1720
01:39:18,151 --> 01:39:21,030
about.
It's like as things you know,

1721
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:26,330
I had this client
and she had a very hard upbringing,

1722
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:28,823
I would say,
not a lot of encouragement to say the 

1723
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:31,464
least,
let's say a fair bit of discouragement 

1724
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:38,630
and she had a son and what was really 
interesting about her in relationship to

1725
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:41,424
her son is that all the things that she 
could have learned to do to him given 

1726
01:39:45,151 --> 01:39:45,984
her extensive experience with being made
as miserable as possible by someone who 

1727
01:39:49,951 --> 01:39:51,900
was hell bent on bringing her to her 
knees.

1728
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,390
She refused to do to recent,
right?

1729
01:39:54,391 --> 01:39:58,290
She learned the opposite lesson from all
her misery and torment,

1730
01:39:58,291 --> 01:40:00,900
which was not to move that forward down 
the generations.

1731
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:01,734
And so the idea here is that if you walk
properly and improperly and act 

1732
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:10,170
properly,
if you walk with God in this manner that

1733
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:13,080
we've been discussing,
is that perhaps that isn't only good for

1734
01:40:13,081 --> 01:40:13,914
you.
Perhaps it's also the thing that will 

1735
01:40:15,001 --> 01:40:15,834
save your family and then by implication
perhaps save society because that's 

1736
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,660
exactly what happens with Noah,
right?

1737
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:24,690
First attempt and then it's his family,
but everything else goes.

1738
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:25,943
And so by saving himself,
by acting properly and by saving his 

1739
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:31,800
family,
he actually saves the world.

1740
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:34,110
It's interesting,
you know,

1741
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:34,944
like the most profound people that I've 
read who've meditated deeply on the 

1742
01:40:39,061 --> 01:40:41,400
problem,
say of totalitarian catastrophe.

1743
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:44,100
And I would put Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 
at the top of that list,

1744
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:46,100
you know,
hit the,

1745
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:50,580
his,
his entire Corpus three volume 700 pages

1746
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:55,090
long.
Each in tiny type is a long scream about

1747
01:40:55,091 --> 01:40:55,924
the absolute necessity of individual,
the absolute necessity of individual 

1748
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:04,673
honesty and ethical behavior as the only
bulwark against totalitarian 

1749
01:41:09,421 --> 01:41:11,130
catastrophe.
And the,

1750
01:41:11,460 --> 01:41:12,293
and I've read many writers who've 
attempted to diagnose the problems of 

1751
01:41:16,081 --> 01:41:19,710
the 20th century.
And I think Solzhenitsyn,

1752
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:22,523
he came to the same conclusions that 
Victor Frankel came to as a consequence 

1753
01:41:25,831 --> 01:41:29,740
of his experiences in the Nazi 
concentration camps and Frankel.

1754
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,023
I'm also an admirer of Franklin,
but social units and takes it to an 

1755
01:41:33,451 --> 01:41:37,410
entire different level of profundity and
makes them extraordinarily strong.

1756
01:41:37,411 --> 01:41:38,244
Case that not only do societies 
deteriorate because the people within 

1757
01:41:43,171 --> 01:41:45,300
the societies become individually 
corrupt,

1758
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:46,343
but that the only way to stave that off 
is for the individuals within that 

1759
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:50,394
society to reject that corruption in the
in the confines of their own personal 

1760
01:41:53,671 --> 01:41:58,470
lives and he tells endless stories of 
people that he met in the Gulag,

1761
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,480
in the work camps,
in the death camps,

1762
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:03,000
in the Soviet Union of people,
and this is what he learned.

1763
01:42:03,001 --> 01:42:03,834
If people who are so incredibly tough 
that even under conditions the most 

1764
01:42:08,761 --> 01:42:09,594
possible extreme conditions,
there wasn't a chance that they were 

1765
01:42:12,931 --> 01:42:15,060
going to step off that straight narrow 
line.

1766
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,223
There was nothing the authorities could 
do to move them and just watching that 

1767
01:42:21,331 --> 01:42:22,164
was enough to transform soldier knits 
and because of course one of the things 

1768
01:42:24,301 --> 01:42:25,134
he wondered was after spending a good 
amount of time in the work camps was 

1769
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,780
well just exactly how did I get here?
And it wasn't.

1770
01:42:33,781 --> 01:42:34,614
Well,
it was Hitler's fault and it was 

1771
01:42:35,431 --> 01:42:36,264
[inaudible] fault.
Although it was definitely the fault of 

1772
01:42:37,471 --> 01:42:40,050
both of them for social incident was 
well,

1773
01:42:40,051 --> 01:42:43,380
it was also his fault because he was 
playing the same game.

1774
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:48,390
He just wasn't as good at it
and of every living thing of all flesh,

1775
01:42:48,391 --> 01:42:49,224
two of every sort shall they'll bring 
into the ark to keep them alive with 

1776
01:42:51,550 --> 01:42:53,400
you.
They shall be male and female,

1777
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:55,640
and so the they.
There's A.

1778
01:42:55,690 --> 01:43:00,690
There's another message in this story 
which is that it isn't only Noah and his

1779
01:43:00,861 --> 01:43:01,694
family and human society that's 
dependent on Noah's appropriate actions 

1780
01:43:06,591 --> 01:43:10,220
in the world.
It's the entire living planet

1781
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:16,720
and in an era of excessive and extreme 
and genuinely disingenuous environmental

1782
01:43:19,881 --> 01:43:20,714
catastrophizing,
that's something to consider very 

1783
01:43:23,811 --> 01:43:26,000
seriously.
Think

1784
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:35,090
perhaps there's nothing better that you 
can do for everything.

1785
01:43:35,091 --> 01:43:35,924
All things considered,
including those things that are outside 

1786
01:43:38,031 --> 01:43:42,980
the confines of human society than to 
get your act together and align yourself

1787
01:43:42,981 --> 01:43:46,490
properly along all of the dimensions of 
your being,

1788
01:43:46,491 --> 01:43:47,600
from,
from,

1789
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:52,400
from the tiniest microcosm to the,
to the macrocosm,

1790
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:55,160
and that's the way that all of being is 
redeemed.

1791
01:43:56,650 --> 01:44:01,130
That's what the story suggests
and we read it.

1792
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:03,380
You know a cynical,
modern people,

1793
01:44:03,381 --> 01:44:08,000
we read it as if it was written by 
primitive people who thought that it was

1794
01:44:08,001 --> 01:44:12,300
really the case that someone could build
a boat and put two of every kind into it

1795
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,090
and thereby save the world.

1796
01:44:17,210 --> 01:44:21,140
It's embarrassing to see things 
interpreted in a manner that shallow,

1797
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:25,400
especially by people who don't have 
ignorance as a justification.

1798
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:27,710
You know these stories have to appeal to
everyone.

1799
01:44:27,711 --> 01:44:28,544
Right,
and there's lots of people in the world 

1800
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:30,494
who aren't very bright and so they tend 
to take things concretely like a child 

1801
01:44:34,191 --> 01:44:37,640
would take things concretely if you read
them a story and this story can be taken

1802
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:38,474
concretely,
but it has to be because the stories 

1803
01:44:40,311 --> 01:44:42,500
have to be for everyone,
but if you're a sophisticated,

1804
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,543
that doesn't mean that you should 
dismiss it as if it's written for a 

1805
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:47,264
child.
It's maybe you have the obligation to 

1806
01:44:48,381 --> 01:44:49,214
look a bit deeper and think for a moment
that it wouldn't been conserved for 

1807
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:52,424
these many thousands of years.
If there wasn't something more to it 

1808
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:57,830
than a casual intellectual dismissal 
would indicate

1809
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:03,240
and take the onto the of all food that 
is eaten and thou shalt gather it to the

1810
01:45:03,241 --> 01:45:06,140
end shall be food for the end for them.
Thus did noah.

1811
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:10,580
According to all that God commanded him.
So did he,

1812
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:14,900
and the Lord said unto Noah,
come down and all the house into the arc

1813
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:19,400
for the I've seen righteous before me.
In this generation of every clean beast

1814
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:21,343
thou shalt take to the by sevens,
the male and female and obese that are 

1815
01:45:23,601 --> 01:45:24,434
clean,
not clean by to the male and who's 

1816
01:45:25,851 --> 01:45:26,684
female.
And,

1817
01:45:26,750 --> 01:45:28,580
uh,
follows also of the air by sevens,

1818
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:29,414
the male and the female,
to keep seed alive upon the face of all 

1819
01:45:31,770 --> 01:45:36,470
the earth for yet seven days,
I will cause it to rain upon the earth.

1820
01:45:36,471 --> 01:45:37,304
Forty days and 40 nights.
And every living substance that I've 

1821
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,360
made will I destroy from off the face of
the earth.

1822
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,960
And Noah did according unto all that the
Lord commanded him.

1823
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:50,150
And Noah was 600 years old when the 
flood of waters was upon the earth.

1824
01:45:50,990 --> 01:45:51,823
And Noah went in and his sons and his 
wife and his sons wives with them into 

1825
01:45:54,141 --> 01:45:58,070
the arc because of the waters of the 
flood of clean beasts and obese that are

1826
01:45:58,071 --> 01:46:00,890
not cleaning the fouls and have 
everything that creepeth upon the earth.

1827
01:46:00,890 --> 01:46:03,770
They went in to and to and to know into 
the arc,

1828
01:46:03,771 --> 01:46:05,930
the male and the female as God had 
commanded Noah.

1829
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:07,123
And it came to pass after seven days 
that the waters of the flood were upon 

1830
01:46:10,641 --> 01:46:13,580
the earth.
In the 600th year of Noah's life.

1831
01:46:13,581 --> 01:46:16,040
In the second month,
the 17th day of the month,

1832
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:16,903
the same day.
We're all the fountains of the great 

1833
01:46:18,771 --> 01:46:19,604
deep broken up and the windows of Heaven
were opened and the rain was upon the 

1834
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:24,920
earth.
Forty days and 40 nights.

1835
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:27,980
And the selfsame day entered Noah and 
chairman,

1836
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:30,710
Ham and Japheth,
sons of Noah and Noah,

1837
01:46:30,711 --> 01:46:33,320
his wife,
and the three wives of his sons with him

1838
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:34,813
into the arc.
They in every beast after his kind and 

1839
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:38,453
all of the cattle after their kind and 
every creeping thing that creepeth upon 

1840
01:46:40,651 --> 01:46:43,440
the earth after his kind and every fowl 
after his kind,

1841
01:46:43,441 --> 01:46:45,450
every bird of every sort of they went 
into noah,

1842
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,010
unto Noah,
into the Ark,

1843
01:46:47,011 --> 01:46:50,340
to and to have all flesh.
We're in is the breath of life

1844
01:46:55,400 --> 01:47:00,400
that makes no the ultimate shepherd,
right shepherd of all things

1845
01:47:05,050 --> 01:47:07,720
tender of the garden and shepherd of all
things.

1846
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:11,380
That's a hell of a role

1847
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:15,190
and maybe that's the one that keeps you 
afloat during the flood

1848
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:18,690
and the that went in,
went in,

1849
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:19,524
male and female of all flesh is God had 
commanded him and the Lord shut him in 

1850
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:25,760
and the flood was 40 days upon the earth
and the waters increased and bear up the

1851
01:47:25,761 --> 01:47:26,594
ark and it was lifted up above the earth
and the waters prevailed and were 

1852
01:47:29,151 --> 01:47:29,984
increased greatly upon the earth.
15 cubits upward did the waters prevail 

1853
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:39,281
and the mountains were covered
and all flesh died.

1854
01:47:40,861 --> 01:47:43,830
That moved upon the earth.
Both have fallen of cattle and the beast

1855
01:47:43,831 --> 01:47:45,900
and over every creeping thing that 
creepeth upon the earth.

1856
01:47:45,901 --> 01:47:46,734
And every man and all in whose nostrils 
was the breath of life of all that was 

1857
01:47:50,731 --> 01:47:52,620
in the dry land,
died

1858
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:57,860
in every living substance was destroyed,
which was upon the face of the earth,

1859
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:59,293
both man and cattle and the creeping 
things in the fall of the heaven and 

1860
01:48:01,911 --> 01:48:02,744
they were destroyed from the earth and 
no only remained alive and they that 

1861
01:48:05,631 --> 01:48:08,840
were with him in the Ark and the water's
prevailed upon the earth.

1862
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:10,430
One hundred and 50 days

1863
01:48:12,460 --> 01:48:13,293
and God remembered no on every living 
thing and all the capital that was with 

1864
01:48:15,371 --> 01:48:16,204
him in the Ark.
And God made a wind to pass over the 

1865
01:48:18,161 --> 01:48:18,994
earth and the waters receded the 
fountains also of the deep and the 

1866
01:48:23,141 --> 01:48:23,974
windows of heaven were stopped in.
The rain from heaven was restrained and 

1867
01:48:25,901 --> 01:48:28,120
the water's returned from off the earth 
continually.

1868
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:31,330
And after the end of 150 days,
the waters were abated.

1869
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:35,860
And the Ark rested in the seventh month.
On the Seventeenth Day of the month upon

1870
01:48:35,861 --> 01:48:36,694
the mountains of error rat.
And the water's decreased continually 

1871
01:48:38,711 --> 01:48:40,960
until the 10th month.
In the 10th month,

1872
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:43,900
on the first day of the month where the 
tops of the mountain scene

1873
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:46,333
and it came to pass at the end of 40 
days that Noah opened the window of the 

1874
01:48:48,621 --> 01:48:49,454
Ark,
which he had made and he sent forth a 

1875
01:48:50,241 --> 01:48:54,440
raven which went to and fro until the 
waters were dried up from off the earth,

1876
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:56,203
and he also sent forth a dove from him 
to see if the waters were abated from 

1877
01:48:58,641 --> 01:48:59,474
off the face of the ground,
but the dove found no rest for the sole 

1878
01:49:01,551 --> 01:49:04,550
of her foot.
And she returned onto him in the Ark for

1879
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:06,560
the waters were on the face of the whole
earth.

1880
01:49:06,830 --> 01:49:10,610
That he put forth his hand and took her 
and pulled her in unto him into the Ark.

1881
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:11,623
And he stayed yet another seven days.
And again he sent forth the dove out of 

1882
01:49:14,481 --> 01:49:15,314
the Ark.
And the devil came into him in the 

1883
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:20,120
evening and low in her mouth was an all 
of leaf plucked off.

1884
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:23,060
So no one knew that the waters were 
abated from off the earth.

1885
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:27,020
And he stayed there yet another seven 
days and sent forth the dove.

1886
01:49:27,021 --> 01:49:27,854
Which returned not again onto him any 
more and it came to pass in the 600th 

1887
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:34,190
and first year in the first month,
the first day of the month,

1888
01:49:34,191 --> 01:49:35,024
the waters were dried up from off the 
earth and Noah removed the covering of 

1889
01:49:38,481 --> 01:49:40,160
the orchid,
looked up and behold,

1890
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:41,930
the face of the ground was dry

1891
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:47,710
and in the second month on the seventh 
and 20th day of the month was the dried.

1892
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:51,310
And God spake unto Noah saying,
go forth of the arc,

1893
01:49:51,311 --> 01:49:52,144
thou and thy wife and they sons and 
their sons waves with the bring forth 

1894
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:59,260
with the every living thing that is with
the of all flesh,

1895
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:00,333
both of fall,
end of cattle and over every creeping 

1896
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:02,674
thing that creepeth upon the earth.
That they may breed abundantly in the 

1897
01:50:05,831 --> 01:50:08,050
earth and be fruitful and multiply upon 
the earth.

1898
01:50:08,051 --> 01:50:11,230
And Noah went forth and his sons and his
wife and his sons wives with him.

1899
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:15,460
Every beast creeping thing every fall 
and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth.

1900
01:50:15,461 --> 01:50:17,590
After their kinds went forth out of the 
Ark.

1901
01:50:18,990 --> 01:50:22,690
And Noah built an altar unto the Lord 
and took of every clean beast.

1902
01:50:22,691 --> 01:50:26,380
And of every clean foul and offered 
burnt offerings on the altar,

1903
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:29,770
immediate returns to the sacrificial 
motif

1904
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:38,050
and the Lord smelled a sweet savor and 
that's known as proper sacrifice.

1905
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,633
And the Lord said into his heart,
I will not again curse the ground 

1906
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:43,054
anymore for man's sake,
for the imagination of Man's heart is 

1907
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:49,900
evil from his youth.
Neither will I again smite anymore.

1908
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:50,734
Every living thing has I have done while
the Earth remaineth seed time and 

1909
01:50:53,831 --> 01:50:55,960
harvest,
cold and heat in summer and winter,

1910
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:58,000
day and night shall not cease.

1911
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,110
And God blessed Noah and his sons and 
said unto them,

1912
01:51:02,111 --> 01:51:02,944
be fruitful and multiply and replenish 
the earth and the fear of you and the 

1913
01:51:06,821 --> 01:51:07,654
dread of you shall be upon every beast 
of the earth and upon every fowl of the 

1914
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:15,541
air upon all that Moveth upon the earth 
upon all the fishes of the sea into your

1915
01:51:15,761 --> 01:51:20,761
hand or they delivered.
No.

1916
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,580
I've heard commentators,
David Suzuki,

1917
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:31,414
for example,
who claim that the substructure of 

1918
01:51:37,461 --> 01:51:42,461
Western culture
in lines such as this

1919
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:49,870
deliver the earth over to human beings 
and justify our ravaging of the,

1920
01:51:51,050 --> 01:51:52,330
of,
of,

1921
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:53,563
of being.
But I don't think that that's a very 

1922
01:51:57,351 --> 01:51:58,184
careful reading,
and it seems to me that given such 

1923
01:52:01,911 --> 01:52:02,744
matters,
given the importance of such matters 

1924
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:07,010
that are very close reading is actually 
necessary.

1925
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,143
You know,
in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam 

1926
01:52:11,451 --> 01:52:12,284
and eve are thrown out of the garden,
God tells eve that she's going to be 

1927
01:52:16,281 --> 01:52:17,114
subordinated to her husband.
He doesn't say that that's what should 

1928
01:52:19,731 --> 01:52:23,450
happen.
He says that's what's going to happen.

1929
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:24,733
And the same thing as far as I'm 
concerned is contained in lines like 

1930
01:52:27,441 --> 01:52:31,040
this isn't necessarily that this is 
something that should happen.

1931
01:52:31,041 --> 01:52:34,670
It's something that did happen.
It's quite remarkable.

1932
01:52:34,690 --> 01:52:35,523
You know,
to think about how long ago these lines 

1933
01:52:38,241 --> 01:52:39,074
were penned,
it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 19 

1934
01:52:41,631 --> 01:52:45,830
sixties that we had dominated the earth 
so completely that it's very

1935
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,143
future existence was in our hands.
And that's a prophetic element of this 

1936
01:52:51,291 --> 01:52:56,291
tale
and the fear of you and the dread of you

1937
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:57,434
shall be upon every beast of the earth 
and upon every fowl of the air and upon 

1938
01:52:59,871 --> 01:53:00,704
all that Moveth upon the earth and upon 
all the fishes of the sea into your 

1939
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:05,630
hand.
Are they delivered?

1940
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:06,943
It's like that's exactly right.
Every moving thing that lives shall be 

1941
01:53:11,101 --> 01:53:11,934
meat for you.
Even as the green herb I've given you 

1942
01:53:13,441 --> 01:53:14,274
all things,
have I given you all things but flesh 

1943
01:53:16,651 --> 01:53:18,590
with the life therapy,
which is the blood thereof,

1944
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:24,060
shall you not eat
and surely your blood of your lives will

1945
01:53:24,711 --> 01:53:28,040
I require at the hand of every beast 
will I required in at the hand of man at

1946
01:53:28,041 --> 01:53:30,710
the hand of every man's brother will I 
require the life of man?

1947
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:31,933
This is a hard section to interpret,
but what it means is something like 

1948
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:35,684
this,
God describes the dominion over the 

1949
01:53:39,381 --> 01:53:44,381
planet that revivified humanity will 
have and notes the power that goes along

1950
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:48,890
with that and then puts a limitation on 
it.

1951
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,173
And the limitation is
maintain the sanctity of life despite 

1952
01:53:55,221 --> 01:53:56,054
your power.
And although it's not easy to extract 

1953
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:02,270
from the manner in which this has been 
translated,

1954
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,650
what God is telling Noah is that if you 
kill yourself,

1955
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:10,430
if you kill someone else,
and if any animal kills a human being,

1956
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:12,920
that there will be a price to pay for 
that.

1957
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:14,240
So there's a

1958
01:54:15,210 --> 01:54:16,043
an opportunity which is that the 
descendants of Noah can dominate the 

1959
01:54:20,101 --> 01:54:23,160
earth,
but there's a moral limitation placed on

1960
01:54:23,161 --> 01:54:23,994
that which is nonetheless,
life itself is to be regarded as 

1961
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:33,740
sanctified in sacred.
Whoever shared with man's blood,

1962
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:36,044
by man shall his blood be shed,
for in the image of God made he man and 

1963
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:41,384
you be fruitful and multiply.
Bring forth abundantly in the earth and 

1964
01:54:44,391 --> 01:54:49,391
multiply their in
and God speaking to Noah and to his sons

1965
01:54:49,421 --> 01:54:50,254
with him saying,
and I behold I establish my covenant 

1966
01:54:52,631 --> 01:54:53,464
with you and with your seat after you 
and with every living creature that is 

1967
01:54:55,871 --> 01:54:57,790
with you,
have the fall in the cattle and to every

1968
01:54:57,791 --> 01:55:00,570
beast of earth that is with you.
For all that,

1969
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:02,620
go out of the art to every beast of the 
earth.

1970
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,550
And I will establish my covenant with 
you.

1971
01:55:09,180 --> 01:55:12,120
Neither shall all flesh be cut off 
anymore by the waters of the flood.

1972
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:15,390
Neither shall there be any more.
A flood to destroy the earth,

1973
01:55:16,810 --> 01:55:17,643
and God said,
this is the token of the covenant which 

1974
01:55:18,941 --> 01:55:21,400
I make between me and you and every 
living creature that is with you.

1975
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:22,234
For perpetual generations.
I do set my bow in the cloud and it 

1976
01:55:25,241 --> 01:55:26,074
shall be for a token of a covenant 
between me and the Earth and it shall 

1977
01:55:28,391 --> 01:55:32,080
come to pass when I bring a cloud over 
the earth that the bow bow shall be seen

1978
01:55:32,081 --> 01:55:36,160
in the cloud and I will remember my 
covenant which is between me and you and

1979
01:55:36,161 --> 01:55:39,400
every living creature of all flesh and 
the waters shall no more become a flood.

1980
01:55:39,401 --> 01:55:40,234
To destroy all flesh.
There's a negotiated agreement there of 

1981
01:55:43,471 --> 01:55:44,304
sorts

1982
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:45,383
and then negotiated agreement is
as far as I can tell to the degree that 

1983
01:55:51,601 --> 01:55:55,200
humanity agrees to act in the manner of 
Noah.

1984
01:55:55,860 --> 01:56:00,860
Then the threat of catastrophic 
destruction will remain at bay

1985
01:56:10,110 --> 01:56:10,943
and the bose shall be in the cloud.
And I will look upon it that I may 

1986
01:56:12,571 --> 01:56:15,480
remember the everlasting covenant 
between God and every living creature of

1987
01:56:15,481 --> 01:56:18,720
all flesh that is upon the earth.
And God said unto Noah,

1988
01:56:18,990 --> 01:56:19,823
this is the token of the covenant which 
I have established between me and all 

1989
01:56:22,621 --> 01:56:23,454
flesh that is upon the earth.
This is the token of the covenant which 

1990
01:56:31,351 --> 01:56:34,860
I have established between me and all 
flesh that is upon the earth.

1991
01:56:38,510 --> 01:56:39,343
So that's a good place to stop.
And there's no lecture next week by the 

1992
01:56:43,941 --> 01:56:45,530
way,
because the theater was booked.

1993
01:56:45,531 --> 01:56:48,560
So there'll be a one week break and then
when we get back,

1994
01:56:48,561 --> 01:56:52,220
we'll finish the story of Noah.
There's not much left of it.

1995
01:56:53,050 --> 01:56:55,550
We'll talk about the tower of Babel,
which is a very short story,

1996
01:56:55,551 --> 01:56:56,990
but a very,
very interesting one.

1997
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:59,990
And then we'll move on to the story of 
Abraham.

1998
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,960
And so thank you very much for coming 
in.

1999
01:57:02,961 --> 01:57:03,460
We'll see you again

2000
01:57:03,460 --> 01:57:08,460
two weeks.
Thank you.

2001
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:24,183
Now is the person who has the 
notification for the meetup after this 

2002
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:30,070
here and do they have the notification?
Okay.

2003
01:57:30,071 --> 01:57:31,720
Because if you give that to me this 
time,

2004
01:57:31,721 --> 01:57:34,090
I'll remember to read it before everyone
leaves.

2005
01:57:34,970 --> 01:57:38,410
So do you want to start?
Okay.

2006
01:57:38,411 --> 01:57:39,244
So see,
let's see if the mic is working because 

2007
01:57:42,911 --> 01:57:45,280
lots of people will listen to this 
question and so.

2008
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,170
Okay.
Okay.

2009
01:57:48,210 --> 01:57:50,850
So you said on a recent live stream that
you were two,

2010
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:52,800
you didn't have enough energy to answer 
this question,

2011
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:57,860
but you said it was intriguing.
So I was wondering if you had the energy

2012
01:57:58,231 --> 01:58:03,231
to answer how someone might help someone
that has borderline personality disorder

2013
01:58:06,740 --> 01:58:11,360
by example,
by example.

2014
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:15,350
You have an example?
No,

2015
01:58:15,740 --> 01:58:16,181
no,
no,

2016
01:58:16,181 --> 01:58:18,280
I don't.
I don't mean that precisely.

2017
01:58:18,281 --> 01:58:19,114
I mean that the.
Let's not take borderline personality 

2018
01:58:22,391 --> 01:58:24,610
disorder precisely as the example.
Okay.

2019
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:25,743
I understand the question.
The question to some degree is how do 

2020
01:58:28,961 --> 01:58:33,961
you help someone that's lost and the 
answer to that is if they aren't willing

2021
01:58:34,331 --> 01:58:36,550
to not be lost,
you cannot help them.

2022
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:40,650
And I would also say that as a clinician
you see,

2023
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:43,810
I mean it's,
it's a statement that's informed,

2024
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:48,900
I would say by mythological knowledge,
but also by straight clinical wisdom,

2025
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:52,930
not mine particularly.
I mean,

2026
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:53,863
one of the things that Carl Rogers 
pointed out was that there were 

2027
01:58:55,271 --> 01:58:58,830
necessary preconditions for entering 
into a therapeutic relationship and that

2028
01:58:58,831 --> 01:58:59,664
that would be really any relationship 
where the mutual flourishing of the two 

2029
01:59:02,621 --> 01:59:03,454
people involved was the paramount goal 
and one of the preconditions was that 

2030
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:08,253
both people have to want that to happen 
and Rogers believed he didn't know how 

2031
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:17,050
to get the horse to drink once you had 
brought it to the water.

2032
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:21,310
And I've thought about that a lot 
because when people are really lost,

2033
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:26,610
sometimes they're so lost that
they can't be found and I think the only

2034
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:28,684
thing that you can do in a situation 
like that is get your life together and 

2035
01:59:33,191 --> 01:59:37,420
she and manifest the reality of an 
alternative motive being.

2036
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:38,913
That's what you've got.
And so that's the only way I knew of to 

2037
01:59:43,511 --> 01:59:44,344
solve an intractable problem.
And I would say the reason that I went 

2038
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:52,180
down that direction with regards to 
borderline personality disorders.

2039
01:59:52,181 --> 01:59:54,860
Because it's one of the most serious of 
the personality disorders.

2040
01:59:54,861 --> 01:59:55,694
It's very difficult to treat.
And so I'll generalize from that to 

2041
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:03,760
situations that are very difficult to 
deal with.

2042
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,980
And you know,
there's a statement too,

2043
02:00:05,981 --> 02:00:09,250
and this has nothing to do with 
borderline personality disorder per se.

2044
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:12,160
There's a statement in the new testament
that's really vicious.

2045
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:13,450
In fact,
there's a number of them,

2046
02:00:13,451 --> 02:00:14,284
but this is a particularly vicious one 
and that is don't cast pearls before 

2047
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:19,204
swine.

2048
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:24,100
And what that means is if you're trying 
to help and it doesn't work,

2049
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:28,030
then stop helping.
It's not helping,

2050
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,550
right?
It may be just wasting your time.

2051
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,980
It might be making things worse.
Now,

2052
02:00:33,010 --> 02:00:33,843
if you're,
if you're offering something and it's 

2053
02:00:35,111 --> 02:00:35,944
not taken,
then perhaps you should be offering it 

2054
02:00:38,171 --> 02:00:43,030
somewhere else.
And sometimes if you offer hand in,

2055
02:00:43,031 --> 02:00:46,030
the person won't take it.
You have to stop offering the hand.

2056
02:00:46,660 --> 02:00:50,440
And then what you do is you go off and 
you have your life.

2057
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:52,540
And sometimes that means in people's 
lives,

2058
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:53,374
for example,
that they have to leave their family 

2059
02:00:54,191 --> 02:00:56,500
members behind.
There's a scene in the new testament.

2060
02:00:56,501 --> 02:00:59,950
This is another very hard scene where 
Christ is walking down the road with his

2061
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:02,710
disciples.
I hope I've got this story right,

2062
02:01:02,711 --> 02:01:04,000
but I've got it essentially.
Right,

2063
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:05,133
and his mother calls to him and says,
I believe that he's supposed to come 

2064
02:01:08,801 --> 02:01:09,634
back to the home because his uncle has 
died and that there's going to be a 

2065
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:15,004
funeral,
and he turns to his mother and says 

2066
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:20,770
something like,
let the dead bury their dead.

2067
02:01:20,950 --> 02:01:24,190
I'm about my father's business.
It's something like that.

2068
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:26,530
And you read that and you think,
Huh,

2069
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:29,640
that should have been edited out.
No,

2070
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:32,320
but it shouldn't have been edited out 
because it's exactly right,

2071
02:01:32,321 --> 02:01:33,154
because sometimes the thing you do is 
walk away because there's no other 

2072
02:01:37,750 --> 02:01:38,583
solution and if you are trapped in 
pathological relationships and you see 

2073
02:01:42,801 --> 02:01:43,790
no way out of them,
if you.

2074
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:44,953
If someone who is sinking has their 
hands around your neck and is pulling 

2075
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:50,540
you down,
you're not obligated to drown with them.

2076
02:01:51,540 --> 02:01:52,460
No.
There's a rule to.

2077
02:01:52,461 --> 02:01:53,294
If you're a lifeguard,
you know some of you have had lifeguard 

2078
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:56,143
training.
How do you approach someone who's 

2079
02:01:57,171 --> 02:02:00,800
drowning and panicking in the water feed
out?

2080
02:02:00,830 --> 02:02:02,180
Right?
Like this?

2081
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:04,040
It's like,
I'll save you,

2082
02:02:04,190 --> 02:02:05,023
but that doesn't mean you get to drown 
me while I'm doing it and if it's you 

2083
02:02:08,901 --> 02:02:12,350
drown or both of us drown.
It's you drown.

2084
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:17,030
And that's wisdom.
That's not cruelty,

2085
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:20,780
right?
So Yep.

2086
02:02:27,660 --> 02:02:31,040
Couple of questions about dialogue and 
engaging in dialogue with people.

2087
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:36,041
So the first issue that I face is a,
I have a very high need for intellectual

2088
02:02:36,051 --> 02:02:40,070
stimulation and I don't get that with 
most people.

2089
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:41,590
It's something like,
um,

2090
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,300
you can,
you can have a dialogue for a time,

2091
02:02:44,301 --> 02:02:48,110
but then it titrate openness.
Yeah.

2092
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:49,853
But then they started running out of 
ideas they can keep up and it sort of 

2093
02:02:53,310 --> 02:02:54,143
falls apart and okay,
this is a problem that intellectuals 

2094
02:02:56,081 --> 02:02:59,910
have quite frequently is that they sort 
of,

2095
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:02,320
once they start treating difficult to 
devoting stuff,

2096
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:03,393
they,
they stopped wanting to talk to regular 

2097
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:06,844
people and I think that contributes to 
the disconnect that you see between the 

2098
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:12,520
intellectuals and working class people 
and stuff like that.

2099
02:03:12,970 --> 02:03:15,110
And the other question I had was about,
okay,

2100
02:03:15,111 --> 02:03:16,700
wait,
I don't know if that's the question.

2101
02:03:18,500 --> 02:03:20,000
I believe there's a question in there,
but I.

2102
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:21,530
The question is how,
how do you,

2103
02:03:21,720 --> 02:03:22,553
how should we address that,
how should I address it and is that 

2104
02:03:26,461 --> 02:03:27,720
something that can be dressed?
Well?

2105
02:03:27,721 --> 02:03:30,930
Part of part of the answer to that is 
that's what the universities were for.

2106
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:32,230
I mean,
you know,

2107
02:03:32,250 --> 02:03:33,083
not everybody is equipped to or 
interested in engaging in high level 

2108
02:03:37,711 --> 02:03:39,840
discussion of abstract and creative 
ideas.

2109
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:40,853
You know,
you hear this idea that everyone's 

2110
02:03:41,641 --> 02:03:43,500
creative.
That's a lie.

2111
02:03:44,370 --> 02:03:46,260
It's a straightforward,
is that true?

2112
02:03:46,261 --> 02:03:49,410
Creativity is very,
very rare and so,

2113
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:50,393
and if you happen to be a creative 
person or if you happen to be someone 

2114
02:03:52,771 --> 02:03:56,910
who's profoundly interested in ideas,
you are in a pronounced minority.

2115
02:03:57,060 --> 02:03:57,893
Just as you are,
if you happen to be extremely 

2116
02:03:59,101 --> 02:04:02,340
extroverted or extremely agreeable,
are extremely conscientious.

2117
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:07,230
These are minority issues and what you 
do is you find likeminded people who are

2118
02:04:07,231 --> 02:04:08,064
capable of engaging that we know a 
heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters 

2119
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:13,523
compete with heavyweight weightlifters 
for a reason and everyone thinks that's 

2120
02:04:16,651 --> 02:04:17,484
fine,
and the same thing applies to 

2121
02:04:18,691 --> 02:04:20,240
intellectual and creative endeavors.

2122
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:25,050
So what you do is you try to find a 
community where that's,

2123
02:04:26,340 --> 02:04:27,173
that's the nature of the community.
And you likely have to find a 

2124
02:04:29,281 --> 02:04:31,800
relationship like that as well.
You know,

2125
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:32,663
so I don't think so.
I think what contributes to the siloing 

2126
02:04:36,241 --> 02:04:39,330
is the arrogance goes along with it 
because if you're,

2127
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:43,440
you can be interested in ideas and you 
can be creative.

2128
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:45,750
Well that's the arrogance of the 
intellect,

2129
02:04:45,751 --> 02:04:47,430
right?
That's the thing the Catholic Church had

2130
02:04:47,431 --> 02:04:50,010
warned about for centuries is the 
arrogance of the intellect.

2131
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:51,323
So because if you're,
if you're wise as well as smart and 

2132
02:04:54,151 --> 02:04:56,910
there is no relationship between being 
smart and being wise,

2133
02:04:56,911 --> 02:04:57,744
they are not the same thing.
There's no quick pathway from smart to 

2134
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:01,434
wise.
And many of the people who I've known 

2135
02:05:03,391 --> 02:05:04,224
who were very wise were,
some of them were intellectually 

2136
02:05:06,721 --> 02:05:11,580
impaired and we're still wise.
So it's the arrogance that brings up the

2137
02:05:11,581 --> 02:05:12,030
block.

2138
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:13,560
And I see this,
for example,

2139
02:05:13,561 --> 02:05:14,394
happening in the United States in 
particular because the last time I went 

2140
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:17,940
down there,
for example,

2141
02:05:17,941 --> 02:05:18,774
I was,
I had friends down there and some of 

2142
02:05:20,581 --> 02:05:21,414
those friends are very,
very smart people and some of them were 

2143
02:05:23,701 --> 02:05:28,080
talking about the trump voters and they 
were talking about the trump voters with

2144
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:28,914
contempt and I thought you better watch 
that because that's 50 percent of the 

2145
02:05:32,821 --> 02:05:33,654
dam population and it might be 
convenient to think that they're stupid 

2146
02:05:36,871 --> 02:05:37,704
and beneath you,
but it's not conducive to a civil state 

2147
02:05:40,440 --> 02:05:41,273
and there's no evidence that it's true 
because there isn't a straight line 

2148
02:05:45,061 --> 02:05:48,570
between intelligent and wise.
And so I think that if your,

2149
02:05:49,110 --> 02:05:52,410
if your character is developed and 
you're intelligent,

2150
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:55,620
you can have your siloed,
creative community,

2151
02:05:56,010 --> 02:05:56,843
but you develop enough wisdom so that 
you can see all the things that people 

2152
02:05:59,701 --> 02:06:00,534
can do that or have high ethical utility
that are outside the intellectual 

2153
02:06:03,871 --> 02:06:04,704
domain.

2154
02:06:04,980 --> 02:06:05,813
You know?
And I think that's why in the New 

2155
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:08,273
Testament,
I think that's why Christ is a 

2156
02:06:08,551 --> 02:06:10,920
carpenter,
right?

2157
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:12,180
Because,
well,

2158
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:17,130
first of all,
carpenter is one of those jobs that when

2159
02:06:17,131 --> 02:06:17,964
you're dishonest,
it manifests itself immediately because 

2160
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:22,920
what you build falls down,
and so if you're known as carpenter,

2161
02:06:22,921 --> 02:06:25,380
you build a good house.
So there's a nice metaphor there,

2162
02:06:25,381 --> 02:06:26,214
but it's also.
It's also a warning in some sense 

2163
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:34,640
against the the equation of intellectual
brilliance with moral superiority.

2164
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:38,213
And so if the intellects would drop 
their moral superiority and fat chance 

2165
02:06:41,641 --> 02:06:42,474
there is of that,
then that divide between the working 

2166
02:06:45,421 --> 02:06:50,421
class say and the elite would would 
resolve.

2167
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:56,460
And there's every reason to have respect
for decent working class people.

2168
02:06:57,010 --> 02:06:57,843
I mean it's on their labor as the left 
wingers at least hypothetically agree 

2169
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:06,120
that the entire edifice of the culture 
is,

2170
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:10,650
is resting so you can have your cake and
eat it too.

2171
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:15,650
But you have to not assume that your 
niche makes you superior.

2172
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,720
And it's very difficult for smart 
people,

2173
02:07:18,721 --> 02:07:21,750
especially smart.
There's this scene in niches.

2174
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:26,850
Sins thus spake Zarathustra Zarathustra.
The prophet comes down from the mountain

2175
02:07:26,851 --> 02:07:27,684
and he comes into a public square and 
there's this crowd around this little 

2176
02:07:31,051 --> 02:07:31,884
midget who is only about this high,
who has a gigantic ear and everyone is 

2177
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:38,350
marveling at him.
Well,

2178
02:07:38,351 --> 02:07:40,300
that's what the modern intellect is 
like.

2179
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:41,403
It's a midget with a giant.
Well mouth generally not an ear and the 

2180
02:07:45,410 --> 02:07:50,350
being is under developed,
but the intellect is hyper activated and

2181
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:54,790
it makes the person extraordinarily 
unbalanced and it's partly because a,

2182
02:07:54,791 --> 02:07:55,624
they can't compete outside the 
intellectual realm and that makes them 

2183
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:59,530
very bitter because they tend to think,
well,

2184
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:00,371
God,
I'm so smart.

2185
02:08:00,371 --> 02:08:01,780
Everything should just come to me.
It's like,

2186
02:08:01,810 --> 02:08:02,643
sorry,
that's not how the world works and and 

2187
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:06,820
it,
it also that,

2188
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:08,670
that and that,
that,

2189
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:13,150
that attitude is immediately evident to 
people that they're talking to when they

2190
02:08:13,151 --> 02:08:13,984
talk in the manner that they talk.
If they are arrogant intellectuals of 

2191
02:08:16,241 --> 02:08:17,074
that sort.
You see that in the simpsons did a good 

2192
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:21,120
job of that with Comic Book Guy,
right?

2193
02:08:21,530 --> 02:08:22,363
I mean he completely useless in every 
possible dimension with an Iq of about 

2194
02:08:26,021 --> 02:08:26,854
160 and it's very annoying to people who
have an Iq of 160 that they can also be 

2195
02:08:30,911 --> 02:08:33,550
completely useless,
but it happens a lot.

2196
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:35,320
So yeah.

2197
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:42,560
Thank you.

2198
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:45,830
I'd love to have it a long time.
No,

2199
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:47,360
see how are you doing?
Thanks.

2200
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,770
So I was at first going to ask about 
your thoughts on a very popular TV show.

2201
02:08:51,771 --> 02:08:52,604
Rick and Morty just recommended that to 
me and they said they thought I would 

2202
02:08:56,401 --> 02:08:57,234
find it funny and that makes me nervous 
because I like the simpsons and I liked 

2203
02:09:00,571 --> 02:09:02,820
the trailer park boys for actually liked
the trailer.

2204
02:09:02,821 --> 02:09:06,300
I really liked the trailer park boys and
so if someone said,

2205
02:09:06,510 --> 02:09:08,890
I know it's so sad.
No,

2206
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:12,990
but they said that I would like rick and
Morty,

2207
02:09:12,991 --> 02:09:17,991
so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it.
It does have a nihilistic theme to it,

2208
02:09:18,270 --> 02:09:19,103
I would say.
So that was quite telling of the young 

2209
02:09:21,361 --> 02:09:23,820
population which say falling in love 
with it.

2210
02:09:23,821 --> 02:09:25,110
Everyone's talking about it.
So.

2211
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:26,211
Okay.
Well,

2212
02:09:26,211 --> 02:09:29,330
I'll definitely watch it because I'd 
been looking for something to watch when

2213
02:09:29,331 --> 02:09:30,650
I'm brain dead at night,
so,

2214
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:36,370
but I just had to tell him my question 
from a different angle if I,

2215
02:09:36,420 --> 02:09:37,240
if I may.

2216
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,430
Um,
and it's about,

2217
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:41,100
um,
the case that governments,

2218
02:09:41,130 --> 02:09:43,890
let's say,
such as Russia and Iran,

2219
02:09:44,160 --> 02:09:46,590
they are even more extreme cases like 
isis.

2220
02:09:46,710 --> 02:09:47,543
Um,
they do not want to confront a 

2221
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:51,690
nihilistic aspects of the west and as a 
result,

2222
02:09:51,691 --> 02:09:52,524
they've taken an anti western approach 
as someone with a Middle Eastern 

2223
02:09:55,501 --> 02:09:56,680
background.
Um,

2224
02:09:56,690 --> 02:10:01,690
I've been trying to figure out where the
origins of this hostility more precisely

2225
02:10:02,011 --> 02:10:04,800
comes from and why things are the way 
they are.

2226
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:06,363
I recently found out that certain key 
uranium philosophers and political 

2227
02:10:10,621 --> 02:10:11,454
activist who were partially 
intellectually responsible for the 1979 

2228
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:20,060
revolution were highly influenced by the
anti western Heideggerian philosophy.

2229
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:24,570
And this is partially why they believe 
that an Islamic state,

2230
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:28,560
uh,
would be unnecessary counter position,

2231
02:10:28,820 --> 02:10:29,400
uh,
to the,

2232
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:32,310
to the nihilistic western thought.
Uh,

2233
02:10:32,311 --> 02:10:32,740
you,
I,

2234
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:37,740
I know you also found there with 
Alexander Duke in a puddings advisor,

2235
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,570
except Dougan doesn't really seem to 
have a coherent answer.

2236
02:10:41,770 --> 02:10:42,603
He says that an answer like that is 
necessary and that hypothetically it's 

2237
02:10:46,401 --> 02:10:48,080
something that Russia might be able to 
offer,

2238
02:10:48,081 --> 02:10:51,020
but the details seem to me somewhat 
obscure.

2239
02:10:51,140 --> 02:10:55,640
I mean the Russians may be,
the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn

2240
02:10:55,641 --> 02:10:57,890
suggested in returning to Orthodox 
Christianity,

2241
02:10:57,891 --> 02:10:58,724
although Russia's corrupt enough so that
it's very difficult to tell from the 

2242
02:11:01,671 --> 02:11:02,504
outside if that's mirror collusion 
between a corrupt church and a corrupt 

2243
02:11:05,031 --> 02:11:07,130
state or if there's something genuine 
going on there.

2244
02:11:07,580 --> 02:11:08,413
Now,
you know,

2245
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:10,303
I would say there's a question under 
your question which is tyranny or 

2246
02:11:13,461 --> 02:11:15,190
nihilism?
Well,

2247
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:17,720
that's a good question man.
That's a good question.

2248
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:19,393
Well,
lots of people would pick tyranny 

2249
02:11:20,541 --> 02:11:24,690
overnight and so if that's the only 
choice that people are offered then.

2250
02:11:24,830 --> 02:11:25,663
And I also think that tyranny is 
stronger than nihilism because of what 

2251
02:11:28,191 --> 02:11:30,710
are you going to do?
Organize nihilists hardly.

2252
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:31,790
Well,
look at,

2253
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:34,730
look at what happened to,
what was that thing in central park,

2254
02:11:35,170 --> 02:11:36,520
you know,
against the one percent.

2255
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:37,551
Jesus.
I mean,

2256
02:11:37,551 --> 02:11:42,140
what a dismal affair that was.
We'd like things to be different.

2257
02:11:42,890 --> 02:11:47,690
How
well we don't know.

2258
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:48,793
It's like

2259
02:11:49,340 --> 02:11:53,520
thank you.

2260
02:11:53,740 --> 02:11:54,573
So you know,
you can just run over that if you're a 

2261
02:11:56,891 --> 02:11:57,724
tyrannical and organized,
you can just run over that like there's 

2262
02:11:59,470 --> 02:12:00,303
nothing there at all and that I think 
there is a danger and I do think that 

2263
02:12:04,121 --> 02:12:04,954
were enticing.
The islamofascism let's say by our 

2264
02:12:09,071 --> 02:12:12,160
nihilistic weakness and I think more 
than that,

2265
02:12:12,161 --> 02:12:14,890
I think that we're doing something more 
than that because one of the things that

2266
02:12:14,891 --> 02:12:17,620
I've been curious about,
and I'm going way out on limb here,

2267
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:18,753
is I've been really interested in the 
alliance between the Neo Marxist 

2268
02:12:21,310 --> 02:12:23,980
denialists or the Neo Marxist,
postmodern,

2269
02:12:23,981 --> 02:12:26,880
especially the feminists and the Islamic
fascists.

2270
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:30,280
I just don't get that.
It's like there's something very,

2271
02:12:30,281 --> 02:12:34,270
very interesting going on there and I 
think part of it is that when you,

2272
02:12:34,300 --> 02:12:39,010
when you drift too far into the 
nihilistic substructure,

2273
02:12:39,190 --> 02:12:40,023
there is a huge call for tyrannical 
order that manifests itself 

2274
02:12:42,731 --> 02:12:43,564
unconsciously.
And so that's the dynamic that I see 

2275
02:12:45,731 --> 02:12:46,564
playing out in that peculiar 
relationship between the modern Neil 

2276
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:53,440
Marxist feminists in the Islam of 
fascists.

2277
02:12:57,040 --> 02:12:58,270
I don't.
I don't know.

2278
02:12:58,271 --> 02:12:59,104
That's a very.
That's very interesting that that's a 

2279
02:13:01,391 --> 02:13:04,240
very interesting idea that you brought 
to mind.

2280
02:13:04,241 --> 02:13:05,074
I had no idea that there was a 
relationship between heidegger and what 

2281
02:13:07,931 --> 02:13:08,764
happened in Iran in the 19 seventies.
If you could send me a citation about 

2282
02:13:12,761 --> 02:13:15,310
that or something to read,
I'd be very interested in doing that.

2283
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:16,420
So.
Okay.

2284
02:13:16,690 --> 02:13:17,523
Yep.
Yep.

2285
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:23,740
Thanks.

2286
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:30,540
Thank you.
That's,

2287
02:13:30,570 --> 02:13:31,403
that's,
that's the closest thing I think I'll 

2288
02:13:32,461 --> 02:13:35,970
experience ta to Arnold Schwartzenegger 
actually delivering that line.

2289
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:54,550
April title,
the left one case for free speech

2290
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:02,800
distribution.
Yeah.

2291
02:14:03,960 --> 02:14:05,890
Not Ross,
but yeah.

2292
02:14:07,090 --> 02:14:07,923
Whereby I guess the square root of the 
number of people involved in some sort 

2293
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:12,220
of a productive endeavor

2294
02:14:12,340 --> 02:14:13,630
do half the work

2295
02:14:14,360 --> 02:14:15,890
would result in half the production.

2296
02:14:15,970 --> 02:14:17,070
Oh,
it's a nasty,

2297
02:14:17,370 --> 02:14:18,390
nasty law.
Yeah.

2298
02:14:18,391 --> 02:14:19,890
It was also known as price's law.

2299
02:14:20,700 --> 02:14:24,630
Four hundred,
500 people we've all cleaned up.

2300
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,400
Great.

2301
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:29,233
What you're saying is that if you say 
that this perino distribution 

2302
02:14:32,570 --> 02:14:33,403
approximates a natural law,
like we all understand the force of 

2303
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:41,120
gravity and there's no escaping the 
influence of gravity,

2304
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,033
that means that there's 20 people in 
this room who are going to be a guess 

2305
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:48,683
candidates for accomplishing.
I guess the goal of being the next 

2306
02:14:52,491 --> 02:14:53,510
Jordan Peterson.

2307
02:14:54,830 --> 02:14:56,300
Hopefully there's fewer of them.

2308
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:02,543
The first is it isn't obvious what the 
population would be that you would 

2309
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,480
compare this population too,
right?

2310
02:15:10,530 --> 02:15:11,550
Because you could say,
well,

2311
02:15:11,551 --> 02:15:13,470
the boundary is the 400 people in this 
room,

2312
02:15:13,471 --> 02:15:17,580
but it isn't necessarily the case.
The 400 people in this room might be the

2313
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:20,940
square root of the broader population.
We're interested in this sort of thing.

2314
02:15:20,941 --> 02:15:23,980
But with the prieto distribution,
what you also see is that it's,

2315
02:15:24,400 --> 02:15:27,120
it's self similar.
And so,

2316
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:28,263
um,
let's say there's 400 people doing 

2317
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:33,180
something,
20 of them are doing half the work,

2318
02:15:33,181 --> 02:15:36,810
but if you take 20,
those 24 of them are doing half the work

2319
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:39,750
of the 20 and one of the four is doing 
half the work of the four.

2320
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:41,153
And so

2321
02:15:42,010 --> 02:15:42,843
it.

2322
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:47,950
So why am I telling you that it's it,
isn't it?

2323
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:48,991
Well,
first of all,

2324
02:15:48,991 --> 02:15:53,991
it isn't that there isn't useful work to
be done at multiple slices of the prieto

2325
02:15:54,271 --> 02:15:55,104
distribution.
But the other thing is it's also the 

2326
02:15:56,641 --> 02:15:58,710
case that there's not only one prieto 
distribution,

2327
02:15:59,610 --> 02:16:00,570
right?
Because he might say,

2328
02:16:00,571 --> 02:16:01,404
well,
if it's just the square root of the 

2329
02:16:02,221 --> 02:16:04,500
number of people in a domain that are 
doing half the work,

2330
02:16:04,510 --> 02:16:06,420
then what do you do with the rest of the
people?

2331
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:07,254
And the answer to that might be while 
they're in a pre a different prieto 

2332
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:10,794
distribution as well,
where they're doing something 

2333
02:16:12,241 --> 02:16:13,860
productive.
So.

2334
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:24,600
Well,
I think it's a good question.

2335
02:16:24,601 --> 02:16:25,080
Like,
ah,

2336
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:26,020
we don't exactly.
Um,

2337
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,140
so,
so the basic rule is the look,

2338
02:16:28,141 --> 02:16:28,974
the basic rule is example,
if you take 100 scientists in a given 

2339
02:16:32,141 --> 02:16:32,974
domain,
10 of them will have published half the 

2340
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:37,360
papers.
And this works with everything.

2341
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:40,270
It works with every creative domain.
The rule applies.

2342
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:41,643
So now the question is why?
And I think the answer to that seems to 

2343
02:16:44,771 --> 02:16:45,604
be,
and I've watched people who've become 

2344
02:16:46,301 --> 02:16:48,700
spectacularly successful and what 
happens is that

2345
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,290
zero is a really bad place to be,
right?

2346
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:54,124
It's really hard to get out of zero.
And that's often why people are trapped 

2347
02:16:57,671 --> 02:16:58,504
in poverty because if you have nothing 
getting to something is virtually 

2348
02:17:02,411 --> 02:17:04,270
impossible.
Once you have something,

2349
02:17:04,271 --> 02:17:06,910
getting to a little more of something is
actually quite a bit easier.

2350
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:10,960
And so
what seems to happen,

2351
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:13,750
this is also called the matthew 
principle,

2352
02:17:14,110 --> 02:17:14,620
right?

2353
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:18,340
It's the same principle.
So that's a new testament citation.

2354
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:19,233
Let's say the matthew principle is to 
those who have everything more will be 

2355
02:17:23,291 --> 02:17:27,580
given from those who have nothing.
Everything will be taken.

2356
02:17:27,730 --> 02:17:28,563
That's another one of those lines in the
new testament that you'd think that a 

2357
02:17:30,461 --> 02:17:33,160
good editor would have just got rid of.
So but,

2358
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:34,023
but,
but I think what it is is that every 

2359
02:17:35,411 --> 02:17:36,244
time you make a step forward,
the probability that you'll be able to 

2360
02:17:39,161 --> 02:17:39,994
take the next step forward increases.
And it seems to increase in a nonlinear 

2361
02:17:42,761 --> 02:17:43,594
way.
So the world that the matthew principal 

2362
02:17:47,141 --> 02:17:49,000
describes is nonlinear.
You know,

2363
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:49,840
so you might say,
well,

2364
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:52,180
what's your trajectory if you're moving 
upward?

2365
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:53,620
Well,
it's not this,

2366
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:56,770
it's this.
What's your trajectory?

2367
02:17:56,771 --> 02:17:59,620
If you're moving downward,
it's not this,

2368
02:18:00,010 --> 02:18:01,450
it's this,
right?

2369
02:18:02,020 --> 02:18:03,400
You Fall,
you fall,

2370
02:18:03,430 --> 02:18:05,950
you plummet,
you rise,

2371
02:18:05,951 --> 02:18:08,020
you rise,
you transcend.

2372
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:09,520
It's something like that and you might 
say,

2373
02:18:09,521 --> 02:18:10,660
well,
that's a hell of a world,

2374
02:18:10,661 --> 02:18:13,650
but whatever.
It has to be run by some principle.

2375
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,850
That's the principle that it appears to 
be run by.

2376
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:20,333
Yes.

2377
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:25,840
No,
no,

2378
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:27,200
no.
It doesn't mean that at all.

2379
02:18:27,440 --> 02:18:31,040
What it means is that every truth claim 
you make,

2380
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:34,340
including those that are implicit in 
your actions,

2381
02:18:34,670 --> 02:18:39,670
carries with it an ethic that justifies 
or doesn't justify the action.

2382
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:41,053
So for example,
let's say I have a tool and I say it's 

2383
02:18:43,611 --> 02:18:46,880
an ax and I go out in the forest and I 
cut down.

2384
02:18:46,910 --> 02:18:49,400
I tried to cut down a tree with it and 
it doesn't work.

2385
02:18:49,820 --> 02:18:52,730
It's not an ax,
it's something else.

2386
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:54,020
And so what the,
what the.

2387
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:58,430
There's a good book on pragmatism called
the metaphysical club,

2388
02:18:58,431 --> 02:18:59,264
a history of American ideas.
It's one I would really recommend and 

2389
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:02,233
what the pragmatists.
I can't give you a full answer because 

2390
02:19:04,011 --> 02:19:04,844
this is such a complicated issue,
but what the pragmatist we're wrestling 

2391
02:19:07,491 --> 02:19:11,930
with back in the late 18 hundreds,
the late 18 hundreds.

2392
02:19:12,050 --> 02:19:14,960
This was William James and his crew in,
in in Boston,

2393
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:16,813
including a philosopher named cs purse,
who is perhaps America's greatest 

2394
02:19:19,671 --> 02:19:20,504
philosopher.

2395
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:22,573
They were wrestling with the same issue 
that the postmodernist would wrestle 

2396
02:19:24,561 --> 02:19:26,630
with 100 years later,
which is

2397
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:31,190
things are indefinitely complex and 
we're not very bright.

2398
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:36,520
So how is it that we can make claims to 
truth about anything and what they were?

2399
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:41,210
What their hypothesis essentially was,
is that with every action and with every

2400
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:44,480
truth claim,
you simultaneously demarcate a territory

2401
02:19:44,481 --> 02:19:47,960
within which that claim is valid and 
you.

2402
02:19:48,030 --> 02:19:48,863
You determine whether the claim is valid
by noting whether your prediction about 

2403
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:56,750
the outcome of your action or your or 
your belief is commensurate is,

2404
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:57,603
is in keeping with if the outcome is in 
keeping with the prediction than what 

2405
02:20:03,291 --> 02:20:06,530
you've said or done is true or good 
enough.

2406
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:10,640
And that's as good as you get.
And so that's the pragmatic perspective.

2407
02:20:10,641 --> 02:20:12,260
And then when,
when,

2408
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:16,910
when the pragmatists encountered Charles
Dark Charles Darwin's works works,

2409
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:18,163
they immediately recognized that Darwin 
had generated a pragmatic solution to 

2410
02:20:21,651 --> 02:20:24,060
the problem of the impossibility of 
being.

2411
02:20:24,540 --> 02:20:25,373
The impossibility of being is this,
there's way more cosmos than there is 

2412
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:31,400
you.
You are going to die.

2413
02:20:31,430 --> 02:20:35,960
You cannot generate a sufficient 
solution to the problem of you're being.

2414
02:20:36,670 --> 02:20:38,180
No one can.
Nothing.

2415
02:20:38,181 --> 02:20:39,014
Cat,
it's like the environment is a snake 

2416
02:20:40,851 --> 02:20:41,684
that moves unpredictably across time and
you're trying to stay on its back while 

2417
02:20:44,591 --> 02:20:47,330
I was how to,
how does the Darwinian process deal with

2418
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:48,164
that?
It produces infinite variance roughly 

2419
02:20:50,511 --> 02:20:53,180
speaking,
almost all of which die.

2420
02:20:54,110 --> 02:20:57,700
And that's how it solves a problem 
across time and the things that exist,

2421
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:59,360
the,
the things that stay alive,

2422
02:20:59,480 --> 02:21:02,510
our true enough,
and that's the best you get.

2423
02:21:02,540 --> 02:21:03,373
That's the argument I was trying to have
with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't 

2424
02:21:05,631 --> 02:21:08,780
take his evolutionary psychology,
evolutionary theory seriously enough,

2425
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,030
but we get.
We kept getting bogged down.

2426
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:12,380
Anyways,
that's,

2427
02:21:12,980 --> 02:21:17,900
that's the best answer to that.
I'd like to agree with that,

2428
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:18,770
but it's not true.

2429
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:26,000
Yup.
Yup,

2430
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:32,100
Yup,
Yup.

2431
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:39,350
True scientific.

2432
02:21:40,240 --> 02:21:42,160
You really do like to ask hard 
questions,

2433
02:21:42,161 --> 02:21:43,580
don't you?
Um,

2434
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,580
I think it depends.
See,

2435
02:21:45,581 --> 02:21:48,850
this is also why like the pod and take 
let's say on,

2436
02:21:48,970 --> 02:21:49,803
on pragmatism because I think that 
pragmatism as a philosophy has the 

2437
02:21:54,280 --> 02:21:58,510
limitation that you just described,
but only if you think about the Games is

2438
02:21:58,511 --> 02:21:59,344
limited.
If you have to play the game in an 

2439
02:22:01,181 --> 02:22:02,014
iterative way,
then that issue resolves itself and the 

2440
02:22:05,411 --> 02:22:07,720
game theorists have done a good job of 
mapping that out.

2441
02:22:07,930 --> 02:22:11,380
It's like you could say,
let's say pragmatically speaking,

2442
02:22:11,381 --> 02:22:13,150
there is no reason I shouldn't deceive 
you once.

2443
02:22:13,151 --> 02:22:15,170
If I can get what I want,
it's yeah.

2444
02:22:15,171 --> 02:22:16,004
Yeah.
Except that I'm probably not only going 

2445
02:22:17,681 --> 02:22:20,890
to interact with you once.
I'm going to interact with you a lot and

2446
02:22:20,891 --> 02:22:22,990
even if it isn't you that I interact 
with,

2447
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:23,973
it's going to be a bunch of beings that 
are so much you that it might as well 

2448
02:22:26,131 --> 02:22:27,900
be.
You might as well be you.

2449
02:22:28,530 --> 02:22:29,363
It's gonna be me if nothing else.
And so the pragmatic game stretched 

2450
02:22:33,451 --> 02:22:34,284
across time would include the necessity 
of interability in relationship to the 

2451
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:41,880
validations of the truth claims.
That's,

2452
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:46,520
that's how it looks to me when you.
I'm gonna,

2453
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,363
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.

2454
02:22:48,510 --> 02:22:51,810
I'm gonna.
Stop you say that again?

2455
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:55,410
Denied on several occasions.
Yes.

2456
02:22:56,360 --> 02:22:58,410
Like you're good at rhetoric.
Yes.

2457
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:01,890
Thank you.
Yes.

2458
02:23:01,891 --> 02:23:03,180
But that's not all I am.

2459
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:13,480
Uh,
so this is on behalf of somebody,

2460
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:14,693
Dr Peterson having listened to your 
expositions on the mythological 

2461
02:23:17,041 --> 02:23:17,874
evolution and amalgamation of religion 
and keeping in mind your working 

2462
02:23:20,821 --> 02:23:25,050
definition of belief and truth and 
despite the obvious reasons for somebody

2463
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:27,780
of your background to identify most with
Christianity,

2464
02:23:27,930 --> 02:23:31,470
my understanding is that you believe 
Christianity to be the most complete and

2465
02:23:31,471 --> 02:23:35,340
articulated form of many of the 
metaphysical ideas that proceeded.

2466
02:23:35,341 --> 02:23:37,710
It led up to that.
Keeping that in mind,

2467
02:23:37,711 --> 02:23:38,544
would it also be accurate to therefore 
say that you're not only a believer in 

2468
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:41,844
Christianity,
but also if to a lesser degree also 

2469
02:23:45,001 --> 02:23:46,470
believer in,
in Marta,

2470
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:47,693
in the ancient Egyptian gods and the 
subsequent gods that you've spoken of 

2471
02:23:49,891 --> 02:23:50,560
here,
uh,

2472
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:51,393
that lead up and contributed to the form
of Christianity that you're discussing 

2473
02:23:54,360 --> 02:23:55,500
and that you identify with.

2474
02:23:56,960 --> 02:23:57,793
Okay.
I got to take that one apart a little 

2475
02:23:58,791 --> 02:23:59,624
bit.
I'm bounded in my judgment with regards 

2476
02:24:03,561 --> 02:24:08,561
to Christianity by my ignorance.
I'm no student of Hinduism

2477
02:24:10,400 --> 02:24:11,233
so I can't make the claim forthrightly 
that there's something intrinsically 

2478
02:24:16,401 --> 02:24:21,260
superior to the Judeo Christian 
tradition because I don't know enough to

2479
02:24:21,261 --> 02:24:22,094
make that claim.
The claim I can make is that there's 

2480
02:24:24,860 --> 02:24:25,693
something that's dreadfully right about 
this core elements of the Judeo 

2481
02:24:29,151 --> 02:24:31,960
Christian tradition and I've seen 
analogs to that.

2482
02:24:31,961 --> 02:24:33,980
Like one of the things I'd like to do,
for example,

2483
02:24:34,550 --> 02:24:35,383
is to do a a short series on the Tao Te 
Ching because that is one remarkable 

2484
02:24:40,101 --> 02:24:41,570
document.
Once you know,

2485
02:24:41,571 --> 02:24:44,480
especially you might want to read it,
you can go online and read.

2486
02:24:44,481 --> 02:24:47,000
It's very short.
Tao Te Ching t a n o,

2487
02:24:47,660 --> 02:24:52,660
t e h e c h I n g dot and it's the 
fundamental texts of Taoism.

2488
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:57,670
And once you know that the world of 
being is made of chaos and order and you

2489
02:24:57,951 --> 02:25:00,170
know that that's represented by the Yin 
and the Yang,

2490
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:02,900
all of a sudden you can understand the 
Tao te Ching and it's just.

2491
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:08,180
It's brilliantly simple and 
straightforward and did sex position.

2492
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:11,540
But it also seems to me to be entirely 
commensurate with the line of,

2493
02:25:11,930 --> 02:25:14,150
of,
let's call it logic.

2494
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:15,570
It's more like a,
the,

2495
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:19,730
the mode of description of being that's 
encapsulated in these stories.

2496
02:25:20,180 --> 02:25:22,790
Now with regards to being a believer,
people ask me all the time,

2497
02:25:22,791 --> 02:25:23,624
two thinks,
say,

2498
02:25:23,740 --> 02:25:24,250
do you believe

2499
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,940
in God and are you a Christian?
And the answer to that,

2500
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:28,960
both of those is actually there's two 
answers.

2501
02:25:28,961 --> 02:25:29,794
One is,
what the hell makes you think it's any 

2502
02:25:30,911 --> 02:25:33,220
of your business?
That's the first answer.

2503
02:25:33,340 --> 02:25:34,173
And the second is why do you think that,
you mean the same thing with those 

2504
02:25:37,781 --> 02:25:39,760
questions that I would mean with my 
answer.

2505
02:25:40,450 --> 02:25:41,283
So you know,
because it's such a funny thing because 

2506
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:44,733
I've spent like three.
This is no accusation with regards to 

2507
02:25:47,291 --> 02:25:48,600
your questions in the least,
you know,

2508
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:49,533
I think it's more about trying to track 
the development of these ideas and you 

2509
02:25:51,731 --> 02:25:53,280
know,
the residual truths and psych,

2510
02:25:53,890 --> 02:25:56,380
psychological significance of all these 
other traditions.

2511
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:57,470
Well,
you know,

2512
02:25:57,750 --> 02:26:02,750
the guy,
I've been floored by either mythological

2513
02:26:03,171 --> 02:26:04,004
structure.
So like when I first understood or 

2514
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:10,130
thought I understood the meaning of the 
Mesopotamian creation method,

2515
02:26:10,131 --> 02:26:13,280
just I've never recovered from that,
I would say.

2516
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:14,263
And the same thing is true of the 
investigations I did into the Egyptian 

2517
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:21,050
myths of Horace and Isis and Osiris and 
seth.

2518
02:26:21,080 --> 02:26:22,240
It's just,
they,

2519
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:26,960
they're so relevant.
I mean they're so unbelievably relevant.

2520
02:26:26,961 --> 02:26:27,794
And how do,
how do see this is a problem that none 

2521
02:26:31,161 --> 02:26:33,260
of us really know how to,
how to solve.

2522
02:26:33,261 --> 02:26:36,110
It's like there are sources of wisdom 
all over the world,

2523
02:26:36,290 --> 02:26:37,123
let's say,
and they need to be made commensurate 

2524
02:26:39,951 --> 02:26:40,784
with one another,
which isn't to say that they need to be 

2525
02:26:42,801 --> 02:26:45,650
turned into a fast food.
A mall,

2526
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:46,191
you know,
that's,

2527
02:26:46,191 --> 02:26:47,720
that's like multiculturalism,
right?

2528
02:26:47,721 --> 02:26:48,554
It's like all the food of the world 
served in the most terrible possible 

2529
02:26:52,431 --> 02:26:55,070
manner all in one place and something 
like that.

2530
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:55,903
And you don't want to do that with 
comparative religion is just water 

2531
02:26:58,341 --> 02:27:00,380
everything down and say,
well it's all nice.

2532
02:27:00,381 --> 02:27:00,861
It's like,
no,

2533
02:27:00,861 --> 02:27:02,650
it is not nice.
Yeah.

2534
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:04,910
Or that it's all the same because it's 
not all the same.

2535
02:27:05,510 --> 02:27:06,343
So the job of communicating between 
those domains of wisdom is really 

2536
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:13,881
continuing.
Right?

2537
02:27:13,881 --> 02:27:15,340
It's been a problem ever since the 
beginning of,

2538
02:27:15,390 --> 02:27:16,223
of civilization.
But it's continuing and I would say the 

2539
02:27:18,591 --> 02:27:22,310
psychoanalysts too young in particular 
was a huge,

2540
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:23,173
huge steps in the direction of doing 
that in an extraordinarily positive way 

2541
02:27:27,890 --> 02:27:31,430
and not a simple minded way at all and 
not just hand waving that.

2542
02:27:31,431 --> 02:27:32,264
Oh well it's.
Everyone has one in all shall have 

2543
02:27:34,281 --> 02:27:35,840
prizes.
Not that.

2544
02:27:36,470 --> 02:27:41,470
So yeah.
Last question.

2545
02:27:45,650 --> 02:27:46,483
I choose a kind of in the same vein,
but it's in regards to another kind of 

2546
02:27:49,161 --> 02:27:49,994
mythology.
So in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own 

2547
02:27:53,260 --> 02:27:54,950
with us,
sorry I'm extremely tall,

2548
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:55,933
but a lot of the.
I actually got found some kind of 

2549
02:27:59,330 --> 02:28:02,030
archetypes like for example in my own 
life,

2550
02:28:02,031 --> 02:28:02,864
but also I've noticed in European life.
So for example in regards to Odin and 

2551
02:28:07,611 --> 02:28:12,611
norse mythology with colleagues essay,
I've only been able to touch you skim it

2552
02:28:12,771 --> 02:28:14,970
because I've been trying to find 
something like.

2553
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:15,833
Because it felt like there's always this
kind of psyche that was almost 

2554
02:28:17,871 --> 02:28:19,700
underneath,
I guess,

2555
02:28:19,701 --> 02:28:20,534
Western civilization and we've see it 
really like embodied in this specific 

2556
02:28:24,951 --> 02:28:25,850
figure,
this deity,

2557
02:28:25,851 --> 02:28:27,800
the wanderer,
the knowledge,

2558
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:30,860
gather the seeker,
but he's also a war.

2559
02:28:30,861 --> 02:28:31,694
God is,
he is all these different aspects that 

2560
02:28:33,381 --> 02:28:38,270
are an accumulation of what seems to be 
something that's distinctly western.

2561
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:43,070
And I feel this is like almost like the 
symbol in a way.

2562
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:45,100
Of course,
it's not always positive.

2563
02:28:45,260 --> 02:28:48,890
There seems to be something maybe,
maybe there seems to be something.

2564
02:28:48,980 --> 02:28:49,813
I do think that the idea of the 
individual has been articulated most 

2565
02:28:53,961 --> 02:28:56,870
fully in the west.
I don't think that's really a,

2566
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:00,200
I don't think that's a contentious claim
actually.

2567
02:29:00,590 --> 02:29:01,423
Um,
that doesn't mean that the latent 

2568
02:29:04,040 --> 02:29:04,873
structures from which that idea might 
emerge weren't also many other places 

2569
02:29:08,811 --> 02:29:09,644
simultaneously.
And the other thing from let's say from 

2570
02:29:11,811 --> 02:29:12,644
a biological perspective is that we're 
only talking about differences of a few 

2571
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:18,770
hundred years in terms of the 
manifestation of these ideas.

2572
02:29:18,771 --> 02:29:19,604
Right?
From A,

2573
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:21,410
from an evolutionary perspective,
that's,

2574
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:23,270
it's instantaneous.
And it's like,

2575
02:29:23,271 --> 02:29:25,580
well,
a new idea has to arise somewhere.

2576
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:28,340
So it's going to be somewhere first and 
but it,

2577
02:29:28,341 --> 02:29:30,650
it's spreading.
Christianity for example,

2578
02:29:30,651 --> 02:29:31,484
spreads so rapidly that it's absolutely 
beyond belief and it is actually 

2579
02:29:33,741 --> 02:29:36,530
spreading more rapidly in China now than
it did in ancient Rome.

2580
02:29:36,920 --> 02:29:37,700
So.

2581
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:38,533
Well in regards to that,
it's also been seen like almost in the 

2582
02:29:41,451 --> 02:29:42,284
wake of a dying Christianity.
I've noticed that like there's been a 

2583
02:29:44,481 --> 02:29:47,270
tendency to go towards,
I guess paganism,

2584
02:29:47,271 --> 02:29:48,130
right?
Yes.

2585
02:29:48,410 --> 02:29:50,750
I'm understand the lake.
Some people love it off.

2586
02:29:50,940 --> 02:29:52,480
Yes.
You Have Waco,

2587
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:53,323
which was mainly a manifestation of all 
the Alistair Crowley has works which 

2588
02:29:56,871 --> 02:29:57,704
were then handed off to whoever actually
made the actual ideology and then next 

2589
02:30:01,791 --> 02:30:02,624
thing you know,
we're finding something almost more 

2590
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:05,054
stable in I guess norse mythology and it
seems like it's acting almost as a 

2591
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:12,170
pendulum swing from something that.

2592
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:14,050
Well,
people are like.

2593
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:14,990
The thing is,
is when,

2594
02:30:14,991 --> 02:30:15,590
when,
when,

2595
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:17,930
when one mythological structure 
collapses,

2596
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:22,160
it's going to collapse into another 
mythological structure or another set of

2597
02:30:22,161 --> 02:30:25,060
mythological structures and,
and because you,

2598
02:30:25,061 --> 02:30:27,530
you can't get out of the mythological 
structures,

2599
02:30:27,531 --> 02:30:29,810
there's no possible way of doing that.
What?

2600
02:30:30,080 --> 02:30:30,913
And so I wouldn't say necessarily that 
the fact that other belief systems 

2601
02:30:34,281 --> 02:30:37,880
emerge in the aftermath of the collapse 
of the overarching belief system,

2602
02:30:37,881 --> 02:30:39,920
I don't think that that's necessarily a 
bad idea.

2603
02:30:40,220 --> 02:30:43,160
I think that it has its attendant 
dangers.

2604
02:30:43,700 --> 02:30:44,533
And so I should stop because I'm 
starting to get tired and I'm not going 

2605
02:30:47,931 --> 02:30:50,500
to be able to formulate any clear 
answers to that.

2606
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:53,380
And it's also 10:00.
So we also do have to start.

2607
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,823
Oh yes.

2608
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:02,293
There is an unofficial meetup and 
discussion group at Hemingway's 

2609
02:31:05,151 --> 02:31:06,650
restaurant.
Second floor,

2610
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:07,543
142 cumberland street.
Just say you with the Jordan Peterson 

2611
02:31:11,331 --> 02:31:13,010
discussion group?
Yes.

2612
02:31:13,100 --> 02:31:13,933
Everyone is invited.
If you say you're with the Jordan 

2613
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:20,010
Peterson discussion group,
please don't misbehave too badly.
