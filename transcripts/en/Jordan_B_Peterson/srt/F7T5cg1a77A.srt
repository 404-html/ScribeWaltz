1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,420
Okay,
so

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,400
last week we spent a fair bit of time 
assessing

3
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,860
the structure of the first two stories 
in genesis and I made the case that

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,853
they were stories about
the rise of humanity into self 

5
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,010
consciousness or the descent of humanity
into selfconsciousness,

6
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,083
depending on which way you look at it.
I should also point out that there's 

7
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:37,044
been a lot of debate
among religious traditions that were 

8
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:47,800
associated with those stories about 
whether the fall was an improvement or a

9
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,010
catastrophe.
Today we're going to discuss at least to

10
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:58,940
begin with,
we're going to discuss the

11
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,830
story of the Buddha.
And the reason I want to do that,

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,860
it's two fold.
Well first,

13
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:07,694
because it's an interesting story in 
second because the parallels between it 

14
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,000
and the story in genesis are I think 
they're quite remarkable

15
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,710
and it's not that easy to understand 
exactly why they're there.

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,040
So here's the story

17
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,603
[inaudible]

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,443
so a long time ago,
king got news that he was going to have 

19
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:32,354
a son and an angel visited him and said,
your son is going to have one of two 

20
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:40,004
destinies.
He's either going to become a great and 

21
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:47,450
powerful world ruler or he's going to 
become

22
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,273
a spiritual leader.
And the king thought it was a very 

23
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:56,300
practical man,
thought,

24
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:57,134
well,
there's no damn way my son is going to 

25
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:58,934
become a spiritual leader.
And so we thought all make sure that he 

26
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,150
falls in love with life.

27
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,670
Okay.

28
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,503
So the king built a city before his son 
was born and wall did the end and made 

29
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,514
it as beautiful as he could possibly 
make it and then decreed that within 

30
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:25,991
that city there were nothing but joy.
And so there were no people who the only

31
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,390
people that were allowed in were young,
attractive,

32
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:30,224
and healthy by express demand.
And so the Buddha grew up in that city 

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,490
and fell in love with life just as his 
father had hoped.

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,483
Now

35
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,930
the analogy that I see there,
we'll pursue it in more detail,

36
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,931
but the first analogy is the idea of a 
safe and segregated like a wallet space.

37
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:04,420
So parodies of paradise means walled 
garden.

38
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,120
And I mentioned that Eden means 
well-watered place.

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,583
So the idea is the same,
that if you want to produce a paradise 

40
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,814
for someone,
you all in a space and you keep 

41
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:15,904
everything that's not acceptable or that
might cause existential distress let's 

42
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,430
say.
And You keep that out.

43
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,160
And I would say,
well it's also,

44
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,450
there's also a very interesting analog 
between that and the genesis story,

45
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,330
but also between that and the role of 
parenthood in general.

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
Because what you essentially do with 
young children is you wall off the space

47
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,920
and you try to make the conditions 
within that space optimal.

48
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,650
And the reason that you do that is so 
that the kids,

49
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,513
your kids fall in love with life and so 
they have to be cared for properly and 

50
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:53,290
attended to and cajoled in some sense 
into living.

51
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,360
I mean we know for example,
that

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,930
children who don't receive proper 
physical care,

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,840
proper love is the right way of 
describing it,

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,633
don't thrive and sometimes they die.
And so it isn't enough to provide 

55
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,404
children with food and shelter
and to protect them from the elements 

56
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,520
they have to be interacted with 
physically.

57
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:21,820
They have to be touched because 
otherwise they don't live.

58
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:24,130
And they have to be interacted with 
continually.

59
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,920
And you know,
that became very clear.

60
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,653
Well it was first learned in the late 18
hundreds when the mortality rate for 

61
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:34,504
orphans under one was 100%
this guy in New York whose name 

62
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,540
unfortunately escapes me,
was very curious about why this is b was

63
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,220
because the children were,
you know,

64
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:49,210
at least receiving what you might think 
of as the bare minimum of care.

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,853
And he journeyed to Germany,
he had heard about a nurse there named 

66
00:04:56,201 --> 00:05:01,201
fat Ana who had the miraculous ability 
to keep children under one alive,

67
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:04,690
at least in her ward.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,130
The mortality rate was much lower.
And so he went there to observe what she

69
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:09,964
was doing and all she was doing was 
taking the children out of their little 

70
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,014
infant cribs and putting them sort of on
a carrier on her hip and just walking 

71
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:20,374
around with them.
And then she'd put that child back in 

72
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,270
the crib and take another one out and 
walk around with the child.

73
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,120
And so the child got,
you know,

74
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,630
surface contact and a bit of 
stimulation.

75
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,030
And that seemed to be enough.
I mean that's pretty minimal,

76
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:34,864
but it was it a lot better than nothing.
And that was the first time that people 

77
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,841
understood explicitly that there were 
necessities to childcare other than,

78
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,830
you know what you might regard as the 
bare minimum

79
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,270
with little rats,
rat pups.

80
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,823
If you take rat pups away from their 
mother and you feed them and give them 

81
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:03,290
enough water and warm fail also guide.

82
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,450
The other thing that you have to do with
them,

83
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,973
what are what the research is do with 
them as they take a pencil with an 

84
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,970
eraser on the end of it and then they 
massage the little rat pups with the,

85
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,403
with the research end of the pencil.
And that's enough to make them feel 

86
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,050
loved,
I suppose.

87
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:23,020
And Ben,
they thrive and,

88
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,900
and there was a woman named Tiffany 
Fields,

89
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,170
I think this work was originally done by
Jaak Panksepp,

90
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,483
the massage work with the rat pups.
And there's a woman named tiffany field 

91
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,123
who started the program in Florida where
they massaged premature infants who are 

92
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,034
in the incubators for,
I believe it was three times a day for 

93
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:50,020
10 minutes.
And what happens with children,

94
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,370
these are premature infants generally 
who are in incubators.

95
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,350
What generally happens to them is first 
of all,

96
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:55,184
they lose weight.
And that's really not good because 

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,033
children,
infants near birth are supposed to be 

98
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,490
packing on a lot of weight.

99
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,873
Um,
so any loss is not only the loss but 

100
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,530
also a decrease from the gain.
And so,

101
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:09,980
you know,
it,

102
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,813
it,
it raises their mortality rates 

103
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:12,794
substantially.
And what fields and her researchers 

104
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:19,520
found that was that three minutes of 
three sessions of massage for 10 minutes

105
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,354
a day would the babies who were given 
that would gain weight as fast as 

106
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:27,464
children who were still in the womb and 
that you could detect positive 

107
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,600
physiological,
psychological and so forth,

108
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:40,040
emotional benefits six months later,
which is a very long time in them in the

109
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,620
life of an infant.
So,

110
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,770
so that's all to say that,
you know,

111
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,633
the role of parents is to set up a 
protective wall for all intensive 

112
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:57,560
purposes around their children so that 
they're not subjected to,

113
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,460
you know,
the unabated harshness of life.

114
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,650
And then to cajole them into living and 
thriving.

115
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,213
You know,
we need know that children have a place 

116
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,170
circuit that separate so they need to 
play.

117
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,360
And the touch circ seems to be mediated 
by all opiates.

118
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,643
And so one of the consequences of that 
is that if a child has scraped his or 

119
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:23,024
her knee and comes running up to you and
says fix it and you give them a hug and 

120
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:26,924
pat them,
that fixes it because the touch is 

121
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:30,404
actually analgesic.
And so it's also a useful thing to know 

122
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
if you're ever dealing with someone 
who's grieving because there's not much 

123
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:43,160
you can do about grief.
From our cognitive perspective,

124
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,850
you know,
I mean you can help allay people's guilt

125
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,880
is if they're suffering from undue guilt
about the circumstances.

126
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,803
But if they're grieving,
they're are in pain because grief is a 

127
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,770
pain response.
Technically speaking,

128
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,604
you can leave it with opiates.
You can also alleviate it with 

129
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,364
antidepressants to some degree,
which is also something else worth 

130
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:05,844
knowing because sometimes you'll see 
someone who's so deep in grief that 

131
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:11,270
they're going to hurt themselves because
of it.

132
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,690
You know,
it's traumatizing.

133
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,240
It'll produce brain damage.
It'll really do the men.

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,313
And that's just not helpful.
So it's useful to know that 

135
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,890
antidepressants can ameliorate that,
you know,

136
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:23,641
and you might say,
well,

137
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,370
people still have to go through it.
Natural grieving process.

138
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,204
It's like,
well actually the grieving process is 

139
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:30,924
the pain that the healing process is the
rebuilding of a life outside of the 

140
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:36,924
person who saved who died.
And that takes time and effort and the 

141
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,990
antidepressant isn't going to interfere 
with that.

142
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,370
So it's not self evident that people 
have to suffer themselves three quarters

143
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:51,570
to death in order to begin the healing 
process post grief,

144
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,920
but conscious also very helpful 
directly.

145
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,700
And so one of the things I recommend to 
my clients who are grieving is that they

146
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:03,780
go get massages because it's comforting.
You know,

147
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,840
that direct human to human contact 
actually has a antique grief effect.

148
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,330
So all right.
So anyways,

149
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,540
the Buddha grows up in this beautiful,
attractive,

150
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,320
safe place.
But of course he'd be,

151
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,250
he develops into adolescence that makes 
them curious.

152
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:27,084
And so he notices more and more 
consciously the existence of the walls 

153
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,180
and starts to wonder what's outside.

154
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,533
MMM.

155
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,240
And so he starts to play,
gets farther.

156
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,230
He wants to go out and he wants to go 
out and he wants to go out.

157
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,093
And of course that's a developmental 
story too because that's exactly what 

158
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,940
happens with children,
right?

159
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:49,774
Is that once they hit,
oh it's probably 11 something like that 

160
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,593
there,
I mean even at for their orientation 

161
00:10:57,341 --> 00:11:02,341
starts to move away from the parental 
unit out to the social community.

162
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:06,430
So
a child should be socialized

163
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,083
with regards to his or her ability to 
interact with nonfamilial with people 

164
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:19,130
who aren't part of the family between 
the ages of two and four.

165
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,800
So at two a child is still pretty 
egocentric.

166
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,410
It's hard for them to play with other 
children.

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,610
They can play beside them and you know,
they,

168
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,444
they can play to some degree.
Two year olds are actually often quite 

169
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,360
good at playing with babies,
which is quite interesting.

170
00:11:32,361 --> 00:11:33,194
You know,
it seems to be part of their inbuilt 

171
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,390
capacity,
you know,

172
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,230
but between two and four they have to 
learn complicated lessons.

173
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:43,970
Like how to share.
That's a tough one.

174
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,270
And because it kind of,
you know,

175
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:50,180
it involves taking the place of the 
other person to some degree.

176
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:52,310
But it also involves comprehending the 
future.

177
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,360
You know,
the idea that if you lend something out,

178
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,520
someone else can play with it and you'll
get it back.

179
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,100
And that'll be okay.
And that's a complicated one.

180
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:04,540
And then they also have to learn how to 
negotiate a script,

181
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,330
which is a ridiculously important thing 
to learn,

182
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,164
right?
So

183
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,960
they can either do that
formally when they play,

184
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,794
say a board game that has rules,
a simple board game or a game like 

185
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:22,411
marbles that actually has rules to which
they have to subordinate themselves.

186
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:24,244
So basically what's happening is they're
moving from a egocentric perspective 

187
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,880
where they're only playing their own 
game under the guys,

188
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:31,714
you know,
under the control of their own 

189
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:34,220
motivational,
uh,

190
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,073
structures to playing a game that two 
people or more conjoined into under the 

191
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:43,430
rubric of a higher order system of,
of rules and goals.

192
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,890
So what they're basically doing is 
learning to subordinate their motive,

193
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,813
individual motivational states to a 
state of being that allows multiple 

194
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,110
people to integrate their motivational 
and emotional states across time.

195
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,490
It's very,
very sophisticated,

196
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,430
very complicated thing to learn how to 
do.

197
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,010
And then of course they also learn how 
to do,

198
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,773
how to pretend,
play and pretend and play is far more 

199
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:12,700
important than people generally realize.
The typical pretend script will be,

200
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,650
there's a number of kids,
you know,

201
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,633
two or more and they're going to play.
They're going to have a little dramatic 

202
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,613
episode,
like maybe they're going to play house 

203
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,850
or,
and then they're all assigned roles.

204
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,953
That's all from mutual agreement and 
then the kids basically negotiate what 

205
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,410
the script is going to be and then they 
play it out.

206
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:33,730
It's,
it's a form of thinking,

207
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,300
right?
It's a,

208
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,133
it's a form of embodied thinking,
but what's really interesting about it 

209
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:39,904
is that
they have to agree on the structure of 

210
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:46,870
the gay man,
the roles.

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,793
Well,
when you negotiate with adults for the 

212
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,060
rest of your life,
especially in an intimate relationship,

213
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,250
that's exactly what you're going to do.

214
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,050
If you're negotiating properly.
It's like,

215
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:56,884
okay,
what do we want to have happen here in 

216
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:03,640
this space that we share and how are we 
going to conduct ourselves mutually?

217
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:07,780
So that occurs and people are really,
really not good at that,

218
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,840
you know?
But it is an extended form of play.

219
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,500
And if the relationship is going well,
then there's all,

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,393
there's an element of play in it because
that's one of the things that makes it 

221
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,770
enjoyable instead of just,
you know,

222
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,850
tyranny and necessity so well so the 
child starts to move out into the world.

223
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:31,510
But that increases,
you know,

224
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:32,344
the,
the,

225
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,110
the voyage length in some sense 
increases.

226
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:35,944
Cause the other thing children do,
and this is often but not always with 

227
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:39,604
their mothers,
they use her as a marker of defined 

228
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,284
territory.
I think that's the easiest way to think 

229
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:46,624
of it.
And then they screwed out from that 

230
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,580
marker and do some exploring until get 
tired or overwhelmed.

231
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,150
Then they come back and they get 
comforted and pat and you know,

232
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,103
put back into a routine and then they're
all put back together and then they go 

233
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,170
out next time a little bit farther and 
they run batch.

234
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,004
And so a big chunk of what you're doing 
as a parent is not so much 24 seven 

235
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,584
monitoring as making yourself available 
as a resource when the child deems 

236
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:16,783
necessary.
So that's part of why it's useful to be 

237
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,270
around and well,
I mean,

238
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,193
if you're a parent,
your place can be taken by another 

239
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,940
adult.
But that's only true really.

240
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,583
If the child knows the adult,
like children can make multiple parent 

241
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,464
like bonds.
But one thing they hate is having their 

242
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:39,150
primary caregiver changed because that 
the primary caregivers,

243
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,450
their whole world.
And so when you change that on them,

244
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:42,284
you just flip them upside down.
And so they can tolerate multiple 

245
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,394
caregivers,
but they have a really rough time 

246
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:54,250
tolerating transitions in child
care givers,

247
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,680
especially the younger they are the 
worst that is so well then you know,

248
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:02,990
as the child progresses towards 
adolescence,

249
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,020
then there's another burst of 
independent seeking activity pretty much

250
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,150
at puberty for obvious reasons.

251
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,643
And you know,
that's when the child is going to turn 

252
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:20,330
their attention almost entirely to 
fitting into the social world.

253
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,790
And so that's a form of apprenticeship.
We talked about that earlier in class.

254
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,533
So you can think the child goes from 
dependence to like dependence on the 

255
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,950
familial structure to interdependence 
with other children.

256
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,713
And,
and then that sort of would transform 

257
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:45,731
into in culturation and the development 
of an idea of a cultural identity.

258
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,353
And then perhaps there's a stage past 
that where morality is defined as 

259
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,060
something outside of pure cultural 
identification.

260
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,570
And that would be something more akin to
an individuation.

261
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,210
And that's the stage at which,
and this is a pay as Jedi and idea,

262
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,150
the person recognizes themselves as a 
creator and modifier of rules as well as

263
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:14,924
a follower and adherence of rules.
And you can even think to some degree 

264
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:24,990
that the divide between conservative and
liberal is a divide if that sort,

265
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:25,843
now the mapping isn't precise,
but the conservatives tend to be low in 

266
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,460
openness and high in conscientiousness.

267
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
So they're not that interested in 
transformation.

268
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,653
They're interested in maintaining the 
rules of the game and doing well within 

269
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:42,680
that set of rules.
And the liberals position is,

270
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,543
well sometimes the lip,
the rules themselves need to be altered 

271
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:51,180
and so you can't blindly accept the game
and follow it.

272
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,100
You have to be willing to adjust it when
it's necessary.

273
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,450
And so there's a constant tension 
between those two positions.

274
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,670
That's somewhat like the tension between
it was cyrus and horrors.

275
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,710
If it's all conservative than things 
stultify and that's not good because the

276
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:12,480
world changes and if your static 
cultural system doesn't change,

277
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:16,200
then it falls by the wayside.
But the Conservatives would say,

278
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:20,040
well don't be changing more things than 
you have to because all you do is invite

279
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:20,874
chaos in.
And so you could say in some sense that 

280
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,013
there's a pant on both sides of the 
political continuum and the pit on the 

281
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:34,161
conservative side is stultification and 
the pit on the liberal side is chaos.

282
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,283
And so the whole polity is trying to 
continually maneuver between chaos and 

283
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:40,824
order.
And the way you do that isn't by having 

284
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:43,914
the Liberals or the Conservatives win.
The way you do that is by having the 

285
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:51,981
Liberals and conservatives talk.
And as soon as they can't talk,

286
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,214
then there's trouble because they both 
stand for principle that can't be 

287
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:58,500
abandoned.
So,

288
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,334
and because the balance between chaos 
and order shifts with time as the 

289
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:04,884
environment shifts awake and aware,
people have to continually negotiate to 

290
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:10,734
determine exactly where that line is 
because it's not in the same place all 

291
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,150
the time.
So,

292
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,500
and that's not going so well at the 
moment,

293
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:20,334
especially in the u s you know,
that's not good and who knows what will 

294
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:27,270
come of it,
but it's definitely not good.

295
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,883
So all right,
so that by the time you know a child is 

296
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,054
adolescent,
then there's a fair bit of impetus to 

297
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:40,611
move out into the world beyond the 
confines of the familial structure.

298
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,560
Um,
if that doesn't happen,

299
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,100
then generally you could infer that
the child has not had it easy.

300
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,353
Either the child is quite dependent in 
terms of its fundamental temperament or 

301
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:59,160
that its independence has not been 
properly fostered by the parents.

302
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,013
Now.

303
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,220
So there's,
there's,

304
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,130
there was literature now,
and I haven't looked into this for,

305
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,093
it's probably 20 years now,
but there was literature that I was 

306
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:14,280
aware of when I was doing research on 
drug and alcohol abuse,

307
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,350
that there were two populations at risk.
If you look at how children,

308
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:20,483
adolescents use drug and alcohol,
drugs and alcohol in junior high and 

309
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,500
high school,
there were two populations at risk.

310
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,783
One population was those who 
experimented with everything and used 

311
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:31,314
everything to an access and all you can,
it doesn't take much description to 

312
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,050
understand where that might lead to 
antisocial behavior and,

313
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,953
and whatever damage you might accrue by 
formulating your socialization around 

314
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:44,934
alcohol for example.
But the other group that was in trouble 

315
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:52,030
with those kids who never experimented 
and so it was,

316
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,983
you've got two kinds of pathologies 
there and one pathology was a chaos 

317
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,430
pathology basically.

318
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,290
And the other one was an order 
pathology.

319
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,370
And the kids in the middle were ones who
had experimented to some degree.

320
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,473
You know,
because partly what adolescents are 

321
00:21:06,581 --> 00:21:10,420
doing this poking the social world,
the world of law,

322
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,270
really to see where its contours are.
You know,

323
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,123
cause part of the question is,
well is it necessary for me to follow 

324
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,174
these rules?
And you can't be told that you have to 

325
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,930
experiment and see what the necessity is
for the rule following.

326
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,630
And that means that your parents have to
allow you,

327
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,110
at least in principle,
there's a certain amount of freedom that

328
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:39,070
you need to be allowed,
or at least that's one way of looking at

329
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:39,904
it.
So there's at least some freedom that 

330
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:43,714
you have to be allowed.
If the goal of parenting is the 

331
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:51,010
production of someone who's capable of 
taking care of themselves.

332
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,683
Now,
you know,

333
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,990
it isn't obvious that that's always the 
goal of parenting,

334
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,913
because some cultures are more 
interdependent and there's no necessary 

335
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:05,761
presumption on the part of the parents 
that the person is going to live.

336
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,930
The person is going to have to be 
capable of living in a fully independent

337
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:12,340
existence.
But

338
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,913
okay,
so what happens is the king's son gets 

339
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:20,820
curious now at this point,
he also has a,

340
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,040
a retainer,
a guy who is with them all the time,

341
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:25,870
who's teaching and things,
but

342
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,750
the gods had got wind of it,
the father's plan,

343
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,000
and decided that they weren't going to 
make things as simple as he wanted it to

344
00:22:34,001 --> 00:22:37,570
be.
So the retainer is an agent of the gods.

345
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,830
And so,
and he's always whispering in the,

346
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,290
in the son's ear.
Well anyways,

347
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,813
Buddha,
the future Buddha gets curious and 

348
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,400
decides I'm going out,
I'm going out there.

349
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,960
And so his father realizes that some 
point that there's just no way that he's

350
00:22:55,961 --> 00:23:00,250
going to be able to be kept inside.
So he pulls a fast one,

351
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,223
it goes out to the city surrounding the 
walled city to the area surrounding the 

352
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:06,544
walled city.

353
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,533
And he chases away all the homeless 
people and he chases away all the 

354
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:11,314
elderly people and he chases away all 
the sick people and he has everybody 

355
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,900
spruce everything up so that it's in 
perfect shape.

356
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:17,734
And then he aligns the streets that the 
Buddhists carriage is going to go 

357
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:25,060
through with the most attractive people 
he can find all cheering.

358
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,130
And so one day they opened the gates and
the Buddha rides out in his,

359
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,630
in his chariot,
his cart and his,

360
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,450
his retainer is behind them.
And you know,

361
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,110
they go down the streets and the 
Buddhist,

362
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,370
they can,
this is just a final day.

363
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,204
And then someone who's ill wanders out 
onto the road in front of him and he's 

364
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:47,120
looking pretty rough.
This guy,

365
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:51,410
he's very sick and it's evident just by 
looking at him that things are not going

366
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:54,530
well.
And you know what the Buddhist stops his

367
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,230
chariot and the shock watching this 
person,

368
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,143
you know,
stumble across the road and he asks his 

369
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,780
retainer,
what the hell's going on here?

370
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,420
And the retainer says,
well,

371
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,930
you know this,
this person is ill and he's,

372
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,030
he's not,
something has gone wrong with him.

373
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:15,920
He's not functioning well.
And illness is the law of mankind and it

374
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,754
happens to everyone.
And so the Buddhists not very happy 

375
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,500
about that piece of information and 
bang,

376
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,334
he goes back into the walled city and 
that's just like he's running back to 

377
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,060
his mother,
roughly speaking.

378
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:30,710
It's the same idea,
right?

379
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:32,540
It's,
it's a piece of information.

380
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:33,374
He's just being offered an anomalous 
piece of information that's sufficient 

381
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:41,560
to shatter the structure of some of his,
his,

382
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:44,990
his value hierarchy.
Wow.

383
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:45,824
Back.
He goes,

384
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,373
you know,
and it takes them like six months to 

385
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,110
digest that piece of information,
but he manages it.

386
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,290
And then his curiosity starts to grow 
again.

387
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,370
And so he starts harassing is farther 
again about going outside again.

388
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,170
So the father tries to pull the same 
trick,

389
00:25:00,171 --> 00:25:01,700
but he's extra careful this time.

390
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:02,893
He makes sure all the sick people are 
rounded up and put somewhere where no 

391
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:05,894
one's going to see them.
And he lightens the streets again and 

392
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,623
the Buddha goes out and it's a beautiful
day and the streets are lined with 

393
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:17,021
cheering people and all of a sudden the 
gods are involved in this.

394
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,210
They're playing tricks on the father.
So they're the random,

395
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,520
that's the random uncontrollable 
element,

396
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,354
you know?
And I would say that's roughly 

397
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,600
equivalent to the snake in the garden of
Eden.

398
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:30,110
So it's the Buddhist curiosity that 
drives him out.

399
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:30,944
You know,
even though his father tells him that 

400
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,280
it's his set it up so that he shouldn't 
go.

401
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,100
And when he goes out there,
the anomalous thing,

402
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,100
oh,
occurs and fractures.

403
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,723
So he goes out,
well this time someone who's really 

404
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,980
agent hobbles out into the road,
you know,

405
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,460
all gray and wrinkled and bent over and 
not move and very well.

406
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,090
And the Buddha is shocked out of his 
mind again.

407
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,880
And he says to his retainer,
what's,

408
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,150
what's up with this?
And His retainer.

409
00:25:59,151 --> 00:25:59,751
He says,
look,

410
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:00,860
you know how you've,
you know,

411
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,190
going from small to larger and you know 
how you grow.

412
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:05,024
Well people continue to do that,
but at some point they start to age and 

413
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,610
things don't go so well and event and,
and that's the law of mankind.

414
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:18,611
And so the Buddha is like,
that's enough fun for one day and bang,

415
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:19,574
he goes back into the walled city and 
this time he stays inside for a whole 

416
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,850
year.
It's just like the rats who go out there

417
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,140
and see that cat,
you know,

418
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,200
and then go back to their burrow and 
scream for two weeks.

419
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,400
He's exactly the same idea.
And so far in a year later,

420
00:26:34,401 --> 00:26:38,810
he's more or less put himself back 
together and he decides to go out again.

421
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,080
And as father pose exactly the same 
trick for exactly the same reasons,

422
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,033
but this time the butsudan encounters a 
funeral procession and he can see the 

423
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,554
body and it's lying there still in cold 
and everyone is weeping and dressed in 

424
00:26:57,361 --> 00:27:01,110
black and it's a terrible situation.
And the Buddha asked his retainer,

425
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,370
what's up with this?
And His retainer says,

426
00:27:05,371 --> 00:27:07,710
well you know,
you saw someone who was sick and you saw

427
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,544
someone who was old.
And like the worst case scenario for 

428
00:27:11,911 --> 00:27:14,610
both of those is death.
And the Buddhist says,

429
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,460
well what's thought?
And the retainer explains to him as best

430
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:21,420
he can.
Well this time this is such a shock that

431
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:26,421
he can't even go back to the,
to the wall garden so to speak.

432
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,723
So as farther,
so this is the sort of shock that 

433
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,320
completely collapses his belief and his 
say infantiles paradise.

434
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,560
It's the death idea.
Then it's the same idea that comes up in

435
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:41,331
genesis,
right?

436
00:27:41,331 --> 00:27:42,164
Is that when Adam and eve are driven by 
their curiosity to interact with this 

437
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,430
snake like entity,
you know,

438
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,990
their realization is one of death and 
that blows paradise permanently.

439
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,580
They don't go back.
In fact,

440
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:59,010
God makes it impossible for them to go 
back,

441
00:27:59,011 --> 00:27:59,844
which is a variation in the Buddhist 
story because Buddha himself decides 

442
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:07,320
that he's not going back well as farther
has one more trick up his sleeve.

443
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,813
So he calls on the most attractive women
in the kingdom to go into a forest 

444
00:28:13,321 --> 00:28:18,321
nearby and to disrobe and to dance 
erotically and to attract and you know,

445
00:28:19,171 --> 00:28:22,020
to bring the boat of there,
to attract them back into life,

446
00:28:22,021 --> 00:28:22,854
to make him feel that the pleasures of 
living are sufficient so that this 

447
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,640
unfortunate incident can be put behind 
it.

448
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,503
But when he goes into the forest,
all he can think about is the 

449
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:37,520
transformation of flesh into decay and 
death.

450
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:41,280
And that's that done.
He can't go home again.

451
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:46,800
And that's what starts this journey.
And so the next thing the Buddha does as

452
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:52,370
he becomes an add depth at all sorts of 
different disciplinary traditions,

453
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,753
you know,
so he becomes an ascetic and he starves 

454
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,304
themselves so thoroughly that you know,
you can see a single grain of rice 

455
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:02,280
passed down his throat and he,
you know,

456
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,114
so he puts himself through martial arts 
traditions and ascetic traditions and 

457
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:07,614
all sorts of religious traditions trying
to in some sense put himself back 

458
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,204
together.
So the idea is that his fundamental and 

459
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,433
naive non self conscious early belief 
system is fractured completely by his 

460
00:29:20,111 --> 00:29:22,380
discovery of sickness,
old age and death.

461
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,980
And then as a fractured entity,
he then submits himself to various forms

462
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:34,410
of discipline trying to reconstitute 
himself.

463
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,083
None of that really succeeds.
And then the story ends with him going 

464
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:45,250
under a tree,
the Bodhi tree and adopting that classic

465
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:46,084
boot oppose and trying to attain 
lightman enlightenment through 

466
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:52,930
meditation and self examination,
which he actually manages to do.

467
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,250
And then he attains enlightenment and is
in a state of Nirvana,

468
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:00,730
but decides that he can't,
he,

469
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,480
he decides that it's immoral to stay in 
that

470
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,310
mode of being unless everybody can be 
there.

471
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,144
So he leaves Nervana,
which in some senses it's final 

472
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:13,234
temptation.
He leaves Nirvana and then goes out and 

473
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:19,300
starts to teach.
And so that's the story of the Buddha.

474
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,273
So now you know the off the most obscure
part of that is what happens underneath 

475
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,740
the bow tree.
No.

476
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,770
Now there's an,
there's an,

477
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,420
there's also an analog between that and 
what happens in the,

478
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,290
the whole,
what would you call it,

479
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:40,124
and narrative of Christianity because 
what happens with Christ is that his 

480
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:49,930
identity with God is fundamentally 
manifested when he ends up on a tree.

481
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,830
It's different,
right?

482
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:55,831
Because there's a crucifixion on a tree 
and it is regarded as a tree in a,

483
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,830
what would you call it,
in the mythological tradition.

484
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:04,831
So there's an idea in symbolic 
Christianity that Christ is crucified

485
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,883
on,

486
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,163
on this,
on the same tree where Adam discovered 

487
00:31:13,811 --> 00:31:17,020
that he was going to die.
And there's a reason for that.

488
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,030
Like there's a reason for that.
And the reason fundamentally is that,

489
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,513
okay,

490
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,630
both genesis and the story of the Buddha
make the proposition that it's this,

491
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,870
it's the,
it's the,

492
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,540
it's the,
uh,

493
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:34,180
ultimate extension of self consciousness
that

494
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,790
devastates people existentially.
It's the discovery of death,

495
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,350
let's say.
But it's not just that,

496
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,000
it's,
it's,

497
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,833
it's vulnerability per say.
It's not just death because there are 

498
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:50,641
worse things than death and that it's 
that discovery of ultimate vulnerability

499
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,000
that turns people into the creatures 
that they are.

500
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,240
And that one response to that is to 
build culture,

501
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,070
which is exactly what happens with the 
Buddha.

502
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,930
He,
Trevor's has multiple cultures,

503
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:02,764
right?
Becoming a master of many specific sub 

504
00:32:05,311 --> 00:32:06,144
cultures.
And then what happens in the old 

505
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:08,794
testament is that after the fall and 
after the story of Adam and eve and 

506
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:13,384
after the story of Noah,
those are all that really before the 

507
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:18,190
flood story.
So those are the really ancient stories.

508
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,263
Then you fall into history and you have 
the continual creation and destruction 

509
00:32:23,261 --> 00:32:24,940
of the,
of the Israel lights,

510
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:28,080
states and,
and you know,

511
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,660
then there's a break in some sense 
between Judaism and Christianity.

512
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,000
And it's an interesting break.
You know,

513
00:32:34,001 --> 00:32:35,980
I'm no expert in Judaism,
but Aye.

514
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,140
Aye.
Aye.

515
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,133
I think I've got this basically right,
is that the Christians make a decision 

516
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,260
that whatever Christ represented was the
solution to the problem,

517
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,273
not only of emergent self consciousness 
but also for the insufficiency of 

518
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:54,944
history.
Because remember you get an empire 

519
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:58,064
building and collapsing and then empire 
building and collapsing and an empire 

520
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:03,340
building and collapsing.
And you know,

521
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,890
one answer to that is a bigger and 
better empire.

522
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,203
And another answer is there's something 
wrong with the idea of empire as a 

523
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:12,764
solution to the initial problem.
And I would say that the Jews and the 

524
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,130
Christians basically split on that 
proposition.

525
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,050
And so that's partly why,

526
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,730
I mean from the,
from the

527
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,340
position of Judaism,
there may still be a messiah buddy,

528
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,440
but that person is not someone who's yet
appeared.

529
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,323
And then there's another proposition 
which is the state itself is redemptive 

530
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,903
and that's played out at least in part 
in Israel where the state is viewed as 

531
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:44,654
redemptive,
that things will go well for the Jewish 

532
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:46,904
people.
If an only if they can establish a 

533
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:50,120
state.
Now,

534
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,550
a skeptic would say,
yeah,

535
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:55,850
but all the things that the state was 
supposed to keep out,

536
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:56,684
start cropping up inside.
And I think that you have to be rather 

537
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,860
blind not to see that that's happened to
a large degree in Israel.

538
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,450
I mean,
one of the things that's happened,

539
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:08,960
forget about the Palestinians and the 
Arabs for the time being,

540
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,303
but even with in Judaism itself,
there's a major fracture between the 

541
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,460
more orthodox Jews,
the ones who are very,

542
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,294
very,
very conservative in their beliefs and 

543
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,760
habits and the more secular,
you know,

544
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,410
Westernized Jews.
And it's,

545
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,244
it's some sense,
it's the distinction between right wing 

546
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,550
and left wing.
But that's been,

547
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:29,481
you know,
a very,

548
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:34,340
very dire advisive divisive battle 
within Israel.

549
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,443
And what it shows in part is that you,
just because you establish a state 

550
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,463
doesn't mean you can assume that the 
kind of homogeneity that will eliminate 

551
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,074
conflict will then rain within that 
state because people within the state 

552
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:49,784
can fragment into different groups just 
like states themselves can be 

553
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:54,590
representative of other groups.

554
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,660
Now the,

555
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,860
if you look at the symbolic meaning I 
think,

556
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:04,080
or the psychological meaning of 
Christianity,

557
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,273
the idea is that the answer to the 
pathology of the state is the constant 

558
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:12,960
renewal of the individual.
And so

559
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,620
that that

560
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,150
falls into alignment with the idea of 
death and rebirth.

561
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,330
You know?
So if the problem is the balance between

562
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:25,840
chaos and order,
both at the state level and the,

563
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,850
and the individual level,
you might say,

564
00:35:27,851 --> 00:35:28,684
well where,
where should action take place in order 

565
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:33,820
to redeem the state?
And they,

566
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,280
I would say that the central Western 
idea,

567
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,610
and this is something emerged out of 
Christianity,

568
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,444
was that the way to transform the state 
is through the transformation of the 

569
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:46,350
individual.
So rather than the other way around,

570
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:49,350
which is you transform the state and 
hope all the individuals follow,

571
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,363
we tried that for example,
in the Soviet Union because you could 

572
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:53,334
say that the communist experiment was 
precisely the attempt to modify the 

573
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:01,230
state so that the individuals would 
follow.

574
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,120
Now I've been reading,
I just bought a new book,

575
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,583
very cheerful book called the Black Book
of communism and it was published in 

576
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:12,594
France in 1999 and the fact that it was 
published in France is particularly 

577
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:20,130
interesting because of all the European 
countries with the possible exception of

578
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:20,964
Italy,
communists had the largest sway over 

579
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,430
especially intellectual life.

580
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,073
And so I would say that the life of 
intellectuals in France after World War 

581
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,320
II was overwhelmingly radically left 
way.

582
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,750
And,
and not just to have the socialist type,

583
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:41,480
but of the communist hype.
I mean both,

584
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,610
both Italy and France had communist 
parties and the French intellectuals,

585
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:47,903
including people like Sartre,
were sergeant never did belong to the 

586
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:53,634
communist party,
but he was a supporter of the Communist 

587
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,543
Party and all the people,
all the French thinkers that are 

588
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:00,420
worshiped,
so to speak,

589
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:01,254
in universities today were all radical 
left wingers who were involved in the 

590
00:37:04,381 --> 00:37:09,381
student riots in 1968 and their beliefs 
were tantamount to communistic

591
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,040
and that's not a good thing.
So this book was written by people,

592
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,820
many of whom were former French 
intellectual communists.

593
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,923
And it was written in 1999 and I read 
the foreword and two of the chapters 

594
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:25,460
last night.
And

595
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,913
the first thing that the person who 
wrote the foreword claims is that it 

596
00:37:31,431 --> 00:37:36,080
wasn't possible to do a real analysis of
the historical significance of communism

597
00:37:36,081 --> 00:37:39,320
until 1999 until basically the end of 
the century.

598
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,543
Because what the Communists had done was
so obscure and so secret that there was 

599
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:45,764
no way to discover it.
And I thought that's complete rubbish 

600
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,560
because by 1945 or there abouts,
George Orwell was already writing animal

601
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,530
farm and,
and he wrote,

602
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,380
um,
1984 in 1948,

603
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,214
he just reversed the last letters and he
knew perfectly well what was happening 

604
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:06,720
in the communist countries.
And so if your eyes were open,

605
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,573
I would say by 1935,
you could tell because that's more or 

606
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,370
less in the midst of the Ukrainian 
famine,

607
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:15,680
which killed some four to 6 million 
people.

608
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,950
So,
so anyways,

609
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:19,784
so there was the 30s then things were 
complicated by the fact of the Second 

610
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,580
World War because,
well,

611
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,803
first of all,
the radical left was fighting against 

612
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,420
fascism.

613
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,253
Say in Spain to begin with,
and lots of European and American 

614
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,154
intellectuals went to Spain to against 
Franco and ended up on the side roughly 

615
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:38,464
speaking of the communists.
So that complicated things because the 

616
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,650
Frankel faction where it's definitely 
bad news.

617
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,484
So it was like a prototype of World War 
II because Franco was a fascist and he 

618
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:51,520
ruled until wasn't very long ago.
Well,

619
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,553
compared to World War Two,
I think it was maybe 1989 somewhere 

620
00:38:57,131 --> 00:38:57,964
around 1980 he finally died and Fred and
Spain transformed itself back into a 

621
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:06,760
democracy.
And I went to Spain just before that.

622
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,360
And it was,
it was an unbelievably poor country.

623
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,733
You could stay in Spain,
in the middle of Madrid for a dollar 50 

624
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:15,334
at night.
So that would be probably equivalent to 

625
00:39:17,651 --> 00:39:18,484
about $5 now.
And that got you a private room with a 

626
00:39:21,101 --> 00:39:25,030
shower and breakfast and wine there was 
cheaper than water.

627
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,863
It was about 75 cents a bottle,
which is something I remember very 

628
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:31,510
fondly.
But you know,

629
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,710
its economy was entirely devastated.
So in the Spanish civil war,

630
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,544
the left wing rose up against them.
The fascists essentially in that was a 

631
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:44,190
precursor to World War II.
And then when World War II emerged,

632
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,320
even though Stalin had made it number of
packs with Hitler,

633
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,080
you know,
the Russians joined the West as an ally.

634
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:50,914
And so for a while there,
it was counterproductive in some sense 

635
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:57,720
too,
to be criticizing the,

636
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,053
the Soviet Union to intently because 
there was something that needed to be 

637
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,234
taken care of first.
So there's some excuse for focusing on 

638
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:08,974
the Nazi horror first and then,
and only then focusing on what happened 

639
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:17,630
in the communist countries,
but still by the end of World War II,

640
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:22,000
anybody who wanted to know could know.
And what that basically meant was that a

641
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:22,834
massive swath of the western,
until intelligentsia put their damn 

642
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:27,364
heads in the sand and protected regimes 
that were so pathological that they 

643
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:32,830
defied description.

644
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,510
So there are,
there are relatively new figures in this

645
00:40:37,511 --> 00:40:41,230
black book of communism that describe 
deaths.

646
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:42,723
So you can attribute 25 million deaths 
directly to the Nazi oppression and 100 

647
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,443
million to communism.
So the bulk of that was the Soviet 

648
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,413
Union,
where it's 20 to 35 million 

649
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,260
Solzhenitsyn,
estimated 60 million.

650
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:01,190
And I should also say something about 
soul Jeanette's.

651
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:05,890
So the French intellectuals who are 
behind the publication of this book,

652
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:08,140
which by the way,
it was a hit in France.

653
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,570
It was a bestseller and very,
very controversial,

654
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,360
partly because people said,
well,

655
00:41:13,361 --> 00:41:15,120
if you criticize the left,
then you,

656
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,300
you know,
the radical left,

657
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:18,370
then you give carte blanche to the 
radical,

658
00:41:18,371 --> 00:41:19,204
right.
And of course the radical right has 

659
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,600
become an emergent phenomena.
Well,

660
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,140
you're going to watch it play out 
because here it comes,

661
00:41:26,141 --> 00:41:27,220
you know,
Sweden,

662
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,590
all the Scandinavian countries,
Germany,

663
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:31,330
Holland,
France,

664
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,560
the right wing parties are coming back.

665
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,350
And that's not going to stop.
And of course,

666
00:41:36,351 --> 00:41:38,600
the same thing is happening in the 
United States with trump.

667
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,250
So the left radical left wingers in 
France were saying,

668
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,084
well,
you don't pick on the communists even 

669
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,974
historically,
because that'll validate the claims of 

670
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,254
the radical right wingers,
which I think is an entirely appalling 

671
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,170
and pathetic argument.
You know,

672
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,360
it's like saying,
don't criticize the Nazis,

673
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,250
because that'll encourage the 
communists.

674
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:01,460
It's just not an acceptable way of 
comporting yourself.

675
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,850
And so,
but,

676
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,713
but anyways,
it was not politically correct shall we 

677
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,740
say to criticize the Communists,
especially in France and,

678
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:14,574
but that turned around to some degree by
1999 but I should also say that it was 

679
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,250
1974 that soldier knits and wrote his 
book,

680
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,084
the Gulag Archipelago.
And if you own it to know what was 

681
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,960
happening in the Soviet Union,
oh,

682
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:29,360
you had to do is read that book like 
it's a hell of a book.

683
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,620
It's 27 I think it's 2,700 pages long 
and it's very small type and it's,

684
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:36,110
it's one intense piece of work.
You know,

685
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,540
you don't read that as bedtime reading 
because it's,

686
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:43,690
it's so draw jokingly appalling that 
it's like permanently traumatizing.

687
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:44,774
But if you wanted to know,
you could've known in 1974 and more to 

688
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:50,354
the point you could have known in 1945 
he could've known in 1930 but the 

689
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:58,781
western intelligentsia basically covered
up the communist pathology,

690
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,960
I would say for something on the order 
of 70 years.

691
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,003
And we,
there's been no reckoning with that 

692
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,600
whatsoever.
In America,

693
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,740
in,
in European,

694
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:14,030
higher institutions of learning.
And so one of the things I still see,

695
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:14,864
and I see this because I talk about this
quite a bit in my psychology to 30 

696
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:21,230
classes that virtually every student 
knows about the Holocaust and,

697
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:25,070
and for a good reason,
but very,

698
00:43:25,071 --> 00:43:27,650
very few people know what happened in 
Soviet,

699
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,910
in the Soviet Union or certainly in 
China where the French estimates are now

700
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:34,070
65 million people.

701
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,620
Right?
So when,

702
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,470
you know,
that's so we'll pay to us.

703
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,510
You know,
I know some things about this,

704
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,800
but not very much.
I mean,

705
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:46,730
I know that you could certainly make the
claim that Mao was the greatest monster,

706
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:48,770
whoever lived,
you know,

707
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,080
even though he's still a revered figure 
in China,

708
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,300
which is appalling figure,
you know,

709
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:57,440
an appalling thing all in itself.
Now,

710
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,330
I don't know if you guys noticed this 
morning,

711
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,164
you probably didn't,
but one of the things that was trending 

712
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:05,300
on facebook was Kim young ills.
I think that's his name.

713
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:11,150
I get all those horrible,
wretched dictators confused because they

714
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:15,980
all look the same and have the same 
general satanic essence.

715
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,120
We basically like back in the,
I think it was in the 80s,

716
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,983
but it might've been in the 90s,
3 million or so North Korea and starve 

717
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:26,900
to death.
And what's his name?

718
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,410
The dictator came out and announced 
today too,

719
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:33,270
is North Korean population that they're 
going to have to go back.

720
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,390
And he said this to sucking routes to 
survive.

721
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,733
And not only that,
he's demanding that every family in the 

722
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:44,961
capitol donate two pounds of rice a 
month to the state warehouses.

723
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,060
So you can see where communist economics
gets you.

724
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,750
It's the warehouses that are supposed to
be distributing the food to the starving

725
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,584
people that are now tyrannizing them 
into donating what they don't even have 

726
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,370
to the state warehouses.
And so,

727
00:44:59,371 --> 00:45:00,204
you know,
that's the last bastion of Stalinism 

728
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:05,850
slashed Maoism and the Chinese of course
still support North Korea,

729
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,480
even though it is,
there's plenty of pathological countries

730
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,520
on the face of the planet.
But you know,

731
00:45:11,521 --> 00:45:15,090
you'd have to give either the gold or 
the silver metal to North Korea,

732
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,130
no where no one has enough to eat except
a tiny proportion of,

733
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:21,540
you know,
uh,

734
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,720
unbelievably corrupt aristocracy right 
at the talk.

735
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:28,740
And you know,
he's treated as if he's a divinity.

736
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,020
He is a kind of divinity but not the 
positive

737
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:32,820
kind.
So,

738
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,440
all right,
so back to back to,

739
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,850
so the idea there is,
you know,

740
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:48,010
if you're trying to figure out how to 
rectify the plight of humanity,

741
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:51,250
that's,
that's a good way of conceptualizing the

742
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:52,084
problem.
So the plight is laid out both in the 

743
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:58,060
story of the Buddha and in the stories 
that we covered last week in genesis.

744
00:45:58,061 --> 00:45:58,894
It's very straightforward.
People woke up and noticed that they 

745
00:46:01,181 --> 00:46:04,510
were going to die.
It's more complicated than that,

746
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:08,650
but it's because it's not just death,
it's vulnerability in all fronts.

747
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:12,040
So you could say death,
insanity and social judgment.

748
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,110
So death,
illness,

749
00:46:14,111 --> 00:46:14,944
insanity and social judgment.
That's what being self conscious means 

750
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:19,714
to people.
And I would say that two largest class 

751
00:46:21,971 --> 00:46:22,804
of fears go along with the mythological 
categories that we've been discussing 

752
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,840
because people are most afraid of the 
terrible mother and the dragon,

753
00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,580
so to speak.
That's chaos,

754
00:46:30,581 --> 00:46:31,414
that's death.
And the other thing they're most afraid 

755
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:34,210
of is tyrangiel judgment.

756
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:37,720
And you know those things are 
intertangled because of course,

757
00:46:37,721 --> 00:46:42,721
if you're rejected by your culture and 
forced to the bottom of the hierarchy,

758
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,310
the probability that you're going to 
confront it,

759
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:48,130
chaotic death radically increases.
So you know,

760
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:51,280
you can't really separate out rejection 
from,

761
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,010
from chaos,
but those are deaf.

762
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,260
And you'll see this with people with 
anxiety disorders.

763
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:59,020
They're almost always afraid of two 
categories of things.

764
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:04,180
One is death and the illness,
and the other is social judgment.

765
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,610
So if you take the typical agoraphobic 
her,

766
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:08,170
because she,
it's usually she,

767
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,850
her biggest fear is that she's going to 
have a heart attack on a subway and make

768
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:14,710
a fool of herself while she dies.
And you know,

769
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:15,810
because that's,
well,

770
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:18,070
it's like the ultimate nightmare in some
sense.

771
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,840
It is.
It is in fact the ultimate

772
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,723
nightmare.

773
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,290
Now,
the problem with the story of the Buddha

774
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:32,020
in part is that the ending,
the enlightenment element is vague.

775
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,093
It isn't clear what happens there.
Now I have a suspicion that that story 

776
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:40,780
grew out of a far older tradition,
which was the shamanic tradition.

777
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,620
And one of the things that's 
characteristic of the shamanic tradition

778
00:47:44,621 --> 00:47:45,454
is that the Sharman usually they take 
some kind of psychoactive drug in the 

779
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,770
Siberia,
which is where shamanism was most widely

780
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:57,530
spread and most established,
the drug was am anita miscarried,

781
00:47:57,550 --> 00:47:58,383
which is a particular kind of mushroom.
It's the red mushroom with the white 

782
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:02,314
caps on it,
quite white dots on it that you see in 

783
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:06,490
fairy tales all the time.
And there's a reason for that.

784
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,740
And and you know,
uphold that would occupy that.

785
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:12,663
That connection between Earth and heaven
was often a central feature of a 

786
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:17,440
shamanic ritual.
And one of the things that was happening

787
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:20,110
with the showman is that when they took 
the psychoactive drug,

788
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,333
they would climb in the pool that 
represented that connection between 

789
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,444
earth and have,
and then they would go up into the 

790
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,274
domain of the gods,
which is roughly equivalent to the idea 

791
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:30,670
of Buddha reaching nirvana.

792
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,073
And so there's a,
there's a UN charted relationship 

793
00:48:36,971 --> 00:48:39,130
between the most archaic human 
religions,

794
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:39,964
which were virtually undoubtedly 
grounded in the use of very powerful 

795
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:47,110
psychoactive chemicals and the Buddhist 
tradition.

796
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,760
And I think part of the reason that the 
vagueness is there is because the direct

797
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,940
connection between the,
what would you call it,

798
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,950
the theological use of transformative 
substances.

799
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,830
And the doctrine per se is not being 
well specified.

800
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,880
I mean now you see the same thing in,
in South America,

801
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,440
the drug there is usually Iowasca,
which is chemically actually

802
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:16,720
am Anita Mascara's different chemicals 
from Iowasca.

803
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:20,320
IOWASCA is very much like psilocybin and
LSD.

804
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:22,480
It has the same ring molecular 
structure.

805
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,800
But of course when the,
when the Amazonian Sharman take Iowasca,

806
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:31,750
they also communicate with the ancestors
and the gods.

807
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,370
That's a classic shamanically
pathway.

808
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:39,550
First communion with the ancestors,
then communion with the gods,

809
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:44,790
and it's actually based on the direct 
experience of the people who are putting

810
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:47,560
themselves into this ceremony.

811
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,053
So there's also some very interesting 
connections historically between 

812
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:56,620
Christianity and the use likely of 
siliciden mushrooms.

813
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,633
So there was a very weird book written 
in 1968 or thereabouts called the magic 

814
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:03,270
mushroom,
the sacred mushroom and the cross,

815
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,340
I think that's the name of it where it 
was a linguist who identified linguistic

816
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:14,581
patterns between the theological claims 
of Christianity and the language used to

817
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:16,534
describe mushrooms and their effect.
Now that book came out sort of at the 

818
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:23,830
height of the hippie revolution and even
though it was a serious book,

819
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:27,160
it was sort of shunted off into the 
hippies wrote this category.

820
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,810
It's not a hippie book at all.
I've read it a couple of times.

821
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,360
I have no idea what to make of the board
because,

822
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,553
because it's based on like with sticks,
it's far outside my range of of 

823
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:38,353
competence to evaluate.
But you certainly can't brush it off 

824
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:41,570
lightly.

825
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,403
And since then there's been all sorts of
evidence emerged that the use of 

826
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,640
mushrooms might've been central to it 
too early Christianity.

827
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,120
Anyways,
the fundamental split,

828
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,550
you could say that,
I think this is a reasonable way to look

829
00:50:58,551 --> 00:50:59,384
at it too,
is that once the basic problem that 

830
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:05,090
faces humanity is laid out rather than 
clearly.

831
00:51:05,091 --> 00:51:06,900
And so we'll say the s the problem 
month,

832
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:11,480
painful self consciousness and knowledge
of which is a major problem,

833
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:13,340
right?
I mean the terror management people,

834
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:14,723
it's social psychologists who are terror
management theorists basically say that 

835
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:19,244
that's rendered people permanently 
pathological and that they have to use 

836
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,350
illusion in order to defend themselves 
against that.

837
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:28,510
Freud basically made the same argument,
um,

838
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,640
when he was criticizing classical 
religion,

839
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:32,930
he basically said,
well,

840
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,153
people are using religious nonsense 
roughly speaking as a way of shielding 

841
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:38,924
themselves against their fear of death 
because they're too immature to be able 

842
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:42,980
to tolerate the reality.

843
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,520
You know,
and it's,

844
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,453
it's an interesting criticism and I 
found it quite compelling for quite a 

845
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:53,360
long time and I do think that people 
hide in their belief systems.

846
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:54,223
But I think one of the basic 
shortcomings of the Friday and ideas 

847
00:51:57,291 --> 00:52:01,640
that it doesn't really account for why 
people would invent the idea of hell,

848
00:52:01,641 --> 00:52:04,280
for example,
because that doesn't really seem to be a

849
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:06,320
lot more comforting than the idea of 
death.

850
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,610
In fact,
it's a lot worse.

851
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,473
It's like not only cause you to die,
but you die permanently or you die 

852
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:15,440
forever continually in the most painful 
possible ways.

853
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,920
I can't really see that as a why.
Why bother with that?

854
00:52:18,921 --> 00:52:20,330
If it's an illusion,
you can say,

855
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:22,490
well it's just to make the illusion more
believable.

856
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:23,324
But you know,
once you have to throw to conspiracies 

857
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:27,860
together to account for a phenomenon,
I think you're,

858
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,180
you're,
the onus of proof is definitely on you.

859
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,710
You know?
So,

860
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,110
okay,
so then the question is,

861
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:38,090
well,
what's the,

862
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:42,410
what's the cure for the pathology that 
self conscious pathology?

863
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,610
And I could say,
I could say,

864
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:45,230
well,
there's two answers to that.

865
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:49,760
And one is the building of a state,
you know,

866
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,713
and,
and that's obviously that's if some 

867
00:52:52,701 --> 00:52:53,534
utility,
because the terror management people 

868
00:52:55,971 --> 00:53:00,971
tend to think of culture as 
psychological and as a defense mechanism

869
00:53:01,581 --> 00:53:03,490
against the fear of death.
But that's,

870
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,490
it's,
it's an overly psychological explanation

871
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:08,324
because obviously one of the things that
culture does as well as protecting you 

872
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,570
from the fear of death is actually 
protect you from death.

873
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,733
You know,
in our culture does everything it can 

874
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:22,361
not only to protect you from death but 
also to protect you from any exposure to

875
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:23,661
death.
You know,

876
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:24,494
part of the reason,
and this is something the sixties 

877
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,784
hippies jumped up and down about two,
part of the reason that we have 

878
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:33,540
psychiatric nomenclature and an entire 
psychiatric system is to take people who

879
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:37,590
are so crazy that they're disturbing off
the streets so that they don't,

880
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,813
you know,
rake existential have on the people who 

881
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,474
are outside.

882
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,643
You know,
and you can debate about whether or not 

883
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,680
that's appropriate.
But you know,

884
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:47,514
it's definitely the case that it's much 
more difficult to walk down the street 

885
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:54,000
if there's very many people who are 
overtly damaged.

886
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:56,790
And expressive about it on that street.
And you can say,

887
00:53:56,791 --> 00:53:58,200
well,
they have a right to be there.

888
00:53:58,410 --> 00:53:59,550
And you can say,
well,

889
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,500
the public has a right to protect 
itself.

890
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:04,200
And obviously both those claims are 
valid and there's,

891
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:05,243
you know,
the right way through it as a 

892
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:09,990
consequence of dialogue.
But it's still nonetheless the case that

893
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,183
we're almost never exposed to extreme 
old age were never exposed to death and 

894
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:17,310
we're almost never exposed to,
you know,

895
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,780
insanity and physical illness unless you
go into a hospital or a place like that.

896
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,543
So one answer to the problem that faces 
mankind is the state as the answer and 

897
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,840
the other,
well let's,

898
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,400
and then we can examine that.

899
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,233
But the problem with that seems to be 
that the state can split into something 

900
00:54:37,021 --> 00:54:39,330
that's very pathological and something 
that isn't,

901
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,760
those are the archetypal elements of the
state.

902
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,990
And then you could make a case that when
the state is fully pathological,

903
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,480
it's actually worse than the original 
problem.

904
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,330
So then the question becomes,
okay,

905
00:54:51,331 --> 00:54:55,530
well the state has utility what you do 
to stop it from becoming corrupt.

906
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:58,440
That's the real question.
As far as I can tell.

907
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,293
And so I would say the Egyptians 
partially solved that problem when they 

908
00:55:04,741 --> 00:55:06,600
started to build their mythology,
of course.

909
00:55:06,601 --> 00:55:08,550
And no cyrus,
because they basically said,

910
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,743
well,
there's two principles that have to be 

911
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:16,640
at work in order,
not only in order to maintain the state.

912
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:20,250
And so we'll say against Isis and the 
forces of the underworld.

913
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,440
Isis being the goddess of the 
underworld,

914
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:25,380
not the new isis is pretty damn funding 
that.

915
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,760
That's their initials,
you know,

916
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,480
so
the states in necessity,

917
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:34,830
but it has to be updated as a 
consequence of the careful action of the

918
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,200
citizen,
you know,

919
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:39,810
by the attention of the citizen 
represented by Horace.

920
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:40,913
Now,
there are many critiques of 

921
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,463
Christianity.
I would say most of these come on the 

922
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:47,394
atheistic end of things,
who make the point that if you take the 

923
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:52,374
mythologies of Horace and the 
mythologies of Christ and you line them 

924
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,680
up side by side,
they're virtually the same.

925
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:02,550
So many of the mythological elements of 
Christ's cause.

926
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:05,250
He's half saying that the logical and 
half historical,

927
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:08,070
though the evidence for his historical 
existence is very,

928
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:11,610
very thin.
But it's heavily mythologized.

929
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:12,444
And a lot of the mythology that was used
to represent Christ was just taken 

930
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:15,804
completely from the mythology of horace.
And so the atheist tick wing of 

931
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,740
criticism,
critics of Christianity say,

932
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:24,574
well obviously that means that 
Christianity is false because it's 

933
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:28,144
central figure was just granted the 
attributes of the previous Egyptian 

934
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,073
Daddy.

935
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:36,890
But well,

936
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:46,750
but I think that that criticism is 
fundamentally beside the point in,

937
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:47,623
in the most important of ways because 
the ideas of what characterized horace 

938
00:56:52,461 --> 00:56:53,294
emerged as a consequence of a lengthy,
I would say evolutionary process to 

939
00:56:57,351 --> 00:57:01,520
define what constituted the central 
redeem or rubbed the state,

940
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,443
roughly speaking.
And then that was just translated on to 

941
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:05,743
Christ.
And that that is just a continuation of 

942
00:57:08,481 --> 00:57:09,314
the religious dream in a sense.
It's not indication that there's 

943
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:16,040
something fundamentally fraudulent about
Christianity.

944
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:17,953
I mean,
unless you think that Christianity is 

945
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:25,220
based on the kind of history that 
empirical historic historians regard his

946
00:57:25,221 --> 00:57:27,590
history,
and that's not the only kind of history.

947
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,460
So,
all right,

948
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:34,294
so then I want it,
I want to talk about something else in 

949
00:57:36,491 --> 00:57:37,900
relationship to that.
So,

950
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,510
and this is sort of
in some sense,

951
00:57:45,231 --> 00:57:48,260
this is the last part of the course,
which is good.

952
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:49,640
Given that we're coming to the end.

953
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,390
When I was working on these ideas,
I laid out the logic that you just,

954
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,160
that I just described to you,
you know,

955
00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,010
to mankind as a fundamental existential 
problem.

956
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:05,100
I don't think that's a particularly 
radical claim that's made.

957
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,890
The claim is made by all sorts of 
schools of thought,

958
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,053
not least the existentialists.
But I would say that that problem was 

959
00:58:12,391 --> 00:58:15,540
already put very clearly in our most 
ancient religious writings.

960
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:18,360
So it's not a new idea.
It's a very,

961
00:58:18,361 --> 00:58:22,740
very old idea.
And then out of that emerged,

962
00:58:22,741 --> 00:58:23,574
the idea that is state would emerge as a
medication for that fundamental 

963
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:29,634
pathology.
And you see that in genesis right away 

964
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:33,090
because as soon as Adam and eve have 
their eyes open,

965
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:33,924
they put on tape leafs.
So the first thing they do is turn fig 

966
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,820
leaf is an emblem of culture,
you know,

967
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:39,654
it's clothing.
And so clothing is certainly one of the 

968
00:58:41,701 --> 00:58:43,710
things that distinguishes us from 
animals.

969
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,480
And so the idea that we could build 
structures that would protect ourselves,

970
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,733
well that's what we do and they work,
but they don't necessarily solve the 

971
00:58:53,671 --> 00:58:58,170
fundamental problem or at least they 
don't solve it permanently and they lead

972
00:58:58,171 --> 00:58:59,004
to another set of problems.
And the other set of problems is the 

973
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,704
pathology of the state.
And so the state then instead of 

974
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:04,704
becoming a defense,
a genuine defense or let's even say an 

975
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:08,754
adaptation to our vulnerability starts 
to become an exploiter of our 

976
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:14,610
vulnerability.
And I would say that,

977
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,150
you know,
there are roots.

978
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,970
So the communist idea was a utopian 
ideal.

979
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,770
And the idea was that,

980
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:28,083
okay,

981
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:32,390
the idea was that the pathology that 
characterized human beings could be laid

982
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:37,391
at the feet of the state.
There was no notion whatsoever that part

983
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:42,410
of the pathology of being human is an 
inbuilt part of being human.

984
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,253
Now that's kind of an original sin claim
in some sense is that we could keep all 

985
00:59:46,461 --> 00:59:47,890
the culture we want,
our new,

986
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:49,880
it's not going to solve your problem

987
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,733
now.

988
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:56,550
So the Marxist utopia and idea had its 
roots in surgery,

989
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:01,320
strains of Christian Utopian thinking.
So because it was Saint Thomas Moore who

990
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:03,960
wrote the first book on Utopia.
And so,

991
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:04,973
you know,
Christianity in some sense influenced 

992
01:00:06,451 --> 01:00:07,284
the Utopian element of Marxism,
but it was the Marxists in particular 

993
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,513
who decided that the reason that human 
beings had problems was because of the 

994
01:00:14,701 --> 01:00:16,350
organization of the state

995
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,173
now.

996
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,633
So that,
and then there was a conclusion from 

997
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:22,220
that and the conclusion was,
well,

998
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:25,910
if you just got rid of the apparent 
pathology of the state,

999
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,880
then people would enter into a utopian 
mode of being.

1000
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:30,830
And so what are the pathologies in the 
state?

1001
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:31,763
While there are still the things that 
radical egalitarians are opposed to 

1002
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,900
hierarchical structure,
differential,

1003
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:40,940
uh,
distribution of resources,

1004
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,870
that's pretty much,

1005
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,070
you know,
private ownership is part of that.

1006
01:00:47,071 --> 01:00:47,904
But you know,
I would say that that's more like an 

1007
01:00:49,891 --> 01:00:54,150
intake really that's tied integrity 
within the first two problems.

1008
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:54,984
And so then the Marxist idea was 
basically on the one hand eradicate 

1009
01:00:58,921 --> 01:00:59,754
prior to private property,
distribute resources equally eliminate 

1010
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:03,594
the distinctions between the classes 
because they thought of classes as the 

1011
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,580
fundamental dividing,
you know,

1012
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:11,220
categories of people not race like the 
Nazis,

1013
01:01:11,221 --> 01:01:12,054
but class.
And then you'd usher inna an endless 

1014
01:01:15,601 --> 01:01:18,720
utopia.
Well,

1015
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:20,190
you know,
stated like that.

1016
01:01:20,191 --> 01:01:23,790
It just sounds stupid and you know,
because I,

1017
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:24,743
I,

1018
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:25,950
okay,

1019
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,430
maybe that's too harsh,
but I don't really think it is in,

1020
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:33,270
in the late 1800 stores get dusty Husky,
he knew all this was coming.

1021
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:37,950
He absolutely knew this was coming and 
God only knows how he knew it.

1022
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:41,670
I mean human would say he was very much 
in touch with the collective unconscious

1023
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:44,150
and you could think of the collective 
unconscious in some senses.

1024
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,470
Like imagine that you have a system of 
ideas,

1025
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,040
you know,
think you are,

1026
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:50,100
that you articulate and you are aware 
of,

1027
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:53,130
but they rest on a dream,
you know,

1028
01:01:53,131 --> 01:01:55,200
which is the place where the ideas are 
coming from.

1029
01:01:55,201 --> 01:01:58,740
But also like the matrix out of which 
the ideas emerge.

1030
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,813
It's a dream like fantasy and it's 
something that's more or less shared by 

1031
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:03,414
everyone.
And you could be farther away or closer 

1032
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:09,570
to that underlying dream like structure.
And the more artistic you are,

1033
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:11,003
the more open,
I would say the closer you are to that 

1034
01:02:12,811 --> 01:02:13,070
dream.

1035
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:16,800
Like structure or Dostoyevsky was 
immersed right inside of it.

1036
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:19,080
And I think that was partly because he 
was epileptic.

1037
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:25,010
So because epileptics have transcendent 
experiences often and,

1038
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,880
and suffer from an overwhelming 
intensification of emotions.

1039
01:02:29,881 --> 01:02:32,790
And so that did something to,
Dorsey has keep it sort of put them into

1040
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,310
a different category.
That's what it looks like to me.

1041
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,280
But anyways,
he knew this was coming in in his book,

1042
01:02:38,281 --> 01:02:40,980
the Devil's aptly named or the 
possessed,

1043
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,890
he says,
this is what's wrong with Russia.

1044
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:44,993
Here's what's happened.
As a consequence of our belief system 

1045
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:47,634
falling apart,
here's the sort of person who is 

1046
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:52,350
destined to emerge and this is what's 
going to happen.

1047
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,380
It's exactly right.
So,

1048
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,550
so,
and at the same time,

1049
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:01,920
Dostoyevsky was thinking this through 
and he and miss,

1050
01:03:01,921 --> 01:03:04,230
he did most clearly in the book notes 
from underground,

1051
01:03:04,231 --> 01:03:07,260
which I would highly recommend that you 
read because it's very short.

1052
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:10,280
It's very interesting.
And it's an ultra bleed.

1053
01:03:10,281 --> 01:03:13,530
Brilliant.
And the reason it's brilliant is because

1054
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,080
Dostoyevsky's main character in the 
book,

1055
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,063
you know,
who's partly informed by 

1056
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:18,714
autobiographical experience,
is a failed civil servant who is a 

1057
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:23,904
nobody.
And who was super resentful and he's a 

1058
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,630
coward.
He's angry,

1059
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:29,700
resentful and cowardly.
But he's very,

1060
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,534
very smart.
And of course he's very proud about the 

1061
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:35,400
fact that he's smart because that's 
pretty much what he has to cling on to.

1062
01:03:35,401 --> 01:03:37,380
He doesn't have a family,
it doesn't have anything else,

1063
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:38,783
but so he's an appalling person.
You could say he's caught the 

1064
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:43,730
underworld,
but what's interesting is that right

1065
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:45,850
eat

1066
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,010
being caught in the underworld,
in that chaos,

1067
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,690
he doesn't degenerate right into someone
who's not allistic or totalitarian.

1068
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,143
He kind of tolerates the tension and 
there are certain things that emerge 

1069
01:03:56,741 --> 01:03:59,230
for,
for him as potential truths.

1070
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:00,363
And so one of the things he says was 
that he sort of toyed with the idea of 

1071
01:04:03,521 --> 01:04:08,521
utopia and he talks about,
he talks about the palace of crystal.

1072
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,533
And so in the palace of crystal,
it's a perfect future utopia and 

1073
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,480
everyone has provided with what they 
need.

1074
01:04:16,481 --> 01:04:20,980
And Dostoevsky says there are so well 
provided that all they have to do is eat

1075
01:04:20,981 --> 01:04:24,760
cakes and busied themselves with the 
reproduction of the species all day.

1076
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,133
So you could think about it as a 
realization in a sense is a concrete 

1077
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:32,980
realization of an economic utopia.
You don't have to work.

1078
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,520
Everything you want is provided for you.
So everyone's happy.

1079
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,170
And Dostoevsky says,
well,

1080
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:41,320
you have to be out of your mind to think
that everyone would be happy under those

1081
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:44,560
circumstances because people are 
fundamentally insane.

1082
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:47,770
And so that if you gave people 
perfection,

1083
01:04:49,150 --> 01:04:51,370
the first thing they would do once they 
got bored,

1084
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:53,710
three quarters to death,
which would take about a week,

1085
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,590
is run around looking for something to 
smash,

1086
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,483
just to cause some trouble,
just so that there'd be an interesting 

1087
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:02,740
problem.
And I think while you can see the,

1088
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:04,870
the,
the relationship between that and the,

1089
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:06,300
and uh,
and uh,

1090
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,900
uh,
the events in,

1091
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,300
in the,
in the book of Genesis at the beginning,

1092
01:05:10,301 --> 01:05:12,970
you know,
because God tells eve don't mock up out,

1093
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,133
you know,
be satisfied with what you've got and 

1094
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:16,804
her curiosity and to go interact with 
the one thing in the whole place that 

1095
01:05:20,651 --> 01:05:23,740
she shouldn't interact with and then all
hell breaks loose.

1096
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:27,220
And then you have to ask yourself,
is that a good thing or a bad thing?

1097
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:28,203
And what Dostoyevsky concludes is that 
that's a good thing is it's that that 

1098
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:33,844
fundamental experience seeking 
disruptive element of the human psyche 

1099
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,274
is actually the best thing about it.
And the idea that we could quell it's 

1100
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:46,060
operation,
but by providing what's essentially a,

1101
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:47,200
you know,
a,

1102
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,950
a return to the womb is something,
you know,

1103
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:50,793
you could think about it that way where 
you have no problems to think that that 

1104
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:54,394
would actually solve the problem is not 
only absurdly immature but also just 

1105
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,680
false on the face of it.
You think,

1106
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:05,410
well,
first of all,

1107
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:07,050
that's an amazing conclusion.
I mean,

1108
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,790
think about that.
Dostoyevsky's thought that through.

1109
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:15,010
He figured out what was wrong with the 
idea of communist utopia 40 years before

1110
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,840
the Russian revolution.
I mean,

1111
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:19,660
it's unbelievable.
Not only did he see what was coming,

1112
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,820
he saw what was wrong with it,
you know,

1113
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:23,800
and you could say the same thing about 
Nichelle though,

1114
01:06:23,801 --> 01:06:24,634
I don't think Nietzsche ever read road 
anything that has the like concentrated 

1115
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:31,000
narrative punch of notes from 
underground.

1116
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,180
And what happens in the [inaudible] 
notes from underground.

1117
01:06:34,181 --> 01:06:39,100
In some senses it's a novel about 
someone attempting to take niches,

1118
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:39,963
route to being a superman,
a lot of Dostoyevsky's novels or both 

1119
01:06:43,011 --> 01:06:43,844
that so risk gallman caught for example,
in crime and punishment who heads up 

1120
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:47,404
being a murderer essentially tries to 
transform himself into a Nietzschean 

1121
01:06:50,471 --> 01:06:51,304
Superman beyond good and evil,
making his own values and Dostoyevsky 

1122
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:56,134
plays that out in his conclusion is 
don't break rules that you don't 

1123
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:02,320
understand because if you do something,
we'll take you down.

1124
01:07:02,530 --> 01:07:04,450
And that's basically what happens to her
skull Nichol.

1125
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:09,370
He kills his,
the pawn broker and the pawn brokers.

1126
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:14,500
Slave slash nice kills them with an ax.
He gets away with it,

1127
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:16,383
he gets away with it.
No one has any idea that he does it and 

1128
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:19,054
he has access to all her money,
which he promptly bernease and I think 

1129
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:25,560
in an abandoned lot and wants absolutely
nothing to do with,

1130
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:26,463
but you know,
it's constantly haunted by what he's 

1131
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:30,990
done and keeps revisiting that area,
you know?

1132
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,550
And then a prosecutor starts to suspect 
him even.

1133
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:34,384
There's no reason to.
And basically subjects him to a Chinese 

1134
01:07:38,861 --> 01:07:39,694
water torture.
He just taps him and taps him and taps 

1135
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:43,614
him and tapson and taps him until he 
starts to break down and eventually can 

1136
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:51,010
facets and the cat and mouse game played
by the prosecutor and risk call Niqab is

1137
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:51,873
absolutely psychologically terrified.
I've never seen anything like that in 

1138
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:55,924
any piece of literature because 
Dostoyevsky was smart enough to figure 

1139
01:07:58,991 --> 01:07:59,824
out exactly how you would torment 
someone with a guilty conscience and to 

1140
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:03,904
confess and the prosecutor is patient,
he just plays them like you'd play a 

1141
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:08,944
fish well and were scolding the cog 
undergo so we won't worry about the end 

1142
01:08:13,811 --> 01:08:15,420
of the story cause it's not that 
relevant

1143
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,223
in notes from underground.
A similar thing happens is that this 

1144
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:21,823
narrator who is so pathological and 
railing against his own cowardice and 

1145
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:29,951
his own resentment and so weakness,
but also not having any,

1146
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:36,080
not granting any credence to the idea of
a future modern utopia.

1147
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,333
He,
he tries to reconstruct his own 

1148
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:40,484
character.
And the way he does that is he ends up 

1149
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:47,030
in a relationship with this woman who's 
been forced into prostitution,

1150
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:48,043
which is,
was a very common consequence of female 

1151
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:53,360
poverty in that era because,
well,

1152
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:56,060
because everyone was absolutely dirt 
poor to begin with.

1153
01:08:56,061 --> 01:08:59,180
And because the alternatives were few 
and far between,

1154
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:00,014
if you fell out of your social class for
for any reason and he decides that he's 

1155
01:09:03,921 --> 01:09:06,470
going to redeem her,
he's going to improve her life,

1156
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:07,304
he's going to rescue her.
And so the last part of the book is 

1157
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:13,040
about him trying to rescue her buddy 
fails because he just doesn't,

1158
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,450
you know,
he takes on this job,

1159
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:18,740
which is to help someone in real trouble
and like helping someone in real trouble

1160
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:23,150
I would say is you bloody well better be
careful before you try that because real

1161
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:24,590
trouble is real trouble.

1162
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:28,610
And the probability that you'll have the
wherewithal to help instead of making it

1163
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:30,440
worse is very,
very low.

1164
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,110
And that's exactly what happens to him.
He sort of,

1165
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:34,483
he attempts supposedly most both.
He sort of becomes narcissistic in his 

1166
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:39,974
estimation of his redemptive capability.
But there's a part of were part of him 

1167
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:46,280
is motivated by a general,
a genuine desire to help.

1168
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,293
But when push comes to shove,
he can't tolerate the responsibility 

1169
01:09:52,071 --> 01:09:54,560
that would take to follow it through and
he ends up betraying her.

1170
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:57,380
And so of course she ends up in worse 
condition than she was to begin with.

1171
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,420
So it's an absolutely amazing novel and 
there's more to it.

1172
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,343
And I should tell you about this too.
So the palace of crystal was actually a 

1173
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:11,981
reference to an actual building.
And the building was a building that was

1174
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:13,304
erected in England,
in London for the world's fair that was 

1175
01:10:16,911 --> 01:10:17,780
held at that point.

1176
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,320
And it was the first steel and glass 
building of any size.

1177
01:10:21,321 --> 01:10:24,320
And so it was a forerunner of,
you know,

1178
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,250
our,
our,

1179
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:27,013
our modern downtowns.
And the reason in part that every 

1180
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:35,651
downtown in the world looks the same.
If it was built say between the 1950s in

1181
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:40,250
the 1970s 1980s the seventies where in 
particular,

1182
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,460
absolutely appalling.
But you know,

1183
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:45,380
that was the new international style.
And,

1184
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,303
and it was,
was originated in Germany and it was 

1185
01:10:48,141 --> 01:10:53,141
predicated on the idea that the worker 
would want a bare bones structure,

1186
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:54,044
glass tower,
completely devoid of in the 

1187
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:58,850
ornamentation because that was all 
birdwatch nonsense.

1188
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,923
And that that style should be imposed 
everywhere in the world as a movement 

1189
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:06,770
towards this sort of workers utopia.
Well you can see what that did.

1190
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,260
You know,
so these,

1191
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:10,123
you know,
I'm telling you that because these 

1192
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:12,014
ideas,
they stretch out and they have their 

1193
01:11:13,681 --> 01:11:14,880
tentacles everywhere.

1194
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,670
You know.
So that new international style that was

1195
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,504
certainly responsible for things like 
the housing projects in the United 

1196
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:24,270
States,
which were absolute catastrophes.

1197
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:25,783
You know,
all came out of this dream up the 

1198
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:30,390
workers socialist paradise.
Well,

1199
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,680
so Dostoevsky goes on the rampage 
against that idea and on a psychological

1200
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:36,120
basis he just says,
well,

1201
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:36,954
don't be,
you really think that human beings are 

1202
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,730
constructed so that if you give them 
enough to eat,

1203
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:43,500
they'll be satisfied.
It's like,

1204
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:44,334
that's not what we're like at all.
We're not even close to like that were 

1205
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:47,603
full of snakes and twists and insanity.
And he makes that case very 

1206
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:57,660
straightforwardly and says,
not only are we like that,

1207
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:58,494
but that it's a really,
it's the best thing about us that we're 

1208
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:03,300
like that some re remarkable,
remarkable book.

1209
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,000
So,
okay,

1210
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,230
so,
well then we might say,

1211
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:09,900
well,
what happened when these utopian schemes

1212
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:10,920
were put into action?

1213
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:12,760
All right,
so,

1214
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:14,293
and describe what happened in the Soviet
Union and the girl in the Gulag 

1215
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:20,180
archipelago.
And he estimated that the stent,

1216
01:12:20,450 --> 01:12:25,450
the Soviets killed 60 million people 
between 1919 in 1959 roughly speaking.

1217
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:29,550
Now people have taken them to task for 
that estimate,

1218
01:12:29,551 --> 01:12:33,120
but there's no good records.
And certainly the,

1219
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,390
it's between 25 and 60 million.
And you know,

1220
01:12:36,391 --> 01:12:37,530
you might say,
well,

1221
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,730
really does it matter?
Is that actually the point?

1222
01:12:41,910 --> 01:12:45,520
Once you're past your first 10 million,
you've already established your,

1223
01:12:45,630 --> 01:12:47,310
your character,
I would say.

1224
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:48,171
You know,
and,

1225
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:50,460
and Stalin said,
one,

1226
01:12:50,461 --> 01:12:53,340
death is a tragedy and a million deaths 
is a statistic,

1227
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:56,790
which pretty much gives you some insight
into how stellan thought.

1228
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,780
So
what happened in,

1229
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,370
in,
in the USSR?

1230
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:08,250
Well,
here's the stat for you.

1231
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:10,550
So czar,
you know,

1232
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:15,150
before the USSR,
Russia was czarist,

1233
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,343
right?
And so it was a monarchy like most 

1234
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:19,674
European countries were monarchies,
except it was more futile than most 

1235
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,540
European countries,
certainly far more than England say,

1236
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:28,374
or France.

1237
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:35,150
And the radicals regarded the czar as an
oppressor.

1238
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,670
And so it was the oppression of bizarre 
risks,

1239
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,523
the czar and the aristocracy.
That was partly what provided the 

1240
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:44,694
impetus for the workers slash peasants 
because they were mostly peasants in 

1241
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:52,050
Russia to rise up against,
let's say,

1242
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:53,243
for the sake of simplicity,
they're class enemies from 1825 to 19 I 

1243
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:05,070
think it was 1900 it's right around 
1,975 years.

1244
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,503
The czar tourists sentence 6,000 people 
to death for political crimes and 

1245
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:11,484
executed thousand in the years for 1919 
to 1959 the communists killed 30 

1246
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,773
million.
So when we're thinking about the 

1247
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:22,594
communist revolution as a revolution 
against tyranny and a justifiable 

1248
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:26,914
revolution against tyranny,
we should be very careful what it is 

1249
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,110
that we're defining as tyranny.
Now,

1250
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:36,010
if you want to know what the Russian 
camps were like four prisoners,

1251
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,620
you can read Dostoyevsky's house of the 
dead.

1252
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,483
Because what happened to Dostoyevsky is 
he was one of those people who was more 

1253
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:43,480
or less sentenced by the czar.

1254
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,210
He was a student radical.
They throw him in prison,

1255
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,433
took him out one day,
pretended to shoot them in a firing 

1256
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:51,160
squad,
used blanks,

1257
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:52,503
shorter them out completely there.
There's some evidence that that's when 

1258
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:58,360
his epilepsy either started or really 
became intense,

1259
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:02,530
and then they banished him to a prison 
in Siberia.

1260
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:05,890
And the prison was full of thieves and 
murderers and rapists.

1261
01:15:05,891 --> 01:15:07,990
And it was a rough place.
And you know,

1262
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:11,740
Dostoyevsky was an aristocratic guy,
an educated person,

1263
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,750
a young man.
He had no idea what to expect.

1264
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:15,460
And so he wrote a book called the House 
of the dead,

1265
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:16,294
which is a very interesting book.
But if you read the house of the dead 

1266
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:20,283
and then you read the Gulag archipelago,
you think that like the house of the 

1267
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,790
dead was up.
I was up Caribbean,

1268
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,450
Caribbean holiday camp compared to the 
ghoulag.

1269
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,313
I mean,
when the prisoners in the prison camps 

1270
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:38,140
in Dostoyevsky's prison,
sorry,

1271
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:40,840
used to go into the villages,
which they did,

1272
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:41,980
they could go into the villages.

1273
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,813
I mean they regarded and all that,
but they could go there to work and 

1274
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:46,800
people would come out and give them 
food.

1275
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:47,653
Little kids would come up to them and 
give them food because one of the 

1276
01:15:49,691 --> 01:15:50,524
characteristics of Russian culture at 
that point was that the peasants in 

1277
01:15:53,891 --> 01:15:58,040
particular felt that the people who were
in prison were unfortunate,

1278
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,650
you know,
and they felt bad for them.

1279
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:02,140
It was part of their Orthodox Christian 
charity.

1280
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,890
And they also felt that maybe they were 
only one step from the same thing.

1281
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:07,990
And so their basic attitude was 
charitable.

1282
01:16:07,991 --> 01:16:10,390
And you know,
they were fed in the prisons.

1283
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:10,901
Like,
I mean,

1284
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:15,901
it was hardly gourmet fair,
but of course everybody was so damn poor

1285
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:18,570
at that time that that's not even a 
reasonable comparison.

1286
01:16:18,571 --> 01:16:20,440
And you know,
it was rough,

1287
01:16:20,441 --> 01:16:21,274
but it wasn't,
it wasn't the most imaginative Roth you 

1288
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:25,114
could possibly imagine for the most 
pointless possible purpose ending up in 

1289
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:31,420
your death and likely your family's 
death.

1290
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:33,610
It wasn't that.
And you know,

1291
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:35,770
you got out of those camps,
you got out,

1292
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:37,930
you do your sentence,
and then they would let you go.

1293
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:40,720
They might exile you,
but even if you were Exxon,

1294
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:41,554
you could have a life there.
So that was the extent of the judicial 

1295
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,860
and penitential tyranny of the czars,
you know,

1296
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:51,723
and you know,
I'm not saying that the czarist system 

1297
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:58,471
was all sweetness and light,
but I don't think that's relevant.

1298
01:16:58,930 --> 01:16:59,763
It was part of the feudal system.
It had developed organically in some 

1299
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,424
sense across history.
The Russians were sort of on the slow 

1300
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:09,070
end of the developmental curve,
but,

1301
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,970
but it wasn't handled a lot better than 
what came afterwards.

1302
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,920
So
after the,

1303
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:23,220
the Soviets after Lenin took over,
now landon stepped in when,

1304
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,700
when,
when Lennon stepped in to take power,

1305
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:30,730
Russia was basically in chaos.
What had happened was World War One,

1306
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:31,754
which was,
you know,

1307
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:32,863
a frenzy of insanity and basically mark 
the end of the monarchical system in 

1308
01:17:36,921 --> 01:17:37,610
Europe.

1309
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:39,080
It also marked,
by the way,

1310
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:39,914
the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire 
and the fragmentation of the Middle 

1311
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,113
East.
And so part of the reason that the 

1312
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:46,123
Middle East is parsed up the way it is 
today is because the Ottoman empire 

1313
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:49,184
collapsed.
England and France still had some 

1314
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:51,824
dominion there as victors in World War 
One and they created the Middle Eastern 

1315
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:57,440
countries out of the wreckage of the 
Ottoman empire.

1316
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:58,131
So,
you know,

1317
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,620
we're still playing out the consequences
of that,

1318
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:03,440
but it's something useful to know.
That's how that came about.

1319
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,333
The empire collapsed,
but all the monarchical empires 

1320
01:18:06,711 --> 01:18:08,780
essentially collapsed after World War 
One.

1321
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:12,590
Russia was devastated,
the soldiers were,

1322
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,430
were deserting the trenches on Mohs and 
coming home.

1323
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:17,583
Part of it because the czar had 
abdicated after he took control of the 

1324
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:22,490
armed forces,
things went south even further,

1325
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:23,413
he abdicated and the new parliament,
which was sort of half democratic and 

1326
01:18:26,581 --> 01:18:31,250
half socialist I would say,
was starting to divide up the land among

1327
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:32,084
the peasants.

1328
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:33,013
And so the soldiers were very motivated 
to get the hell home so that they could 

1329
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:37,520
get some of this land.
But the whole country,

1330
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:42,950
the overarching political system had 
collapsed and the Russians were starting

1331
01:18:42,981 --> 01:18:45,530
to organize themselves from the bottom 
up at that point.

1332
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:48,790
And there was the hints of a new 
governmental structure in,

1333
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:52,760
in Moscow in this was this democratic 
socialist alliance,

1334
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:53,953
but there was still a terrible power 
vacuum and the central authorities in 

1335
01:18:58,071 --> 01:18:58,904
Moscow never really seem to get control 
of the country and it was into that 

1336
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,920
mass,
that Lennon step.

1337
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,780
And so,
you know,

1338
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:08,810
sometimes when there's an 
extraordinarily chaotic situation,

1339
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:11,240
it just takes one seat of orders,
so to speak,

1340
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:12,074
to spread itself out everywhere.
It's like the Yin and Yang symbol and 

1341
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,044
that's what happened.
But so the Marxist idea was that the 

1342
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:24,200
thing that made people's lives 
intolerable was basically differences in

1343
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:29,120
distribution that had been stabilized 
into class differences.

1344
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,073
And so the classes were basically that 
proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the 

1345
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:34,970
virtual Z,
we're the owners.

1346
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,223
And so if you owned anything,
the theory was that since everything of 

1347
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:42,674
value was created by workers,
the only way you could have any excess 

1348
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:50,420
value was essentially if you stole it,
if you took it.

1349
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:54,200
So you were by definition an oppressor 
by definition.

1350
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:55,663
And that part of the move towards the 
socialist utopia was that the Burj waze 

1351
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:03,164
would dissolve as a class.
Well that the communists were a little 

1352
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:10,710
impatient for the spontaneous 
dissolution of the bourgeoisie.

1353
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:15,090
So what they decided to do was just 
proactively dissolved it.

1354
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,313
And so what the Nazis did to the Jews 
and the other people that they 

1355
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:24,180
persecuted for the manner in which they 
were born,

1356
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:25,014
roughly speaking,
the Communists did to people who to 

1357
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:28,584
people by class.
And so essentially if you were educated 

1358
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:33,383
and you own any property or if someone 
just didn't like you and you were a 

1359
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:39,030
little richer than anywhere,
anyone else,

1360
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,800
you were going to be dead.

1361
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:46,670
And so they sent wave after wave of 
radical brutalized,

1362
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:47,963
resentful mobs into the Russian 
countryside and raped and pillaged and 

1363
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:55,973
killed everyone who was competent.
And so part of that was direct so that 

1364
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:03,534
you know a mob would storm your house.
Now you have to understand that often 

1365
01:21:06,391 --> 01:21:07,224
wouldn't,
these outside agitators came into the 

1366
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:09,264
village.
There was enough outside agitator so 

1367
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:12,480
that they could do the storming by 
themselves,

1368
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:17,190
but they would pick up adherence in the 
village and those would be the adherence

1369
01:21:17,191 --> 01:21:19,830
who wanted to go out to someone's house 
and you know,

1370
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,480
strip it of all its valuables and have 
their way with the people inside.

1371
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:25,314
And so you can imagine what sort of 
people that attracted the obviously the 

1372
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:28,884
highest quality of person.
And so they'd go out to a Kulak house 

1373
01:21:32,011 --> 01:21:32,844
and surrounded.
Now often the peasants would fight them 

1374
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:39,210
off with pitchforks trying to defend the
people inside the house.

1375
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,860
And you know,
that works sometime.

1376
01:21:40,861 --> 01:21:41,694
But most of the time it didn't work.
And then they'd go in and they take 

1377
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:44,454
everything absolutely everything out of 
the house and leave it with nothing and 

1378
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:52,980
then leave the people with nothing.
And then eventually those people,

1379
01:21:52,981 --> 01:21:54,990
the ones that survived,
which weren't that many,

1380
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,363
the government offered them the 
opportunity to be taken out to Siberia 

1381
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,113
to start a new life.
They could bring two months worth of 

1382
01:22:01,951 --> 01:22:02,784
food in their families and go out there.
But of course they didn't have two 

1383
01:22:04,921 --> 01:22:07,380
months worth of food because everything 
had been stolen from them.

1384
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:09,840
And then when they go out to Siberia,
there was nothing left,

1385
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:10,763
nothing there except crowded camps that 
immediately produced typhus and killed 

1386
01:22:13,891 --> 01:22:16,200
all the children.
So that was,

1387
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,540
that was the beginning of the Russian 
revolution.

1388
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:20,820
And it was lennon who did that.
So if you,

1389
01:22:20,821 --> 01:22:24,720
if you read communist revisionists,
they'll basically say,

1390
01:22:24,721 --> 01:22:25,554
well,
things were going all hunky dory under 

1391
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:29,040
Lennon because he had everyone's best 
interest in mind.

1392
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,450
And then that monster,
Stalin,

1393
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,010
God,
control of the party.

1394
01:22:32,011 --> 01:22:32,844
And that's when it became a cult of 
personality that had nothing to do with 

1395
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:36,960
true communism.
You know,

1396
01:22:36,961 --> 01:22:41,550
that's the rationale.
But Lennon was just as good a monster.

1397
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,393
Astella he just didn't live very long.
He died in about 1920 to 1923 something 

1398
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:47,514
around that.
And He'd already produced style and as 

1399
01:22:49,711 --> 01:22:52,800
his followup monster at that point,
you know,

1400
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:53,634
and that was just,
things just barely got going at that 

1401
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:56,724
point.
You know,

1402
01:22:57,420 --> 01:23:00,000
the next thing was after they got rid of
all the Kulaks,

1403
01:23:00,001 --> 01:23:03,660
they collectivize the farms,
which meant if you had a farm,

1404
01:23:03,661 --> 01:23:06,130
you're some damn peasant.
You just got some

1405
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,750
land,
you know,

1406
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,330
because your,
your parents were basically,

1407
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:12,610
they weren't,
they were basically slaves.

1408
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,160
For all intents and purposes,
they were attached to the land.

1409
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:15,994
And so you just got some land and some 
of you were smart enough so that you 

1410
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:19,294
made something out of it.
You were growing food at the same time 

1411
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:23,470
to feed everyone.
So,

1412
01:23:23,471 --> 01:23:24,460
and you know,
in any,

1413
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:28,960
in any creative enterprise,
any creative enterprise whatsoever,

1414
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,170
it's a minority of the people who do all
the productive work.

1415
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,041
So,
you know,

1416
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,920
if you have a hundred farmers,
10 of them grow half the food.

1417
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:38,950
If you have a thousand farmers,
30 of them grow half the food.

1418
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,550
So you go out there and you wipe out 
your most productive people.

1419
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:44,560
It's like,
well guess what happens next?

1420
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:45,873
Well you,
you wipe them out and then you forcibly 

1421
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:51,460
collectivize and so everyone who had 
nothing and who is completely useless,

1422
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:54,700
it's thrilled about that.
But the next thing that happens as well,

1423
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,050
hey,
you don't grow any crops.

1424
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:01,180
And so that's what happened.
Food production plummeted.

1425
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,613
And then

1426
01:24:04,350 --> 01:24:04,690
yeah,

1427
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:05,523
for a variety of reasons,
the central Soviets weren't very happy 

1428
01:24:07,931 --> 01:24:08,764
with the Ukrainians.
And so what they decided was that they 

1429
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:12,950
were going to take all the food that the
Ukrainian collected,

1430
01:24:12,951 --> 01:24:13,784
this farmers managed to grow anyways,
which wasn't very much and ship it to 

1431
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:17,404
the cities.
And so they did that and then they 

1432
01:24:19,211 --> 01:24:20,044
pursue prosecuted women who would go out
into the fields with their children to 

1433
01:24:23,111 --> 01:24:23,944
pick up individual grains of wheat that 
the gleaners that the threshers had 

1434
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:30,460
missed.
And the punishment for that was that you

1435
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:31,294
were incarcerated in a death camp and so
6 million Ukrainian starved and 

1436
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,483
cannibalism was so rife in the Ukraine 
in the 1930s that the Soviet government 

1437
01:24:39,671 --> 01:24:43,120
printed posters saying it is barbaric to
eat your children.

1438
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:46,540
So you might say,
well that's a little too little,

1439
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:50,350
a little too late.
So that was the first 6 million deaths,

1440
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:55,380
not counting all the Russian civil war 
and all the desks that went along there.

1441
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,760
And that just basically got the ball 
rolling,

1442
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:58,691
you know?
Well,

1443
01:24:58,691 --> 01:24:59,524
that was happening that the Gulag camps,
that style or that Solzhenitsyn wrote 

1444
01:25:03,461 --> 01:25:04,294
about were well onto being established.
And that's where it was in slave labor 

1445
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:08,974
camps,
roughly speaking that the Soviets 

1446
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:11,374
produced enough of their economic goods 
to keep lumbering along with these 

1447
01:25:14,831 --> 01:25:19,180
forest five year plan projects that made
everyone into a liar.

1448
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:21,160
And so that's the next part of the 
story.

1449
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:22,293
So

1450
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:28,640
Solzhenitsyn probably has done a better 
job of documenting this than anyone else

1451
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:30,890
I ever read,
but it's,

1452
01:25:30,891 --> 01:25:33,230
uh,
it's also something that orwell talked a

1453
01:25:33,231 --> 01:25:34,370
lot about.
You know,

1454
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,660
I think that the best introduction to 
this idea is probably 1984,

1455
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,280
because it's a short book,
you know,

1456
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,700
and basically what happens in 1984 is 
it's a,

1457
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,400
it's a satire of communist 
totalitarianism,

1458
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:50,300
clearly.
And I mean expressly,

1459
01:25:50,301 --> 01:25:51,134
that's exactly what it is.
And basically the rule was in the 

1460
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:55,664
society of 1984 that you are not allowed
to think or say anything that wasn't 

1461
01:25:58,941 --> 01:26:01,670
part of the prevailing dogma.
The Times.

1462
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:06,530
And one of the things that happens,
1984 is that there's three big blocks,

1463
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:07,393
power blocks,
and they're always at war with one 

1464
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:10,880
another except who they're at war with 
shift.

1465
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:14,420
So at one point it's,
I think one of them is called Oceana,

1466
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,870
I don't remember exactly,
but these two power blocks are at war.

1467
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:20,960
And then all of a sudden that switches,
these two power blocks are at war.

1468
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:21,794
And so then all the history textbooks or
revised and all the news stories or 

1469
01:26:24,621 --> 01:26:27,470
revised.
So it's as if we were always at war with

1470
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:29,480
that particular block.
And you know,

1471
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:34,170
that can change on a whim.
And so everyone is required to pair it,

1472
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:38,060
the beliefs of the state and to praise 
it continually.

1473
01:26:38,061 --> 01:26:38,894
No criticism whatsoever.
And everyone in the entire state is an 

1474
01:26:42,831 --> 01:26:43,664
informer or at least enough people so 
that the probability that you're going 

1475
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:47,084
to get nailed,
if you ever say anything that you 

1476
01:26:48,141 --> 01:26:52,580
actually think it's near 100% and the 
informers are continually rewarded,

1477
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:55,010
which is exactly what happened in the 
Soviet Union.

1478
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:56,083
So if you were some nasty bit of work 
with your three families in your 150 

1479
01:26:59,991 --> 01:27:00,824
square foot apartment,
which would have been about what you 

1480
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:02,924
could expect and you were hoping that 
maybe your son and daughter could have 

1481
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:06,404
their own place and you saw someone down
the hallway that you didn't like or had 

1482
01:27:09,531 --> 01:27:10,364
an animus against her or whatever,
couple of words to the proper 

1483
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:15,020
authorities.

1484
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:15,853
And they come charging in at two in the 
morning with their Jack boots and you 

1485
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:19,970
know,
take everyone out,

1486
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:22,700
bring them to the central prison,
shave them balled,

1487
01:27:22,701 --> 01:27:25,850
strip them of their clothes,
put them in ill fitting uniform,

1488
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:29,210
and they were gone.
And then you've got their apartment.

1489
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,390
So that was the basis of the Soviet 
state.

1490
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:34,190
So,
you know,

1491
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:37,340
you should just imagine for a while what
that would be like.

1492
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,620
And so one of soldiering instance 
points,

1493
01:27:39,621 --> 01:27:41,750
and this was something that was echoed 
by Viktor Frankl,

1494
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:44,780
but soldier knits and does the best job 
of documenting this,

1495
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:47,630
was that,
first of all,

1496
01:27:47,631 --> 01:27:51,530
he takes the Marxists presuppositions as
a set of axioms.

1497
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,930
And he says,
well,

1498
01:27:53,931 --> 01:27:57,950
one possibility is that these axioms 
were never put into practice property.

1499
01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:00,410
So let's look at that idea.
And then he says,

1500
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,071
well,
you know,

1501
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:01,904
there's a couple of problems with that 
because here's how the axioms were put 

1502
01:28:04,051 --> 01:28:04,884
into practice in the Soviet Union 
directly as a consequence of the 

1503
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:12,410
accident themselves,
which is like private property is theft.

1504
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,720
You know,
the Burj waze is a,

1505
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:19,460
is a parasitical class that um,
you know,

1506
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:20,210
that,
that,

1507
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:23,000
that everything should be collectivized 
in equal among everyone.

1508
01:28:23,001 --> 01:28:23,834
Those are the basic presuppositions.
And that was exactly what was put into 

1509
01:28:26,361 --> 01:28:28,880
practice and used as justification for 
everything they did.

1510
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:31,880
So that's a non starter.
And then he also points out,

1511
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:32,893
well,
we don't just have the Soviet Union as 

1512
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:36,920
an example.
We have the Soviet Union,

1513
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,410
we have China,
which was even worse.

1514
01:28:39,470 --> 01:28:42,830
We have Vietnam,
we have Cambodia where Pol Pot,

1515
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:43,664
who was trained in France at the 
Sorbonne by French left wing 

1516
01:28:46,131 --> 01:28:46,964
intellectuals,
went back through everyone out of the 

1517
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:53,570
city and killed one in four people in 
Cambodia in the space of about 10 years.

1518
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,760
And then of course we still have North 
Korea.

1519
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,773
And we also have the fact that the only 
countries in Africa that suffered like 

1520
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,123
deadly famines in the 20th century were 
those that were running by communist 

1521
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:05,844
dictators.

1522
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:09,390
So how much he evidence do you need?
You know,

1523
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,790
and so people say,
and I've had people say this to me,

1524
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:12,270
is that,
you know,

1525
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:13,103
that wasn't true communism.
And I think what that means is that 

1526
01:29:15,871 --> 01:29:20,580
person has the following delusion.
If they were the leader of the Communist

1527
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,580
Party at that time,
things would have turned out better.

1528
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,300
And the probability of that is,
first of all,

1529
01:29:27,301 --> 01:29:29,340
if you were the sort of person who was 
good,

1530
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:30,953
the chance that you would live through 
the massacres and get to the top was 

1531
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,380
zero.
There wasn't a chance of that,

1532
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:40,260
you know?
So the system basically produced its own

1533
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:45,090
breed of horrible monster to lead it.
And there is no standing in its way.

1534
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:46,133
You know,
if you had an iota of compassion and 

1535
01:29:49,021 --> 01:29:51,290
dared to express that,
I mean,

1536
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,433
think about what you're doing.
If you stand up in a system like that 

1537
01:29:55,381 --> 01:29:56,214
and act compassionately,
you're an immediate judge of every 

1538
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:01,290
single person around you who doesn't 
want to do that.

1539
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:03,480
Well,
you're not going to live through that,

1540
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,710
that's for sure.
You know,

1541
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:07,500
they'll kick call you an enemy of the 
state or whatever the hell it is.

1542
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:12,570
You're going to be gone in no time flat.
So what soldier Nixon,

1543
01:30:12,630 --> 01:30:13,351
so,
okay,

1544
01:30:13,351 --> 01:30:14,184
so orwell made the proposition that 
states like that could only exist if 

1545
01:30:18,571 --> 01:30:19,404
everyone in them was trained to lie.
And the training was the idea of 

1546
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,473
training isn't exactly orwell's notion 
willing to and punish if they did both 

1547
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:30,984
of those at the same time.
And so that's where the idea of 

1548
01:30:33,151 --> 01:30:35,370
Orwellian doublespeak comes from.
You know,

1549
01:30:35,371 --> 01:30:37,170
and that's when you say one thing but 
mean another.

1550
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:39,660
You say something that is in accordance 
with the,

1551
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:41,490
you know,
the tenants of the time,

1552
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:45,390
but it's a euphemism to cover up 
something terrible that's going on.

1553
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,793
And so 1984 with the story of a person 
who basically gets tangled up in that 

1554
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:52,944
and they find his worst fear,
he's afraid of rats and they punish him 

1555
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:57,990
with his worst fear.

1556
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:59,790
And the way they punish him is by 
putting a,

1557
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,010
uh,
like a muscle,

1558
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,310
like a goalie mask or like an umpire's 
mask on his face,

1559
01:31:05,311 --> 01:31:08,850
except it's this long.
And they put a starving rack inside that

1560
01:31:08,851 --> 01:31:13,470
and tie it to his head.
And so that's 1984.

1561
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:17,760
But that's exactly the sort of thing 
that happened in the ghoulag prisons.

1562
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:18,793
No,
I mean perhaps not the rap thing 

1563
01:31:20,491 --> 01:31:22,080
precisely,
but it doesn't really matter.

1564
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:23,183
And the other thing the Soviets did was 
that if they throw you in one of their 

1565
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:26,604
prison camps,
you had to sign a confession admitting 

1566
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:29,184
that you were wrong,
which was its own particular kind of 

1567
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:32,630
evil.
You know,

1568
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:35,200
the Nazis,
if they gathered you up and

1569
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,750
the lines were clear cut,
it was irrelevant.

1570
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,990
Your innocence or guilt as a person was 
irrelevant.

1571
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,033
You know,
you were the member of a racial group 

1572
01:31:45,361 --> 01:31:47,550
deemed unacceptable and so you were 
dead.

1573
01:31:47,551 --> 01:31:48,384
But the Soviets,
they actually managed to figure out how 

1574
01:31:49,861 --> 01:31:54,390
to make that even worse.
So that not only were you destroyed as a

1575
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:57,510
consequence of your birth but class,
not race,

1576
01:31:58,020 --> 01:32:00,100
but you had to also that you

1577
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,010
are an enemy of the state and sign that 
before they would kill you.

1578
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:05,430
And so most people did,
and I'm surprising,

1579
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:07,180
you know,
there were people who didn't,

1580
01:32:07,181 --> 01:32:10,600
but,
but they were few and far between.

1581
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:14,050
And you know,
of course that's not surprising.

1582
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:16,570
I mean,
how much punishment do you think someone

1583
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:17,404
can take and soldier Nixon's book,
there are stories of people who didn't 

1584
01:32:20,591 --> 01:32:21,810
give in,
you know,

1585
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:24,280
and those people are so damn tough,
you just can't even,

1586
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:25,653
he said that was actually what transform
social and it's an an accounts cause he 

1587
01:32:27,971 --> 01:32:29,320
was,
you know,

1588
01:32:29,321 --> 01:32:30,154
a moderately committed,
although somewhat cynical communist on 

1589
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:37,120
entry into the counts.
But then he saw people in there who were

1590
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,073
absolutely unwilling to falsify any of 
their experience and lie no matter what 

1591
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:45,490
happened to them under any conditions 
whatsoever.

1592
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:46,683
And he was so amazed by that,
that it actually produced a 

1593
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,330
transformation in this character.

1594
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:53,163
And part of what the Gulag archipelago 
is about is exactly that transformation 

1595
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:57,363
and his discovery of the,
what you might describe as the 

1596
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:03,970
individual responsibility to truth in 
the face of state tyranny,

1597
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,433
you know,
and soldier Knutson's basic conclusion 

1598
01:33:07,091 --> 01:33:07,924
was,
and this is a conclusion by the way the 

1599
01:33:09,371 --> 01:33:12,460
Dostoyevsky had drawn 70 years 
previously,

1600
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:17,680
was that an individual who stops lying 
could bring down a totalitarian state.

1601
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:19,653
And so it's a very interesting claim.
No Cause Solzhenitsyn's inclusion from 

1602
01:33:23,381 --> 01:33:27,190
his detailed analysis and all his 
personal experience inside the camps was

1603
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,400
that no matter how powerful the 
totalitarian state was,

1604
01:33:30,401 --> 01:33:34,030
that in the final analysis,
he couldn't stand up to actual truth.

1605
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:36,183
Now it's a very radical plane,
but it's born out in part by his 

1606
01:33:40,471 --> 01:33:41,304
experience.
Because of course Solzhenitsyn did tell 

1607
01:33:42,661 --> 01:33:43,494
the truth and his book,
the Gulag Archipelago was one of the 

1608
01:33:47,491 --> 01:33:50,310
things that,
well it was the book,

1609
01:33:50,311 --> 01:33:53,970
but demolished the credibility of 
communism as a political structure.

1610
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:55,830
So he managed it.

1611
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:57,333
No.

1612
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:04,650
The first book that he wrote called the 
a day in the life of Viabahn,

1613
01:34:04,650 --> 01:34:05,483
Denisovich was published in 1962 so what
happened was Stalin died or was killed 

1614
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:11,454
in the late 1950s I think it was in 1957
but it was somewhere between 1957 in 

1615
01:34:16,561 --> 01:34:17,394
1959 and cruise chef took over.
Now there's some evidence that 

1616
01:34:20,461 --> 01:34:23,610
Khrushchev and two other people killed 
stolen because they thought it was going

1617
01:34:23,611 --> 01:34:25,710
to invade Europe,
which is hydrogen bombs.

1618
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:27,293
And started,
it already demonstrated quite clearly 

1619
01:34:28,741 --> 01:34:29,930
that if he had to,
you know,

1620
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:31,013
drop a hydrogen bomb on Paris in London 
to make sure that the Europeans got the 

1621
01:34:33,751 --> 01:34:34,584
hell out of the way,
that that wasn't something that was 

1622
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,920
certainly,
that he was certainly willing to do.

1623
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,003
So Khrushchev was one of the people who 
was involved at Stalin's death and he 

1624
01:34:43,561 --> 01:34:45,630
took over,
but cruise ship was also one of the main

1625
01:34:45,631 --> 01:34:46,464
architects of the Ukrainian famine,
but Khrushchev had actually developed a 

1626
01:34:49,531 --> 01:34:50,364
bit of a conscience about all that and 
he loosened things up substantially for 

1627
01:34:53,551 --> 01:34:55,410
a period of time,
for about five years.

1628
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,543
And during that time social and released
a book called one day in the life of 

1629
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:00,014
Ivan Denisovich,
which is a story about himself and it's 

1630
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:08,261
just one day in a gulag archipelago cap.
And so it's a very dreary and,

1631
01:35:08,850 --> 01:35:09,683
and wretched and horrifying book.
But it was the first of anything like 

1632
01:35:12,681 --> 01:35:16,400
that that was seen in the Soviet Union.
And add another bit of evidence that was

1633
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:17,234
disseminated out into the West in 1962 
which the bloody French intellectuals 

1634
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:22,340
could have picked up right there.
And then and said,

1635
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:23,720
oh look,
you know,

1636
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,673
our,
our glorious leader has a lot more 

1637
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:28,070
problems than we think.

1638
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:30,590
But of course that never happened.
But then,

1639
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:35,300
and Khrushchev was actually loosening up
the strictures in the,

1640
01:35:35,301 --> 01:35:36,134
in the USSR,
but he got wiped out of power in a coup 

1641
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:39,314
and taken out of power.
And the clamps came back down and 

1642
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:45,470
Khrushchev was sent off to live in,
is in exile in this Dasha.

1643
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:46,304
I don't remember which one says his 
vacation home until he died in about 

1644
01:35:49,491 --> 01:35:52,490
1980 so,
but you know,

1645
01:35:52,491 --> 01:35:54,530
there were a few cracks that appeared it
exactly,

1646
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:55,364
not time.
And of course that was also at the 

1647
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:57,074
height of the Cold War because it was 
1962 when Kennedy and Khrushchev faced 

1648
01:36:00,381 --> 01:36:02,090
off over Cuba.
And you know,

1649
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:04,640
that was one of the places where we got 
this far away from,

1650
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,710
you know,
total annihilation.

1651
01:36:10,070 --> 01:36:10,903
Okay.

1652
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,000
How soldier Nixon's proposition was that
had people refused to lie,

1653
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:23,330
the Soviet government could have never 
taken hold or maintained itself.

1654
01:36:24,930 --> 01:36:26,880
So he believed that,
you know,

1655
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,610
cause there's a lot of theories about 
how a society becomes corrupt,

1656
01:36:29,611 --> 01:36:30,444
right?
So like let's say you take the example 

1657
01:36:32,251 --> 01:36:33,084
of Nazi Germany,
you might say it's the following orders 

1658
01:36:36,151 --> 01:36:37,710
idea,
right?

1659
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:39,563
The power structure is taken over by 
thugs and then what you're doing when 

1660
01:36:43,711 --> 01:36:46,560
you carry out the orders of the thugs is

1661
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:51,250
merely responding out of fear.
You're a good person,

1662
01:36:51,251 --> 01:36:53,500
but you know,
you'd be put in a terrible situation and

1663
01:36:53,501 --> 01:36:55,450
there's terrible pressure being brought 
to bear on you.

1664
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:57,670
And that's why you go do the things that
you do.

1665
01:36:58,330 --> 01:36:59,163
And so that theory is predicated on the 
idea that there's no real relationship 

1666
01:37:02,651 --> 01:37:03,484
between the populous and the government 
and that the government is basically 

1667
01:37:06,521 --> 01:37:07,354
taken over by [inaudible] and the people
who organize the coo are well 

1668
01:37:09,911 --> 01:37:10,744
distributed enough and aggressive enough
to maintain authority by punishment 

1669
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,113
under all circumstances whatsoever.
The problem with that theory is that it 

1670
01:37:19,961 --> 01:37:20,794
doesn't seem to be true.
So the first issue is did Hitler create 

1671
01:37:26,711 --> 01:37:28,750
the Germans or did the Germans create 
Hitler?

1672
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:31,930
Or could you say that they were involved
in a dance?

1673
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:33,123
Well,
you must take on that because you can 

1674
01:37:34,111 --> 01:37:34,944
spend a lot of times stuff what the hell
was going on in Germany and by his own 

1675
01:37:37,691 --> 01:37:40,630
admission got caught up in it for a 
short period of time.

1676
01:37:40,631 --> 01:37:43,240
But he said when he was there that the,
um,

1677
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:47,290
the illness so to speak,
was so overwhelming.

1678
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:49,880
That was virtually impossible not to get
caught up there.

1679
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:50,591
And I,
you know,

1680
01:37:50,591 --> 01:37:51,424
I think people underestimate the degree 
to which what they think is true and 

1681
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,070
false is a consequence of the mill

1682
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,300
you,
that they'd be placed here.

1683
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:59,033
But I think,
and this is partly from reading young 

1684
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:01,703
Hitler and the Germans cocreated each 
other and the young Ian explanation for 

1685
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:08,010
that with something like,
I'm going to update it a bit,

1686
01:38:08,011 --> 01:38:12,840
modernize it in a crowd.
You have dispersal of responsibility.

1687
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:14,013
Everyone knows about that.
And that means you can do whatever you 

1688
01:38:16,351 --> 01:38:18,420
want in a crowd.
You can say whatever you want,

1689
01:38:18,421 --> 01:38:21,510
you can act however you want because 
you're not going to be held individually

1690
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:22,344
responsible for it.
So young would say the crowd has the 

1691
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:27,570
capacity of allowing the shadow to 
emerge.

1692
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:31,710
And then he believed that what happened 
was the crowd shadow had a dialogue,

1693
01:38:32,010 --> 01:38:35,160
often nonverbal with Hitler,
with Hitler's imagination.

1694
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:38,550
And so Hitler who was a great retro 
Titian,

1695
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:42,010
I don't know if that's a word,
um,

1696
01:38:42,730 --> 01:38:47,730
what talk and his emotional oratory to 
the crowd and the crowd would respond in

1697
01:38:48,091 --> 01:38:48,840
one way or another.

1698
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,673
And so Hitler would be guided by their 
response and being an imaginative 

1699
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:53,514
person,
cobbling together what the crowd is 

1700
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,570
encouraging and him to speak.
That produces a kind of a theory.

1701
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:03,720
And you know,
Hitler is able to flesh out that theory.

1702
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,000
Populous leaders do that.
You know,

1703
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:06,834
it's,
so I talked to Preston manning at one 

1704
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:12,390
point,
Preston manning started the reform party

1705
01:39:12,391 --> 01:39:13,850
in Alberta.
Um,

1706
01:39:14,210 --> 01:39:15,043
anyway,
it eventually merged with the 

1707
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:17,904
conservative.
So it was kind of an offshoot of the 

1708
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:20,693
Conservative Party.
There's always been left and right wing 

1709
01:39:22,171 --> 01:39:24,420
off shoot parties that are generated in 
Canada,

1710
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:29,100
almost always sit in the west.
And I invited them to talk to a group of

1711
01:39:29,101 --> 01:39:29,934
people that I brought together to tell 
us how he managed to create a whole 

1712
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:34,014
political party in like 10 years now.
He was the son of a premium who is the 

1713
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:38,874
right way and premium.
So we had this connections and that was 

1714
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:43,440
part of it,
but he said,

1715
01:39:43,441 --> 01:39:44,280
you know,
he'd go to,

1716
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:48,520
there was a lot of
western separatist

1717
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:53,280
agitation at that point.
And and people in Alberta,

1718
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:54,660
yeah,

1719
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,493
some of the political leaders thought 
that that would become powerful enough 

1720
01:39:57,271 --> 01:40:00,240
so that it would actually be a movement 
to contend with.

1721
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:01,074
And partly what they were doing with the
formation of the reform party was to 

1722
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:05,490
take some of the pressure off that side 
of things.

1723
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:06,743
So anyways,
they started to go around to talk to 

1724
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:12,510
people in arenas mostly,
and manny would give a speech,

1725
01:40:12,511 --> 01:40:15,870
but he said the thing that he liked best
was the question and answer at the end.

1726
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:16,973
And then what the Reform Party did was 
derived its policies from the question 

1727
01:40:20,911 --> 01:40:23,430
and answer sessions.
So you could imagine that,

1728
01:40:23,460 --> 01:40:24,293
you know,
the crowd had concerns which were 

1729
01:40:25,741 --> 01:40:28,290
allowed to be expressed in an 
articulated fashion.

1730
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,573
And the party built a lot of its 
doctrines as a consequence of that 

1731
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:33,443
conversation.
And of course that was partly what 

1732
01:40:34,771 --> 01:40:35,604
accounted for it's rapid popularity 
because it was actually addressing the 

1733
01:40:38,311 --> 01:40:40,680
desires of the crowd.
And so,

1734
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:41,910
you know,
you could even say,

1735
01:40:41,911 --> 01:40:43,680
well,
that's how a democracy should function,

1736
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:45,330
you know?
But,

1737
01:40:47,550 --> 01:40:48,383
but that also assumes that the 
democratic systems and conventions are 

1738
01:40:53,381 --> 01:40:55,420
in place to protect against,
you know,

1739
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:56,254
let's say just a mass movement that goes
off radically to the laughter radically 

1740
01:40:59,891 --> 01:41:00,724
to the right.
It was still all taking place within a 

1741
01:41:02,201 --> 01:41:05,530
perfectly functional monarchical 
democracy,

1742
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:10,070
but by his own admission and we'll,

1743
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:13,790
the policies were shaped by the crowd.
Okay.

1744
01:41:13,791 --> 01:41:14,624
Well,
the same thing happened with Hitler 

1745
01:41:15,201 --> 01:41:18,080
except it happened in an underground and
pathological way.

1746
01:41:18,081 --> 01:41:18,914
And the people he was addressing,
we're in a hell of a lot worse shape 

1747
01:41:21,511 --> 01:41:23,690
than Albertans in 1980.
You know,

1748
01:41:23,691 --> 01:41:26,210
because they just got back from the 
trenches,

1749
01:41:26,660 --> 01:41:27,201
all,
you know,

1750
01:41:27,201 --> 01:41:31,280
a huge chunk of the young men were dead.
The rest that weren't,

1751
01:41:31,281 --> 01:41:34,550
were brutalized beyond belief.
The economy was in shambles.

1752
01:41:34,551 --> 01:41:37,430
The friendship imposed an incredibly 
punitive,

1753
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:38,623
um,

1754
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:39,120
okay.

1755
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:40,440
You know,
peace treaty,

1756
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:44,720
Germany and lost most of its industrial,
uh,

1757
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:48,660
uh,
centers as part of the redistribution of

1758
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:49,494
land after World War One.
And then the whole bloody economy 

1759
01:41:51,661 --> 01:41:52,494
collapsed because the German government 
inflated the currency to wipe out their 

1760
01:41:55,051 --> 01:41:55,884
debt to the,
to the allies and just reduced its 

1761
01:41:57,601 --> 01:41:59,970
failure to zero.
So people were not happy,

1762
01:42:00,030 --> 01:42:00,863
they were seriously not happy.
And so that was the crowd that Hitler 

1763
01:42:03,241 --> 01:42:04,074
was addressing.

1764
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:05,563
So

1765
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,380
now one of the issues might be,
well,

1766
01:42:14,381 --> 01:42:15,214
where does the,
this is where things get so tricky when 

1767
01:42:19,711 --> 01:42:22,260
you're trying to figure out exactly how 
these things are caused.

1768
01:42:22,830 --> 01:42:26,580
My sense,
I took a political science degree before

1769
01:42:26,581 --> 01:42:29,790
I became a psychologist because I was 
interested in this sort of thing.

1770
01:42:29,791 --> 01:42:32,820
But I became aware quite early that

1771
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:37,220
almost all the explanations that the 
political scientists were offering where

1772
01:42:37,221 --> 01:42:38,054
economic and you know,
to me that means they were all derived 

1773
01:42:40,161 --> 01:42:40,994
from theories on the left,
roughly speaking because it's the left 

1774
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:47,060
that constantly claims that the primary 
motivations for people are economic.

1775
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:49,610
You know,
I mean the right does this,

1776
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,670
I won't talk about that for the moment 
cause it's,

1777
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:54,410
it's just not relevant in the context of
the university.

1778
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:55,633
And I thought that's just not right.
There's all sorts of motivations that 

1779
01:42:57,561 --> 01:42:59,630
people have that are economic.
It's not,

1780
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:02,060
there's lots of things.
It doesn't take into account.

1781
01:43:02,280 --> 01:43:03,113
It doesn't take into account,
well it doesn't take into account the 

1782
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:06,644
fact that people will have a psyche and 
that psyche is perfectly capable of 

1783
01:43:09,951 --> 01:43:12,980
desiring good things as well as terrible
things.

1784
01:43:12,981 --> 01:43:13,820
It's like,
well what,

1785
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:16,760
how are you going to account for that?
I mean,

1786
01:43:16,761 --> 01:43:19,610
economics make someone into a suicide 
bomber.

1787
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,360
I don't think so.
Like economics plays a role obviously,

1788
01:43:23,361 --> 01:43:26,180
but there's lots of people who are under
severe economic pressure.

1789
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:27,740
Do you not become,
you know,

1790
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,620
mass shooters in the United States are 
suicide bombers.

1791
01:43:30,860 --> 01:43:33,260
You need a hell of a lot more 
explanation than that.

1792
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,200
And so I was very,
very interested in the uh,

1793
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,113
in the moral questions that underlying,
especially things like what happened in 

1794
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:43,534
Nazi Germany in the concentration camps 
because it seemed to me that the moral 

1795
01:43:46,271 --> 01:43:47,104
question was paramount.
How could people do the sorts of things 

1796
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:52,550
that they did in the concentration 
camps?

1797
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:55,700
You know,
there's a psychological issue there.

1798
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:57,130
Okay.

1799
01:43:57,130 --> 01:44:00,130
So that's when I started to read young 
and,

1800
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:02,320
and Social Netsim in particular in 
Orwell.

1801
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:06,610
And a lot of the people that I've been 
talking to you about in this book,

1802
01:44:06,611 --> 01:44:09,090
I started last night,
the block book of Communism

1803
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:12,243
in the introduction.
And they talked about different 

1804
01:44:13,301 --> 01:44:15,280
approaches to history,
you know,

1805
01:44:15,281 --> 01:44:16,114
and

1806
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:18,303
there,
there is a positivist approach to 

1807
01:44:20,281 --> 01:44:24,150
history where there's never any moral 
judgment rendered,

1808
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,793
you know,
and that was the position putatively 

1809
01:44:28,771 --> 01:44:32,610
taken too many people who conducted an 
analysis of the 20th century.

1810
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:33,923
But my sense is is that there's some 
things that have happened that are so 

1811
01:44:36,331 --> 01:44:37,164
brutal and terrible,
but to treat that from a positivist 

1812
01:44:40,141 --> 01:44:43,380
perspective is in itself a form of 
complicity.

1813
01:44:43,650 --> 01:44:44,483
It's like because at some point you have
to make a decision was what happened in 

1814
01:44:47,791 --> 01:44:49,200
Auschwitz,
wrong or not?

1815
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:53,300
It's a simple question.
You can say it wasn't,

1816
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:54,203
it wasn't wrong because the standards of
right and wrong are generated locally 

1817
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:02,340
and there's no ultimate standard against
which they can be judged.

1818
01:45:02,700 --> 01:45:05,250
And so there,
there are constructions,

1819
01:45:05,251 --> 01:45:07,560
they're local constructions of 
convenience.

1820
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,980
And even if you're not happy with the 
results they produce,

1821
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,260
that doesn't mean you get to say they 
were wrong.

1822
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:15,083
Or you can say to hell with that.
I don't care what your rationalization 

1823
01:45:19,081 --> 01:45:22,500
is.
If you perform this kind of action,

1824
01:45:22,710 --> 01:45:26,130
then what you're doing is wrong.
And then I should also say that

1825
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:30,780
that was actually formerly determined 
after World War II,

1826
01:45:30,810 --> 01:45:32,820
right?
Because after World War II,

1827
01:45:32,821 --> 01:45:35,790
the Nazi leaders were subjected to the 
Nuremberg trials.

1828
01:45:36,690 --> 01:45:39,480
And that's where the idea of crimes 
against humanity emerged.

1829
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:43,560
War Crimes and crimes against humanity.
And the basic principle,

1830
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,903
there's a few of them,
but the basic principle between the eye 

1831
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:47,783
behind the idea that there can be crimes
against humanity is that it's wrong to 

1832
01:45:52,201 --> 01:45:55,830
kill someone for the manner in which 
they were born.

1833
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:58,033
Okay.

1834
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,790
So that's the basic principle.
So that could be race obviously.

1835
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:03,740
Um,
it could be language,

1836
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:06,260
it could be gender,
could be class,

1837
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,730
whatever.
It's wrong.

1838
01:46:08,150 --> 01:46:09,230
Well,
okay.

1839
01:46:09,890 --> 01:46:13,100
A cynic would say has to say,
yeah,

1840
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:15,740
yeah.
Had the Germans won the war,

1841
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:16,663
the laws would have been different.
So that was just the law written by the 

1842
01:46:18,951 --> 01:46:21,860
victors and the,
and the cynic would also say,

1843
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:24,080
well Dan,
I don't know exactly what you say.

1844
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:25,273
I guess the next thing you say is you 
cannot appeal to universal principles 

1845
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:32,690
that transcend culture because people 
are cultural creatures only,

1846
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:34,093
which is by the way,
also the claim of the radical left 

1847
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:40,280
because one of the things that the 
radical left wanted to do in places like

1848
01:46:40,281 --> 01:46:45,050
the Soviet Union and China and Cambodia 
and so forth was to produce the new man.

1849
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:49,990
And the idea was wipe out the past,
really wipe it out in the model.

1850
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:53,460
We went a long way to doing that because
part of the cultural revolution involved

1851
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,443
the wholesale destruction of almost all 
of the China's history prior to 1960 so 

1852
01:46:59,401 --> 01:47:01,050
that's another thing that we can thank 
the,

1853
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:04,650
the radical communist sport is they 
destroyed Chinese culture,

1854
01:47:04,890 --> 01:47:08,040
all that history
done.

1855
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:09,293
And part of the reason for that was that
they idiot logically presumed that that 

1856
01:47:12,571 --> 01:47:16,710
culture was transforming people into the
wrong sort of person.

1857
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,720
And so we're going to wipe the slate 
clean,

1858
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:19,554
which smile was perfectly willing to do 
and generate the new human being out of 

1859
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:23,724
the ashes.
And underneath that is the 

1860
01:47:24,721 --> 01:47:27,510
presupposition that there's no such 
thing as human nature.

1861
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:28,463
It's all cultural.
And the logical conclusion from Matt or 

1862
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:33,030
Al logical conclusion,
he has a,

1863
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:33,864
people are completely malleable.
So that's the radical social 

1864
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:37,164
constructionist position,
which I would say is also the position 

1865
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:41,520
of most academics at universities.

1866
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,820
Now you know that things like gender are
socially constructed.

1867
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:45,840
It's like,
okay,

1868
01:47:46,200 --> 01:47:47,033
it's fine,
right?

1869
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,710
Take your goddamn argument to its 
logical conclusion.

1870
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:51,840
Oh No,
I can't do that.

1871
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,970
Why not?
Cause you don't know anything about,

1872
01:47:53,971 --> 01:47:54,804
I don't know anything about history.
I'm completely ignorant of anything 

1873
01:47:57,181 --> 01:48:00,240
outside of my little narrow domain of 
specialization.

1874
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:02,790
And who cares about the hundred million 
dead people.

1875
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:04,403
So you know,
you can't adopt a philosophical or an 

1876
01:48:07,321 --> 01:48:08,154
ideological position without being 
willing to see what it's done to think 

1877
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:13,320
that,
to think through the consequences.

1878
01:48:13,321 --> 01:48:14,250
And so you say,
well,

1879
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:17,130
people are completely malleable from a 
cultural perspective.

1880
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:18,083
What that means is that I can decide if 
I have the power to make you into 

1881
01:48:21,331 --> 01:48:24,480
anything I want because it's just 
arbitrary after all.

1882
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:28,740
Or you can take a different position.
And the position is fundamentally,

1883
01:48:28,920 --> 01:48:29,753
I would say this is the fundamental 
position of Western democracy is that 

1884
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:38,031
human beings have in Nalia inalienable 
rights and an inalienable character.

1885
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:42,990
And as far as I can tell,
that's predicated on the,

1886
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:48,290
roughly speaking on the idea of horace,
it's that idea is that the person is the

1887
01:48:48,631 --> 01:48:53,460
center of the kind of consciousness that
creates the world as it acts.

1888
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:54,653
You know,
because one of the things I was curious 

1889
01:48:55,621 --> 01:48:58,410
about when I was working on these ideas,
I thought,

1890
01:48:58,411 --> 01:48:59,244
okay,
look,

1891
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:03,300
the communists have one world view and 
the Western democracies have another,

1892
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,530
and you could say it's just a battle 
between ideologies.

1893
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:08,483
And you would also say under those 
circumstances that all belief systems 

1894
01:49:10,741 --> 01:49:11,574
are nothing but an ideology,
and that's the radical social 

1895
01:49:13,801 --> 01:49:15,780
constructionist viewpoint,
right?

1896
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:17,620
It's like a,
it's,

1897
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:20,790
it's behavior isn't in some sense taken 
to its extreme right?

1898
01:49:21,030 --> 01:49:22,830
Human beings are a blank slate.
Well,

1899
01:49:22,831 --> 01:49:23,970
first of all,
they're not.

1900
01:49:24,150 --> 01:49:24,983
We know that there's enough biology 
being we've studied enough biology over 

1901
01:49:28,981 --> 01:49:31,860
the last hundred years so that we can 
just dispense with that idea.

1902
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:34,020
It's raw.
But anyways,

1903
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:36,870
we'll give the devil his due.
Okay.

1904
01:49:36,871 --> 01:49:41,130
It's an ideological conflict between 
communism and and the West.

1905
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,990
Okay.
It's arbitrary.

1906
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:45,150
It doesn't matter who wins,
but the war is,

1907
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:47,010
the war is between these two belief 
systems.

1908
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:49,000
Well,
why is that a flawed argument?

1909
01:49:49,780 --> 01:49:50,613
Well,
people weren't flocking into Soviet 

1910
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:54,700
Union as immigrants.
They were trying desperately to escape,

1911
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,910
which is why there was a wall in Germany
and if you go went over the wall,

1912
01:49:57,940 --> 01:49:59,200
they shot you.
Okay,

1913
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:02,380
that doesn't look so good.
Well then there's all the deaths,

1914
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:05,020
35 million of them that seems to 
indicate that,

1915
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,893
you know,
there's a bit more happening on the 

1916
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:10,210
pathological end in one society.
Then on the other.

1917
01:50:10,510 --> 01:50:12,340
And then the next thing I was curious 
about is,

1918
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,174
okay,
where the hell did the idea that needle 

1919
01:50:14,061 --> 01:50:17,890
animal rights come from?
Like is that just something arbitrary?

1920
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:22,630
Is it just an invention or is it based 
on something that's real and you know,

1921
01:50:22,631 --> 01:50:23,600
what is real meat?

1922
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:27,760
And so that's when I started to trace 
the emergence of the idea back as far as

1923
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:29,650
I could trace it.
And so first of all,

1924
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:30,484
that was political.
So maybe that manifested itself in the 

1925
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,260
most articulate it for him during the 
enlightenment.

1926
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:39,340
But that isn't where it started because 
in the 13th century,

1927
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,470
the English should come up with the 
magnet card already.

1928
01:50:41,471 --> 01:50:43,240
And so there was an idea that,
you know,

1929
01:50:43,450 --> 01:50:47,890
the people had some sovereignty that the
monarchy was not allowed to steal.

1930
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,830
And that was the origin of the idea of 
parliamentary democracy.

1931
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:51,993
But that emerged out of another idea and
that was the Judeo Christian idea that 

1932
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:58,690
everyone had value before God.
I thought,

1933
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:00,220
okay,
well what the hell does that mean?

1934
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:01,360
You know,
because you might say,

1935
01:51:01,361 --> 01:51:02,194
well,
if that's the case and we've dispensed 

1936
01:51:03,911 --> 01:51:04,744
with the idea of God,
then the whole idea of natural rights 

1937
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:09,490
falls,
which by the way was niches prediction.

1938
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,473
He thought as soon as we wiped out the 
classical underlying structure that the 

1939
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:16,420
whole idea of rights would just 
disintegrate.

1940
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:17,523
Well,
that's exactly what happened in the 

1941
01:51:19,300 --> 01:51:20,880
Soviet Union and China and so forth.
You know,

1942
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:24,760
and we'll see.
It might not happen here,

1943
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:27,370
but it wouldn't surprise me if it did.
Okay.

1944
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:28,300
So then I thought,
well,

1945
01:51:28,301 --> 01:51:29,134
is there anything that might lead,
lend some validity in any way to that 

1946
01:51:32,981 --> 01:51:33,970
claim?
First of all,

1947
01:51:33,971 --> 01:51:38,170
what is the claim mean that people have 
value before God also?

1948
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:40,000
So I went back to the,
to the,

1949
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,680
you know,
the theological stories.

1950
01:51:41,681 --> 01:51:42,514
And the religious history and tried to 
figure out exactly where this idea had 

1951
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:47,560
come from and what it meant.
And I found that you could just trace it

1952
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:50,260
farther and farther and farther and 
farther back.

1953
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:52,900
So you know with disappears that 
Mesopotamia,

1954
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,513
but then it doesn't disappear.
Because if you look at wolf packs and 

1955
01:51:57,521 --> 01:51:59,920
chimp troops and social animals in 
general,

1956
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,113
they organize their societies as if each
of the individuals in the hierarchy you 

1957
01:52:04,451 --> 01:52:05,284
have value and the wolves for example,
like if there's a dominance dispute 

1958
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,060
between two wolves,
one wins,

1959
01:52:10,270 --> 01:52:14,080
one turns its neck over and says you 
don't tear up my throat.

1960
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:17,230
And the other wolf says,
now you're annoying,

1961
01:52:17,231 --> 01:52:18,940
but we'll keep you around because you're
useful.

1962
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,200
Well,
it's this,

1963
01:52:20,201 --> 01:52:21,034
it's the same idea.
The idea is that the individual has 

1964
01:52:23,351 --> 01:52:27,490
integrity worth in relationship to the 
group and then that's not an ideological

1965
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:28,324
idea.
That's an idea that's based as far as I 

1966
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:33,100
can tell,
an evolution and it's really,

1967
01:52:33,101 --> 01:52:35,680
really deep.
It goes back as far as you can chase it.

1968
01:52:35,890 --> 01:52:38,410
So that means it's not just an 
ideological conflict.

1969
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:39,633
Well,
okay,

1970
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,713
maybe that's wrong,
but I can't see anywhere that it's 

1971
01:52:42,941 --> 01:52:46,160
wrong.
Are you always using

1972
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,100
our
missionary?

1973
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:04,281
Okay,
so,

1974
01:53:04,281 --> 01:53:05,810
so that's a good question.
Okay,

1975
01:53:05,811 --> 01:53:08,120
so the question is,
you know,

1976
01:53:08,121 --> 01:53:12,230
I parceled off one set of beliefs as 
specifically grounded in evolutionary,

1977
01:53:12,770 --> 01:53:13,970
in evolution.
Okay.

1978
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,730
I'm going to make two distinctions.
First,

1979
01:53:16,731 --> 01:53:21,050
there's a difference between an idea 
that's grounded in that evolution and an

1980
01:53:21,051 --> 01:53:23,750
idea that's grounded in evolutionary 
theory.

1981
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:26,360
Okay.
So the Marxists we're,

1982
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:27,203
we're grounded and evolutionary theory.
They have psychobiological 

1983
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:33,200
justifications for their claims.
I know,

1984
01:53:33,201 --> 01:53:35,660
I know what it is.
I just want to dispense with that first.

1985
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:37,670
Okay.
So then I was thinking,

1986
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:41,420
well,
what exactly do ideologies do?

1987
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:42,523
Because obviously they're also not 
constructive just arbitrarily because 

1988
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:48,080
they wouldn't be attractive to people if
they work.

1989
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,450
They have to be.
And I thought,

1990
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:51,284
well,
like if you look for example at Mao or 

1991
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:57,020
sorry,
marks Stalin and Lenin,

1992
01:53:57,050 --> 01:53:59,960
so you could think of them as the 
trinity of the USSR.

1993
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:01,123
Well,
I think part of the reason that the 

1994
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:04,280
trinitarian idea worked as a,
as a,

1995
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:05,293
you know,
as a means of propaganda was because 

1996
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:11,510
Russia was an orthodox Christian country
and it had the trinitarian idea already,

1997
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:14,390
you know,
lay down and it's unconscious.

1998
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:20,150
Well you remember I showed you that 
diagram of chaos on the outside and then

1999
01:54:20,151 --> 01:54:20,984
the great mother and then the great 
father and then the individual and the 

2000
01:54:23,211 --> 01:54:26,780
valence of each of them.
I think what happens with an ideology,

2001
01:54:26,781 --> 01:54:27,614
and I,
I didn't point this out that out at the 

2002
01:54:28,581 --> 01:54:29,414
time,
but it's worth revisiting is that the 

2003
01:54:31,081 --> 01:54:35,120
ideology capitalizes on certain aspects 
of that story.

2004
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:38,270
It doesn't tell the whole truth.
So it stands,

2005
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:41,510
for example,
the individual is all good,

2006
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:45,260
the state is corrupt and mother nature 
is good.

2007
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:46,393
Okay.
That's Russo and that's the 

2008
01:54:47,991 --> 01:54:49,850
environmentalist movement.
Okay.

2009
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:50,570
Cause it's grounded.

2010
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:53,180
We were so in thinking via thoroughal 
for example,

2011
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:58,510
and then you have the officer at which 
is harms and Hob says the individual is,

2012
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:59,743
you know,
a catastrophe of conflicts and 

2013
01:55:01,821 --> 01:55:04,130
aggression.
The state has to be,

2014
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:08,990
the state is the only thing that can 
possibly keep the individual in check.

2015
01:55:08,991 --> 01:55:09,824
And that protects,
it protects us from the ultimate chaos 

2016
01:55:11,511 --> 01:55:12,620
of nature.
Well,

2017
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:16,460
those are both true and you can derive 
ideologies from them.

2018
01:55:16,461 --> 01:55:19,700
But I think their weaknesses is they 
don't take the other side into account.

2019
01:55:20,360 --> 01:55:21,193
And I don't think that you can say that 
about the traditions that I've been 

2020
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:26,540
describing.
I think they've been around toola.

2021
01:55:26,541 --> 01:55:28,100
So when you look at Egypt,
for example,

2022
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,480
the story has all the elements.
It has the adversary,

2023
01:55:32,481 --> 01:55:33,590
so that seth,
right,

2024
01:55:34,100 --> 01:55:34,933
it has the good king and not so cyrus,
and it has isis as queen of the 

2025
01:55:38,361 --> 01:55:40,760
underworld.
She's gone to pot like she's,

2026
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,890
she's not as well differentiated in the 
story,

2027
01:55:42,891 --> 01:55:44,220
but the elements are still there.

2028
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,290
And you have horace,
and it says says,

2029
01:55:46,291 --> 01:55:47,124
look,
life is this landscape and all these 

2030
01:55:49,171 --> 01:55:51,540
characters are participate.
Yeah,

2031
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:52,374
that's,
that's as close as we can get to a 

2032
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:57,690
narrative truth.
And part of the reason I wanted to teach

2033
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:00,900
this course once I thought I'd figured 
these things out,

2034
01:56:00,901 --> 01:56:03,520
was to provide people with a defense 
against ideology.

2035
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:07,050
It's like someone tells you it's a story
that's causal.

2036
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:09,670
Here's how history laid itself out.
Okay.

2037
01:56:09,671 --> 01:56:13,050
It's plausible.
Like the Russo story is plausible and so

2038
01:56:13,051 --> 01:56:14,350
is the,
um,

2039
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:16,590
hobbsy and story.
Now,

2040
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:18,510
not only their plausible,
they're true,

2041
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:21,270
but they're only true like this.
You know,

2042
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:22,493
and the other one's true like this,
but you want to know where's the other 

2043
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:25,914
half of the story?
People are inherently good in society 

2044
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:29,520
corrupts them.
Yes.

2045
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:32,670
People are inherently evil in society.
Regulates them.

2046
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,170
Yes.
And it's,

2047
01:56:34,171 --> 01:56:35,004
it's hard on people because you know,
the classic idea of Western logic is 

2048
01:56:38,611 --> 01:56:42,300
that one thing can't be itself and its 
opposite at the same time.

2049
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:43,613
But that only applies to unitary things.
And like a human being is not a unitary 

2050
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:50,400
thing and neither is a state.
So,

2051
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:53,520
so well,
so that's the best answer that I have to

2052
01:56:53,521 --> 01:56:57,310
that question
is like,

2053
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:01,320
hmm,
it's exactly what it is.

2054
01:57:01,350 --> 01:57:02,183
That's why it has its power because it 
can extract it's motive power from the 

2055
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:08,730
underlying archetypes which,
which relates to them to the motivations

2056
01:57:08,731 --> 01:57:09,564
that you just described.
Like there is a pronounced demand for 

2057
01:57:12,931 --> 01:57:16,560
egalitarianism in human beings.
It's agreeableness,

2058
01:57:16,590 --> 01:57:17,970
the trading,
agreeableness.

2059
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:20,790
So the more agreeable you are,
the more egalitarian you are.

2060
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:21,713
Why?
Because people should share and get 

2061
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:26,070
along.
It's especially true within the confines

2062
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:28,020
of a family or tribal unit,
right?

2063
01:57:28,110 --> 01:57:30,090
Where everyone's pulling together and 
cooperate.

2064
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,820
It isn't obvious to me that it's useful 
ethic.

2065
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:36,960
Once you get beyond like a kin group 
size,

2066
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:42,240
I think you need conscientiousness then 
because conscientiousness is more like a

2067
01:57:42,241 --> 01:57:45,510
cold virtue and it's the thing that 
supports,

2068
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:48,480
um,
success in bureaucracies.

2069
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:49,463
If you're conscientious,
you go into a large landscape of 

2070
01:57:51,661 --> 01:57:52,494
unrelated people.
So maybe a functional bureaucracy and 

2071
01:57:54,811 --> 01:57:55,644
conscientiousness predicts your success.
But conscientiousness and agreeableness 

2072
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:00,293
are orthogonal to one another.
They do not have the same value 

2073
01:58:02,641 --> 01:58:05,220
structure.
And the truth of the matter is,

2074
01:58:05,221 --> 01:58:09,270
is that they both wouldn't exist if they
weren't both necessary.

2075
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:10,673
Egalitarianism is necessary because 
otherwise the hierarchy skitzo damn 

2076
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:17,970
steep that the people at the bottom die 
and the whole system collapses.

2077
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:19,463
But agreeableness is as a universal 
ethic is no good because it doesn't 

2078
01:58:22,891 --> 01:58:23,724
allow for distinctions of quality and it
doesn't allow any decisions to be made 

2079
01:58:27,181 --> 01:58:28,014
because if a hundred people have to come
to a consensus before action can take 

2080
01:58:31,171 --> 01:58:32,004
place,
well someone with a hierarchy who's 

2081
01:58:35,160 --> 01:58:37,740
invading you,
they're just going to wipe you out.

2082
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:42,430
You're so slow.
So there's this tension and it is partly

2083
01:58:42,431 --> 01:58:43,264
the tension between,
it's the tension between the far left 

2084
01:58:46,871 --> 01:58:47,704
and the right because the best marker 
for the far left is agreeableness in 

2085
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:55,030
terms of a personality dimension that 
predicts question.

2086
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:01,630
You can say,
um,

2087
01:59:01,980 --> 01:59:02,813
if you have a license to sell as an 
element of the culture that butter the 

2088
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:09,083
nature,
why can't you say that's also one side 

2089
01:59:12,220 --> 01:59:13,053
other side?

2090
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:14,233
Well,
I think the reason that that I don't 

2091
01:59:15,951 --> 01:59:19,010
think that that's appropriate is 
precisely the reason that I told you the

2092
01:59:19,011 --> 01:59:19,844
Egyptian and the Mesopotamian stories in
the first reason I told you those 

2093
01:59:22,851 --> 01:59:23,684
stories was to show you that those 
stories exist and they can't be taken 

2094
01:59:27,471 --> 01:59:28,304
lightly because those stories are the 
products of tens of thousands of years 

2095
01:59:31,521 --> 01:59:33,800
of thought.
Like they're not just any old story.

2096
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:36,740
And so,
and what the story seemed to indicate is

2097
01:59:36,741 --> 01:59:37,574
that there has to be a dynamic 
relationship between the vision of the 

2098
01:59:41,931 --> 01:59:44,150
individual and the integrity of the 
state.

2099
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:47,240
It isn't saying that one of those is 
more important than the other at all.

2100
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:50,510
It's saying that in order for one to 
remain healthy,

2101
01:59:50,660 --> 01:59:51,493
in order for both to remain healthy,
there has to be a constant dialectic of 

2102
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:59,060
communication.
And so then you could say,

2103
01:59:59,061 --> 01:59:59,894
and people have said this,
how do you know this isn't just another 

2104
02:00:01,441 --> 02:00:02,274
radiology?

2105
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:03,783
Well,

2106
02:00:05,430 --> 02:00:06,800
I,
I tried to,

2107
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:11,240
I tried to explain why that is.
It looks to me like ideologies only take

2108
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:12,233
an hour.
I don't know how to define that because 

2109
02:00:13,041 --> 02:00:13,874
I'm trying to figure it out.
Part of that was grounded in the 

2110
02:00:16,311 --> 02:00:17,144
question,
was it just the ideology that drove the 

2111
02:00:19,731 --> 02:00:21,800
distinction between the West and the 
Soviet Union?

2112
02:00:22,430 --> 02:00:26,660
For me it was hopeless if it was because
if it was just in theology,

2113
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:32,240
there wasn't right on either side and it
was just an endless battle.

2114
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:36,020
It was an endless battle because one of 
the things I realized was,

2115
02:00:36,760 --> 02:00:37,593
and this is was the most dismal part of 
going through all this material for me 

2116
02:00:41,331 --> 02:00:42,164
because I thought that that it was done.
Like I came to the conclusion at one 

2117
02:00:45,891 --> 02:00:48,920
point,
I mean for whatever relevance it has,

2118
02:00:48,921 --> 02:00:49,754
that the problem was unsolvable.
Technically people were pathologized by 

2119
02:00:55,071 --> 02:00:56,240
their self consciousness.

2120
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:57,283
Completely understanding.
It's like when someone comes to me with 

2121
02:00:59,451 --> 02:01:01,790
an anxiety disorder,
I never ask why.

2122
02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:05,150
I think no kidding.
You know?

2123
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:08,930
It's the healthy,
anxious people that are the mystery.

2124
02:01:09,320 --> 02:01:10,910
So it is.
It's like,

2125
02:01:10,911 --> 02:01:12,950
why the hell aren't you freaking out all
the time?

2126
02:01:13,010 --> 02:01:15,230
It's a really good question.
You know,

2127
02:01:15,231 --> 02:01:17,690
it's like you're like the rat that's in 
its burrow.

2128
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:19,610
You've explored the territory and you're
calm.

2129
02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:22,880
That does not mean you're calm.
It also does not mean you're safe.

2130
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:25,280
It just means that for some weird 
reason,

2131
02:01:25,281 --> 02:01:27,950
you can act like you are and you can 
undo that.

2132
02:01:27,951 --> 02:01:29,600
Like people have that undone all the 
time.

2133
02:01:29,601 --> 02:01:30,434
They get traumatized and then they start
questioning and that whole protective 

2134
02:01:33,351 --> 02:01:35,840
structure falls apart and they're 
screwed.

2135
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:37,700
They're,
they're anxious.

2136
02:01:37,701 --> 02:01:39,770
They're in pain,
they develop bag or a phobia,

2137
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:40,070
you

2138
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,160
know where they develop obsessive 
compulsive disorder and you think,

2139
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,210
well yeah obviously it's like someone 
comes to me and says,

2140
02:01:47,211 --> 02:01:50,090
well when I go into a new building I 
always check out the fire exits.

2141
02:01:50,900 --> 02:01:53,150
What are you supposed to say about that?
It's like,

2142
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:55,640
well what if the building caught on 
fire?

2143
02:01:55,730 --> 02:01:57,710
Well then your dad,
cause you don't do that.

2144
02:01:58,040 --> 02:02:00,410
And you might say,
well what's the chance of that?

2145
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:02,000
And the person says

2146
02:02:03,650 --> 02:02:08,650
1% chance of an infinitely bad outcome 
is an infinitely large risk.

2147
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:12,710
And there's no arguing with that.
It's like how safe should you be

2148
02:02:14,250 --> 02:02:16,020
Ken?
You can't argue about that.

2149
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,333
So

2150
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:23,853
yeah,

2151
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:30,070
I think the reason that I think this 
isn't an ideology is because I think you

2152
02:02:30,071 --> 02:02:33,730
can make a distinction between stories 
and met a stories.

2153
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:35,643
And a story is generally an ideology.
It's a partial representation of the 

2154
02:02:39,581 --> 02:02:42,820
whole.
And a Meta story is an observation about

2155
02:02:42,850 --> 02:02:43,683
the set of all possible stories.
And that's what I was trying to do in 

2156
02:02:46,751 --> 02:02:48,220
this class.
And in the book it's like,

2157
02:02:48,221 --> 02:02:49,120
okay,
what's the,

2158
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:52,270
what's the landscape of the set of all 
possible stories?

2159
02:02:52,540 --> 02:02:54,040
And that's,
you know,

2160
02:02:54,041 --> 02:02:56,710
the structure that I laid out.
Now maybe that's wrong,

2161
02:02:57,070 --> 02:02:57,903
but it's an interesting structure 
because everything has its place order 

2162
02:03:02,201 --> 02:03:04,060
and chaos,
masculine and feminine,

2163
02:03:04,150 --> 02:03:08,950
but even more importantly good and evil.
And that's the landscape.

2164
02:03:09,250 --> 02:03:10,180
And then we can say,
well,

2165
02:03:10,181 --> 02:03:14,350
you can parcel out partial stories from 
now and they have functional utility and

2166
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:18,520
potent motivational force,
but they're dangerously one sided.

2167
02:03:18,521 --> 02:03:20,260
Unless you've covered the entire 
territory.

2168
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:30,730
We see that
they suggest by a part of this,

2169
02:03:35,391 --> 02:03:39,570
is this the way he's like Cyrus?

2170
02:03:41,430 --> 02:03:42,560
Yeah,
well that's exactly,

2171
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:45,480
that's exactly how it looks to me.
It is.

2172
02:03:45,570 --> 02:03:46,403
It's,
it's something that's outside 

2173
02:03:47,371 --> 02:03:50,520
rationality.
It's embedded nodding rationality but in

2174
02:03:50,521 --> 02:03:51,354
biology and then knows essential claim 
that you'll made with regards to the 

2175
02:03:54,121 --> 02:03:57,150
collective unconscious and part of his,
believe me,

2176
02:03:57,151 --> 02:03:57,984
part of what human was doing,
and this was partly in response to what 

2177
02:04:00,361 --> 02:04:04,440
was happening mostly in Nazi Germany,
but also to some degree in the communist

2178
02:04:04,441 --> 02:04:05,670
countries,
is he was asking,

2179
02:04:06,630 --> 02:04:11,580
does do human beings have a nature?
Are we a certain way?

2180
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:15,030
Because if we are,
then that should be taken into account.

2181
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:16,453
You know,
when you're trying to construct our 

2182
02:04:17,231 --> 02:04:18,064
political systems and if we do have a 
nature well what is it and how does it 

2183
02:04:21,481 --> 02:04:25,320
manifest itself and what should we,
how should we take stock of that?

2184
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:26,930
Well,
here's a question for you guys.

2185
02:04:26,940 --> 02:04:27,773
Okay.
You can think about this for a minute 

2186
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,473
now.
There was a paper published a week ago 

2187
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:36,060
and it was in the International Journal 
of Psychology,

2188
02:04:36,061 --> 02:04:39,660
which is the world's psychology journal 
for whatever that means,

2189
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:44,520
but it was a large scale analysis of 
gender differences across culture and it

2190
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:46,223
concluded the same thing that all the 
large scale analysis of gender 

2191
02:04:49,231 --> 02:04:53,370
differences across culture have 
concluded in the last 15 years,

2192
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:58,610
which is that the differences taking 
trade by trade are rather small

2193
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:03,660
quarter to a half standard deviation,
which isn't,

2194
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:07,680
it's not trivial,
but it still means that along any single

2195
02:05:07,681 --> 02:05:08,514
trait dimension,
men and women are more the same than 

2196
02:05:10,201 --> 02:05:11,034
they are different.

2197
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:17,580
And those differences maximize as 
societies become more egalitarian.

2198
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:19,343
Now you have to,
that should have been front page news 

2199
02:05:20,941 --> 02:05:23,760
when that was first discovered because 
it completely,

2200
02:05:23,761 --> 02:05:27,840
if it's true,
it completely undermines everything that

2201
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:28,674
students have been taught by radical 
left wingers since the 1960s it 

2202
02:05:31,651 --> 02:05:36,651
completely invalidates the claim that 
people are constructed by society.

2203
02:05:38,410 --> 02:05:39,243
Because if they're constructed by 
society and you make the state 

2204
02:05:41,740 --> 02:05:44,530
egalitarian,
then the gender differences disappear.

2205
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:47,950
But that isn't what happens.
Not only do they not disappeared,

2206
02:05:47,980 --> 02:05:50,380
which would be bad enough,
they maximize,

2207
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:51,550
okay,
that's it.

2208
02:05:51,610 --> 02:05:54,100
Theory done.
Now you could say,

2209
02:05:54,101 --> 02:05:55,750
well,
the research isn't that good.

2210
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:56,860
It's like,
well,

2211
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:57,753
that turns out to be wrong.
Most of it's done with the big five 

2212
02:06:00,280 --> 02:06:04,420
personality model,
which I hated until like broop necessity

2213
02:06:04,421 --> 02:06:06,820
made me accept because they're kept 
coming.

2214
02:06:06,821 --> 02:06:10,930
And why wasn't an interesting theory to 
me it's like it was annoying.

2215
02:06:11,170 --> 02:06:14,110
Bloody statistician's figure out the 
structure of personality,

2216
02:06:14,111 --> 02:06:15,460
how boring,
you know.

2217
02:06:15,461 --> 02:06:16,294
But when you,
when you analyze the psychometrics 

2218
02:06:18,881 --> 02:06:22,330
you're done,
it's like personality as encapsulated in

2219
02:06:22,331 --> 02:06:25,210
language has five dimensions now it's a 
little rough around the edges.

2220
02:06:25,211 --> 02:06:25,661
Yeah,
yeah.

2221
02:06:25,661 --> 02:06:27,130
Whatever.
It's there.

2222
02:06:27,670 --> 02:06:29,560
Okay,
fine.

2223
02:06:29,710 --> 02:06:32,710
So how big are those differences?
Well if you add them up,

2224
02:06:33,070 --> 02:06:37,150
which you could,
the overlap between men and women is 10%

2225
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:38,103
that's it.

2226
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:38,973
So that means if you constructed a 
regression equation using the big five 

2227
02:06:42,851 --> 02:06:46,300
personality differences to predict who 
was men and women,

2228
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:47,163
men and woman,
just on the basis of the responses to 

2229
02:06:48,911 --> 02:06:49,744
the personality traits,
you could identify the genders with 90% 

2230
02:06:52,301 --> 02:06:55,360
accuracy.
And it's worse than that because the new

2231
02:06:55,361 --> 02:06:56,194
study showed that not only do there are 
other differences that exist in 

2232
02:06:59,711 --> 02:07:02,380
personality that are that small 
individually,

2233
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:05,170
but that large in combination.
But there are differences,

2234
02:07:05,200 --> 02:07:08,590
differences in blood pressure,
maximize in egalitarian societies,

2235
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,860
differences in the market,
in the dark triad traits,

2236
02:07:11,861 --> 02:07:14,620
the Makaveli Ism and I don't remember 
what the other two are.

2237
02:07:14,740 --> 02:07:19,690
Maximizing Egalitarian states like all 
sorts of differences maximize.

2238
02:07:19,691 --> 02:07:21,460
And then you might ask,
well why is that?

2239
02:07:21,820 --> 02:07:24,550
And then there's a simple explanation 
and the simple explanation.

2240
02:07:24,551 --> 02:07:29,320
Yes.
Differences between men and women have a

2241
02:07:29,321 --> 02:07:31,300
partial basis in biology.

2242
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:32,860
Yeah.

2243
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:36,100
If you eradicate the cultural,
you know

2244
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,173
the environmental variability by making 
the state egalitarian all you leave or 

2245
02:07:40,571 --> 02:07:43,390
the biological differences which 
maximize,

2246
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:47,570
it's like
dispute that.

2247
02:07:47,810 --> 02:07:48,643
How can you dispute that?
It's not like something that someone 

2248
02:07:51,261 --> 02:07:54,080
planned,
no one was aiming at that.

2249
02:07:54,290 --> 02:07:55,940
It just,
that's how it happened.

2250
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,110
Okay.
So there is evidence we could say,

2251
02:08:00,111 --> 02:08:00,944
well there is powerful evidence that 
people have a biological nature and 

2252
02:08:04,191 --> 02:08:06,560
inbuilt nature and then we could also,
and then you can say,

2253
02:08:06,561 --> 02:08:08,120
okay,
let's take that set of data.

2254
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:09,313
Okay.
The biggest difference between men and 

2255
02:08:13,301 --> 02:08:14,320
women is an interest

2256
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:16,593
and the interest dimension seems to be 
people versus things women are more 

2257
02:08:20,201 --> 02:08:22,570
interested in people and men are more 
interested in things.

2258
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:25,240
And the difference there is about a 
standard deviation.

2259
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:29,080
It's a big difference by by 
psychological standards.

2260
02:08:29,890 --> 02:08:30,723
And it's a nice finding because you know
for a while one of the claims was that 

2261
02:08:34,361 --> 02:08:36,610
there were fewer women in stem 
disciplines,

2262
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:37,540
science,
technology,

2263
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:38,374
engineering,
mathematics was because the standard 

2264
02:08:40,691 --> 02:08:43,930
deviation of male intelligence was 
larger because the curve was flatter.

2265
02:08:43,970 --> 02:08:44,803
So there were more intellectually 
impaired men and more sort of super 

2266
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:47,944
genius men.
And there's a biological rationale for 

2267
02:08:49,901 --> 02:08:52,270
that.
And then one of the consequences of that

2268
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:53,104
was that if you went five standard 
deviations from the mean and you needed 

2269
02:08:56,201 --> 02:08:57,034
that to be like an expert physicist,
that was so rare that the only people 

2270
02:09:00,551 --> 02:09:01,384
who were out there were men.
You know what it's like the reason that 

2271
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:04,624
most of the people in prison are manage 
because the distribution of 

2272
02:09:07,781 --> 02:09:11,660
agreeableness is skewed and there's way 
more disagreeable man at the extreme,

2273
02:09:11,661 --> 02:09:12,820
so they all end up in prison.

2274
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:17,290
That argument has not been settled,
but I think you can just put it aside.

2275
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,153
There's a lot of debate about it.
So Larry Summers brought it up at 

2276
02:09:20,201 --> 02:09:21,034
Harvard and got fired as a consequence 
and then a variety of female 

2277
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:29,290
psychologist scoured the ICU literature 
and made the claim that that finding was

2278
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:31,360
questionable to say the least.
And maybe it is,

2279
02:09:31,361 --> 02:09:32,680
maybe it isn't,
but it doesn't matter.

2280
02:09:32,681 --> 02:09:33,550
It's,
it's debatable.

2281
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:38,260
What you do find though is that if you 
look at male and female performance,

2282
02:09:38,261 --> 02:09:40,420
say in mathematics in junior high or 
high school,

2283
02:09:40,421 --> 02:09:41,254
you can find a chunk of three to four 
standard deviation above the mean 

2284
02:09:44,291 --> 02:09:47,500
females and none of them go into stem 
studies.

2285
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:48,813
And why is that?
It seems to be because they don't want 

2286
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:52,390
to,
no,

2287
02:09:52,660 --> 02:09:56,080
I like that explanation because you 
know,

2288
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,720
if you had to have an explanation that 
was palatable,

2289
02:09:58,810 --> 02:09:59,710
that would be a good one.

2290
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:00,543
It doesn't,
it doesn't make a claim for anything 

2291
02:10:02,381 --> 02:10:04,630
that has to do with the intrinsic 
differences in ability.

2292
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:06,003
So that's kind of Nice.
It wipes out a whole deep politicizes a 

2293
02:10:09,071 --> 02:10:11,380
huge chunk of the argument.
But then you could say,

2294
02:10:11,381 --> 02:10:12,214
well,
maybe men and women are like different 

2295
02:10:15,791 --> 02:10:17,650
things because of socialization.
It's like,

2296
02:10:17,651 --> 02:10:18,484
no,
you can't say that because that isn't 

2297
02:10:19,451 --> 02:10:22,150
how it worked out in Scandinavia.
So that's the end of that argument.

2298
02:10:22,151 --> 02:10:25,690
Unless you can figure out how those 
studies are wrong and like,

2299
02:10:25,691 --> 02:10:26,524
good luck to you.
But I've never seen a credible 

2300
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,893
explanation.
And then the next thing you could say 

2301
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:31,721
is,
yeah,

2302
02:10:31,721 --> 02:10:35,780
regardless about men and women should be
the same.

2303
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:38,120
Fine.
No problem.

2304
02:10:38,240 --> 02:10:42,130
You could do it if you want to make,
if you want to take,

2305
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:43,273
say you have two kids that are,
that are adopted out at birth and 

2306
02:10:46,371 --> 02:10:47,204
they're twins,
and you assess their Iq and you look at 

2307
02:10:49,641 --> 02:10:52,220
it in relationship to their 
socioeconomic status.

2308
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:53,383
One kids,
it ends up in a family that's poor that 

2309
02:10:55,461 --> 02:11:00,461
95% of other families and other kid ends
up in a family that's richer than 95% of

2310
02:11:00,981 --> 02:11:02,690
families.
So it's a big difference.

2311
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:06,740
The kid in the richer home,
we'll have a 15 point Iq advantage.

2312
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:08,650
So what that basically means,
I'm,

2313
02:11:08,660 --> 02:11:09,493
I've got the statistics a little bit 
wrong here because I can't translate it 

2314
02:11:11,931 --> 02:11:14,420
onto the normal distribution,
but roughly speaking,

2315
02:11:14,421 --> 02:11:18,770
what it means is that you need a three 
standard deviation move in socioeconomic

2316
02:11:18,771 --> 02:11:21,140
status to produce a one standard 
deviation move.

2317
02:11:21,141 --> 02:11:21,974
In Iq,
what it implies is that you can buy 

2318
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:25,183
transformation of Iq,
but what it also indicates is that it's 

2319
02:11:27,741 --> 02:11:30,530
bloody expensive.
It's extent that makes sense,

2320
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:31,430
right?
You could,

2321
02:11:31,431 --> 02:11:32,264
you could imagine that being the case.
If you spend enough money you could 

2322
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:37,620
switch something.
But I would say no.

2323
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:41,360
The farther you want to switch it,
the more expensive it's going to get.

2324
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:42,313
And it's probably a curve like this,
a diminishing return things so that 

2325
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:47,630
maybe the first five points would be 
pretty easy.

2326
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:49,940
The next five things are getting 
expensive.

2327
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:50,953
The five after that,
it's really expensive and then each 

2328
02:11:53,691 --> 02:11:56,330
additional one point is going to cost a 
lot.

2329
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:57,613
Alright,
fine.

2330
02:11:58,670 --> 02:12:01,910
So what that means is that even if the 
differences are biological,

2331
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:05,450
you can shift them.
The question is two questions,

2332
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:08,420
how much effort are you willing to put 
in?

2333
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:10,093
And then the next question is how much 
effort do you put in before it's a 

2334
02:12:12,711 --> 02:12:16,400
tyranny?
And that's the real question.

2335
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:19,340
So we could say,
well,

2336
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:22,460
radically transformed the socialization 
of boys and girls.

2337
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:23,294
Now this is being called for it.
Before there was a guy psychologist and 

2338
02:12:26,641 --> 02:12:28,910
appalling,
it was an appalling article.

2339
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:29,803
I think he was a social psychologist,
which would make sense because most of 

2340
02:12:32,781 --> 02:12:33,614
what they do is appalling.
And so he proposed that the way to 

2341
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:39,223
decrease the radical difference in 
aggression rates between men and women 

2342
02:12:42,381 --> 02:12:45,470
was to socialize little boys,
like little girls,

2343
02:12:45,830 --> 02:12:46,663
and that's been put into practice a lot 
and it will not work because what will 

2344
02:12:50,511 --> 02:12:51,500
happen is that you'll,

2345
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:56,810
you might reduce the aggression of the 
average guy,

2346
02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:57,913
but you're going to pop up the 
aggression of the pathological guide by 

2347
02:13:00,111 --> 02:13:00,944
such a degree that it will completely 
overwhelm whatever minor gains you make 

2348
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:04,334
for the typical.
So you're just going to produce more 

2349
02:13:05,601 --> 02:13:10,010
guys that are so bad that they're like 
hell band for for revenge fundamentally.

2350
02:13:10,490 --> 02:13:11,840
So,
okay.

2351
02:13:11,841 --> 02:13:13,310
But you could make that case,
you know,

2352
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:14,144
like from a,
from a scientific or political 

2353
02:13:15,681 --> 02:13:16,700
perspective,
you could say,

2354
02:13:16,701 --> 02:13:17,534
look,
it's worth investing in the 

2355
02:13:19,011 --> 02:13:21,230
transformation of the socialization 
process.

2356
02:13:21,231 --> 02:13:23,990
So we get rid of those differences.
Okay.

2357
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:25,680
The next thing you got to ask yourself,
yes,

2358
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:26,623
yes.

2359
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:28,483
Why?

2360
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:31,980
What's the end game?
Now here's the end

2361
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,670
game.
Men and women will be represented 50% in

2362
02:13:35,671 --> 02:13:39,780
absolutely every occupation and there 
will be zero differences in economic and

2363
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:41,160
political power.
Okay?

2364
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:46,470
That end game presumes that that outcome
has a value.

2365
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,480
We know,
I don't know what the value is,

2366
02:13:48,481 --> 02:13:49,314
but some valid and then the more 
resources you're willing to dump into 

2367
02:13:52,350 --> 02:13:53,183
attain that end,
the more valuable your acting as if it 

2368
02:13:56,521 --> 02:13:59,820
is.
So you could think about it as a utopian

2369
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:05,490
or Utopian in state.
And I'm not complaining about the formal

2370
02:14:05,491 --> 02:14:07,920
proposition that that would be a utopian
end state.

2371
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:09,173
What I'm complaining about is,
or what I'm commenting on is who says 

2372
02:14:12,901 --> 02:14:16,920
that's the desire blow come and how much
are you willing to risk to test it out?

2373
02:14:18,120 --> 02:14:21,180
So because what you'll have to do,
especially for things like interest,

2374
02:14:21,181 --> 02:14:26,181
is you'll have to punish boys for being 
interested in boy things and reward them

2375
02:14:26,641 --> 02:14:27,474
for being interested in girl things and 
punish girls for being interested in 

2376
02:14:30,841 --> 02:14:33,810
girl things and reward them for being 
interested in boy things.

2377
02:14:33,900 --> 02:14:35,580
Now I think you could do that,

2378
02:14:35,980 --> 02:14:40,030
but,
but

2379
02:14:41,770 --> 02:14:43,240
what if they're,
you know,

2380
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:45,670
they're,
the differences exist.

2381
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:49,210
Why eradicate them?
Do you want them eradicated?

2382
02:14:49,240 --> 02:14:52,600
Do you really want them eradicated?
And you know the word eradicated?

2383
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:53,463
That's a rough word because you just 
never know how far you're going to have 

2384
02:14:55,511 --> 02:14:57,070
to go to eradicate.

2385
02:14:57,170 --> 02:14:59,030
Thanks.
So,

2386
02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:01,550
all right,
let's see,

2387
02:15:01,551 --> 02:15:03,590
what time is it with their habit break?
Yes.

2388
02:15:03,890 --> 02:15:04,820
Oh,
it's three 30.

2389
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:07,190
Well,
there's no more,

2390
02:15:07,190 --> 02:15:09,110
not much point in a break.
Okay.

2391
02:15:09,111 --> 02:15:10,400
So let me,
Yup.

2392
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:18,770
Neurobiology.
So they started doing experiments very,

2393
02:15:19,470 --> 02:15:23,960
they basically tried growing neurons,
different hormones,

2394
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:27,200
and I found that neurons growing 
estrogen,

2395
02:15:27,580 --> 02:15:28,413
they're like,
they grow completely differently than 

2396
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:32,930
other things,
which makes sense,

2397
02:15:32,931 --> 02:15:35,150
right.
If gender differences of biological,

2398
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,460
uh,
but the upshot to that is,

2399
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:41,630
it works with sort of that theory,
but you have to add on is that,

2400
02:15:42,710 --> 02:15:43,543
you know,
there are men and women with different 

2401
02:15:44,541 --> 02:15:47,150
levels of hormone.
It's not uniform across sex.

2402
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:52,160
So when you look at how you're going to 
raise a child,

2403
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:54,520
you can't just say,
you know,

2404
02:15:54,570 --> 02:15:56,660
it's a girl.
You raised him like a girl.

2405
02:15:57,900 --> 02:16:00,620
You have to look at either a hormone 
levels,

2406
02:16:00,621 --> 02:16:03,000
but because you can't access those,
you'd have to look at their,

2407
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:04,730
their,
their gender identity.

2408
02:16:05,830 --> 02:16:06,960
Yes.
While they're there,

2409
02:16:07,080 --> 02:16:07,913
but to see that,
but that's an individual relationship 

2410
02:16:09,790 --> 02:16:11,260
issue.
Okay.

2411
02:16:11,261 --> 02:16:12,640
So,
um,

2412
02:16:12,910 --> 02:16:14,640
I've had children and

2413
02:16:17,140 --> 02:16:21,160
they seem to have turned out reasonably 
well and you know,

2414
02:16:21,161 --> 02:16:21,994
there was a variety of differences 
between them temperamentally that I 

2415
02:16:25,091 --> 02:16:27,500
observed as they were growing up.
Um,

2416
02:16:27,970 --> 02:16:32,970
it turns out my daughter is quite tilted
towards a feminine temperament.

2417
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:39,670
I tested her personality multiple times.
She tests all the personalities,

2418
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:42,580
she tests the personalities of all her 
potential dates,

2419
02:16:42,810 --> 02:16:44,830
which I think is really funny.
Yeah.

2420
02:16:45,460 --> 02:16:46,293
And my son has a very masculine 
temperament so he's very low in 

2421
02:16:48,611 --> 02:16:50,630
agreeableness and very high emotional 
stability.

2422
02:16:50,631 --> 02:16:53,380
Again,
so I can see that manifesting itself and

2423
02:16:53,381 --> 02:16:54,214
what you do if you have a relationship 
with your kids as you adjust your 

2424
02:16:57,371 --> 02:16:59,410
interactions with them according to who 
they are.

2425
02:16:59,411 --> 02:17:00,244
Because in principle you want,
maybe it seems to me then in principle 

2426
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:07,420
maybe you want who they are to be 
allowed to emerge.

2427
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:10,660
Now I think there's some evidence that 
that's what good parents do.

2428
02:17:10,660 --> 02:17:11,493
And the reason I think that is because 
when you're looking at influences on 

2429
02:17:15,161 --> 02:17:18,160
children,
you can look out genetic influences,

2430
02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:19,623
non shared environmental,
various and shared environmental 

2431
02:17:21,941 --> 02:17:23,440
therapy.
So shared environment.

2432
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:24,423
Well variants would be if you and I were
brother and sister in the same family 

2433
02:17:27,430 --> 02:17:28,263
shared environmental,
various would be what was common across 

2434
02:17:30,611 --> 02:17:34,270
our upbringings.
Unshared environmental variance would be

2435
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:37,510
what was specific to you in our family 
and what was specific to me.

2436
02:17:37,630 --> 02:17:39,630
And then the biological stuff is 
biological.

2437
02:17:39,640 --> 02:17:44,640
What you almost always find in the 
studies is that non shared environmental

2438
02:17:45,161 --> 02:17:49,690
variance is the most powerful after 
biological predisposition depends on the

2439
02:17:49,691 --> 02:17:50,524
trade.
And so what that seems to indicate is 

2440
02:17:52,091 --> 02:17:56,560
that the general mill you in which 
children is raised has hardly any effect

2441
02:17:56,561 --> 02:18:00,220
whatsoever on their,
on their treat outcomes.

2442
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:03,070
Now you can be pessimistic or optimistic
about that.

2443
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:04,053
If you're pessimistic,
you say parenting doesn't matter and 

2444
02:18:06,671 --> 02:18:08,290
people have drawn that conclusion.

2445
02:18:08,290 --> 02:18:10,420
There was a famous book written about 
that a while back.

2446
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:13,630
Um,
but if you're optimistic,

2447
02:18:13,631 --> 02:18:14,370
what you say is,
no,

2448
02:18:14,370 --> 02:18:14,611
no,
no,

2449
02:18:14,611 --> 02:18:14,961
no,
no,

2450
02:18:14,961 --> 02:18:16,360
no,
you don't get it.

2451
02:18:16,810 --> 02:18:17,643
If you were a good parent,
you were radicchio the shared variance 

2452
02:18:20,110 --> 02:18:20,943
because what you do is have an 
individual relationship with each child 

2453
02:18:23,121 --> 02:18:25,030
that takes into account their 
temperamental,

2454
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:26,283
you know,
idiosyncrasies and you tailor the 

2455
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:28,954
environment to them.
And so the shared the shared 

2456
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:33,730
environmental various disappears because
there is no shared environment.

2457
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:35,133
You know,
it's like go on 10 dates and treat each 

2458
02:18:38,921 --> 02:18:39,754
man you meet or each woman you meet as 
if they were exactly the same and see 

2459
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:45,520
how far you get,
right?

2460
02:18:45,521 --> 02:18:49,630
You're going to be one annoying person 
and you know probability you're going to

2461
02:18:49,631 --> 02:18:51,670
get brushed off.
So what you want to do is,

2462
02:18:52,210 --> 02:18:53,043
you know,
take the gender into account as a broad 

2463
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:55,920
template.
You know,

2464
02:18:55,990 --> 02:18:59,080
cause you need to set up your 
expectations and then rapidly Taylor the

2465
02:18:59,081 --> 02:18:59,914
hell out of that as fast as you can to 
indicate that you've got some social 

2466
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:04,000
sophistication.
Right?

2467
02:19:04,001 --> 02:19:05,440
While you do the same thing with 
children.

2468
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:06,753
Okay.
So then,

2469
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:08,103
but that still begs the question and 
this is something that you guys can 

2470
02:19:11,351 --> 02:19:12,184
think about.
It's like

2471
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:16,090
what do you do about the differences?

2472
02:19:18,380 --> 02:19:19,213
Do you leave them?

2473
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:22,620
Do you encourage them?
That's another thing you could see.

2474
02:19:22,621 --> 02:19:25,720
You could say,
see the thing that I,

2475
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:28,490
one of the things I really dislike about
the social constructionists

2476
02:19:28,520 --> 02:19:30,920
stances,
that there was an implication that comes

2477
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:32,600
with it.
Here's the implication.

2478
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,940
Men and women are the same.
Okay,

2479
02:19:37,970 --> 02:19:40,130
well why is that necessary?
Well,

2480
02:19:40,131 --> 02:19:44,360
because that similarity is valuable 
because otherwise white pursue it,

2481
02:19:44,390 --> 02:19:45,740
right?
Because it's valuable.

2482
02:19:45,741 --> 02:19:49,490
So people are better off with near the 
same fine.

2483
02:19:50,060 --> 02:19:52,040
People are worse off when they're 
different.

2484
02:19:52,340 --> 02:19:53,173
Ah,
why are they worse off when they're 

2485
02:19:54,291 --> 02:19:55,124
different?
How about because differences are not 

2486
02:19:56,691 --> 02:19:57,830
acceptable.
Okay,

2487
02:19:57,831 --> 02:20:00,950
well play out if you want.
Differences are not acceptable.

2488
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:02,053
Well,
you could see where that would leave in 

2489
02:20:03,310 --> 02:20:05,110
no time flat.
You know?

2490
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:05,983
So the mere proposition that men and 
women are the same in a world where 

2491
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:11,780
there are differences,
has the implication that the differences

2492
02:20:11,781 --> 02:20:14,630
are substandard and maybe even 
pathological.

2493
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:16,820
And you might say,
are they really,

2494
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:17,713
is that right?
Is it the case that to the degree we 

2495
02:20:19,281 --> 02:20:23,090
defer,
we're not mutually complimentary and not

2496
02:20:23,091 --> 02:20:25,040
acceptable?
I mean as individuals and gender.

2497
02:20:26,970 --> 02:20:27,803
It is true that I feel like
they want to pretend that we don't have 

2498
02:20:32,671 --> 02:20:34,440
to force it,
but at the same time,

2499
02:20:34,441 --> 02:20:36,630
and I feel like they're are also very 
um,

2500
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:42,400
like encouraging like other people,
especially their culture,

2501
02:20:43,380 --> 02:20:46,320
they're also be about the same time of 
like say well what?

2502
02:20:46,321 --> 02:20:48,450
All the same,
there are no differences there.

2503
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:49,171
Also like,
oh,

2504
02:20:49,171 --> 02:20:50,730
we should multicultural.

2505
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:52,630
We,
we have a theory about that now.

2506
02:20:52,660 --> 02:20:53,493
So we just did a study of political 
correctness because we wanted to find 

2507
02:20:56,411 --> 02:20:56,720
out,
oh,

2508
02:20:56,720 --> 02:20:57,553
I'll get to write with,
we wanted to find out if political 

2509
02:20:59,501 --> 02:21:01,180
correctness existed,
right?

2510
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:02,043
Is it a margin,
a set of values because it might not be 

2511
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:06,093
the left planes that the idea that 
political correctness exists as a 

2512
02:21:09,191 --> 02:21:10,024
homogenous set of constructs is a right 
wing idea and that it's just wrong that 

2513
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:15,250
this the belief side,
it's so diverse.

2514
02:21:15,251 --> 02:21:17,290
You can't characterize it under a single
label.

2515
02:21:17,500 --> 02:21:18,333
It's easy to test.
What you do is you get a bunch of 

2516
02:21:20,650 --> 02:21:21,483
statements that appear to be on the 
politically correct side and you can do 

2517
02:21:24,221 --> 02:21:25,054
that relatively objectively.
We had a bunch of people generate them 

2518
02:21:27,191 --> 02:21:29,140
and we took clips from news items and 
all of that.

2519
02:21:29,141 --> 02:21:33,790
So over generated to set,
asked a thousand people factor,

2520
02:21:33,791 --> 02:21:34,840
analyze the results.

2521
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:35,673
And we've got two factors.
One was sort of radical egalitarianism 

2522
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:42,670
and the other was language control.
Okay.

2523
02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:44,950
And we've already done this for liberals
and conservatives.

2524
02:21:44,980 --> 02:21:47,260
Okay.
So the liberals are high in openness and

2525
02:21:47,261 --> 02:21:50,470
low in conscientiousness,
particularly orderliness.

2526
02:21:51,370 --> 02:21:54,550
The conservatives are low in openness 
and high in conscientiousness,

2527
02:21:54,730 --> 02:21:57,910
particularly orderliness.
So they're actually mirror images of one

2528
02:21:57,911 --> 02:22:01,540
another.
The politically correct people.

2529
02:22:01,870 --> 02:22:04,330
The first dimension,
which is radical egalitarianism,

2530
02:22:04,480 --> 02:22:08,170
they're primarily agreeable and low in 
conscientiousness.

2531
02:22:08,890 --> 02:22:10,060
Okay.
So that's different.

2532
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:13,090
They're not hyper liberals.
They're off on a different axis.

2533
02:22:13,360 --> 02:22:14,193
Okay.
The second dimension was high 

2534
02:22:17,531 --> 02:22:18,400
agreeableness.

2535
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:20,613
Okay.

2536
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:22,520
Low conscientiousness.
Is that right?

2537
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:24,650
Well conscientiousness,
I hope that's right.

2538
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:27,090
It doesn't exactly matter.
And low verbal Iq.

2539
02:22:28,770 --> 02:22:29,940
Okay.
So

2540
02:22:31,570 --> 02:22:33,100
there was a reason I was telling you 
that

2541
02:22:34,880 --> 02:22:36,290
can ask me your question again.

2542
02:22:36,440 --> 02:22:40,040
Oh,
the fact that a lot of left wing people,

2543
02:22:40,041 --> 02:22:42,350
they're all one had they tried to claim 
that every day.

2544
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:43,980
Oh Great.
Good,

2545
02:22:43,981 --> 02:22:44,814
good,
good.

2546
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:47,430
Okay.
So the commonality.

2547
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:48,353
So we've always,
we felt that and people make this claim 

2548
02:22:50,881 --> 02:22:51,714
that there's something about the pc 
stands that leads itself to a kind of 

2549
02:22:54,121 --> 02:22:54,954
authoritarianism.
But it's weird because a lot of the 

2550
02:22:57,451 --> 02:22:58,284
research on authoritarianism and there's
historical reasons for that was 

2551
02:23:01,171 --> 02:23:04,770
predicated on the claim that 
authoritarianism was necessarily a right

2552
02:23:04,771 --> 02:23:05,630
lane phenomenon.
Yeah.

2553
02:23:05,940 --> 02:23:07,530
Okay.
So the authoritarian scale,

2554
02:23:07,531 --> 02:23:10,110
for example,
which was derived by Theodore Adorno,

2555
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:13,200
who was part of a left wing think tank,
um,

2556
02:23:13,560 --> 02:23:15,480
what were they called?
They were in Germany,

2557
02:23:15,750 --> 02:23:18,360
I'll remember their name.
It was after World War Two.

2558
02:23:18,361 --> 02:23:19,194
And they had every reason for assuming 
that authoritarianism was the right way 

2559
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:23,460
phenomena,
except for all the things the communists

2560
02:23:23,461 --> 02:23:24,330
were doing.
But you know,

2561
02:23:24,780 --> 02:23:25,613
forget about that for a moment.
And then there was a huge debate in the 

2562
02:23:27,541 --> 02:23:29,340
psychological literature,
really tilt,

2563
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:30,533
still going on about whether only the 
right can be authoritarian or whether 

2564
02:23:33,961 --> 02:23:37,470
the left and the right can be 
authoritarian has never been sorted out.

2565
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,060
Okay.
But what we found,

2566
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:43,920
so the conservatives were high in 
orderliness and low and opens.

2567
02:23:44,310 --> 02:23:45,143
Okay.
So orderliness seems to be the 

2568
02:23:46,471 --> 02:23:47,304
authoritarian aspect because 
conscientious people like structure and 

2569
02:23:51,751 --> 02:23:55,110
they'd like to compete with instructors 
and conscientiousness predicts,

2570
02:23:55,260 --> 02:23:56,670
right wing beliefs.
Okay,

2571
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:57,623
but it isn't industriousness,
which is another part of the 

2572
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,410
conscientiousness.
Its orderliness.

2573
02:24:01,890 --> 02:24:02,723
Okay.
The second dimension of the politically 

2574
02:24:06,751 --> 02:24:07,584
correct people.
The language control was agreeable and 

2575
02:24:10,561 --> 02:24:12,840
orderly.
And then then the Iq.

2576
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,370
Okay,
so this is what we think.

2577
02:24:14,371 --> 02:24:15,204
Now this is Beckman but,
but it's a good study and we'd been 

2578
02:24:18,301 --> 02:24:21,090
trying hard to pin this down and this 
isn't my idea by the way.

2579
02:24:21,091 --> 02:24:23,700
This is my graduate student's idea was 
not very smart idea.

2580
02:24:24,150 --> 02:24:27,890
She thought authoritarianism is driven 
by orderliness.

2581
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,390
Okay fine.
If you are agreeable,

2582
02:24:30,420 --> 02:24:31,253
you are authoritarian by inclusion.
And if you're disagreeable and you're 

2583
02:24:34,621 --> 02:24:36,210
authoritarian by exclusion.

2584
02:24:36,930 --> 02:24:37,630
So the,
the,

2585
02:24:37,630 --> 02:24:38,463
the goal is homogeneity,
but the right way you say all you 

2586
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:43,524
different people screw off and the left 
wing says all you different people come 

2587
02:24:46,981 --> 02:24:50,190
in here and be the same.
Okay?

2588
02:24:50,250 --> 02:24:51,083
So now I think the way that that 
pertains to your question is that I 

2589
02:24:54,721 --> 02:24:55,554
think the left wing manages that weirdly
paradoxical viewpoint by assuming that 

2590
02:25:00,391 --> 02:25:01,224
whatever differences exist,
our cultural and so they can just be in 

2591
02:25:04,561 --> 02:25:06,210
time,
they can just be ameliorated.

2592
02:25:07,050 --> 02:25:08,490
That's what it looks like to me.
I mean,

2593
02:25:08,491 --> 02:25:12,840
it really does seem
paradoxical,

2594
02:25:12,900 --> 02:25:14,340
right?
That you can,

2595
02:25:14,370 --> 02:25:18,000
you can be for an egalitarianism and 
celebrate differences.

2596
02:25:18,001 --> 02:25:21,760
And you see this turns out very weirdly.
So let so many people,

2597
02:25:22,350 --> 02:25:24,430
well let,
let me you an example of what happened.

2598
02:25:24,431 --> 02:25:26,800
So do you guys know who I Ayaan Hirsi 
Ali is?

2599
02:25:26,820 --> 02:25:27,800
Yes.
Do.

2600
02:25:27,830 --> 02:25:30,070
And how many of you know,
okay,

2601
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:31,230
now if you could keep it.

2602
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:32,030
Good.
Good.

2603
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:33,670
Look,
she's quite the day I'm character.

2604
02:25:33,671 --> 02:25:34,870
You know,
I hadn't heard the elite.

2605
02:25:34,871 --> 02:25:36,670
I would look her up.
I think she's a real hero.

2606
02:25:36,671 --> 02:25:38,740
That woman,
she is tough as a bloody boot.

2607
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:39,963
She came from Ethiopia,
she escaped from an arranged marriage 

2608
02:25:41,981 --> 02:25:45,150
and she was in a very hierarchical,
you know,

2609
02:25:45,160 --> 02:25:49,090
authoritarian Muslim family.
So she had to run and she did.

2610
02:25:49,091 --> 02:25:51,400
And so that was tough man.
To get away from that.

2611
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:52,653
You know,
she had to forfeit or familial ties and 

2612
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:54,874
all of that.
And then she went to the Netherlands to 

2613
02:25:56,291 --> 02:25:57,124
study and the Netherlands shocked her 
and she said a couple of things that 

2614
02:26:01,931 --> 02:26:02,764
shocked her that I thought were so cool.
The first thing that shocked her was 

2615
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:05,824
that she was at a bus stop and there was
a little digital sign there that said 

2616
02:26:08,471 --> 02:26:09,304
when the bus was coming and then the bus
came like right at the time it was 

2617
02:26:12,461 --> 02:26:13,294
supposed to,
she couldn't believe that that could 

2618
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:15,580
actually happen.

2619
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:16,413
And if you think about how many things 
have to be going right for that to 

2620
02:26:18,461 --> 02:26:19,294
happen,
you know that her detection of that 

2621
02:26:21,341 --> 02:26:22,174
miracle was accurate.
And the fact that we just assume that 

2622
02:26:25,210 --> 02:26:28,000
that's just shows you how well things 
work.

2623
02:26:28,660 --> 02:26:32,620
And the second thing she was amazed 
about was that if you ask the policeman,

2624
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:33,454
they would help you.
Because in most countries policemen are 

2625
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:38,590
like,
they're just an extension of thug,

2626
02:26:38,620 --> 02:26:39,970
right?
They don't get paid anything.

2627
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:41,890
So all the money they make,
it's from you.

2628
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:44,680
And they're not there to maintain order 
or to help you.

2629
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:46,900
They're there as a control arm of the 
state.

2630
02:26:47,260 --> 02:26:48,093
Anyway,
she went and go to liberal arts 

2631
02:26:48,851 --> 02:26:53,851
education and she was very taken by the 
idea of individual sovereignty,

2632
02:26:56,650 --> 02:26:57,483
roughly speaking and the enlightenment.
So she turned into a really pro 

2633
02:26:59,801 --> 02:27:00,634
enlightenment person and then she got 
into the Dutch parliament and she also 

2634
02:27:04,961 --> 02:27:07,270
had,
there was a bit of a scandal about that,

2635
02:27:07,271 --> 02:27:08,110
which I won't go into.

2636
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:09,603
She also had a relationship,
I think it was just a friendship with 

2637
02:27:11,981 --> 02:27:12,814
this guy named Van Gogh,
who was actually a descendant of found 

2638
02:27:14,911 --> 02:27:15,744
gold.
And he made this video that have naked 

2639
02:27:17,771 --> 02:27:20,530
women in it with verses of the Quran 
written on them.

2640
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:21,760
And it was very,
very,

2641
02:27:21,761 --> 02:27:22,594
very,
very controversial because these were 

2642
02:27:23,531 --> 02:27:26,080
anti female versus at least that's what 
he thought.

2643
02:27:26,380 --> 02:27:30,400
And so he got stabbed and what happened 
was the guy that stabbed him,

2644
02:27:30,401 --> 02:27:34,300
it was a Muslim extremists took the 
note,

2645
02:27:34,301 --> 02:27:38,140
it explained why he was being killed and
stabbed it into him.

2646
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:39,880
Okay.
So that was nasty.

2647
02:27:40,120 --> 02:27:42,340
So I ended Hirsi Ali.
Eventually she,

2648
02:27:42,341 --> 02:27:43,174
her life was in danger.
[inaudible] to such a degree and a 

2649
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:46,504
variety of things happen at home that 
she had to move to the United States 

2650
02:27:48,671 --> 02:27:49,504
with bodyguards.
And so she lives there now and she's an 

2651
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:58,080
outspoken critic of patriarchal 
oppressor in the best sense.

2652
02:27:58,330 --> 02:28:00,370
Like she experienced it.
It was terrible.

2653
02:28:00,371 --> 02:28:05,371
Like she got away from it and you know,
and in a really remarkable and honorable

2654
02:28:07,091 --> 02:28:09,760
and admirable way,
and I read,

2655
02:28:09,761 --> 02:28:10,594
I in Herzliya lead before she was 
politically controversial except in 

2656
02:28:13,451 --> 02:28:14,530
Holland.
Well,

2657
02:28:14,531 --> 02:28:15,364
last year Brandeis University offered 
her a honorary phd and the students set 

2658
02:28:21,441 --> 02:28:22,274
up a petition saying that she couldn't 
be granted that phd because of her 

2659
02:28:26,511 --> 02:28:31,511
objection to two Muslim too radical 
Muslim faith and they disinvited her.

2660
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:34,250
So that's a good example of this weird 
paradox.

2661
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:37,100
It's like I read,
I Ayaan Hirsi Ali and I thought,

2662
02:28:37,101 --> 02:28:39,650
Jesus,
if anybody ever had a case to make about

2663
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:40,484
the oppressive nature of the patriarchy,
like as someone who had personally 

2664
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:43,994
experienced it,
it's like you read her story and you 

2665
02:28:45,951 --> 02:28:46,850
think,
Oh yeah,

2666
02:28:46,851 --> 02:28:47,684
there's no doubt about that.
And so then she makes this immensely 

2667
02:28:50,871 --> 02:28:55,100
complex and sophisticated case for the 
individual rights of women.

2668
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:56,413
And Brandeis invites her to give her an 
honorary degree and then they resend it 

2669
02:29:00,021 --> 02:29:00,854
because the students complain about her.
And that was the radical left students 

2670
02:29:02,931 --> 02:29:04,610
who were complaining.
I just thought,

2671
02:29:05,090 --> 02:29:07,190
well I thought first of all,
that's amazing.

2672
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,840
It's,
I just can't believe that happened.

2673
02:29:08,841 --> 02:29:09,674
It's second.
I couldn't believe that that pathetic 

2674
02:29:11,361 --> 02:29:15,290
university cave and withdrew their,
their invitation to her.

2675
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:16,333
She's a tough cookie man.
And I think she's a real hero and that 

2676
02:29:19,881 --> 02:29:21,770
was irrelevant.
It's like some students were upset,

2677
02:29:21,771 --> 02:29:22,604
they made a petition.
So like who cares about Ayaan Hirsi Ali 

2678
02:29:24,711 --> 02:29:26,090
and her,
you know,

2679
02:29:26,780 --> 02:29:27,890
amazing journey.

2680
02:29:28,280 --> 02:29:29,113
I've noticed that like if I,
if I bring up friendship infringements 

2681
02:29:32,641 --> 02:29:36,780
on women's rights that contradicts like 
the liberal narrative of like a straight

2682
02:29:36,781 --> 02:29:40,350
white
person maybe like,

2683
02:29:40,490 --> 02:29:42,590
it's like some poor people,
you know,

2684
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:44,200
in a very like,
you know,

2685
02:29:44,210 --> 02:29:46,460
a Muslim majority country oppressing 
women,

2686
02:29:46,620 --> 02:29:47,453
if I bring that up is I feel like a lot 
of times like the gifts cause like it 

2687
02:29:51,241 --> 02:29:52,950
contradicts that,
the main narrative,

2688
02:29:52,951 --> 02:29:53,820
which is impressive.

2689
02:29:54,860 --> 02:29:55,693
Well,
the prog,

2690
02:29:55,720 --> 02:29:57,050
you know,
generally the problem,

2691
02:29:57,080 --> 02:29:57,913
the problem with a set of axiomatic 
presuppositions is that you'll find 

2692
02:30:01,041 --> 02:30:04,340
situations where they conflict.
I can give you another example.

2693
02:30:04,700 --> 02:30:06,080
So,
um,

2694
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:08,260
that's definitely one,
you know,

2695
02:30:08,261 --> 02:30:09,350
so you say,
well,

2696
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:13,010
diverse ethnicity and diverse cultural 
background is a plus,

2697
02:30:13,011 --> 02:30:13,791
but then you think,
oh,

2698
02:30:13,791 --> 02:30:14,624
well some of these practices look like 
they're not exactly commensurate with 

2699
02:30:19,011 --> 02:30:21,360
what we would regard as appropriate.
Okay.

2700
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:24,260
So we have a problem there.
Here's another problem.

2701
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:27,920
So as a of the same sort,
and I'm using this as an example just to

2702
02:30:27,921 --> 02:30:30,980
show you how axiomatic systems produce 
internal conflicts.

2703
02:30:31,310 --> 02:30:32,600
So,
um,

2704
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:35,593
the access to abortion has become 
increasingly universal in western 

2705
02:30:39,921 --> 02:30:40,754
countries,
although it's backtracked a lot in the 

2706
02:30:41,691 --> 02:30:44,420
US over the last 10 years for a variety 
of reasons.

2707
02:30:45,020 --> 02:30:47,420
But there's a,
there's a weird consequence of that.

2708
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,033
And one of the consequences is that 
female fetus get aborted at a much 

2709
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:53,450
higher rate than male fetuses worldwide.

2710
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:55,250
Okay.
So what do you do about that?

2711
02:30:55,940 --> 02:31:00,230
Like is that acceptable or not?
Because if it's not well then,

2712
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:03,740
then there's a problem because you know,
you have to face,

2713
02:31:04,040 --> 02:31:06,680
you have to face what do you have to 
face?

2714
02:31:06,681 --> 02:31:10,430
Exactly that there is an ethical 
question that when it comes to abortion,

2715
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:13,880
because I,
how if abortion is not wrong,

2716
02:31:13,910 --> 02:31:17,390
how could selective abortion pro 
possibly be not wrong.

2717
02:31:18,200 --> 02:31:20,940
Like maybe you could come up with an 
explanation for that,

2718
02:31:20,941 --> 02:31:25,110
but I've never seen a credible one.
But that's just a good example of how if

2719
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:25,944
you use an axiomatic system,
there's inevitably the case where the 

2720
02:31:29,371 --> 02:31:34,371
axioms collide and it's sort of like,
am I free to offend you with my speech?

2721
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:37,720
Two axioms,
freedom of speech and,

2722
02:31:37,721 --> 02:31:39,390
and you know,
integrity of person.

2723
02:31:39,480 --> 02:31:42,120
At what point am I,
am I in citing aggression?

2724
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:43,840
So,
oh,

2725
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:45,450
and it's also the case,
I think,

2726
02:31:45,451 --> 02:31:46,480
where the,
why the horace.

2727
02:31:46,480 --> 02:31:49,950
So Cyrus thing is absolutely necessary.
So you can take a vote,

2728
02:31:49,951 --> 02:31:53,760
cyrus as a set of axiomatic moral 
presuppositions,

2729
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:56,280
like a list of rules like the 10 
Commandments.

2730
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:59,730
The problem is,
is that not only do the rules get out of

2731
02:31:59,731 --> 02:32:01,530
date over time,
you know,

2732
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:02,933
um,
we don't worry very much about coveting 

2733
02:32:05,011 --> 02:32:07,290
our neighbor's goat for example.
You know,

2734
02:32:07,291 --> 02:32:09,390
so,
so they become obsolete across time.

2735
02:32:09,391 --> 02:32:10,224
But worse than that,
there are situations where if you apply 

2736
02:32:12,781 --> 02:32:13,890
both,
they conflict.

2737
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:16,050
So then what do you do?
Well,

2738
02:32:16,051 --> 02:32:18,710
the answer is you pay attention.
You know,

2739
02:32:18,711 --> 02:32:21,720
you pay attention because you have to 
mediate between the conflict.

2740
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:22,793
Well,
horace is also the thing that mediates 

2741
02:32:23,731 --> 02:32:24,564
between the conflicts.
And that's partly why in the 

2742
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:28,104
Mesopotamian story you have Marduk.
And one of the things that Martech 

2743
02:32:31,501 --> 02:32:33,900
demands when he's elevated to the 
highest position,

2744
02:32:34,080 --> 02:32:34,651
which is,
you know,

2745
02:32:34,651 --> 02:32:36,570
so that makes him ruler of all the gods.

2746
02:32:36,570 --> 02:32:38,580
And you can think about those as,
you know,

2747
02:32:38,610 --> 02:32:41,010
integro motivational forces are 
principles.

2748
02:32:41,430 --> 02:32:42,263
He gets the tablet of destinies,
which means that what he represents is 

2749
02:32:45,631 --> 02:32:46,464
the thing that makes the decisions.
And that's often the decision between 

2750
02:32:49,081 --> 02:32:49,914
two rigid approaches to right and wrong.
And so you say a chaotic approach to 

2751
02:32:55,561 --> 02:32:57,900
right and wrong,
that's a catastrophe.

2752
02:32:58,710 --> 02:32:59,543
And then you say,
well you replaced that with a system of 

2753
02:33:00,931 --> 02:33:03,330
rules,
which is better,

2754
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:05,850
but the system of rules has two 
potential problems.

2755
02:33:05,851 --> 02:33:10,590
One is it will age and the other is that
it produces internal conflicts.

2756
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:11,813
So then you need a third principle.
And the third principle to me seems to 

2757
02:33:14,851 --> 02:33:16,860
be what the Egyptians represented with 
horace.

2758
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:18,383
And then you get into a car,
you get into a communicative dialogue 

2759
02:33:21,270 --> 02:33:22,103
between the horace factor,
which is attention and the culture like 

2760
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:26,983
this.
They mutually inform one another and 

2761
02:33:28,141 --> 02:33:33,090
that keeps things structured but also 
flexible enough to adapt across time.

2762
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:36,270
And then the system has to build in 
recognition for that.

2763
02:33:36,271 --> 02:33:38,670
And that's where I think the idea of 
individual rights comes from.

2764
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:41,670
It's like you have an individual,
right?

2765
02:33:41,671 --> 02:33:42,504
Because you are a necessary player in 
the process that keeps the forces of 

2766
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:48,113
order and chaos balanced across time.
And if you're shutdown or oppressed or 

2767
02:33:51,511 --> 02:33:55,800
not allowed to speak,
then the society denies itself,

2768
02:33:55,801 --> 02:33:59,730
that corrected action and the correct of
micro corrections say,

2769
02:33:59,970 --> 02:34:00,803
and then what happens is it gets more 
and more and more rigid and more 

2770
02:34:02,581 --> 02:34:03,414
tyrannical because people have to 
falsify their experience to adhere to 

2771
02:34:06,421 --> 02:34:07,254
it.
And then the bloody thing collapses 

2772
02:34:08,491 --> 02:34:11,100
precipitously.
And that's what happened with the Soviet

2773
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:11,933
Union.
So you either make micro corrections or 

2774
02:34:15,721 --> 02:34:17,830
you accumulate error

2775
02:34:18,280 --> 02:34:19,840
and collapsed.
And I think that,

2776
02:34:20,240 --> 02:34:21,910
so when I looked at that 
psychologically,

2777
02:34:21,911 --> 02:34:22,744
and I think,
I think the way that people do that in 

2778
02:34:24,581 --> 02:34:25,414
their own life is that they adjust their
own psyches with micro corrections and 

2779
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:30,574
then they communicate about freely.
And then that's enough to keep the 

2780
02:34:34,091 --> 02:34:37,450
society dynamic.
But you have to let people speak.

2781
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:40,630
So that's why the,
you know,

2782
02:34:40,631 --> 02:34:41,464
freedom of speech is a critical 
characteristic of modern democratic 

2783
02:34:45,011 --> 02:34:45,844
states.
It's like it doesn't matter what the 

2784
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:48,970
person says,
it's irrelevant whether they're right or

2785
02:34:48,971 --> 02:34:51,160
wrong.
It doesn't matter if they're offensive,

2786
02:34:51,370 --> 02:34:53,410
it's not the point.
The point is,

2787
02:34:53,411 --> 02:34:54,244
is that you have to let the chatter 
emerge so that you can sort the wheat 

2788
02:34:58,361 --> 02:35:00,940
from the chaff.
And if you suppress it,

2789
02:35:00,941 --> 02:35:03,340
then the error correction mechanism goes
away.

2790
02:35:08,510 --> 02:35:10,580
Let's take the lid off political 
correctness.

2791
02:35:12,970 --> 02:35:15,880
There's absolutely no doubt about that.
I was looking today,

2792
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:18,730
they just fired a professor at Marquette
University.

2793
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:19,481
Yeah.
Okay.

2794
02:35:19,481 --> 02:35:22,050
So what
was it,

2795
02:35:22,051 --> 02:35:23,680
mark hat?
It was a marquette.

2796
02:35:24,230 --> 02:35:25,540
Okay.
So what this guy did,

2797
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,400
he's,
he's a self proclaimed conservative.

2798
02:35:27,401 --> 02:35:30,880
He has a blog and he,
he,

2799
02:35:30,881 --> 02:35:32,050
uh,
uh,

2800
02:35:32,051 --> 02:35:32,884
ta was teaching a course where the idea 
of gay marriage came up and a student 

2801
02:35:36,821 --> 02:35:40,600
approached her afterwards and said that 
he had opposed gay marriage and she said

2802
02:35:40,601 --> 02:35:41,434
there wasn't something like there wasn't
going to be any discussion of that in 

2803
02:35:43,241 --> 02:35:44,110
her class.
And,

2804
02:35:44,530 --> 02:35:47,680
and he recorded that and then that was 
released.

2805
02:35:47,681 --> 02:35:50,180
And then this character,
um,

2806
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:53,530
wrote a blog and criticized the graduate
student for,

2807
02:35:53,670 --> 02:35:55,780
for not letting this guy speak.
Okay.

2808
02:35:55,810 --> 02:35:59,650
So far.
So you can read the blog.

2809
02:36:00,070 --> 02:36:03,040
That caused quite a lot of trouble and 
eventually he got fired.

2810
02:36:03,220 --> 02:36:04,053
Okay.
So fine.

2811
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:06,670
Whatever.
I read opinions on both sides.

2812
02:36:06,671 --> 02:36:09,940
You know that the conservative critic 
said,

2813
02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:10,803
uh,
this is just another case of someone 

2814
02:36:11,591 --> 02:36:12,424
being hounded out of his job.
And the people on the left said he 

2815
02:36:15,701 --> 02:36:19,420
misused his position of authority to go 
after this graduate student in public.

2816
02:36:19,421 --> 02:36:20,254
And that wasn't due process.
And so it wasn't his opinions that got 

2817
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:26,290
him fired.
It was his failure to observe university

2818
02:36:26,291 --> 02:36:27,280
regulations.
So fine,

2819
02:36:27,281 --> 02:36:28,114
whatever,
something can be said on both sides of 

2820
02:36:29,441 --> 02:36:32,110
the argument.
But then I looked at the comments,

2821
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:36,340
well,
20 to one they were,

2822
02:36:36,430 --> 02:36:39,790
this is why we're voting for trump.
Yeah.

2823
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:41,283
Yeah.
And I do believe that because trump has 

2824
02:36:42,341 --> 02:36:45,910
disagreeable,
and that means he'll say anything.

2825
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:48,310
He'll shoot off his mouth,
he'll say anything.

2826
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:50,350
And the thing is,
people don't care what he says.

2827
02:36:50,710 --> 02:36:52,810
What they care about is that he'll say 
anything.

2828
02:36:53,260 --> 02:36:56,800
That's what they're going after.
And they definitely see that as a,

2829
02:36:58,440 --> 02:36:59,273
uh,
a gesture of hostility towards the PC 

2830
02:37:02,801 --> 02:37:04,870
left.
They say that.

2831
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:07,810
So the problem is,
is,

2832
02:37:07,811 --> 02:37:09,730
you know,
when you,

2833
02:37:11,560 --> 02:37:14,350
extremism always calls the devils out of
the closet.

2834
02:37:14,770 --> 02:37:16,760
So if you move too far to the left in 
any way,

2835
02:37:16,761 --> 02:37:17,594
you Carl,
the demons of the right out and vice 

2836
02:37:19,491 --> 02:37:21,230
versa.
It's a psychological principle.

2837
02:37:21,231 --> 02:37:24,020
It happens within people's character.
So

2838
02:37:25,530 --> 02:37:25,980
you know,
I,

2839
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:26,813
I was privy to a,
a line of communication between a bunch 

2840
02:37:31,561 --> 02:37:33,450
of people who,
who weren't poor,

2841
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:35,670
white trash,
so to speak.

2842
02:37:36,300 --> 02:37:37,980
You know,
the stereotypical trump's supporter.

2843
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:38,833
These people were well ensconced in the 
middle and upper middle class and 

2844
02:37:41,821 --> 02:37:42,654
virtually,
and they were almost all men virtually 

2845
02:37:43,981 --> 02:37:46,590
to a man.
They said something like,

2846
02:37:46,591 --> 02:37:48,390
the system is so raw and we're going to 
bring it down.

2847
02:37:48,720 --> 02:37:49,553
And I thought,
really that's what you guys are 

2848
02:37:50,941 --> 02:37:54,960
thinking.
You're that reactively angry.

2849
02:37:55,560 --> 02:38:00,560
And
you know,

2850
02:38:03,311 --> 02:38:08,311
if you're in a marriage shape and then 
you refuse to let your partner speak for

2851
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:09,453
decades,

2852
02:38:10,810 --> 02:38:11,643
you body bit well better be careful with
make decided to speak because you're 

2853
02:38:14,591 --> 02:38:15,424
going to come home one day.
I used to tell this children's story in 

2854
02:38:17,321 --> 02:38:18,154
this class about a guy who there's a 
little dragon in the house and it's 

2855
02:38:20,861 --> 02:38:23,440
ignored by everyone and it eventually 
runs away with the house.

2856
02:38:23,441 --> 02:38:26,140
And so Mr Bixby,
who's the head of the household,

2857
02:38:26,141 --> 02:38:30,640
the guy who's all working comes home and
his house is gone and he's surprised the

2858
02:38:30,641 --> 02:38:32,710
house is gone.
He asked the neighbors where it went.

2859
02:38:32,711 --> 02:38:35,170
And you know,
the basic story is something like,

2860
02:38:35,171 --> 02:38:37,600
well there was something not going on so
good in that house.

2861
02:38:37,601 --> 02:38:40,300
And people ignored it and got bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

2862
02:38:40,301 --> 02:38:41,134
It's finally it ran away with his house.
Well that happens to people all the 

2863
02:38:43,481 --> 02:38:44,314
time.
They come home and their partner has 

2864
02:38:45,401 --> 02:38:47,050
packed up taking the kids and left.

2865
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:48,610
It's like,
I didn't see that coming.

2866
02:38:48,880 --> 02:38:51,560
It's like see is the right word.
You know,

2867
02:38:51,570 --> 02:38:54,850
what did you have a million warnings?
Likely,

2868
02:38:55,180 --> 02:38:55,631
you know,
now,

2869
02:38:55,631 --> 02:38:56,464
now and then someone gets screwed.
They're married to someone who's 

2870
02:38:57,971 --> 02:39:01,660
psychopathic and you know,
they're just doomed from the start.

2871
02:39:02,050 --> 02:39:02,883
But generally it's not that.
It's the accumulation of a million 

2872
02:39:05,111 --> 02:39:08,890
unsolved on had arguments and finally it
explodes.

2873
02:39:09,430 --> 02:39:12,130
And that's what happens when you 
suppress free speech.

2874
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:13,643
The the,
for the reason you support free speech 

2875
02:39:15,911 --> 02:39:19,210
is not because people,
it's not even because it isn't.

2876
02:39:19,211 --> 02:39:22,510
Because people have a right to be heard.
That isn't a dig it exactly.

2877
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:24,513
It's the people have a right to be 
stupid and ignorant and you need to 

2878
02:39:27,161 --> 02:39:30,850
listen to them because then you know 
where the stupid and ignorant people are

2879
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:33,730
and you can,
you can have a discussion with them.

2880
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:37,030
Instead they feel oppressed and they go,
hi,

2881
02:39:37,390 --> 02:39:40,810
and then that's not good.
That is not good.

2882
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:42,400
Because they can say,
well,

2883
02:39:42,401 --> 02:39:43,234
we're all pressed.
And that justifies their stupidity and 

2884
02:39:45,701 --> 02:39:47,740
ignorance and it's like they are 
oppressed.

2885
02:39:48,160 --> 02:39:50,290
Whether that justifies their stupidity 
ignorance,

2886
02:39:50,291 --> 02:39:51,124
it's a whole different question.
But you don't stop destructive morons 

2887
02:39:55,811 --> 02:39:59,440
from talking ever.
Because the fact that you don't let them

2888
02:39:59,441 --> 02:40:01,540
talk doesn't mean that what they think 
goes away.

2889
02:40:01,690 --> 02:40:03,490
Plus you don't have a chance to confront
them.

2890
02:40:04,390 --> 02:40:05,223
So

2891
02:40:06,480 --> 02:40:11,480
anyways,
we'll,

2892
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:13,980
we'll finish up

2893
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,500
on this next week.
But here's the central idea.

2894
02:40:20,250 --> 02:40:23,610
People have an ethical responsibility to
embody horace,

2895
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:24,473
let's say,
because we can take it out of the 

2896
02:40:25,531 --> 02:40:26,364
religious context that way.
Because like none of you guys are 

2897
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:29,910
ancient Egypt worshipers,
right?

2898
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:32,040
So it's,
it's irrelevant from a,

2899
02:40:32,220 --> 02:40:33,053
from a cultural perspective.
But what the Egyptians carefully laid 

2900
02:40:35,491 --> 02:40:40,260
out was the idea that it's the,
it's the force that pays attention,

2901
02:40:40,500 --> 02:40:44,970
especially to corruption and evil that 
revivified as the state at its own risk.

2902
02:40:44,971 --> 02:40:47,160
Because of course horse loses nine and 
the conflict,

2903
02:40:47,161 --> 02:40:47,994
it's,
there's never any indication that the z 

2904
02:40:49,410 --> 02:40:51,690
easy,
you put yourself at risk to do it,

2905
02:40:52,440 --> 02:40:53,273
but the risk you avoid by doing it is 
the ultimate degeneration of everything 

2906
02:40:56,281 --> 02:40:57,114
into hell.
So there's a risk to be taken to say 

2907
02:40:59,821 --> 02:41:02,970
what you think,
but it's a moral obligation.

2908
02:41:02,971 --> 02:41:06,870
And the consequence of not doing it is 
that the system deteriorates into hell.

2909
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:07,831
And you might say,
well,

2910
02:41:07,831 --> 02:41:11,640
is that prove it?
Okay fine,

2911
02:41:11,700 --> 02:41:12,533
it's approved.
That's what happened in the communist 

2912
02:41:13,891 --> 02:41:15,720
countries.
And the documentation is,

2913
02:41:16,080 --> 02:41:16,913
it's so clear that the formal rat,
there are many who are form were former 

2914
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:22,823
Lee radical lefties and communists in 
France who have written a book saying 

2915
02:41:28,021 --> 02:41:28,854
that it's true.
So you know when you completely convert 

2916
02:41:31,890 --> 02:41:34,380
reconvert the converted,
you have to think,

2917
02:41:34,381 --> 02:41:35,214
well maybe there's some power to that.
And Social Net since basic point 

2918
02:41:37,561 --> 02:41:41,230
continually was there's no way the 
Soviet system could,

2919
02:41:41,231 --> 02:41:42,064
it kept its talons in people if they 
would've refused to lie and the lies 

2920
02:41:45,031 --> 02:41:48,540
were always,
you'll face this in the workplace,

2921
02:41:48,541 --> 02:41:49,374
you wait and see it's going to come.
Because what'll happen is someone will 

2922
02:41:52,051 --> 02:41:54,450
come and there'll be a bit of a bully 
and they'll come to you and they'll say,

2923
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:56,850
well,
how about if you do this work and you'll

2924
02:41:56,851 --> 02:41:58,410
think,
hey renee,

2925
02:41:58,411 --> 02:42:01,590
that's your work and it's not kosher 
that you're giving it to me,

2926
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:02,700
but you won't say anything.

2927
02:42:02,700 --> 02:42:03,690
You'll say,
okay,

2928
02:42:03,720 --> 02:42:04,471
because you'll think,
well,

2929
02:42:04,471 --> 02:42:06,240
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It's like,

2930
02:42:06,570 --> 02:42:07,530
Hey,
no problem,

2931
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:09,660
but the next time that we're comes your 
way,

2932
02:42:09,690 --> 02:42:10,523
you can just remember that you 
facilitated that process because you 

2933
02:42:12,541 --> 02:42:13,374
didn't say anything to begin with.
And when you get your 10000th piece of 

2934
02:42:16,081 --> 02:42:18,660
work and you're crushed right over and 
you think,

2935
02:42:18,661 --> 02:42:19,494
why is the system so damn corrupt?
You might remember that you opened the 

2936
02:42:23,221 --> 02:42:27,220
door this much with your first response 
and people do that all the time and it's

2937
02:42:27,221 --> 02:42:28,054
a,
it's a minor falsification of their 

2938
02:42:29,431 --> 02:42:32,190
experience.
And one of the things I've learned about

2939
02:42:32,191 --> 02:42:33,024
that,
and you can think about this as a good 

2940
02:42:34,081 --> 02:42:37,500
guide.
If you're resentful about something,

2941
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:42,330
you're either immature or you have 
something to say.

2942
02:42:43,080 --> 02:42:44,790
If you're immature,
well then you should grow up,

2943
02:42:44,820 --> 02:42:47,310
you know?
But if you have something to say,

2944
02:42:48,240 --> 02:42:49,073
you should say it because the pathology 
of the system has manifested itself 

2945
02:42:53,671 --> 02:42:55,380
within the domain of your experience.

2946
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:58,500
It's right there in front of you and 
it's only gone,

2947
02:42:59,130 --> 02:43:02,070
it's only tilted just this micro tilt,
you know,

2948
02:43:02,080 --> 02:43:04,110
off kilter.
And you might think,

2949
02:43:04,111 --> 02:43:04,944
well,
I'm not going to make a fuss out of 

2950
02:43:05,740 --> 02:43:07,740
because of other that because it's so 
little.

2951
02:43:07,890 --> 02:43:12,700
It's like there's a book called ordinary
Germans,

2952
02:43:13,270 --> 02:43:14,320
ordinary man,
sorry.

2953
02:43:14,410 --> 02:43:15,243
It's a famous book and it's a story 
about this troupe of German policemen 

2954
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:20,853
who are taken to Poland once the Germans
had marched through and they were 

2955
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:26,800
birdwalk guys all race before Hitler 
came to power.

2956
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:27,903
Just,
I think you could just think about them 

2957
02:43:29,381 --> 02:43:32,080
as middleclass suburbanites that's 
basically who they were.

2958
02:43:32,230 --> 02:43:34,170
You know,
average gums.

2959
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:38,680
Okay.
Banded up by taking naked women out into

2960
02:43:38,681 --> 02:43:41,380
the field who are pregnant,
shooting them in the back of the head.

2961
02:43:41,950 --> 02:43:42,970
And so you think,
wow,

2962
02:43:42,971 --> 02:43:43,804
how does that happen?
And the answer is one tiny little step 

2963
02:43:46,901 --> 02:43:47,710
at a time.

2964
02:43:47,710 --> 02:43:48,543
And this is well documented in the book 
because the guy who wrote the book was 

2965
02:43:51,941 --> 02:43:52,631
curious.
It's like,

2966
02:43:52,631 --> 02:43:56,320
well how do you take ordinary people who
in principle are no worse or better than

2967
02:43:56,321 --> 02:43:59,770
anyone else and get them to commit 
unbearable atrocities.

2968
02:43:59,980 --> 02:44:03,430
And then he walks you through it.
It's like they're asked to do x.

2969
02:44:03,431 --> 02:44:04,240
And they say,
okay.

2970
02:44:04,240 --> 02:44:06,610
And then they're asked to do x plus one 
and they say,

2971
02:44:06,611 --> 02:44:08,530
okay.
And they were asked to do x plus two and

2972
02:44:08,531 --> 02:44:09,364
they say,
okay.

2973
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:10,323
And by the time they're an x plus a 
hundred things are looking pretty 

2974
02:44:13,151 --> 02:44:15,310
dismal.
And it's getting hard to step back,

2975
02:44:15,490 --> 02:44:16,323
you know?
And then then the descent instead of 

2976
02:44:18,401 --> 02:44:19,960
being like,
this goes like this,

2977
02:44:20,020 --> 02:44:22,480
and there's no bottom,
there's absolutely no bottom.

2978
02:44:23,440 --> 02:44:25,390
And so the trick is to nip it in the 
bud.

2979
02:44:25,420 --> 02:44:28,300
And the way you do that is by being 
very,

2980
02:44:28,301 --> 02:44:29,134
very careful about what you say.
And then when something is not going 

2981
02:44:31,451 --> 02:44:32,284
right and you know it,
you have to say something and you might 

2982
02:44:35,231 --> 02:44:36,520
say,
well maybe I'll get fired.

2983
02:44:37,090 --> 02:44:37,923
And I would say,
how the hell do you know that's not the 

2984
02:44:39,191 --> 02:44:41,620
best thing that could happen to you.
You know?

2985
02:44:41,621 --> 02:44:44,620
Cause if you're in a system that will 
not take your feedback when you're being

2986
02:44:44,621 --> 02:44:45,454
reasonable,
then you're in a nascent tyranny and it 

2987
02:44:47,651 --> 02:44:48,484
could be easily the best thing that ever
happened to you to get out of there 

2988
02:44:50,531 --> 02:44:52,030
before you're crushed.
Completely.

2989
02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:53,403
So,

2990
02:44:55,860 --> 02:44:56,520
so,
you know,

2991
02:44:56,520 --> 02:44:57,353
the most sophisticated political 
philosophers of the 20th century in my 

2992
02:45:00,031 --> 02:45:00,864
estimation,
came to the conclusion that the reason 

2993
02:45:02,371 --> 02:45:05,730
that horrific genocidal crimes take 
places because ordinary people lie.

2994
02:45:07,410 --> 02:45:11,100
And that's a radical conclusion.
But

2995
02:45:12,750 --> 02:45:14,850
a,
how could it be any different?

2996
02:45:15,750 --> 02:45:17,910
I mean,
if people start,

2997
02:45:18,870 --> 02:45:23,700
if people let the system deteriorate by 
not opposing it when it does,

2998
02:45:25,170 --> 02:45:27,030
how could things end up being different 
than that?

2999
02:45:31,490 --> 02:45:32,590
Then I would say,
well,

3000
02:45:33,370 --> 02:45:36,320
that maps perfectly onto classical 
religious ideas.

3001
02:45:36,321 --> 02:45:37,360
So let's,
we could say,

3002
02:45:37,420 --> 02:45:38,950
talk about horace and we could talk 
about,

3003
02:45:38,990 --> 02:45:40,540
uh,
a martyr.

3004
02:45:41,140 --> 02:45:44,710
But the idea of logos that's underlying 
Christianity is exactly the same thing.

3005
02:45:44,711 --> 02:45:47,590
Because what logos basically means is 
truthful communication.

3006
02:45:47,770 --> 02:45:48,603
That's what it means.
And that's the thing that in the Judeo 

3007
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:52,623
Christian tradition,
identify as people with the part of God 

3008
02:45:55,421 --> 02:45:57,890
that creates order out of chaos.
It's,

3009
02:45:58,350 --> 02:46:01,480
it's,
it's laid out clearly in the theology.

3010
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:03,580
And the other part that goes along with 
that,

3011
02:46:03,581 --> 02:46:07,390
and this is where the story,
because the story rolls to a conclusion,

3012
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:09,890
is that if you manifest

3013
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:13,610
the logos,
you end up being crucified and reborn.

3014
02:46:14,060 --> 02:46:14,893
But in principle,
that can happen in small enough way so 

3015
02:46:18,561 --> 02:46:21,350
that it doesn't actually have to happen.
You know,

3016
02:46:21,351 --> 02:46:22,880
because if you learn something,
you know,

3017
02:46:22,930 --> 02:46:24,950
if something,
if something's bothering you,

3018
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:27,170
it's bothering you need to take it 
through.

3019
02:46:27,620 --> 02:46:28,453
What inevitably happens is that as you 
think it through and incorporate the 

3020
02:46:31,041 --> 02:46:34,940
information,
all presuppositions are forced to die.

3021
02:46:35,090 --> 02:46:35,923
And that's painful.
It's hard on people because you have to 

3022
02:46:37,401 --> 02:46:39,870
reexamine your principles.
You know,

3023
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:44,030
at a high resolution level or a broad 
level part of you is going to die,

3024
02:46:44,031 --> 02:46:44,864
especially if you need a radical change.
But maybe if you let the part die and 

3025
02:46:48,411 --> 02:46:51,440
revivified,
then the whole doesn't have to die.

3026
02:46:51,800 --> 02:46:52,633
And I think that that scale,
it's like it works within the 

3027
02:46:55,311 --> 02:46:56,144
personality,
but it also works within the 

3028
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:01,820
personalities organized into a 
hierarchical state.

3029
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:02,833
If you don't allow that
death and resurrection process to occur 

3030
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,893
and you suppress it enough,
the whole state has to die and then you 

3031
02:47:12,531 --> 02:47:13,364
know,
the probability that that's going to 

3032
02:47:14,211 --> 02:47:16,520
take everyone with it is very,
very high.

3033
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:19,220
So that seems like a bad long term 
outcome.

3034
02:47:20,390 --> 02:47:21,223
Well.
