1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,310
No,
I want to tell you a story now

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:09,210
and it has these characters in it
and so this is a very important story.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,323
It's called the Enuma elish and it's the
Mesopotamian creation myth and it's 

4
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:19,830
important for a bunch of reasons.
First of all,

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:21,540
it's the oldest written story we know 
of,

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,890
but it's also a Middle Eastern story and
the whole,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,273
all the abrahamic religions emerged out 
of the Middle East and so it's a 

8
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:34,974
foundational story.
It's a story that sits at the bottom of 

9
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,840
our culture now.
It has.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,400
It has similarities to the creation 
story in genesis,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,010
whether the creation story in genesis 
was derived from it or whether there was

12
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:50,844
a whole variety of similar stories 
floating around in the Middle East and 

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,780
at the same time that we're very.
It's a theme we don't really know,

14
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,340
but it doesn't really.
I don't think it really matters.

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,133
We don't know how old the story is.
We know how old it is and it's written 

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,700
form.
It's,

17
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,653
it's,
it's thousands of years old and it's 

18
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,560
written for them.
Maybe it's 10,000 years old.

19
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,930
It's written for him,
but probably not.

20
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:18,764
It's probably more like 5,000 years old,
but the thing is is that a 5,000 year 

21
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:26,990
old story is a lot that's written is way
older than 5,000 years.

22
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:27,824
Like we're used to being in an 
environment where there's a million 

23
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,330
stories,
you know,

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,210
because we have books and movies and all
of these things,

25
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:36,044
but you know,
in slower moving and more archaic 

26
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,283
cultures,
especially ones that are just just have 

27
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:43,550
an oral tradition.
It's not like there's a million stories.

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,760
There's like 20 canonical stories and 
God only knows how old they are.

29
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,740
There was evidence,
linguistic evidence.

30
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,574
I just saw a study on this last week.
Someone sent it to me showing that some 

31
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,763
of the fairytales that the grimm 
brothers gathered might be 10,000 years 

32
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:06,401
old and that doesn't surprise me because
the kind of depth that's in a good fairy

33
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:07,814
tale is so the depth is so.
The profundity is so deep that there's 

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,170
no way that someone could just 
contracted up,

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,290
you know,
100 years ago.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,163
Because there's layers and layers and 
layers of meaning and they're basically 

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,760
archetipal and religious in 
significance.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,020
And a Hansel and Gretel story is a good 
example of that.

39
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,500
Um,
and sleeping beauty is a good example of

40
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,510
that too.
A lot of the canonical fairytales are,

41
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:33,950
they're very,
very powerful.

42
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,050
They pack a lot of meaning into a very 
short

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,950
and do a very limited amount of time.
So,

44
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:48,310
so it was great that this was an arrest 
and it was only unearthed in the late 18

45
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,550
hundreds.
So we haven't known about this story for

46
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:52,660
a long,
long time.

47
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,480
And so it's,
it was a tremendously exciting discovery

48
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:57,670
on the part of the people who,
who dug it up.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,510
So I'm going to tell you the.
So

50
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,763
the primary character in the story is a,
like a dragon mother named tire mount 

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,713
and tire map.
You could think about or as half the 

52
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,670
dragon of chaos and half the destructive
creative feminine.

53
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:20,504
So she,
you can think about her as what sort of 

54
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:26,060
on the border between what's a known 
known and unknown and unknown.

55
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,840
And she is construed as the mother of 
all things.

56
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Now
the mother of all things is like,

57
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,870
what was it revealed when the towers 
came down?

58
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,423
Is this tremendously complex background,
multilevel system of operations that's 

59
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:49,351
always going on that that identifiable 
singular things emerged from now.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,413
The mesopotamians wouldn't have said 
that because what they said was this 

61
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:55,864
story because that's the form in which 
their knowledge it had developed to the 

62
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:00,754
point where they could tell a story 
about it instead of maybe acting it out 

63
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,410
or dreaming about it in some sense,
you know,

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,740
but they couldn't articulate it.
We can barely articulate it now,

65
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,340
so there's time out.
She's viewed as the mother of all things

66
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,710
and she has a husband named app suit 
who's her concert.

67
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,660
Very little said about absolut in this 
particular story,

68
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
and I think the reason for that,
although I'm not sure if this is that 

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,600
the Mesopotamian civilization was new 
enough as a technological state,

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,733
let's say,
because they made cities as a 

71
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:35,911
technological state that the mint,
the myths of humanity hadn't figured out

72
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,500
how to encapsulate the nature of the,
of our technological

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,073
dominance hierarchy.

74
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,583
There was a sense that it existed,
but there wasn't a sense of it as a 

75
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:49,764
carrot differentiated character that was
capable of doing all sorts of different 

76
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,870
things.
I think that didn't emerge until Egypt,

77
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,870
although I'm not certain of that,
but that's how it looks to me.

78
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,123
So absolute is her husband now,
the way the Mesopotamian started with 

79
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,700
the world,
and this is the same way that the people

80
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:09,690
who wrote genesis started the world.
They thought that the world was a desk.

81
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,290
You know what the world's like when you 
go outside and you stand in a field,

82
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,880
it's a flat field.
You look at the world,

83
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,714
it's pretty obvious what it is.
It's a big disk of earth and then 

84
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:19,104
there's a dome on top of it and in the 
dome or the Sun and the moon and the 

85
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:23,700
stars.
And then you might ask,

86
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:24,990
well,
what's underneath the earth?

87
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,780
And that the answer for the 
Mesopotamians was um,

88
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,230
fresh water first and then sold water.
And how did you know that?

89
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,340
Well,
if you drilled down,

90
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,213
then the fresh water would come.
So obviously it was fresh water down 

91
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:37,020
there.
And then if you went to the edge of your

92
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:37,854
territory,
it's like,

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
well,
there's the salt water.

94
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,970
So the earth was,
you know,

95
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,340
let the,
the earth,

96
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,670
roughly speaking,
was it disk of matter,

97
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:51,350
resting on a disk of fresh water,
resting on a disk of salt,

98
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:56,351
water and absolute time at were the 
fresh and salt water respect.

99
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,980
Okay.
And now the Mesopotamians thought that

100
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,553
the way that the,
that absolutely time that gave birth to 

101
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:09,290
everything was that they joined together
in sexual union.

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,950
It's like the Yin and the Yang and it's 
very much like that in fact,

103
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,250
and that it was out of their union that 
the,

104
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,443
the elemental God's emerged and I think 
you can think of the elemental gods as 

105
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,970
there are forces of nature and they're 
viewed through.

106
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,523
They're not personified because to 
personify something means that you see 

107
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:35,270
it as an objective phenomena and then 
attribute human characteristics to it.

108
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,104
And that isn't how people work.
What happens is we perceive human 

109
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:39,494
characteristics and then only with trip 
terrible effort do we extract out the 

110
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:44,774
objective reality from that.
So we depersonalize things when we 

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,574
become scientific,
but we just naturally see them as 

112
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,440
characters.
And you can see this when you read books

113
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,131
to kids,
you know,

114
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,964
like everything's a person that train is
a person in a car as a person that moon 

115
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,870
is a person and the sun is a person and 
you know,

116
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:07,190
you read stories to children that have 
that as a presupposition,

117
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:08,430
doesn't bother you at all,
you know,

118
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,264
you,
you can just fall right into it with no 

119
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,140
problem,
you know,

120
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,983
and in the automation is you see the sun
in the sky smiling and bouncing along 

121
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,280
and it doesn't bother you,
you know,

122
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,193
it's,
it's no problem to look at the world 

123
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:19,304
that way and there's some utility in 
looking at the world in that way as as 

124
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,724
we'll discover.

125
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,793
So anyways,
and I think part of the reason that we 

126
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:27,290
view things that way.
Oh yeah.

127
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,620
That was the other thing I wanted to 
tell you about our perceptual systems is

128
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:35,300
that we,
we do have a social cognitive platform,

129
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,140
intellectual platform,
which means that our primary categories,

130
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:42,080
the primary categories of our mind do 
seem to be social.

131
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,860
So you could say that the reason our 
mind evolved,

132
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,723
or no,
you could say that the fundamental 

133
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:53,291
selecting pressures on our,
on our mind ensured that the,

134
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,050
the primary substructure of our 
cognitive ability was modules that could

135
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:04,490
understand social behavior.
Men could understand,

136
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,350
women,
women could understand men,

137
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,780
men and women could understand children,
children,

138
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:10,850
men and women could understand the 
social world.

139
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,350
And that's,
and that's,

140
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,490
that's what we're specialized for.
And then it was only after those systems

141
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,350
developed,
hyper developed probably under the,

142
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,410
uh,
under the force of sexual selection that

143
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,244
they became able to separate themselves 
to some degree from that underlying 

144
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,204
social cognitive structure and start to 
see the world in ways that weren't 

145
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,073
personified.

146
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,573
So,
but what that means is that our natural 

147
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:40,310
categories are still an anthropomorphic 
and dramatic,

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,010
and it actually turns out that they 
work.

149
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,363
So absolute timeout nature and culture 
is a perfectly reasonable way of 

150
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,420
thinking about them.
Now they would say,

151
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,254
well,
it's the interplay between nature and 

152
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,930
culture that gives rise to the 
primordial forces of nature.

153
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,823
Now,
those forces of nature would be to some 

154
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:02,880
degree external,
like a storm or fire.

155
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,670
But they would be some to some degree 
internal to like,

156
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,070
like the fire of passion,
right?

157
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,071
And the and the storm of swirl because 
those are natural forces as well.

158
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,363
And one of the things that the ancients 
knew was that man was created to serve 

159
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:19,314
the gods.
And of course modern people think of 

160
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,374
that as a superstition.
But that's because they don't really 

161
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:27,000
understand how archaic people thought.
Archaic people thought.

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,790
Like Freud thought it was like,
yeah,

163
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:31,830
yeah,
you have an ego fine.

164
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,664
You know,
and as long as you're in a box within a 

165
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,090
bunch of other blocks is the eagle runs 
things.

166
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,780
But as soon as we put you somewhere 
where those boxes are gone,

167
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,640
it's the underlying forces of nature 
that run you hunger,

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,990
thirst,
you know,

169
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:46,943
aggression,
sexuality and all those things that are 

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,813
impersonal.
Because of course you have them and you 

171
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,880
have them.
And so does everyone else.

172
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:57,600
So they're impersonal and transcendent 
and they're also eternal.

173
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,490
And so when the art arcade people said,
and they usually said this with sorrow,

174
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:07,320
that man was destined to serve the gods.
That's what they meant.

175
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,183
They meant that we were the play.
Things have these unbelievably powerful 

176
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,074
primordial forces that manifested 
themselves within our lives and 

177
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,530
determined our destinies and in in,
in,

178
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:21,900
in fact the Mesopotamian said that 
specifically about the elder gods.

179
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,733
They said they were.
They were part of that which determined 

180
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,484
human destiny.
They monitor who will talk about in a 

181
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:32,400
while and was given the tablet of 
destinies because when he was,

182
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,590
when he asked to become top God,
he said,

183
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,820
well,
if I'm going to be taught God,

184
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,040
I get to determine the destinies and 
well,

185
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,830
we'll get to that.
So you,

186
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,570
you kind of got to know what these,
what these archaic,

187
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,390
God's work,
and they were personalities.

188
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,680
You know when you could say,
well,

189
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,181
yeah,
yeah,

190
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,950
maybe it's a mistake to attribute the 
qualities of personality to a storm.

191
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,350
Although it depends on what you think a 
storm is like.

192
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,393
A modern person would think of a storm 
as an objective event that you have 

193
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:02,754
subjective reactions to,
and our caring person would more likely 

194
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:10,641
think of the storm as the subjective 
consequences of the storm plus the storm

195
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,910
all at once.

196
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,743
They would make that separation,
so it's a lot easier to personify 

197
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,980
something under those conditions or not 
to personify it,

198
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,823
but to.
But to stay within the realm of 

199
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:24,780
conceptualization that makes it a 
persona.

200
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,673
Find Force.
So the storm God is something that you 

201
00:11:28,701 --> 00:11:30,900
know,
that can instill terror into your heart.

202
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,471
It's like,
well,

203
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,590
you know,
yeah,

204
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,790
fair enough.
You know?

205
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,710
All right,
so anyways,

206
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,544
absolutely time map.
They give rise to these primordial gods 

207
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,013
and I'm going to think about them as 
forces of nature and I think that's a 

208
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,950
reasonable representation for a variety 
of reasons.

209
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,070
They're like the titans.
All right,

210
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:55,904
so the given rise to these gods and the 
gods are their children and they run 

211
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:01,604
about making all sorts of rack.
They were making rockets and they're 

212
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:06,680
doing this and they're doing that and 
they're building things in there messing

213
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:07,514
about with things in their,
their noisily engaged in their 

214
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:11,024
interactions with one another and 
they're having children and they're 

215
00:12:12,681 --> 00:12:16,550
fighting about sex and they're just 
making racket like Matt and then they do

216
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:20,810
something stupid and so they're annoying
time as they make all this rocket.

217
00:12:20,811 --> 00:12:23,510
She's sorta slumbering down there in the
depths,

218
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,863
leaving them be,
but they make all this racket that may 

219
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,580
annoy her.
It's like it's the environmentalist myth

220
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,530
by the way.
It's exactly the same idea.

221
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,180
So you know,
human beings,

222
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,014
we're kind of dopey.
We're running around gratifying our 

223
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:37,804
fundamental needs and making racket and 
destroying things and if we're not 

224
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
careful,
mother nature will come flooding back 

225
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:45,100
and like wipe us out.
It was like,

226
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:45,740
yeah,
no,

227
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,350
that's happened in the past.
It could happen,

228
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,600
but it's an archetypal.
It's an archetypal idea.

229
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,803
It's a mythological idea so far and 
they're making racket and time that's 

230
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:57,190
leaving them be,
but then they get arrogant,

231
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,024
I would say,
or careless and they kill app suit and 

232
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,190
they make their dwelling place on his 
corpse.

233
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,770
Now that's a.
That is a brilliant,

234
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:08,470
brilliant symbolic idea because what it 
means,

235
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,990
it means a bunch of things,
but one of the things that means is that

236
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,160
in so far as the gods are because 
they're masculine,

237
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,313
they're part of the representation of 
the dominance hierarchy and the human 

238
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:22,000
interactions within it.
That the idea that that,

239
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,463
that that's all existing on the corpus 
of apps is something like the idea that 

240
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,490
all of the natural forces that are 
embodied within human beings and driving

241
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,324
them are resting on a substructure of 
dead culture and everyone knows that 

242
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:43,240
because everyone says,
especially modern people,

243
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,560
they look back at their culture and they
think,

244
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:45,550
oh,
that thing's dead.

245
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:46,943
You know,
and we can rest comfortably on its 

246
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,541
surface.
Well,

247
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,310
that's not right because if it's dead,

248
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,970
well,
if it's dead,

249
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,960
logically speaking,
it's not alive.

250
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,794
Then if it's not alive at can't adapt 
and if it doesn't adapt and it falls 

251
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:03,390
behind and gets full of errors and it 
gets corrupt and starts to fall apart,

252
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,373
and if it gets corrupted full of errors 
and falls apart enough than chaos comes 

253
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,544
back.
That's exactly what happens in the 

254
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:10,284
Mesopotamian myth.
So they kill app soon and they keep 

255
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:15,660
making racket and tie him at wakes up 
one day and she thinks,

256
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,790
oh,
they're noisy.

257
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,180
I don't like them that much and now 
they've gone and done in my husband,

258
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:24,570
which is order.
So I'm going to wait them out.

259
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,950
So the gods get wind of this and they're
not very happy about it,

260
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,660
you know,
because after all they're gone.

261
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,523
But she is the god goddess slash drag 
that gave them all life and the 

262
00:14:37,981 --> 00:14:42,390
probability that they'll prevail in a 
battle against that which gave them form

263
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:43,440
is very,
very low.

264
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
So they're pretty damn terrified.
So meanwhile time Matt is generating her

265
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:52,850
army and she generates quite an army and
Mesopotamians list out what she does.

266
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,670
She,
she first of all picks for her concert,

267
00:14:55,671 --> 00:15:00,671
a new character named king and king who 
is like the king of the demons monsters.

268
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,910
So her old husband was absolutely,
maybe he was ordered and her new husband

269
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:08,744
is like,
he's not someone that you want to have 

270
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,880
around at all.
And so he's basically put at the hand of

271
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,223
this flanks of terrible monsters and she
generates like Scorpion monsters and 

272
00:15:18,621 --> 00:15:19,454
crocodile monsters and all sorts of 
things in her army so that she can go 

273
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,540
wipe out these,
these gods.

274
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,853
And so while this is happening,
the gods gathered themselves together 

275
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,023
and they decided that they'll elect a 
champion from within their ranks to go 

276
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,110
out and fight with tire map.

277
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,333
And so they do that and they said one 
God out and he comes back with his tail 

278
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,210
between his legs,
roughly speaking,

279
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:39,050
all white,
don't lie,

280
00:15:39,051 --> 00:15:42,110
his encounter with chaos.
And then they send another God out.

281
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:44,120
The same thing happens and they send 
another God out.

282
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,003
The same thing happens and it's getting 
pretty damn hopeless because they're 

283
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,690
sending out their best men against chaos
and the,

284
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,763
and the mother of all things.
And they're getting struggled all the 

285
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:57,860
time
while this was happening.

286
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,440
They continue to produce new generations
of Gods.

287
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:02,600
And at one point this new God emerges 
as,

288
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,670
as a young person,
I presume.

289
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,240
Um,
but he's,

290
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,093
he's,
there's some things that are different 

291
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,880
than about him than any other thing 
that's being produced so far.

292
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,520
And one of the things that's different 
is he's,

293
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,870
he's quite tall and powerful.
So,

294
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,060
you know,
that's not necessarily so radical,

295
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,220
but he has eyes all the way around his 
head.

296
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,390
And when he speaks,
he can speak darkness into being,

297
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:24,224
any can speak light into being so,
so things obey the commands of his 

298
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,110
words.
So He's a master of language.

299
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,420
He can see everywhere and he's a master 
of language.

300
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,883
Okay?
And so the Guardian to checking him out 

301
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,181
and they think,
wow,

302
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:35,740
you know,
he's,

303
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:36,573
he's quite something,
maybe we can get him to go after time 

304
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:41,420
that.
So they all go to him in this,

305
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,010
in this little group and they say,
look,

306
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,660
Marduk,
because that's his name.

307
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,190
Um,
you know,

308
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:49,700
we've been checking you out and you're 
looking pretty impressive.

309
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:51,370
And so we've got a proposition for you.
I,

310
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:54,770
how about if you go fight time map and 
Marta,

311
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,800
who's not only all seeing and,
and very capable with languages,

312
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,950
no fool.
And he says,

313
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:01,521
yeah,
yeah,

314
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,900
yeah,
I get what you want,

315
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:03,734
but here's the deal.

316
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,010
You get everybody together first and all
go fight your monster,

317
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,100
but you're going to have a congress and 
add that Congress.

318
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:18,080
You're going to be king of the gods.
And then I'll go fight time map.

319
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,080
And so of course the other gods aren't 
very happy about this,

320
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,680
but they go off and they have a congress
and they invite mark to it and they talk

321
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:26,930
about it and they realize they don't 
really have any other choice.

322
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:30,710
So they decided that they're going to 
elect Marduk to the top of the hierarchy

323
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:34,220
of gods.
Now that's such a smart idea.

324
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,520
So if you think,
for example,

325
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,340
you can think of a hero and then you can
take,

326
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,520
if you took 10 heroes,
an average them out of that,

327
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,380
you get a a God,
right?

328
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,470
So it'd be 10 heroes.
You get Annetta here out of that,

329
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,470
and that would be a god.

330
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,770
And then maybe you do that to 10 sets of
10 heroes and you get 10 mega heroes and

331
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,930
then you take all those medical heroes 
and you figure out what's the same about

332
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:02,400
them and you abstract that out and then 
you get the hero of heroes of heroes.

333
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,980
And that's the archetype.
That's the archetype.

334
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,203
It's a process of distillation.
It's like who is the most interesting 

335
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:13,470
possible at the most interesting and 
capable possible person?

336
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,390
Well,
that would be this person.

337
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,210
This is the most memorable possible 
person.

338
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,920
Well,
we don't know who that is,

339
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:21,660
but this is how we figured out how I 
could say,

340
00:18:21,661 --> 00:18:22,494
well,
I admire something about you and I 

341
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:23,994
admire something about you.
I can notice that as a phenomenal 

342
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:26,894
logical fact.
You seem very capable in a certain way 

343
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,560
and you know you have this attribute,
and then I might say,

344
00:18:31,561 --> 00:18:33,450
well,
if I was gonna,

345
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,850
sort out an ideal for myself to follow,
then I take the good parts of all of you

346
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
and I put that into one thing and then I
would make that my ideal.

347
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,123
Well,
that's the origin of the idea of the 

348
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,834
savior of the Messiah,
is that it's an emergent idea emerges 

349
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,413
when people notice that the hero is the.
The hero is part of the forest that 

350
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,020
makes order out of chaos.
Or sometimes the reverse.

351
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:58,854
When when order has become too rigid,
it can also decompose order bringing a 

352
00:19:03,121 --> 00:19:06,000
little necessary chaos into it,
rejuvenate the whole structure.

353
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,820
So anyways,
so Marta,

354
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,570
he gets elected king.
Now you might think about how would this

355
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,270
happen historically speaking?
Well,

356
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,130
here's an interesting way of thinking 
about it,

357
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:20,580
so imagine a landscape that consists of 
tribes,

358
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,670
okay,
and then on top of them,

359
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,120
imagine a landscape of the imagination.
Okay,

360
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:27,954
so each member of each tribal group 
lives in their imagined world and that 

361
00:19:33,691 --> 00:19:34,524
imagined world is full of Dante's and 
natural forces of various kinds that 

362
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,544
they're following,
but then you can imagine that as the 

363
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:43,350
tribes battle it out and organize 
themselves,

364
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,590
the figures of the imagination do 
exactly the same thing.

365
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,520
So as the people are battling,
the Gods in heaven are battling,

366
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,354
which is also a very common mythology,
and as the human beings on a beat 

367
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,224
themselves into a functional group,
their world conceptions do the same 

368
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,634
thing.
And so over time you move from 

369
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,650
polytheism,
roughly speaking to monotheism as the,

370
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,610
the,
as all these tribes communicate with one

371
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:13,830
another in,
in language,

372
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:18,600
and in and in combat,
and sort out just exactly what should be

373
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,710
sovereign,
what should it be?

374
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,240
Powerful,
what should be dominant,

375
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,350
right?
It's a major,

376
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,510
it's a major issue and it's partly 
practical.

377
00:20:24,511 --> 00:20:29,040
It's partly conceptual.
So this is reflected in the Mesopotamian

378
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:29,874
creation myth.
The gods assemble themselves and they 

379
00:20:32,971 --> 00:20:34,530
look among them and they think,
okay,

380
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:35,364
well some one here is has the 
characteristics that should should be 

381
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:45,690
the central element of the top dating,
which is like the ultimate value.

382
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,273
Okay,
well the Mesopotamians chose wisely 

383
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,830
vision and language.
Those are your most,

384
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,190
the most potent weapons you have against
chaos because you,

385
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,463
if you pay attention,
you can see chaos when it first emerges 

386
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,440
and then if you are a master of 
language,

387
00:21:05,441 --> 00:21:06,274
you can encapsulate it then articulated 
very rapidly and you can communicate 

388
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,410
that to other people's.
It's like now this it.

389
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,190
You just cannot overestimate how radical
an idea that is.

390
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,540
It's a staggeringly radical idea that 
that's the set of attributes that should

391
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,374
be at the top.
The mesopotamians were trying to figure 

392
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:26,440
out what should be sovereign,
what should be above everything else.

393
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,360
Well,
you might say a person.

394
00:21:28,361 --> 00:21:28,931
It's like,
yeah,

395
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:29,980
yeah,
no,

396
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,540
the person embodies sovereignty.
Sovereignty itself as something else.

397
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,733
So when Frans de Waal for example,
he was watching chimpanzees hash it out 

398
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,750
for dominance in,
in the,

399
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:44,030
in the zoo,
and I think it's in the hall and our.

400
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,020
I think anyways,
it's a zoo that has a lot of chimpanzees

401
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:50,650
in and he spent a lot of time watching 
them and you know,

402
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:54,790
one idea about the dominant chimp is 
that he's just the biggest,

403
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,420
meanest,
most tyrannical chimp.

404
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,540
It's sort of the strong man theory of 
chimp leadership,

405
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,910
but what do all observed was that,
well,

406
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:06,340
that was sort of true in that the 
strongest,

407
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,880
meanest chimpanzee could obtain 
dominance.

408
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,230
But the problem with him is if he was 
really like selfish and cruel,

409
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:17,710
was that he didn't have any friends.
Now chimps have friends and they spend a

410
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,544
lot of time with them and they groom 
each other and they protect each other 

411
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,840
and fights and like you can be the 
ugliest,

412
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,630
meanest chimp around.
But if there's two chimps that are three

413
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:28,250
quarters of your strength coming at you,
it's like you.

414
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,310
You lose now.

415
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,203
So that means two chimps that are 
capable of enough civilization to bind 

416
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:34,864
themselves in to a dyad that is,
that has mutual obligations across time 

417
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:43,200
is way stronger than one ship who 
doesn't.

418
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,990
And so what that means is that strength 
and viciousness,

419
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,503
you know,
there'll be times when that can emerge 

420
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:51,280
as the dominant power,
but it's very,

421
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:55,480
very unstable and everyone's motivated 
to bring it down as fast as possible.

422
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,820
And the best way to bring it down is 
with a coalition.

423
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,863
And so partly what that indicates is 
that it's actually the chimp who's the 

424
00:23:01,511 --> 00:23:04,810
best at making coalitions that's most 
likely to become sovereign.

425
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,063
So that,
and that's actually what happens with 

426
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,564
the chimps,
is that the dictator chimp is very 

427
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:12,950
unstable.
And in the one story I read it of Arnhem

428
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,940
at the Arnhem Zoo,
he rose to the top,

429
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,810
the,
the,

430
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,643
the,
you know,

431
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,760
bad,
bad guy,

432
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,780
that gangster guy.

433
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,470
And a two chimps went after,
been torn to pieces.

434
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:26,860
They tore off his testicles.
Yeah.

435
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,023
And you know,
it agitated the hell out of the rest of 

436
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,600
the truth.
And it was like a bloody revolution.

437
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:32,530
You know,
it was really,

438
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:34,630
really stressful for the troop.
But,

439
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,080
but what it indicates,
and it's so interesting,

440
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:42,160
is that the idea that in a,
in a dominance hierarchy,

441
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,370
what's most dominant is power.
That there's no evidence whatsoever that

442
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,590
that's true,
and in fact I was talking to when I have

443
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:55,700
a partner in a business that I have who 
was a student of mine at Harvard,

444
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,534
he's a very,
very smart person and I was talking to 

445
00:23:58,491 --> 00:23:59,324
him about dominance hierarchies and he 
said something very that I found very 

446
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:03,794
upsetting on a variety of levels.
He said it's not a dominance hierarchy 

447
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,650
if you can't put a dog collar on the 
person one level below you,

448
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,010
which is pretty bloody blunt statement,
but when he's he,

449
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,933
he's prone to that sort of thing,
but what he meant is that it's possible 

450
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,834
that the idea that the term dominance 
hierarchy is not the right term to be 

451
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,094
applying to these sorts of social 
structures because what it implies is 

452
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:28,310
that what keeps the structure in place 
is power.

453
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,380
You know,
and that's the sort of claim that people

454
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,600
like food make.
It's all about power.

455
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,090
It's like the thing is,
it's not all about power.

456
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,230
It's not all about power.
It's not all about power among animals.

457
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,050
So with power,
with chimps,

458
00:24:42,051 --> 00:24:44,570
if that's all you've got is power,
you're going to get wiped out.

459
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,463
You have to.
So what the wall found was that the 

460
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:48,134
chimps who were able to establish stable
patterns of leadership were quite 

461
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,240
congenial.
They had a lot of allies,

462
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,074
so they engaged in mutual grooming and a
lot of social interaction and they were 

463
00:24:58,011 --> 00:25:01,550
very positively predisposed to the 
females in the truth.

464
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,780
So that's pretty interesting,
you know,

465
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,850
because we don't know what constitutes 
valid sovereignty,

466
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:11,360
but even in animals it doesn't seem to 
be power.

467
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,670
So,
and then,

468
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:14,504
you know,
you look at wolf packs and that sort of 

469
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:17,770
thing and you know,
if two wolves go at it for,

470
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,770
for dominance,
one wolf will back off and roll over and

471
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,950
show his throat and you know,
like Stalin,

472
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:26,870
Wolf would just tear out his throat.

473
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,240
But you know,
I'm Churchill Wolf,

474
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,140
let's say,
would say,

475
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:34,370
well yeah,
you're kind of useless,

476
00:25:34,371 --> 00:25:37,000
but we might need to be around later.
So why don't you get up and you know,

477
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,680
we'll let bygones be bygones.
And that's what wolves do,

478
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,620
you know,
and unsurprisingly,

479
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,210
because what are you going to do?
Kill everyone in your troop?

480
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,793
Well,
that it doesn't seem like a very 

481
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,070
effective strategy either for meeting or
for survival.

482
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,353
So the Mesopotamians were trying to work
out practically who's going to be 

483
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,074
sovereign and at the same time 
conceptually what is the proper basis 

484
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,940
for sovereignty,
which is,

485
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,580
it's really the ultimate question in 
some sense.

486
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,223
So anyways,
so they elect Marduk and the Martex go 

487
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:07,850
to all these eyes and he can speak.
And so he thinks,

488
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,610
all right,
he says,

489
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,170
if I win,
I'm going to get the tablet,

490
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,630
have destinies.
And then I'm taught God.

491
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,231
And they say,
yeah,

492
00:26:15,231 --> 00:26:16,160
yeah,
whatever.

493
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,810
If you win,
no problem.

494
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,703
So he goes out to fight timeout and he 
takes a sword and he and he takes a net 

495
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:28,610
and they meet on the battlefield and he 
encapsulates timeout in a net,

496
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:31,280
which I think is a brilliant,
brilliant metaphor again,

497
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:35,660
because chaos is a morphis and unformed,
right?

498
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,590
And if you want to conquer it,
you have to encapsulate it within a net,

499
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,090
a net.
You have to,

500
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,070
you have to make it into something 
rather than amorphous,

501
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:44,731
you know,
when.

502
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:48,990
So look,
maybe a client comes to me and they say,

503
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,030
Oh,
I've been having these terrible symptoms

504
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,980
on my heart races and I,
I my,

505
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,933
my breath,
I can't catch my breath and I think I'm 

506
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,034
going to die and I think maybe I'm 
having a heart attack and I'm always at 

507
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:01,770
the hospital and they tell me that 
there's nothing wrong with me,

508
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,120
but I have like,
I'm,

509
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,390
I'm afraid all the time and I'm starting
not to go out and I say,

510
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,290
Oh,
you have agoraphobic.

511
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,153
Yeah,

512
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:11,973
lots of people have that.
You're not the only person like that in 

513
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:15,760
the world.
Not only that,

514
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:16,594
it has a name,
we know what to do about it and there's 

515
00:27:19,151 --> 00:27:19,984
a treatment course and they'd go,
and the reason for that is that the 

516
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:25,594
unknown unknown has just been turned 
into a known unknown and that's a 

517
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:33,301
massive improvement.
And so the person who conceptualizes the

518
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:36,670
anomalous situations fastest is in fact 
the leader.

519
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,910
That's the definition of leadership.
It's like we don't know what's going on.

520
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,310
This is what's going on.
And what,

521
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,470
and when you say this is what's going 
on,

522
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:49,390
you also simultaneously say,
here's a million other things that could

523
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:50,224
have been going on that aren't.
So it's a process of radical 

524
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,630
simplification and it lowers the stress 
levels immediately anyway,

525
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,473
so time that goes in or articles,
he gets her in a nap and then he splits 

526
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,174
in half and he makes heaven out of one 
half and the earth out of the other for 

527
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:06,450
the human beings.
And uh,

528
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,870
and he goes back to any defeats can do 
and all the monsters.

529
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:12,704
And then he goes back to tell the other 
gods and they're pretty happy about 

530
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,640
this.
And Keanu had the tablet of destinies.

531
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:19,400
But Martin took that from him and now he
has it.

532
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,234
So he gets to determine destiny.
And he makes human beings out of king 

533
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,044
whose blood,
which is quite an interesting little 

534
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:29,390
twist to the story.
And he makes them to serve the gods.

535
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,850
And so,
so that's that.

536
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,743
So,

537
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,930
so the idea is that the,
the hero who can see and can communicate

538
00:28:36,931 --> 00:28:40,260
is also the hero who separates out the 
elements of existed.

539
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,094
So that it becomes a habitable place and
that humans should serve that serve 

540
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,470
Margo.
Well,

541
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:50,970
you have to serve something well,
you're going to serve a natural force of

542
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:52,450
some sort,
or you can be all anger.

543
00:28:52,451 --> 00:28:54,330
You can be all last week and we all 
love.

544
00:28:54,331 --> 00:28:55,164
We can be all hunger.
Or are you going to represent some 

545
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,340
integrated,
ah,

546
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,560
some,
some balanced and integrated

547
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,260
emergent property of that.
It's also socially constructed,

548
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:08,094
you know,
so that you're a balance of natural 

549
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:10,324
forces and you're a civilized person and
that's some sort of essence and that's 

550
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,520
what you're going to strive for.
Well,

551
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,860
that's Marta.
So you're supposed to be a good Marta.

552
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,753
Now Martin is immortal now.
The only person who was identified with 

553
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:23,950
Martech in the Mesopotamian realm was 
the emperor.

554
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,030
Now they lived in a walled city.
And so what the emperor,

555
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,013
the reason the emperor was sovereign was
because he was supposed to be the 

556
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:31,834
embodiment of Marico and earth,
which meant that his job was to 

557
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:35,014
transforms chaos into order whenever 
chaos threatened he was supposed to 

558
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:43,261
transform it back into order.
So this is what Mesopotamians did at the

559
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,130
New Year's celebration when the year is 
rejuvenated,

560
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,450
right?
The old year dies,

561
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,280
of course we know that because we still 
do it,

562
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,020
and the new year is this new baby.

563
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,853
It's a time of new beginnings.
So the Mesopotamians would take the 

564
00:29:53,351 --> 00:29:54,184
emperor out of the city and they'd strip
him of all his emperor close and then 

565
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:59,164
they'd make them recite all the ways 
during the last year that he'd been a 

566
00:30:02,921 --> 00:30:05,140
bad Marduk,
like he hadn't kept.

567
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,513
He hadn't been encountering chaos 
properly and hadn't been keeping order 

568
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:12,820
property,
so and confess all of his inadequacies.

569
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,530
Then the priest would come with a glove 
as a,

570
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,703
you know,
as a ritual punishment and then they 

571
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:21,934
take all the statues out of the old gods
out of the city and then they read 

572
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,070
represent the battle between Martech and
tire mount.

573
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,383
And then the emperor was Marta and he 
would win and then he would have sex 

574
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:39,260
with a ritual prostitute.
Which was that.

575
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,440
This is a much tougher concept,
but it's.

576
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,383
It's a way of symbolizing the fact that 
if the creative force encounters the 

577
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:47,524
positive element of the feminine,
it's like the prince and sleeping 

578
00:30:50,231 --> 00:30:51,064
beauty,
getting sleeping beauty from the grasp 

579
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,610
of the evil queen who turns into the 
Dragon.

580
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,020
It's exact because it's weird,
right?

581
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,030
You've seen that and you'd understand 
it.

582
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,960
Right?
Sleeping.

583
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:01,540
Beauty's all in the tower.
She's covered by a.

584
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,990
she's hemmed in by a huge fields of 
thorns.

585
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,870
The Evil Queen is trying to stop the 
prince from getting to her.

586
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,780
She turns into a dragon,
which makes absolutely no sense,

587
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:11,614
but everyone follows it and then he has 
to fight his way through that to get to 

588
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,370
the,
to the main.

589
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,383
It's the same idea in a different 
context and then order productive order 

590
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,470
being reestablished.
Everybody goes back into the kingdom and

591
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:24,304
it's renewed for the next year,
and that's the idea behind Mesopotamian 

592
00:31:27,101 --> 00:31:30,790
sovereignty and it's bloody brilliant 
because it's an abs.

593
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,430
It's,
it's,

594
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,980
it's,
it's the beginnings of,

595
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,480
of law.
In some sense.

596
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:36,760
It's,
it's the idea that to be,

597
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,990
to be proper,
even if you're a desperate,

598
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,863
even if you're the king,
there's a sacred pattern of behavior 

599
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:46,444
that you must adhere to,
which is the consequence of the 

600
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,013
congress,
of the gods deciding what the most 

601
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:54,160
effective mode of being is.

602
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:58,990
It's staggeringly brilliant and,
and it took that story.

603
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,080
We just have no idea how long that story
took.

604
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:02,470
Do we merge?
I would say it's,

605
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,950
it's the consequence of the full course 
of human evolutionary history.

606
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,580
Like the,
there are elements in it that are as old

607
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:12,570
as mammals and maybe older than that.
You know,

608
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,413
if you think about those patterns being 
embedded in behavior long before they 

609
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,750
were abstracted out into 
representations,

610
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,823
it's unbelievably archaic and ancient 
and so you have time at the great 

611
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:27,460
mother.
You have absolutely the great father.

612
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
You have margot,
the archetypal son.

613
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:32,680
You have king who's the negative element
of Marta,

614
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,903
right?
And you have the drama of all those 

615
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:39,290
characters interacting across time and 
that's,

616
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,203
that's the mythological,
that's the mythological representation 

617
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,264
of reality.
And tying that to tie it into the 

618
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,810
neuropsychology that we talked about,
you know,

619
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,150
we talked about anomaly,
right?

620
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,890
And how normally you have a,
a,

621
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,153
a box that you're in that is your world,
but that box doesn't contain everything 

622
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,550
in the world.
There's a lot of things that are good at

623
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:02,870
and sometimes they poked their head in 
like a snake.

624
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,540
And then that's disruptive.
And what do you do?

625
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,440
Well,
you have to,

626
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,283
you have to voluntarily encountered the 
snake and either defeated or make 

627
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:13,780
something valuable out of it.
You know,

628
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:14,614
you could cower and hide,
but all that generally means the state 

629
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,460
grows and grows until there's hardly any
you in the box.

630
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:20,294
And there's all snake.
And that's actually the best Damien 

631
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,633
story.
It's so if the elder gods weren't so 

632
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:28,850
careless and had been paying attention 
and hadn't killed absolute time,

633
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,380
that would've stayed asleep the whole 
time.

634
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,130
So.
Well.

635
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:37,490
So that's the,
that's the level of isomorphism.

636
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:41,660
So what's,
what's fascinating,

637
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,720
but I think inevitable is that the 
methodology reflects the physiology,

638
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,500
but how,
how could it not?

639
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,500
The physiology produced the mythology 
like,

640
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:54,200
of course that's going to be the case.
It shouldn't be a surprise.

641
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,880
It should be.
It should be.

642
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,490
We should be.
The reverse should be a surprise.

643
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:00,260
It's like there's no relationship 
between these,

644
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,660
these old stories and the way that human
beings are structured.

645
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,680
It's like,
well,

646
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
no,
no,

647
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,880
that's a dumb idea.
So,

648
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,013
well,

649
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,170
that's the Mesopotamian creation myth 
and it's,

650
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,400
it's a killer.
It's,

651
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,840
it's a,
it's a staggering story and you know,

652
00:34:22,841 --> 00:34:24,880
it still sits.
Whether we know it or not,

653
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,770
it sits at the very base of our culture.
It's absolute that story.

654
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,820
And if we kill it,
which we will or have been,

655
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,380
then then look out.
You know,

656
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,223
we know the story from so long ago.
If you let your culture die and act 

657
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,363
carelessly towards it,
all hell will break loose and it's no 

658
00:34:47,471 --> 00:34:49,340
joke.
So,

659
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,933
so here we are trying to revive a fight.
It's pretty weird that these things 

660
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:03,090
happened to be real.
But then if you think about it,

661
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,740
well,
how could it be otherwise?

662
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,070
You know,
I mean,

663
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,403
you think all these people who lived 
before us for the tens of millions of 

664
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:16,370
years that we've had are vaguely human.
Pre predessessors were stupid.

665
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,140
They weren't and they weren't ignorant 
and they weren't superstitious or any of

666
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:26,130
those things.
They were.

667
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:28,523
They were.
They were tough enough so that we're 

668
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:30,834
here.
