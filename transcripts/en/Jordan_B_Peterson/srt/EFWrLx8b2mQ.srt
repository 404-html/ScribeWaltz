1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:06,640
Okay.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,640
Hi everyone.
Welcome to the September version of my q

3
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:16,780
and a's and uh,
thank you very much for tuning in again.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,433
Um,
hopefully we'll have an interesting 

5
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:21,484
discussion tonight.
I want to stop start that is with a 

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,210
demonstration of some new newly managed 
technical wizardry.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,000
I have a program that I developed with 
my colleagues that I want to talk to you

8
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:34,834
guys about for just a few seconds.
Some of you already know about this 

9
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:37,534
called self authoring and self authoring
helps people write about their past to 

10
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:45,070
guide it autobiography,
that's the past authoring program and to

11
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:46,660
write about their virtues and their 
faults.

12
00:00:46,661 --> 00:00:47,494
That's there's to present autherine 
programs and a future authoring program 

13
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:54,970
that helps people write out a vision and
a destination,

14
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:55,804
let's say an ethical destination for 
their lives as well as formulate a plan 

15
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:04,690
to put that vision into,
to make that vision into reality.

16
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,660
And our experimental investigations have
indicated,

17
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,494
for example,
that university students who complete 

18
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:11,344
this program,
even if they do it badly and I would 

19
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:17,230
recommend at least doing it badly,
increase their probability of staying at

20
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:18,064
university by about 30% and it has a 
positive effect on their grade point 

21
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,904
average as well.
So there's a fair bit of evidence that 

22
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:25,924
your personality is organized at the 
highest level through articulated 

23
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:29,734
speech.
Some of that you can formulate 

24
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:33,280
internally by thinking in some of it you
have to do,

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,143
you can do by writing.
You also do that in discussion with 

26
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:39,250
other people.
But these programs are designed to break

27
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,240
down the problem of articulating your 
life in the past,

28
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,074
present and future into a series of 
steps that are at least in principle 

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,813
manageable.
And the thousands of people have done 

30
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,550
them and I think they're very helpful 
programs and uh,

31
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,384
we spent a lot of time perfecting them I
suppose to the degree that they are 

32
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,434
perfected.

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,790
Anyways,
I want to,

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,653
here's the high tech part of this.
You see that's the website self 

35
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:10,630
authoring.com and I put a coupon 
together.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,350
Um,
the coupon name is September.

37
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,540
So that's what you have to enter for the
coupon.

38
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,660
And that gives you a 20% discount at 
self authoring.

39
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,943
So,
and now all this is even more high tech 

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,020
because this marker is in a different 
color.

41
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,470
And this program is a personality test 
based on the big five aspect scale,

42
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:34,684
which is a scale that calling the young 
one of my students developed when he 

43
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:41,560
worked in my lab along with Lena quilty.
And uh,

44
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,423
the big five aspects scale offers you a 
five dimensional readout of your 

45
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,290
personality,
extroversion,

46
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:48,550
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

47
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,010
conscientiousness and openness,
the classic big five.

48
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:55,150
And then it breaks each of the factors,
each of the traits into two aspects.

49
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:58,900
So you get a high resolution map of your
personality that takes the,

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,033
takes about a hundred questions,
takes about 15 minutes to do and you'll 

51
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,430
learn about yourself.
I think you'll learn interesting things.

52
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,264
I had my kids do repeated iterations of 
the big five aspects scale when they 

53
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:10,984
were teenagers.
And I learned a lot about them even 

54
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,610
though I thought I knew them quite well.
I learned things that were very useful.

55
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:20,110
So you can do that and maybe you'll 
understand yourself a little bit better.

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,423
And so

57
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,770
this is the site
and the coupon is September,

58
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,350
just as it was for self authoring.
And that's 20% as well.

59
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,910
Okay.

60
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,910
And you'll see that amazingly enough,
this advertisement,

61
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,600
I suppose,
which is what it is,

62
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,583
is in purple instead of blue.
And so that's another technological 

63
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,064
miracle brought to you by the Internet 
and the intelligence of modern human 

64
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:03,210
beings.
So all right,

65
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,044
so we've dispensed with that.
So that's self authoring and understand 

66
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:11,991
myself and you might find those useful 
and I hope you do so onto more,

67
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,010
um,
von to different things.

68
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:20,730
I guess I just got back to Toronto 
yesterday,

69
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,810
I think it was yesterday.
I was out in western Canada.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,033
I went to a family reunion on Vancouver 
Island and then a reunion of sorts as 

71
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:33,870
well in Saskatchewan with my side of the
family and uh,

72
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,260
finished the talk and Regina and went 
into saskatoon as well,

73
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,810
which seemed to be relatively well 
received.

74
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,063
So hurray for that.
I've really enjoyed all these lectures 

75
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,910
that I've been giving.

76
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,890
And tammy and I,
Tammy's my wife,

77
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,173
we visited 65 cities now on this tour 
and we're starting again on September 

78
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,750
5th we're going to go down the eastern 
seaboard.

79
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:57,480
There's 20 cities in,
in the northeastern us.

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,930
And then we're off to Europe for another
15 cities or so.

81
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,810
And then in February I think we're going
to go to Australia.

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,660
And then in March and April back to 
Europe.

83
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:07,494
And then in May,
I'm going to spend four months 

84
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,300
diligently finishing up what I hope to 
be my next book,

85
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:18,600
if assuming that I can get that done in 
that period of time.

86
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:21,660
And also that other opportunities,
let's say,

87
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:25,530
or distractions don't rear their head 
either positively or negatively.

88
00:05:25,531 --> 00:05:26,940
And who knows,
right?

89
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,310
Because life is a very uncertain 
business.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,460
I've really enjoyed the lecture tour a 
lot.

91
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,500
Um,
you know,

92
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,453
I've been speaking to audiences of about
2,500 to 3000 people and mostly about 

93
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:43,410
the,
I would say mostly about the nexus,

94
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:47,310
the relationship between meaning and 
responsibility,

95
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,144
trying to make the case that because 
life is difficult as everyone with any 

96
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:52,410
sense knows.

97
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,143
And because we can make that worse with 
our own stupidity and malevolence that 

98
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,440
it's necessary to find a sustaining 
meaning in life.

99
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,603
And my sense is,
and I think people tend to agree to 

100
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,204
this,
is that the most sustaining meaning can 

101
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,240
be found a and the adoption of voluntary
responsibility.

102
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,074
So in attempts to decrease the suffering
in life and to do things that are 

103
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,694
worthwhile and admirable and to take 
care of yourself individually and your 

104
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,164
family,
and to have a little bit leftover for 

105
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,264
your community and to have goodwill 
across all those dimensions if you can 

106
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,014
possibly manage it despite the fact that
there is something in life to make 

107
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,570
people relatively bitter.
And then,

108
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,773
um,
as well the necessity of conducting 

109
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,290
yourself in a truthful manner.
Um,

110
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,513
making also the case to my listeners,
I suppose that that one of the most 

111
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,100
ancient presuppositions that underlies 
the structure of Western civilization,

112
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:52,580
which is a very functional civilization 
in my estimation,

113
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:57,380
is the idea derived from genesis,
that truthful speech,

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,370
if you confront truthful speech,
if you confront potential,

115
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,420
the chaos and potential that is in front
of you with truthful speech,

116
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:08,420
that you engender the order that is 
good.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,960
And that's a fundamental ethical dictum.
It's,

118
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:13,400
it's,
it's a presupposition in some sense that

119
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,200
the order that you bring into existence 
in all the choices that you make will be

120
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,034
the best possible order in proportion to
the degree that you conduct yourself in 

121
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:26,750
a truthful manner.
And so those ideas seem to be falling on

122
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:27,584
very receptive ears and they are the 
most resilient ideas that I think I've 

123
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,680
ever come across.
I mean,

124
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,514
I always take an ice pick and a hammer 
to any idea that I encounter and I 

125
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:38,984
really do that diligently because I 
don't want to rely on ideas that can 

126
00:07:41,841 --> 00:07:44,210
fall apart and break,
especially when they're stressed.

127
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,250
And I don't see,
I don't,

128
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,030
I haven't come across ideas that are 
more solid than that.

129
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:52,070
I mean,
the first proposition,

130
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:55,250
you know that life is suffering and that
we make it worse with our malevolence.

131
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,410
I think everyone understands that to be 
true.

132
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,873
But the second is that the best way to 
confront that is to shoulder 

133
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,560
responsibility voluntarily and to live 
in truth.

134
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,543
I think those are even more powerful 
ideas because you could say that the 

135
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:11,054
cure for a malaise or the treatment for 
a disease is more powerful than the 

136
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,134
Malaysia Malays or the disease itself.
And If responsibility and truth are 

137
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,820
antidotes to suffering and malevolence,
then that means that they're there.

138
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,990
They have a power that's transcendent 
over suffering malevolence and you know,

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,710
it's so,
it's a very pessimistic viewpoint.

140
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,980
On the one hand,
because I'm stressing for everybody that

141
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,113
is coming to listen to me talk the fact 
that life has an inalienable element of 

142
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,793
difficulty and,
and travail and suffering and all of 

143
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,510
that,
and you certainly see that sort of thing

144
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:45,950
when you go to a family reunion.

145
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,080
You know,
like a lot of my relatives,

146
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,910
my parents generation,
they're getting,

147
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,730
all of my parents are in their eighties 
now and,

148
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,810
and their friends,
some of,

149
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,693
they have friends that are older and 
everyone's starting to suffer from the 

150
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,330
inevitable deterioration that's 
associated with old age.

151
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,164
And it's very,
very trying and very difficult for 

152
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,030
people.
And it's,

153
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,873
it's in those situations that you see 
more clearly the fragility of life and 

154
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,770
also the importance of having,
uh,

155
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,473
having a family that's functional and 
people around you that love you and all 

156
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,980
those things that in principle can help 
sustain you through difficult times.

157
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,050
So anyways,
I'm here in Toronto for about 10 days,

158
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,320
got a lot of media interviews again 
partly to discuss the upcoming talks.

159
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,903
Um,
my book 12 rules for life still appears 

160
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,220
to be selling extraordinarily well.
Um,

161
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,143
it's quite

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,540
amazing.
All things considered.

163
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,823
Um,
it's approaching 2 million sales and in 

164
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,400
the English version.
And um,

165
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,030
there are foreign versions coming out 
all the time.

166
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,090
So,
and I've also,

167
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,403
I'm also in the process of putting 
together the final arrangements for my 

168
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,140
next book,
which I talked about.

169
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:02,920
So the plan is to,
to,

170
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:04,080
right,
I'm writing that now.

171
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,200
I've got it about half written,
maybe a little bit more expanding on the

172
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:08,034
themes that I developed in 12 rules for 
life and also extending them as much as 

173
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:14,380
I possibly can.
Um,

174
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,890
and I hope to continue writing during 
this period of touring as well so that I

175
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,724
can stay on top of my deadlines and then
from May to September to spend most of 

176
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,050
that time finalizing and editing and 
polishing and all of that.

177
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,273
And then hopefully the book is due in 
September and the current plan is to 

178
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,300
spend September through December,
um,

179
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,190
likely concentrating on a return to the 
biblical lectures starting with exodus,

180
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,024
which is something I'm really looking 
forward to but haven't really been able 

181
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,570
to turn my hand to.

182
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,760
The other thing I'm really thinking hard
about doing,

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,780
I'd like to do a series of lectures.
I don't know if I could do them publicly

184
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:52,614
or not,
but I might be able to finagle that in 

185
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,384
some manner.
I'd like to do a series of lectures on 

186
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,743
the sacred icons of the radical left.
So I'd like to do a lecture series on 

187
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:05,760
Marx and foucault and Derrida,
and then some,

188
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,713
some of the famous feminist too,
like betty for Dan whose work I'm not a 

189
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,650
fan of,
um,

190
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,640
for a variety of reasons and do Judith 
Butler as well.

191
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,980
But I'd really like to concentrate on 
marks.

192
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,173
So,
uh,

193
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,460
one of the things I might duty for you 
guys tonight or two you have,

194
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,573
one of the things I might do to you 
tonight is I found a poem by Karl Marx 

195
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,750
that is extraordinarily interesting and 
uh,

196
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,010
that might be worth reading if I can.
I just thought about doing that if I can

197
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,023
scrape it up in time.
So let me just check very quickly and 

198
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,180
see if I can find it and then I'll get 
to some questions because after all,

199
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,290
this is a q and a,
right?

200
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:47,580
That's the theory.
So

201
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,680
give me 30 seconds if you can indulge 
me.

202
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,310
There it is.
Yeah.

203
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,510
So let me read this to you and then 
we'll get to the Q.

204
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:03,260
And.
A.

205
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,093
I think this,
this is the kind of thing that I'd like 

206
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:10,040
to shed light on in any possible lecture
series on marks.

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,070
So this is called invocation

208
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,943
invocation of one in despair.
So God has snatched from me my all in 

209
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:37,760
the curse and rack of destiny.
Oh,

210
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:38,594
his worlds are gone beyond recall 
nothing but revenge is left to me on 

211
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:49,700
myself.
Revenge all proudly wreak on that.

212
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:54,410
Being that in thrown Lord make my 
strength of patchwork of what's week.

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,970
Leave my better self without reward,
I shall build my throne.

214
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:01,100
High overhead,
cold,

215
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,820
tremendous shell at summit be for it's 
bulwark,

216
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,073
superstitious dread for it's Marshall,
blackest agony who looks on it with a 

217
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:13,064
healthy I shall turn back struck 
definitely pale and dumb clutched by 

218
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:22,640
blind and chill mortality me,
his happiness prepare his too.

219
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,830
And the Almighty's lightning shell 
rebound from that massive iron giant.

220
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,220
If he bring my walls and towers down,
eternity shall raise them up defiant.

221
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,970
Well,
so on that happy note,

222
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,283
that's perhaps perhaps some insight into
the spirit that motivated our friend Mr 

223
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,910
Carl Marx.
So,

224
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,740
okay.

225
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,460
I've really been thinking a lot about 
the Marxist critique of Western culture,

226
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,220
especially the fundamental,
um,

227
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,473
Marxist critique is something eight 
fundamental mark Marxist critique is a 

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,420
criticism of the fact that in capitalist
societies,

229
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,380
uh,
a disproportionate amount of the spoils,

230
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,214
let's say the wealth goes to a 
disproportionately small part of the 

231
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:16,984
community.
And this is of course a truism by the 

232
00:14:19,661 --> 00:14:21,400
way,
it is the case that that occurs,

233
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:22,234
which is why the richest dozen people in
the world have as much money as the 

234
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:26,590
bottom 2 billion,
something like that.

235
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,930
Um,
it's also the case,

236
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,213
it's part of a more generalized law 
sometimes called prices law and 

237
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,530
represented with the prieto 
distribution.

238
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:40,531
Prieto is p a r e t o showing that not 
only do the bulk of the spoils,

239
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,123
let's say the wealth go to a 
disproportionately small number of 

240
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:45,994
people,
but the bulk of the productive work is 

241
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:50,890
also done by a disproportionately small 
number of people,

242
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,300
not necessarily the same people that 
have the wealth,

243
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:55,790
by the way,
although in a functional society,

244
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,750
there's some overlap.

245
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,213
Now mark's was correct and observing 
that that happened in capitalist 

246
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,800
societies,
but incorrect in assuming that there are

247
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,634
any societies that have ever been 
formulated or that could ever be 

248
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:09,020
formulated that would escape from that 
destiny.

249
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,640
Because you see that same tremendous 
pareto distribution,

250
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,474
that proclivity of wealth to,
to accrue in the hands of small of a 

251
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,573
small number of people.
You see that in every human society 

252
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:23,480
that's ever been studied.
And if it's not wealth,

253
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:26,900
it's sexual access or reproductive well 
that's the same thing.

254
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,940
Reproductive Opportunity,
let's say,

255
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,440
or,
or,

256
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,110
or,
or material possessions,

257
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,180
which is obviously a form of wealth,
et cetera.

258
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,800
So one of the things that characterizes 
the west is that all our,

259
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,200
although our society's produced 
inequality,

260
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,930
like every other society,
including animal societies,

261
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:46,760
by the way,
and even among plants,

262
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,623
even among stars,
a disproportionate number of the 

263
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:52,040
heavenly bodies have most of the mass by
the way,

264
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,370
which is not something that you can lay 
at the feet of western capitalism.

265
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,760
Um,
the thing that the West has been able to

266
00:15:58,761 --> 00:15:59,594
do
that other societies haven't been able 

267
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:06,290
to do is to produce wealth along with 
inequality.

268
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,393
And that wealth is definitely
a fair proportion of that wealth is 

269
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:12,914
actually going to benefit the people who
are in the diaries straights and not 

270
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,240
processes been accelerating over the 
last 20 years.

271
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:21,074
So from the year 2000 till the year 2012
the level of absolute poverty in the 

272
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:26,954
world is halved,
which is the fastest rate of economic 

273
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:32,690
development in the history of the world.
And I think that rate is accelerating,

274
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,940
at least in part because the Soviet 
Union,

275
00:16:34,941 --> 00:16:35,774
for example,
isn't around anymore to agitate the 

276
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,703
economic masters in leaders of 
developing countries into the adoption 

277
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:45,620
of counterproductive collectivist 
economic strategies.

278
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,693
And so what appears to be happening is 
that as we spread the fundamental 

279
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,953
western ethos of individuality and 
private property and free markets and 

280
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:57,620
freedom in general for men and for women
around the world,

281
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,890
that the poorest people are becoming,
well at least they're not starving.

282
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,350
They're becoming richer,
even though at the same time we do pay a

283
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,184
price for that in inequality.
So there's a rule and I don't know how 

284
00:17:07,881 --> 00:17:08,714
to formulate it exactly or there seems 
to be a rule which is a given unit of 

285
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:16,720
wealth is produced at the cost of,
of certain production of inequality,

286
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,600
a certain number of units of inequality,
and that seems to be inalienable to some

287
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,730
degree.
So anyways,

288
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,520
that's part of a Marxist critique the 
poem first,

289
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:29,720
which is like you want to listen to that
poem a couple of times I would say,

290
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,610
but then more fundamentally a critique 
of the Marxist critique of the West.

291
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,680
Yes,
the West produces inequality,

292
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:39,140
but it's not something that you could 
lay at the feet of capitalism.

293
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,940
It's a much,
much deeper problem.

294
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,133
And what that means too is that those 
people who purport to be on the side of 

295
00:17:44,691 --> 00:17:45,524
the poor and dispossessed are not being 
friends to them by any stretch of the 

296
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:53,160
imagination at all by attempting to tear
down the very hierarchies that seemed to

297
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:57,390
be leveraging the world's poorest people
out of poverty as rapidly as possible.

298
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,870
There's evidence as well that people 
start to become very concerned about the

299
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,880
environment.
If you can get their family income.

300
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,140
I think arts,
GDP,

301
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:08,250
I think up about 40,
above about 4,500 us a year,

302
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,323
they start to have a little bit of spare
time to be concerned with the 

303
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:14,480
environment around them.
And so the right way to,

304
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,430
to ecological balance in the world seems
to be,

305
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,653
um,
to make people rich as fast as we 

306
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:23,460
possibly can to make the poor rich as 
fast as we possibly can.

307
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,980
And wouldn't that be lovely if that was 
really the way out?

308
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,390
So anyways,
um,

309
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,080
and now for that,
so let's,

310
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,930
let's try some questions here.
So

311
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:43,910
any advice on effectively implementing 
what I learned into my life?

312
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,350
I resonate with 12 rules so much when 
reading,

313
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:49,140
but struggle to remember it in my day to
day life.

314
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,640
Well,
you're not alone.

315
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,650
Not with Sam.
You're not alone in that,

316
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:53,880
Sam.
I mean,

317
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:54,714
first of all,
you've got to figure out what your 

318
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,760
timeframe is.
You know,

319
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:57,963
um,
one of the truisms of clinical 

320
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:05,631
psychology is that slow and incremental 
improvement is first of all,

321
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,050
normative in the best possible way,
in the most optimistic situation,

322
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,003
but also very powerful.
And so of course you struggled to 

323
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:13,824
remember it in your day to day life 
because life is difficult and it's 

324
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:17,304
harder to do things the not to do them.
And it's harder to do them well than to 

325
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,240
do them badly,
you know,

326
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,340
and it's easy to sit around and be 
hopeless.

327
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,950
I don't mean it's emotionally easy 
because it's not,

328
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,140
but it's procedural,
easy to be useless and to fall back into

329
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:33,900
your old habits and to not discipline 
yourself.

330
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:37,080
And it's,
it's a matter of continual practice,

331
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:38,640
slow continual practice.

332
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,480
And I think a good example of that is 
something like weightlifting.

333
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,280
You know,
if you start a weightlifting program,

334
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:46,380
which I would recommend by the way,
because it,

335
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,400
it's tremendously advantageous 
physically and cognitively,

336
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,743
you're not going to really see results 
for a number of weeks and then the 

337
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:54,654
results are rather slow.
But you can get pretty decent results 

338
00:19:57,091 --> 00:20:00,720
over a six month period and absolutely 
stellar results over a couple of years.

339
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:01,554
And so you have to make sure your 
timeframe is right and not to be too 

340
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,434
hard on yourself.
And I did mention the future authoring 

341
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,370
program,
um,

342
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,713
earlier.
And one of the things I would recommend 

343
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:16,260
too is if you're having a hard time 
implementing your,

344
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,573
your decision,
say you're ethical decisions that you 

345
00:20:19,591 --> 00:20:20,424
spend a bit more time thinking them 
through and writing them down in the 

346
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:24,140
future authoring program is really 
helpful thought.

347
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,013
That's why we designed it and so get 
your goal straight and continue to 

348
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:33,270
practice every day and if you're not 
succeeding then make your goals slightly

349
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:34,080
smaller.

350
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,170
You want to,
you want to make your goals large enough

351
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,123
so that they challenge you but small 
enough so that you have a reasonable 

352
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,814
probability of succeeding at them on a 
day to day basis and then you have to 

353
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,310
also understand that if you fail on a 
given day,

354
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,223
I could,
let's say you're trying to quit smoking 

355
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:52,510
and you quit for two weeks and then you 
have a cigarette and you think,

356
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:54,010
oh my God,
now I've screwed it up.

357
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:57,340
I've not quitting anymore.
You smoke a whole pack of cigarettes.

358
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,174
It's like,
well there's a couple of mistakes there 

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,040
and one is,
well,

360
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,800
just because you had a cigarette doesn't
mean you failed.

361
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,053
It just means that you had a cigarette,
you can start stopping again the next 

362
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,733
day.
And the fact that you had one cigarette 

363
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:14,524
in the last two weeks is a hell of a lot
better than the two weeks that you had 

364
00:21:16,751 --> 00:21:17,584
before that.
And so you've gotta be realistically 

365
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,454
humble.
You've got to be ambitious enough in 

366
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:23,734
your goals so that you're pursuing 
something that you regard as truly 

367
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:28,810
meaningful and worthwhile.
You know,

368
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,480
and maybe you can judge that to some 
degree.

369
00:21:31,481 --> 00:21:32,314
If you think about someone you love 
attempting the same thing and think 

370
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:36,880
about how you would feel if they managed
it.

371
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:39,700
And if you would feel good,
then that's probably a good,

372
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:42,940
um,
what would you say that would be a good

373
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,950
evaluation strategy to use on yourself?
You,

374
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,520
so you want your goals to be of 
sufficient nobility so that you can live

375
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,560
with yourself properly if you're 
pursuing them,

376
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,394
but you want them to be small enough so 
that you have a reasonable probability 

377
00:21:58,981 --> 00:22:02,160
of implementing them.
And if your implementation,

378
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,430
okay,
that's good.

379
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,870
You can start again.
Maybe

380
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,010
we're back.
Yeah.

381
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,930
Okay guys.
Well,

382
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:28,764
that was interesting.
The software that I use on my camera 

383
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,110
crashed.
And then when I reopened it,

384
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,220
it told me I hadn't purchased it and 
wanted me to reenter the serial number,

385
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,140
which is quite the interesting 
experience.

386
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,543
So,
so I'm just getting my questions back 

387
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,204
up.
Um,

388
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,680
this three quarter person that you see 
here is Julian,

389
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:49,640
who's,
you know,

390
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:51,890
reasonably helpful about these sorts of 
things now.

391
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:52,724
And then

392
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:56,403
I've Al,
I've almost actually learned how to do 

393
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,091
this.
I tell you,

394
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:00,370
you do get slower technologically as you
get older.

395
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:03,700
It's kind of annoying or maybe get just 
fed up with it more.

396
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,593
It's hard to tell.
I think you probably stupider and less 

397
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:11,470
patient and so then you justify your 
less pay your stupidity by just assuming

398
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:13,660
that you're less patient.
So,

399
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,250
okay.
Anyways,

400
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,430
um,
we're back.

401
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,820
Thanks Julian.
Okay.

402
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,493
So Paul Maloney says,
you mentioned analyzing one of your 

403
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:29,314
wife's dreams that left you feeling 
hopeful that will emerge from this 

404
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:33,160
chaos.
Okay.

405
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,460
Do you still feel this way?
Any new signs?

406
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,560
Well,
who knows,

407
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,400
right?
Because

408
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,180
because the future is complicated and no
one's a profit.

409
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,690
I don't know what to think.
I think this,

410
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,524
I guess I already mentioned earlier in 
this q and a that on a global level 

411
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,760
there is all sorts of reasons for real 
optimism as far as I'm concerned.

412
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,653
There's reasons for pessimism as well,
but there's reasons for real optimism 

413
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,340
and what,
look,

414
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,840
it looks to me like what's happening is 
that this spread of

415
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,233
the western free market individualists 
ethos around the world is producing a 

416
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,320
substantive increment in wealth,
a substantive decrease in poverty.

417
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:38,350
And the consequence of that decrease in 
poverty is also in places like China,

418
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,700
which by the way,
China is reforesting.

419
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:41,534
So that's pretty interesting.
China's now rich enough so that it can 

420
00:25:44,031 --> 00:25:44,864
afford to reforest.
So there's more forest in China than 

421
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:49,640
there was in 1990 which is quite a 
remarkable thing.

422
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,040
Anyways,
my point is,

423
00:25:51,041 --> 00:25:55,640
is that on the global scale,
things appeared to be very positive

424
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,213
and the,
but then in the West we seem to be 

425
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,124
suffering from a crisis of confidence 
and that's destabilizing us and making 

426
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,364
us act foolishly.
And I don't know how much of a threat 

427
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,980
that is to the integrity of our 
political system.

428
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,373
Um,
and I'm so much in the middle of this 

429
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:19,620
let's say,
um,

430
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,020
personally that it's hard for me to have
a clear head about it.

431
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,270
Now I'm very optimistic about a variety 
of things that I see.

432
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,920
I'm very optimistic,
for example,

433
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:31,754
about the fact that so many people have 
are coming out to these long form 

434
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:41,231
lectures and paying attention to high 
complexity,

435
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,090
educational and political material on 
Youtube.

436
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,190
There's a real hunger for that.
And I,

437
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,163
as I said before,
the lecture tour that I'm on has been 

438
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,260
extremely positive.

439
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,903
Um,
it's really something to see all these 

440
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:55,824
thousands of people come out to 
concentrate on getting their lives 

441
00:26:59,071 --> 00:26:59,904
together.
And I do believe that that's why people 

442
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:02,191
are coming out.
And then,

443
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:03,900
you know,
I think,

444
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,973
I don't remember if I did a q and a 
since I did the discussions with Sam 

445
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,220
Harris,
but,

446
00:27:11,221 --> 00:27:12,054
um,
I did for discussions with him for 

447
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:15,564
debates,
let's say each of which was about two 

448
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,080
hours long,
two in Vancouver,

449
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,080
one in Dublin and one in London,
UK.

450
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,950
And there were about 3000 people at each
of the Vancouver events,

451
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:26,784
8,500 people in Dublin.
And something approximating 6,500 in 

452
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:31,644
London.
And the audience was very attentive for 

453
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,190
the two hour stretch for all four 
discussions.

454
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,053
And so I do see the,
I see more intelligence in the general 

455
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:47,704
population say then I think we presumed 
was there and more hunger for serious 

456
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:57,991
discussion.
And I'm hoping that people who are clear

457
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:00,454
headed and sensible can push back the 
idiot collectivist radicals on the left 

458
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:08,920
and on the right.
We'll see.

459
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,530
Um,
so yeah,

460
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:12,364
I'm hopeful because I think that people 
are remarkable creatures despite their 

461
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:17,494
limitations and the absurdity of our 
existence and our proclivity toward 

462
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,220
malevolence.
I think that

463
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,220
w

464
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,053
we can,
whatever constitutes our essence is 

465
00:28:32,301 --> 00:28:36,320
capable of transcending that.
And I think that people know that.

466
00:28:36,321 --> 00:28:37,154
And I think the more people that realize
that consciously and start to implement 

467
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,150
it,
the better off we'll be.

468
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,313
And so nested inside my extreme 
pessimism about the structure of life 

469
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,870
and the frailty of human character is an
acceptable optimism,

470
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,110
exceptional optimism about our 
potential.

471
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,183
So we'll see.
But I would also say to all of you that 

472
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:00,110
are listening,
you know,

473
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,123
it is my firm belief that each of us 
have a responsibility to set the world 

474
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:09,530
right in the manner that we are able to 
end.

475
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:14,531
That that is a fundamental,
that's a fundamental import.

476
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:16,543
I really believe in some sense it's of 
cosmic import in the same way that 

477
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:25,130
consciousness itself is of cosmic import
and consciousness reflects being itself.

478
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:26,923
And so,
and I do believe that we have the 

479
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,033
ability and the responsibility to bring 
new creation into being and that our 

480
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:39,911
ethical decisions help us,
that our ethical decisions,

481
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,143
that the value of that new being is 
dependent directly on the ethical 

482
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:45,214
decisions that each of us make.
And I think we can realize that even 

483
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,630
though it's a frightening thing to 
realize,

484
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,620
Marcus Perry asks,
you said,

485
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,580
the narrow bandwidth of TV has made us 
think we are stupider than we are.

486
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,500
We'll internet center censorship lead to
the same problem once TV is supplanted.

487
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,390
Well,
God,

488
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,820
another incredibly complicated question.

489
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,200
You know,
whenever I think about censorship,

490
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,153
I actually talked to mark Zuckerberg 
awhile back and we had a good 

491
00:30:16,221 --> 00:30:17,630
conversation,
you know,

492
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:18,464
and Zuckerberg,
who I think is a very straightforward 

493
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,130
person as far as I could tell,
um,

494
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,503
is optimistic about facebook and does 
see it as a platform whose primary goal 

495
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:36,540
is to connect people and mostly at the 
personal level,

496
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:37,374
although they've,
facebook has made forays into news 

497
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:43,440
provision and that's complicated their 
corporate vision.

498
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,693
Now I am not a pro censorship character.
I do not like hate speech legislation 

499
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:51,204
and I am absolutely opposed to compelled
speech legislation of the sort that's 

500
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:56,394
been introduced into Canada.
I think it's a violation of the 

501
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:01,230
principle of free speech and free 
thought.

502
00:31:01,231 --> 00:31:03,210
And I think it's exceptionally 
dangerous.

503
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,360
But having said that,
you know,

504
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:07,194
nothing is ever simple and that's part 
of the reason that things are so 

505
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:11,910
annoying politically.
So,

506
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,073
you know,
one of the things that apple and 

507
00:31:15,181 --> 00:31:18,500
facebook and so forth,
those,

508
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:22,170
the large social media platforms had to 
contend with say,

509
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,483
was the attempts by organizations like 
isis to use their platforms for 

510
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,400
recruitment.

511
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,953
Now,
let's say that I'm a free speech 

512
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:32,694
absolutist,
which isn't exactly true because I 

513
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,413
realize that there are the constraints 
that he evolved in some sense naturally 

514
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,780
in the English common law system on free
speech and that they're necessary.

515
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:48,570
You can't libel someone,
you can't outright lie about someone,

516
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,404
you can't slandered them,
you can't counsel them to criminal 

517
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,730
conduct,
et Cetera.

518
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:56,940
There are restrictions on free speech 
well,

519
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,800
but I think those restrictions should be
minimal.

520
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,233
Well,
let's say that one of the restrictions 

521
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,280
you assume should be placed on free 
speech is that those that you are at war

522
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:13,950
with are not allowed to use your 
platform to recruit,

523
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,180
which doesn't seem to be an unreasonable
proposition and is perhaps even the sort

524
00:32:18,181 --> 00:32:21,150
of thing and a conservative or a 
libertarian,

525
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,440
much less a liberal or a left winger 
might get behind.

526
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,023
Well then that means that you've defined
already a framework in which is that 

527
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:34,950
censorship and or maybe I'm not thinking
this through clearly,

528
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:36,540
but is that censorship?

529
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,853
It certainly self protection.
Well then having established the 

530
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:45,020
principle that a certain amount of Mod,
what would you call,

531
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:47,870
monitoring of the use of your platform 
is necessary.

532
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,050
Where do you stop and answer is
it's complicated.

533
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,090
Um,
I think that what facebook,

534
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,780
etc. Did with Alex Jones was a big 
mistake.

535
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,510
I think that was because,
well,

536
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,450
it wasn't just Alex Jones that was 
punished,

537
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,330
let's say it was all the people that 
were watching him and not everybody that

538
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,970
was watching him was an avid follower of
him.

539
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,483
Um,
some people were just watching him to 

540
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:17,720
see what the hell he was doing and what 
he was up to.

541
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,554
And that's necessary,
but you don't just sensor the one 

542
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:21,284
person,
you censor everybody that's paying 

543
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,174
attention to them.
And then you make him a martyr and you 

544
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,563
persecute someone who's paranoid,
which all that does is validate his 

545
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:34,280
conspiracy theories is conspiratorial 
theories and the conspiratorial theories

546
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:35,270
of his followers.

547
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,883
Um,
I guess one of the things I've really 

548
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:40,274
been wondering is if the wild and woolly
reality of facebook and Youtube and 

549
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,104
twitter are actually sustainable in a 
corporate environment or if the radical 

550
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:58,370
freedom that was associated with those 
technologies was only something that was

551
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,800
possible,
when in some sense,

552
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:01,634
all of that material provision,
all the provision of that material was 

553
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,330
outside the standard legal framework 
because it was too new to regulate.

554
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,710
You know,
I can't tell,

555
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,053
I don't know if corporations can manage 
something like youtube or twitter or 

556
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:22,121
facebook for that matter because their 
internal conservatism and there,

557
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,990
and I mean that in the,
in the temperamental sense,

558
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,590
their unwillingness to take risk is,
is,

559
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:34,400
is what I mean in that particular case 
is liable to make it impossible for them

560
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,234
to be neutral purveyors of information,
some of which is going to be extremely 

561
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:39,434
radical.

562
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:42,350
So
well,

563
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:46,880
so there's,
I have no conclusions to offer there.

564
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,053
I,
and I guess I'm glad in some sense that 

565
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,554
these complicated,
these particular complicated problems 

566
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:57,140
aren't mine to solve.
I certainly think that the production of

567
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:59,780
automated sensors is a very,
very bad idea.

568
00:34:59,781 --> 00:35:00,614
But I'm also someone who's 
constitutionally opposed to such things 

569
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,184
as closed circuit TV monitor,
monitoring of the general public as 

570
00:35:08,331 --> 00:35:09,164
well.
And,

571
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,033
and cameras that,
that watch people at stoplights and any 

572
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,694
automated system that that enforces the 
law or the or what's hypothetically the 

573
00:35:20,361 --> 00:35:23,300
law to me is to be regarded with deep,
deep suspicion.

574
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,000
So,
okay.

575
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,900
That's that much of my early work deals 
with alcoholism.

576
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,450
Yes.
And with Ann at the biological level,

577
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,284
that's what I did my phd thesis on and 
much of my early published papers where 

578
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:40,500
I learned brain function because alcohol
affects every part of the brain.

579
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,490
So I had learned a lot about the brain.
What prompted my interest in that area.

580
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:47,280
And you're a parent shift,
two issues clustered around personality.

581
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,600
While I was always interested in 
motivation for drug and alcohol abuse,

582
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,650
you know what it was that drove people 
to use drugs of,

583
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,330
of,
of abuse,

584
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:58,800
let's say.
And,

585
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:01,380
um,
I got the opportunity to study at Miguel

586
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:02,214
under Dr Robert Peel,
who was an excellent supervisor and he 

587
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:07,430
was deeply involved with,
um,

588
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,060
drug and alcohol abuse research,
looking at motivation for alcoholism.

589
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:14,000
And he offered me a position in his lab 
and,

590
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,470
and that was what he was working on.
And I thought,

591
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:19,020
well,
that was one of my cardinal interests,

592
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:22,980
although perhaps not my,
my fundamental interest,

593
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:23,814
which even at that point had to do with 
motivation for totalitarianism and the 

594
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:29,250
commission of a trustee in the service 
of,

595
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,840
of group belief.

596
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,490
But I thought,
well,

597
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,324
it's a broad topic and I could learn a 
lot about biology and neurobiology as a 

598
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:40,020
consequence of working on something that
was so biological.

599
00:36:40,021 --> 00:36:40,854
So my,
my early work in psychology was 

600
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,660
extremely biologically oriented and it 
was unbelievably useful.

601
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,720
I learned a lot from the animal 
experimentalists in particular,

602
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:51,720
people like Jeffrey Gray and later Jaak 
Panksepp.

603
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,870
Um,
I have a reading list at Jordan B.

604
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,260
Peterson Dotcom that outlines some of 
those emotional,

605
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,240
so those books on emotional 
neuroscience.

606
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,720
Um,
what was my,

607
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,080
why did I shift?
While there was a variety of reasons.

608
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:12,081
One was that the National Institute of 
Alcohol Abuse and alcoholism and I aaa,

609
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,493
which funded grant research in the 
United States essentially made the 

610
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,470
corner of research I was doing with 
Robert Peale.

611
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:22,560
Impossible.
And it's part of the consequence.

612
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:23,394
I think this is one of the things that 
the universities are doing so terribly 

613
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:26,214
wrong,
is the ethics committees made our 

614
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:32,070
research impossible both to fund and to 
implement.

615
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:35,190
So here's why.
So we were bringing people into the lab.

616
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,923
So here's who we pick for subjects.
If you are going to be a subject in one 

617
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:43,920
of our experiments,
you had to be a young man and you had to

618
00:37:43,921 --> 00:37:48,450
have an alcoholic father and an 
alcoholic grandfather,

619
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:52,530
and at least one other first or second 
degree male alcoholic relative.

620
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:04,973
Hmm.

621
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,463
Well I hope I'm back again.
You know what my software updated and 

622
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,000
obviously the update has a bug,
so that's rather annoying.

623
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,080
Okay.

624
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,580
Pauly g's for that once again.

625
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,610
Yeah.

626
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,070
So back to the alcoholism discussion.
Um,

627
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:55,930
okay,

628
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,280
where was I?
Oh yes.

629
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,550
So we would get these subjects.
I mentioned who they were,

630
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,500
they were young men who weren't 
alcoholic,

631
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,130
but who drank socially,
who had an alcoholic father,

632
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,413
an alcoholic grandfather,
and at least one other male alcoholic 

633
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,310
relative.
Now why did we pick subjects like that?

634
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,173
Well,
we knew alcoholism ran in families and 

635
00:39:16,951 --> 00:39:20,250
we couldn't really study its 
transmission and women because if you're

636
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:23,730
a female alcoholic and you drink when 
you have a child in Utero,

637
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:24,564
then the child can have fetal alcohol 
syndrome and whatever abnormalities in 

638
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:32,450
psychophysiological response or 
psychopathology is,

639
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,293
might be associated with their 
alcoholism can easily be masked by the 

640
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:41,430
presence of fetal alcohol syndrome.
So we couldn't use women.

641
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:46,050
And besides alcoholism is a problem that
fundamentally characterized as men.

642
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:48,570
Although there are female alcoholics,
I think it's four to one,

643
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,910
if I remember correctly from from those 
days,

644
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,650
it's four to one male to female.

645
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,633
So it was,
we know when we thought if we 

646
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:55,584
concentrated on those who had the 
highest probability of developing 

647
00:39:58,081 --> 00:39:58,914
alcoholism because of their loaded 
family history that we could shed some 

648
00:40:01,561 --> 00:40:02,394
light on the mechanisms associated with 
alcoholism and that would be useful for 

649
00:40:04,831 --> 00:40:07,680
men and for women.
So we studied sons of male alcoholics,

650
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,380
sons of multigenerational male 
alcoholics.

651
00:40:10,381 --> 00:40:13,290
Those were our target group,
very hard populations to fight.

652
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,124
We have people hired full time to do 
nothing but find us research subjects 

653
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,294
and so we did relatively small end 
studies because we were lucky if we 

654
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:25,770
could gather four or five subjects a 
month in the Montreal urban area.

655
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:26,600
Okay.

656
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,970
Anyways,
we did discover a lot about alcoholism.

657
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:29,804
We discovered for example,
that if people with this 

658
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:36,230
multigenerational history,
a substantial proportion of them,

659
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:41,530
if they drank enough alcohol to move 
their blood level up above 0.08 which is

660
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,374
legal intoxication level,
and if they did that relatively short 

661
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,034
period of time,
then their heart rate would increase 

662
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,273
above.
I think the average was about 12 beats 

663
00:40:50,871 --> 00:40:55,871
per minute compared to the standard 
control of of zero zero or one or two.

664
00:40:56,601 --> 00:40:58,580
It was is very low.
And so,

665
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,414
and then we did figure out over time,
our whole team that that seemed to be a 

666
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:07,361
consequence of susceptibility to 
alcohol's effect on opioid production in

667
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:09,570
the brain and secondary,
uh,

668
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,513
or opioid effects on dopamine,
which is both opiates and dopamine are 

669
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,593
primarily primary reward chemicals.
So it looked to us like people with 

670
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,044
multigenerational family histories of 
alcoholism got an opiate response from 

671
00:41:21,411 --> 00:41:22,244
alcohol.

672
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,413
So,
but we had to get people drunk in order 

673
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:29,030
to find this response.
And it turned out that 0.08,

674
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,864
which was the legal limit at that time 
for driving was approximately the place 

675
00:41:32,661 --> 00:41:35,210
where we,
the psychophysiological effects and also

676
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:40,070
saw fairly pronounced cognitive and 
motor effects of alcohol because we also

677
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,980
studied that.
So now to bring it,

678
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,814
we bring people into the lab and we'd 
give them three large shots of alcohol 

679
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,700
that they consumed in 10 minutes.
We use laboratory alcohol,

680
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:53,420
which was I think 95% pure alcohol,
usually put it in orange juice.

681
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,450
Um,
and so people would be,

682
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,010
you know,
reasonably intoxicated.

683
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:01,730
And then we would let them sober up 
until they were at 0.04,

684
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:04,670
which is half legal intoxication,
which we thought was useful.

685
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,310
And then we put them into cabin and 
they'd go home and we,

686
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,473
you know,
we had our odd mishap now and then 

687
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,230
someone would throw up and that was,

688
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,970
well I'm at least getting better at 
fixing it when it screws up now.

689
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,530
So,
um,

690
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,693
you know,
and in anyways now and then we would 

691
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:28,400
have somebody who would be become ill in
the lab and that was always unpleasant.

692
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,234
But then we,
we'd also let people sober up and it 

693
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,010
actually takes quite a long time to go 
from point a to 0.04,

694
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:36,230
especially if you're a big guy cause 
your,

695
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,720
your dose of El Calls proportionate to 
your body weight.

696
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,540
And so we used to have people wait in 
the lab for a couple of hours,

697
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:44,750
you know,
and they were not very happy necessarily

698
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,150
about having to wait before we paid them
and so forth.

699
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:48,230
And,
and,

700
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,050
and if we didn't treat them 
extraordinarily well,

701
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:51,884
which we tried to do,
then of course they were much less 

702
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,580
likely to come back and participate in 
another study.

703
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,580
And since it was very difficult to get 
research subjects,

704
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,803
then we wanted to treat them very well 
apart from the fact that we would have 

705
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,160
done that anyways.
But then,

706
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,600
and I aaa said,
well,

707
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:06,434
you can't let your research subjects go 
home until they have a blood alcohol 

708
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,480
level of point.
Oh two was like,

709
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:13,340
we would have had to have people in our 
lab,

710
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,060
you know,
sobering up for

711
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,043
okay,

712
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,690
for six to eight hours.
This keeps happening.

713
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:24,400
I'm very sorry about this,
everyone.

714
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,860
Um,
I don't know what to say about it except

715
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:32,070
that that's a consequence of software 
updates,

716
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:33,720
I suppose.
Um,

717
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:39,143
anyways,
so that made it impossible because we 

718
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,590
just couldn't keep people in the lab for
that long.

719
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:46,260
All it did was annoyed them to death and
then they hated us and they,

720
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:47,094
you know,
people would get quite irritable and 

721
00:43:48,481 --> 00:43:51,510
upset and no bloody wonder.
So then also,

722
00:43:51,511 --> 00:43:52,344
and I aaa decided that half our subjects
had to be women or we couldn't get 

723
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:59,100
funding.
Well now our subjects couldn't be women.

724
00:43:59,101 --> 00:43:59,934
It was impossible to do the kind of 
research that we were doing with women 

725
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:05,130
for the reasons that I just outlined.
Well,

726
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:06,660
first of all,
um,

727
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:11,100
alcoholism doesn't affect women as much 
as it affects men.

728
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,060
Depression and anxiety tend to affect 
women more and it's perfectly reasonable

729
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:17,160
to study those things.
But that isn't what we were doing.

730
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:18,443
And uh,

731
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,513
and then we couldn't do 
multigenerational studies for genetic 

732
00:44:24,461 --> 00:44:28,300
predisposition with women because of the
fetal alcohol syndrome problem.

733
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,100
And you know,
this was something,

734
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:30,934
I think this came in under Clintons,
this re requirement for absolute gender 

735
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:38,400
equality in,
in subject selection.

736
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,234
And they didn't give a damn if that 
meant that there were certain kinds of 

737
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:43,350
research that just couldn't be done 
anymore.

738
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:47,790
And so I had to stop doing it and no 
one's really doing that kind of research

739
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,624
anymore because it's just too difficult.
It's like it was always a pain because 

740
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:52,554
it was really hard to get the subjects 
and then you had to get people quite 

741
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,403
intoxicated and then you had to deal 
with them when they were drunk and you 

742
00:44:57,871 --> 00:45:00,660
had to do your psychophysiological 
recording and all that sort of thing.

743
00:45:00,661 --> 00:45:02,610
And then they had to sober up and you 
know,

744
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:03,780
it was complicated.

745
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,950
Clinical research is unbelievably,
unbelievably complicated and difficult.

746
00:45:07,951 --> 00:45:08,784
And then yeah,
I'd like to more restrictions to it and 

747
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,220
people just go,
oh,

748
00:45:11,221 --> 00:45:12,300
okay,
well we,

749
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:13,134
I guess we won't study the 
psychophysiological consequences of 

750
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:18,450
alcohol anymore or so people would use 
low doses,

751
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:19,284
you know,
and want to get their subject's blood 

752
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:22,560
alcohol level up to like 0.02 or 
[inaudible] three.

753
00:45:22,561 --> 00:45:23,394
But that's completely irrelevant because
alcohol doesn't have much of a 

754
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:29,520
physiological effect at those low doses.
And so,

755
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,660
well this is one of the things that made
me absolutely despise ethics committees.

756
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:34,494
And I believe that the proliferation of 
ethics committees is one of the reasons 

757
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:39,620
that university research human research 
is,

758
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,490
is,
is doing badly.

759
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,640
Psychological research is doing badly.
There's a variety of reasons,

760
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,730
but that's certainly one of them.
So I was interested,

761
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:48,564
sorry this is a very long answer,
but I was interested in personality as 

762
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:51,120
well.

763
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:51,953
You know,
because I was a clinical psychologist 

764
00:45:53,161 --> 00:45:57,810
and I had read Freud and Jung and Adler 
and all the great clinicians of the 20th

765
00:45:57,811 --> 00:45:59,970
century.
And when I went to Harvard,

766
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,200
um,
I was offered,

767
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:02,101
uh,
you know,

768
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:02,670
I,
you know,

769
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,503
when you're a new faculty member there's
usually a set course that they require 

770
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:09,060
you to teach.
That's one of the core courses.

771
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:10,980
And then you have some freedom with your
other courses.

772
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,413
And so I said I'd teach personality and 
then I got more and more and we were 

773
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:19,800
looking at personality models with the 
alcoholism research too.

774
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:20,634
At that point,
the big five was starting to establish 

775
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:22,824
itself.
And I wasn't much of an admirer of the 

776
00:46:23,971 --> 00:46:24,804
big five because I like,
while I like theories as well as 

777
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,220
empirical research.
And I thought the big five,

778
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,520
while there was just no theory at all,
it was just brute force empiricism,

779
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,390
but well,
but you know,

780
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,490
that data eventually became convincing.

781
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,290
And as I got more and more interested 
in,

782
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,430
um,
in personality,

783
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:45,264
I got more and more interested in the 
use of personality and other 

784
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,163
psychometric technologies to predict 
things like academic and creative 

785
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,820
success.
You see it at mcgill,

786
00:46:57,210 --> 00:47:01,080
my bob and I and a variety of other 
people were using,

787
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,353
um,
psychological tests of various sorts to 

788
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:07,300
predict things like alcoholism and 
antisocial personality.

789
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:11,010
So we could use the big five and 
neuropsychological tests,

790
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:13,050
tests of Dorsolateral prefrontal 
function,

791
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,453
at least in principle,
to predict to some degree who might be 

792
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,290
susceptible to the development of anti 
social personality.

793
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,550
And then when I went to Harvard,
I thought,

794
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:20,911
well,
hey,

795
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:21,744
maybe we could use those tests to 
predict who was going to be good at 

796
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:27,300
things as well as who was going to be 
bad.

797
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,950
You know,
the people who are creative are the,

798
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,680
who were,
um,

799
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,380
academically,
um,

800
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,273
outstanding or people who did well as 
managers and administrators and 

801
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:38,770
corporations might do well on 
personality tests.

802
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:42,190
And,
and neuropsychological tests that assess

803
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,040
dorsolateral prefrontal functions,
that's higher order cognition.

804
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,470
So we started to put together test 
batteries that,

805
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:48,843
um,
assessed that and that was fascinating 

806
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:51,970
research.
I did that with Daniel Higgins,

807
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,953
who's the partner,
my partner in the development of the 

808
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:58,270
self authoring program and understand 
myself that things that he's labored for

809
00:47:58,271 --> 00:48:01,090
20 years on before they really became 
successful.

810
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,420
Um,
and he wrote a bang up thesis.

811
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,343
Um,
I think it was the best thing ever 

812
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:09,610
written on this,
on the topic of intelligence.

813
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,713
And,
and launched that he started working on 

814
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:13,930
in,
in 1993,

815
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:16,210
which is about the same time that the 
bell curve came out.

816
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:20,200
And so his research actually became row 
relatively politically contentious,

817
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,034
even though all we were trying to do was
trying to determine what attributes 

818
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,153
predicted success among creative people 
and among managers and administrators 

819
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,440
and in it and in academia and so forth,
pure empirical research.

820
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,070
But it became real,
very rapidly politicized anyways.

821
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,560
So I just got more and more interested 
in psychometrics,

822
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:42,394
partly because I realized way back when 
in 1993 that almost nothing that's 

823
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:47,860
psychologists measured was actually 
real.

824
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,020
And so we were interested in what was 
real.

825
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,270
And Daniel is an engineer and trained at
Mit.

826
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,780
And so he was very,
very method method,

827
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:56,873
a methodical person.
And he didn't like to move ahead with 

828
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:04,000
his research at all unless he had nailed
absolutely everything down in a way that

829
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:06,550
only an engineer and a software coder 
would.

830
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:07,983
And so we started working on personality
models and I've been doing that and 

831
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:14,020
concentrating on that more specifically 
ever since,

832
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:17,950
as well as writing the more theoretical 
material that was associated say with 12

833
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,290
rules for life in maps of meaning.
So.

834
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,170
Okay.
So that's that answer.

835
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,200
Are you aware of any of your critics?

836
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,800
Are you aware of any critics of your 
work who are deep and credible?

837
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,150
Well,
of course not.

838
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,633
Um,
someone who had a minimum had read maps 

839
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,440
of meaning.
Well,

840
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:37,570
it's a complicated question.
Um,

841
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,883
you know,
I've never read a critic of young who 

842
00:49:43,961 --> 00:49:46,180
actually understood what you and was 
talking about.

843
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:47,463
And I actually knew a number of 
scientists including Jaak Panksepp who 

844
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:52,930
wrote an affect of neuroscience,
which is a great book,

845
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,400
who is a real admirer of young and,
and the psychoanalysts.

846
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,760
I mean,
um,

847
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,463
Panksepp was very interested,
neuro psycho analysis and most of the 

848
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,940
people,
many of the people who are interested in

849
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:04,774
the F in the neuroscience of emotion,
we're also very interested in the 

850
00:50:07,861 --> 00:50:08,694
psychoanalytic types.
Most of the people who criticize young 

851
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,180
don't have a clue what he was talking 
about.

852
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:15,370
And it's not surprising cause he's very 
difficult.

853
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:16,743
No,
I haven't come across a credible critic 

854
00:50:18,971 --> 00:50:21,580
of maps of meaning.
And I think,

855
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,510
and I don't know,
I mean that may also be because,

856
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,190
you know,
until I became notorious,

857
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:31,050
let's say over the last couple of years,
it

858
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:33,890
was,
it influential.

859
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:36,920
It did pretty well.
The book did pretty well for a,

860
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,950
an academic work.
It was no massive seller,

861
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:41,770
although it's hit the best seller list 
now on the,

862
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:44,630
in the audio version,
which I think is pretty amusing.

863
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,000
And that's The New York Times bestseller
list,

864
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,070
given that they wouldn't list 12 rules 
for life.

865
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,213
Um,

866
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,370
okay.

867
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,590
So,
I don't know if the lack of criticism is

868
00:50:53,591 --> 00:50:57,100
a consequence of its lack of influence 
or

869
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,450
it's difficulty.
I've had social psychologists talk to me

870
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,400
a little bit about the ideas of maps of 
meaning.

871
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,253
And I tried to talk to them,
especially the people that are 

872
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:08,510
interested in such things as terror 
management.

873
00:51:08,511 --> 00:51:09,720
But,
um,

874
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,023
they're,
they usually don't know the 

875
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:13,790
neuropsychology and they don't know the 
mythology.

876
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,624
And there are very few people who are 
versed in the world of neuropsychology 

877
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:19,910
and in the world of mythology 
simultaneously.

878
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,590
And I'm drawing these parallels,
you know,

879
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:22,790
like,
um,

880
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,080
and they're very complicated parallels.
So I made the assumption,

881
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,033
see,
I studied these Russian 

882
00:51:28,491 --> 00:51:29,324
neuropsychologists,
vinegar Dova and Sokolov who were 

883
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,370
students of Alexander Luria brilliant 
students,

884
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,670
and they discovered this phenomena 
called the orienting reflex,

885
00:51:37,671 --> 00:51:39,560
which I wrote a lot about in maps of 
meaning.

886
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,210
And the orienting reflex is your 
automatic response to what is unknown.

887
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,650
And you have a very deep automatic 
response to what is unknown.

888
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,580
And that really means that the unknown 
is a conceptual category.

889
00:51:52,581 --> 00:51:53,414
And it was my proposition developed in 
maps of meaning that the unknown is a 

890
00:51:58,941 --> 00:51:59,774
fundamental cognitive category or maybe 
even a fundamental category of reality 

891
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,003
depending on how you define reality.
Like I'm defining reality 

892
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,310
phenomenologically as experienced,
um,

893
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,263
but as experienced universally and has 
experienced biologically by animals and 

894
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,990
by human beings,
um,

895
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,413
the unknown is something like unexplored
territory and it's reasonable to assume 

896
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:25,310
that there's a fundamental distinction 
even neurologically between the patterns

897
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:26,144
of action that are obtained in 
territories that you've thoroughly 

898
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:30,344
explored and the pattern of action 
that's necessary when you step outside 

899
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,274
the domain that you're familiar with,
where your reaction as a prey animal or 

900
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:41,210
perhaps as a Predator has to become 
paramount.

901
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,793
And so the fundamental proposition in 
maps of meaning is something like the 

902
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:50,810
domain of the unknown that's reflexively
responded to with the orienting reflex,

903
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:55,010
which is a very,
very fundamental reflex and basic to the

904
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:55,844
entire process of learning itself is 
reflected in our mythological 

905
00:53:00,591 --> 00:53:04,970
representations.
And I think that that is a absolutely.

906
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:06,180
Okay.

907
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,310
Um,
if that's true,

908
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:13,610
then it's a profound realization.
I wouldn't exactly say discovery because

909
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:15,503
I don't know if you bring two 
literatures together that have never 

910
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,400
been conjoined,
if that constitutes of discovery.

911
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,020
But I've certainly never found anyone 
who was able.

912
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,140
Okay.

913
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,973
Suggest to me any reason why I should 
assume that that hypothesis is 

914
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:32,790
incorrect.
You know what,

915
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:33,624
I've had pretty damn bright graduate 
students and they've gone off to be 

916
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:40,350
credible professors and most of them 
have maintained that viewpoint.

917
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:43,080
And I think calling the youngest 
probably foremost among them.

918
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,453
So,

919
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:46,403
mmm.

920
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,590
You know,
it would be nice actually,

921
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:50,424
if,
if I could encounter critics of maps of 

922
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:53,454
meaning who were credible because I'm 
sure there's some things in it that I 

923
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,330
wrote that were wrong.
Um,

924
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,460
and I don't know what they are.
I mean,

925
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:07,440
I'd be thinking about the damn book 
since 1982 and I'd been thinking about a

926
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:08,274
lot in my work in 12 rules for life is 
an extension of what I did in maps of 

927
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:11,844
meaning,
but I can't see holes in it and nothing 

928
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:14,814
I've learned since then.
And that might be a consequence of my 

929
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,750
own stupidity.
But a narrow mindedness is,

930
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,170
I haven't seen any reason to radically 
revise the propositions that I put forth

931
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:29,250
in maps of meaning.
I think they're credible.

932
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,653
I think the idea that,
and I think there's actually more 

933
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:36,540
evidence now that the propositions were 
correct then there were,

934
00:54:36,541 --> 00:54:39,720
when I wrote the book originally,
the idea for example,

935
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:40,554
that our hemispheres are specialized one
for action in the domain of the known 

936
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,300
and the other for action in the domain 
of the unknown.

937
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:51,240
I think that's well supported by the 
work of um,

938
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,480
what's his name?
No other student of Lyria,

939
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,130
Greenberg,
Greenberg,

940
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,210
um,
elk,

941
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,290
Conan Goldberg,
Elkhorn and Goldberg.

942
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:04,090
Um,
and Rama Shondra and as well,

943
00:55:04,091 --> 00:55:05,850
and a neuro,
uh,

944
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,270
a physician who's well versed in 
neuroscience has,

945
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,460
has,
has a theory that's quite similar.

946
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,793
Um,

947
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:14,883
so no,
I don't think maps of meaning has been 

948
00:55:16,211 --> 00:55:19,600
subject to proper critical evaluation.
So,

949
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:23,530
and then with regards to critics of my,
of 12 rules for life,

950
00:55:23,531 --> 00:55:24,364
well,
most of the time they don't criticize 

951
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:28,660
what I say.
They criticized there,

952
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,740
what would you call it?
Ideologically motivated,

953
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:35,890
pathological oversimplification of who 
they wish I was.

954
00:55:35,891 --> 00:55:38,380
So they didn't have to take anything I 
said seriously.

955
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,930
And those people don't constitute 
critics.

956
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:42,550
They constitute,

957
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,610
yeah,

958
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,560
they constitute the chattering puppets 
of,

959
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:51,703
of the,
of a certain form of ideological 

960
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:54,614
possession.
Wesley Yang reported that you met with 

961
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,460
Tech Titans,
Marc Andreessen and Peter Teal,

962
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,370
both of whom advocate decentralized 
education.

963
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:07,070
Can you share anything about this?
Um,

964
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:09,980
I dunno if I can share anything 
interesting.

965
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,500
I mean I enjoyed the meeting mark and 
Peter.

966
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:14,570
I met mark several times.
Um,

967
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,433
I've only met Peter Wants,
although I've spent some time with Eric 

968
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,140
Weinstein who works with Peter,
you know,

969
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:23,870
Peter is Libertarian oriented.
Um,

970
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,353
and so,

971
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:26,323
okay.

972
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,303
He,
he,

973
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,283
he shares concerns about the potential 
totalitarian function of Internet 

974
00:56:34,261 --> 00:56:37,740
technology and manifesting itself well 
in,

975
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:41,370
in the constant monitoring of our 
behavior and also in,

976
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,330
in the emergent censorship.
Let's say Marc Andreessen,

977
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:47,164
well mark's a smart guy and he knows a 
lot of other smart guys and we spent a 

978
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:55,180
lot of time talking about the 
possibility of online education and,

979
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,910
and,
and,

980
00:56:57,040 --> 00:57:00,160
but there isn't anything really exciting
I can report about that.

981
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,180
I mean they were all preliminary 
discussions of a sort to see if we could

982
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:06,970
get long and if we could talk and so far
we've been able to,

983
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,300
I am making a hair fair bit of headway 
with this university project,

984
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:15,850
although we don't really conceptualize 
it as a university project anymore.

985
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:16,684
We're conceptualizing it as an adaptive 
learning system and we're trying to use 

986
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:22,534
it to index people's no index knowledge 
on the web funnel money to creative 

987
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,023
producers of educational content,
allow people to test their knowledge no 

988
00:57:31,811 --> 00:57:32,644
matter how it's generated and to 
accredit people properly and we'll 

989
00:57:35,651 --> 00:57:36,484
release,
release more information about that in 

990
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:41,830
the upcoming months as we move closer 
and closer to a functional prototype.

991
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:42,873
The plan at the moment,
I've talked to lots of people like 

992
00:57:44,921 --> 00:57:45,754
Andrea said and teal who who are very 
interested in technology and education 

993
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,823
who also are very well capitalized and 
have had the opportunity multiple times 

994
00:57:54,281 --> 00:57:57,460
to pull in investors into this 
educational project.

995
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:00,820
But I haven't done that partly because 
weirdly enough,

996
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:01,654
you know,
you think money is a solution to a 

997
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:04,480
problem,
but it's also,

998
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:05,583
it's often a problem in and of itself.
And if I generated several million 

999
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:09,611
dollars,
let's say,

1000
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,690
to fund this educational
endeavor,

1001
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,733
then I would not only have to worry 
about how to design the educational 

1002
00:58:17,051 --> 00:58:17,884
system,
but then I'd have to worry about how to 

1003
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:21,640
spend that money and shepherd that money
intelligently.

1004
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,713
And that's actually a huge 
administrative problem of sufficient 

1005
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:28,780
magnitude to stop you from doing any 
creative thinking at all.

1006
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:30,363
So what we're doing instead is I'm 
funding the university project at the 

1007
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:34,324
moment or the online education project 
as a consequence of my patriot and 

1008
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,164
funding.
Fix that in about five seconds this 

1009
00:58:57,471 --> 00:58:58,790
time.
So,

1010
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,633
um,

1011
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,540
I'm funding that from my patrion 
donations in our,

1012
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:06,220
I like that model better.
The only problem is,

1013
00:59:06,221 --> 00:59:07,054
is that I would like to offer the people
that I have his employees a certain 

1014
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:12,160
amount of financial stability.
And so,

1015
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,113
and you know,
it isn't obvious to me how stable the 

1016
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:17,770
Patriot on funding is,
although it's been very stable so far,

1017
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:20,020
but you know,
who knows how that will work out.

1018
00:59:20,021 --> 00:59:25,021
So I think what we're going to do is to 
crowdfund in October or November once we

1019
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:29,570
have a minimal viable product.
And I,

1020
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:30,404
I think I'd rather do that than raise 
money privately anyways because I don't 

1021
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,710
want this project to be beholden to 
anyone.

1022
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,873
And I wanted to maintain control over 
its direction with a small group of 

1023
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:42,800
programmers.
You know,

1024
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:43,634
it's often a small group of people who 
are working tightly together that solve 

1025
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:47,600
very complicated problems.

1026
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,550
And that's certainly been the case with 
working,

1027
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:50,384
say with Daniel Higgins and Robert Peel 
on the self authoring programs and so 

1028
00:59:53,541 --> 00:59:55,010
forth.
Small team.

1029
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:56,143
We've,
we've thought about going the venture 

1030
00:59:57,111 --> 01:00:00,410
capital route and expanding and trying 
to make a big business out of it.

1031
01:00:00,411 --> 01:00:04,070
But our sense was more that it,
and maybe we were wrong about this,

1032
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:04,904
but that was better to go directly after
customers and to build the business 

1033
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:08,744
incrementally and to test it along each 
step and not to get enticed by the 

1034
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:16,760
possibility of Unicorn level money.
And so,

1035
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,470
um,
anyways,

1036
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,290
that's the,
that's the situation there.

1037
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:24,140
And I've got three really bright people 
working on this,

1038
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,353
um,
open educational platform and it's 

1039
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,590
really quite exciting.
And I would say we're,

1040
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,530
we're well ahead of schedule from where 
I thought we would be.

1041
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,633
So that's pretty cool.
Have you spoken to Nassim to lab 

1042
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,770
following your brief twitter exchange?

1043
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,810
Would love to hear a conversation with 
the two of you?

1044
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,670
I'd like to talk to him too because he's
very,

1045
01:00:43,671 --> 01:00:44,960
very smart.
He's a,

1046
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:48,780
he's touchy though and so I have some 
apprehension about that.

1047
01:00:48,781 --> 01:00:49,614
I've,
I've talked to lots of touchy people 

1048
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:53,420
over the last couple of years and I'm a 
bit apprehensive about it,

1049
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:56,150
but I would like to do that.
There's a lot of people I'd like to talk

1050
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:59,140
to.
He's one of them in and you know,

1051
01:00:59,141 --> 01:00:59,974
it's,
I'm having a hard time setting up those 

1052
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:03,770
conversations at the moment because I'm 
doing so much touring.

1053
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:04,783
I am talking again to Jonathan Heit 
though in the near future and I think 

1054
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:11,870
probably to Steven pinker as well.
And by the way,

1055
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,160
for those of you who are wondering,
um,

1056
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:18,290
I am going to release the,
and so is Sam.

1057
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:23,291
We're going to release the videos from 
the Sam Harris Peterson debates.

1058
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,330
Um,
I'll put them on my youtube channel.

1059
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,650
Sam,
we'll put them on his will,

1060
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:28,484
make them into podcasts as well.
I'm going to just release the first one 

1061
01:01:31,131 --> 01:01:35,810
on September 1st and uh,
and everyone will have access to it.

1062
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:36,833
Um,
it's taken us a while to figure out 

1063
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,074
exactly how to do this,
partly because Travis Pangbourne who 

1064
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:41,984
hosted the events,
wanted to raise some money with the 

1065
01:01:43,971 --> 01:01:45,530
videos,
um,

1066
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,510
at least in part to help offset the 
costs that he incurred for those events,

1067
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:53,030
which were very expensive,
believe it or not,

1068
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:56,780
and difficult to generate a profit for 
from on his end.

1069
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,043
Um,
and also he wants to translate the 

1070
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:05,810
material that he already has into 
multiple languages.

1071
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:10,250
So we agreed to let him when we had to 
make a three way agreement for this,

1072
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:11,084
you know,
because Sam was involved and I was 

1073
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,820
involved in,
so it was paying burn and so,

1074
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,160
and we didn't know how the events would 
go,

1075
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:16,994
you know,
so we weren't actually that concerned 

1076
01:02:17,991 --> 01:02:20,760
with the damn videos to begin with 
because we take,

1077
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:21,690
uh,
we,

1078
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,560
we'd take an,
uh,

1079
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,603
a risk.

1080
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,440
I'm not complaining about this by the 
way,

1081
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:26,940
like I'm not complaining about taking a 
risk,

1082
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:28,340
but we didn't.
Salmon,

1083
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:29,730
I hadn't even met,
you know,

1084
01:02:29,731 --> 01:02:32,370
we didn't know if you're going to have 
conversations that were worthwhile.

1085
01:02:32,371 --> 01:02:34,650
We didn't know if anybody would show up 
for the events.

1086
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:35,723
And so we were way more concerned about 
whether or not we'd get a crowd of any 

1087
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:38,784
sort,
whether the events would be successful 

1088
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:44,841
and whether we could actually talk then 
what we would do with the videos if the,

1089
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:48,180
or even if there would be videos if the 
events were successful.

1090
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,440
And so it turned out that we couldn't 
talk and we did have useful discussions.

1091
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:53,274
At least we thought so.
And the audiences responded very well 

1092
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:58,200
and there was large crowds and so it was
successful.

1093
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,420
So then it turned out that the videos 
were worthwhile,

1094
01:03:00,421 --> 01:03:05,421
but we hadn't discussed who had control 
over the videos or who was going to edit

1095
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,380
them or any of those things.

1096
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,290
And we had to do that post hoc after the
fact,

1097
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:11,124
which isn't the best way of doing it.
And then it took travis awhile to 

1098
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:16,770
assemble a team to do the actual 
editing.

1099
01:03:16,771 --> 01:03:20,190
And so that was our compromise.
And you know,

1100
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,053
it would've been better if we could have
released the videos and all of that 

1101
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,400
immediately after the talks.
But you know,

1102
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:30,000
when you're doing something new and you 
don't know exactly what you're doing,

1103
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:34,470
you're not going to do it perfectly.
And so we didn't do that perfectly,

1104
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,304
but the events were good.
And I enjoyed talking to Sam and I 

1105
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,460
learned a lot from the discussion.
I really had to sharpen my thinking.

1106
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:43,140
I really figured out something,
you know,

1107
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:43,974
I figured out that I think the 
fundamental issue here is how you take 

1108
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:51,840
the infinite world of facts that 
presents itself to you,

1109
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,900
independent of the value of those facts.

1110
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,890
So value neutral facts.
And they have to be filtered to a single

1111
01:03:58,891 --> 01:03:59,724
point,
like a single point of perception 

1112
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:02,334
because you have to point your eyes at 
one thing and your attention at one 

1113
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:05,064
thing and a single point of action.
And so there's a tremendous reducing of 

1114
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:09,564
the world of fact to the extraordinarily
simple and targeted rule of Vail or 

1115
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:15,984
world of value and your,
your brain is the instrument that does 

1116
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:21,624
that reducing and it's sort of,
it's in keeping with Elvis Huxley's 

1117
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:25,644
suppositions about and that,
and they were motivated by Henri 

1118
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,293
Bergson,
the idea that the brain was a reducing 

1119
01:04:31,501 --> 01:04:32,334
valve and that what psychedelic 
experience did was open the doors of 

1120
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:35,544
perception.
Something William Blake also talked 

1121
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:37,884
about.
The brain seems to be in some sense the 

1122
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:41,963
part of the structure that reduces the 
infinite complexity of the world of 

1123
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:49,110
facts to the finite and single point 
domain of world of values.

1124
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,153
And that's partly neurologically 
instantiated and partly sociologically 

1125
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:57,870
instantiated as we come to a negotiated 
agreement about what constitutes value,

1126
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:01,080
just like we do about what constitutes 
value economically.

1127
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,380
And so the structure that reduces facts 
to values is a reducing structure that's

1128
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:08,694
similar caneously in Stan,
Shelia instantiated neurologically and 

1129
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:14,100
sociologically.
And I understand that a lot more clearly

1130
01:05:14,101 --> 01:05:17,440
because I had these discussions with Sam
and I'm writing a lot about that in this

1131
01:05:17,441 --> 01:05:19,060
next book,
which is,

1132
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,143
it's a followup.
I s I suspect that's the plan at the 

1133
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:26,410
moment to 12 rules for life because I 
had written originally 40 rules,

1134
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:29,860
so I have more to go.
I've written about half the new book and

1135
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:30,694
I spent a lot of time writing about,
at least in part what I had to become 

1136
01:05:34,361 --> 01:05:37,090
clearer about as a consequence of my 
discussions with Harris.

1137
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,510
And so I took a look at the videos and 
I,

1138
01:05:39,511 --> 01:05:43,030
I think the debates were productive and,
and their audiences seem to find them.

1139
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:44,390
So,
and certainly salmon.

1140
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:46,360
I did,
I really enjoyed meeting him.

1141
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:49,180
We got along quite well.
He has much better sense of humor than I

1142
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:51,250
presumed from listening.
Well,

1143
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,930
from the two podcasts we did.
Of course,

1144
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:55,030
I wasn't in great humor when I did those
either.

1145
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:57,460
Um,
and you know,

1146
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:58,294
I also think that I'm also,
what would you say I'm a fan of Sam's 

1147
01:06:02,861 --> 01:06:04,390
motivation?
Uh,

1148
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,490
or at least as far as I could determine 
it.

1149
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,353
I mean he wants to ground the world of 
value in something that isn't merely 

1150
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:13,270
arbitrary revelation.
And Fair enough,

1151
01:06:13,271 --> 01:06:14,260
man,
that's a good,

1152
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:19,420
that's a good aim to ground ethics in 
something that it's solid.

1153
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,320
Um,
and,

1154
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,153
and not just arbitrary opinion,
but I think that the devil's in the 

1155
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:24,604
details.
And so that's basically what we 

1156
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:27,670
discussed.
So,

1157
01:06:27,671 --> 01:06:28,504
um,

1158
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:30,550
okay.

1159
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,383
How do you reconcile studies that show 
genetic superseding environment in life 

1160
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:37,720
outcomes with your own experience 
conducting successful psychotherapy?

1161
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,300
Yeah.
Well,

1162
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:41,890
I'll tell you one thing,
man,

1163
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,143
that I've really come to realize more 
and more in the last three or four 

1164
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:48,244
years.
Partly I would say from dealing with my 

1165
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:50,194
own health problems to some degree,
but also watching the health problems 

1166
01:06:53,711 --> 01:06:55,550
that my daughter had.
Um,

1167
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:01,300
I think a lot of what we think of as 
mental illness is physical illness.

1168
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:04,930
It's a lot more than we think even,
but,

1169
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,080
and I think that that is reflected in 
the genetic studies.

1170
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,333
Um,

1171
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,393
but I also think,
I also still think that that doesn't 

1172
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:18,220
eliminate the rule of learning.
You know,

1173
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:19,103
um,
people obviously learn and they can 

1174
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:22,054
learn better or worse and they learn 
better when they voluntary voluntarily 

1175
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:26,224
approach things that are frightening and
threatening and they challenged 

1176
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,130
themselves.
And so,

1177
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,820
um,
it's made me more humble,

1178
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:34,713
I would say in some sense both as a 
person and as a psychotherapist because 

1179
01:07:38,801 --> 01:07:39,634
I'm more attuned to the fact that the 
apparently psychological difficulties 

1180
01:07:43,841 --> 01:07:44,674
that my clients might be experiencing,
maybe a consequence of an underlying 

1181
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,970
destabilization of physical health.
I'm really unwilling to discount that.

1182
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,193
Um,
even if what they're experiencing is 

1183
01:07:54,131 --> 01:07:54,964
very idiosyncratic.
But it still seems to me that there is 

1184
01:07:58,121 --> 01:07:58,954
credible evidence that exposure to,
to what you would rather avoid is 

1185
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:05,194
curative.
And so is the weaving together of a 

1186
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:12,361
coherent and a coherent map or narrative
of your experience.

1187
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,070
I believe that those doctrines are 
solid.

1188
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,870
So,
and that's what psychotherapists do.

1189
01:08:17,871 --> 01:08:18,704
Essentially,
they help you get your story straight 

1190
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:22,310
about your past and your present and 
your future.

1191
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:24,530
They help you establish your point in 
life.

1192
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,633
They help you lay out a map so that you 
can negotiate through the territory of 

1193
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:31,010
your life,
past,

1194
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:31,844
present and future.
And they help you develop strategies to 

1195
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,574
deal with,
to help deal with emergent complexity 

1196
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:40,190
and the fear that goes along with it.
So,

1197
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:42,133
um,

1198
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,840
Michael Tom Rose House,
a very hard question.

1199
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:07,260
Please comment on young Paulie's.
That's Wolfgang Paulie's.

1200
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:08,243
Who knows?
Mundus hypothesis one world hypothesis 

1201
01:09:10,501 --> 01:09:11,780
essentially.
So that,

1202
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,570
so Michael,
Tom Ross ass,

1203
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,540
sorry,
I got frozen there again momentarily.

1204
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,290
Please comment on Yom [inaudible] Mundus
hypothesis.

1205
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:46,620
Does this correlate with quantum theory 
solutions to the hard problem?

1206
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:51,770
Eg Penrose Hameroff or church or,
or C,

1207
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:54,750
H R I don't know what orange or is.
I know penrose and Hameroff.

1208
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,870
I'm not an admirer of the pen.
Penrose and Hameroff,

1209
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,990
uh,
attempt to reduce consciousness to,

1210
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,130
to,
um,

1211
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:03,193
microtubule function,
quantum mechanics and microtubule 

1212
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,040
function.
I did my best to understand it.

1213
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,170
I couldn't,
it seemed hollow to me.

1214
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:14,670
My experience has generally been,
if I find something incomprehensible and

1215
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:16,200
hollow,
it generally is.

1216
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,260
Um,
I've read better books on consciousness,

1217
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:21,060
um,
like the user illusion,

1218
01:10:21,061 --> 01:10:23,130
which I really liked.
That's the user illusion,

1219
01:10:23,131 --> 01:10:23,964
by the way.
In Jeffrey Gray wrote a good book on 

1220
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:26,770
consciousness as well.
Um,

1221
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:28,351
the only,
and Paulie,

1222
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,720
I'm not going to be able to answer this 
question very well cause I'm starting to

1223
01:10:30,721 --> 01:10:32,860
get a bit worn out here.
Um,

1224
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:39,540
Wolfgang and Pauli and young recognized 
that,

1225
01:10:40,050 --> 01:10:42,060
man,
this is really a complicated problem.

1226
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,950
I don't know if I can,
I don't know if I can answer this.

1227
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,040
Okay,
let's try this.

1228
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,223
God,
it's been years since I thought about 

1229
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:55,620
this and wrote about it.
So we'll see how I can do.

1230
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,300
You could think about this from a 
perspective of psg,

1231
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:10,870
Hattie and constructivism.
So imagine that what you confront.

1232
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,780
Yeah.

1233
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:13,613
What you fundamentally in the world is 
what is unknowable and what is 

1234
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:22,830
unknowable has an intrinsic meaning.
It's both frightening and compelling.

1235
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:23,963
Simultaneously,
it activates Predator detection systems 

1236
01:11:28,561 --> 01:11:29,394
that protect you in the way that a prey 
animal is protected by freezing and 

1237
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:34,314
withdrawal and that sort of thing.
But it also makes you curious so that 

1238
01:11:38,191 --> 01:11:39,024
which you do not understand,
which is something that you can 

1239
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:45,240
conceptualize as that which has not yet 
been made.

1240
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:48,180
Habitable world has an intrinsic 
meaning.

1241
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,593
Now the question is whether the 
fundamental stuff of the world is that 

1242
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:58,920
meaningful unknown or something 
material.

1243
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,053
You can make the case that what we 
recognize as material is actually a 

1244
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:11,871
pragmatic reconceptualization of the 
meaning of the ambivalent meaning of the

1245
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,710
unknowable.
Now I know that that's hard.

1246
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,890
That's a hard concept,
but imagine you see,

1247
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,173
it depends on whether or not you believe
that our descriptions of material 

1248
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:27,564
reality are the superordinate 
descriptions of reality or whether our 

1249
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:34,403
conceptualization of material is 
actually a form of pragmatic tool use 

1250
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,780
that's oriented towards our survival and
this is not an easy thing to sort out.

1251
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,510
It's something that I did try to sort 
out to some degree with Sam,

1252
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:49,983
you know,
is do we have an objective description 

1253
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:53,544
of reality and his reality,
something that can be objectively 

1254
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:56,424
described or are we using a technology 
that produces so called objective 

1255
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,550
representations to facilitate our tool 
use?

1256
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,930
And it's a hard question,
right?

1257
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:09,390
Because obviously our advanced 
technology,

1258
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:14,630
which we use in a tool like fashion is a
consequence of our materialist science.

1259
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:16,043
Which begs the question,
is the science is the fundamental 

1260
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:22,260
purpose of the science descriptive or 
pragmatic?

1261
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,153
Now I think I tend to think it's 
pragmatic because I think our 

1262
01:13:25,321 --> 01:13:28,260
fundamental problem is a problem of 
survival.

1263
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,023
So there's a way of looking at the world
where the fundamental reality is the 

1264
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:39,690
chaotic potential that gives rise to 
fear and curiosity.

1265
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:42,060
And that's how your nervous system 
response by the way,

1266
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,580
and see that's interesting to me because
I would say,

1267
01:13:44,581 --> 01:13:49,581
well it's a truism of evolutionary 
biology that what your nervous system is

1268
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:51,084
adapted to what you're adapted to as a 
consequence of view three and a half 

1269
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:56,310
billion years of evolution is reality.

1270
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,620
And that there's no other real way of 
defining it.

1271
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:04,070
And so the way your brain construes 
reality is as if what you're confronting

1272
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:05,994
is an indeterminant chaotic potential 
that first generates something like 

1273
01:14:10,411 --> 01:14:13,060
apprehension,
fear and curiosity.

1274
01:14:13,061 --> 01:14:13,894
Secondarily,
the apprehension to freeze you so that 

1275
01:14:15,971 --> 01:14:16,804
you don't get eaten or destroyed and the
curiosity to allow you to engage with 

1276
01:14:20,531 --> 01:14:21,364
what's known.
And to transform it into habitable 

1277
01:14:24,011 --> 01:14:27,670
territory,
which in large part consists of tools.

1278
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,133
Now the Munis Mundus that Paulie and 
young talked about seems to me to be 

1279
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:39,781
associated with this idea of that 
chaotic potential.

1280
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:44,920
And I think that's related to the 
physicist wheeler's proposition,

1281
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:45,754
that the fundamental reality of the 
world is information rather than 

1282
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:52,270
material.
That material is a secondary,

1283
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,233
what would you call it?
It's a secondary manifestation of 

1284
01:14:57,341 --> 01:15:01,000
information.
And I think that what we confront in the

1285
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,020
world,
see,

1286
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:06,400
I don't think we're driven by the past 
and or determined by the president.

1287
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:10,180
I think what we do is we apprehend the 
potential of the future,

1288
01:15:10,181 --> 01:15:12,590
that chaotic potential of the future.
And,

1289
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:32,320
and I think that that's associated with 
a Tohu wa Bohu,

1290
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,393
which is the chaotic potential that God 
confronted with the logos at the 

1291
01:15:37,421 --> 01:15:39,250
beginning of the,
of time in Genesis.

1292
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:43,030
I think the genesis story is a 
reflection of that fundamental truth.

1293
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,360
And I think that that capability 
characterizes us.

1294
01:15:46,361 --> 01:15:51,361
And so the onus Mundus is the 
informational substrate that constitutes

1295
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:55,510
the world before it's divided into 
psyche.

1296
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:58,510
So that would be spirit.
That'd be human spirit and consciousness

1297
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,540
and material.
So there's something underneath that.

1298
01:16:01,541 --> 01:16:04,270
And this is what young and Paulie we're 
driving out in my understanding,

1299
01:16:04,271 --> 01:16:09,271
there's something underneath that which 
is the pre division unity of reality.

1300
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,350
And that's something like the Tohu wa 
Bohu or the tail,

1301
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:16,690
which is etymologically cognate by the 
way,

1302
01:16:16,691 --> 01:16:17,524
with the word Tiamat.
And Tiamat is the goddess that the 

1303
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,543
message Damien Creator,
God Marduk confronted and cut into 

1304
01:16:25,961 --> 01:16:26,794
pieces and made the world from.
So that's all outlined in maps of 

1305
01:16:29,411 --> 01:16:30,244
meaning,
although not so much the onus Mundus 

1306
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,420
hypothesis.
You know,

1307
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:35,650
and I haven't thought about that for a 
while.

1308
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:36,513
I wrote about it,
but these were in papers I never 

1309
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:39,550
published because they were too damn 
complicated.

1310
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,040
And I tried to publish them a couple of 
times with people.

1311
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:56,243
Okay.

1312
01:17:00,670 --> 01:17:04,320
But people didn't understand what I was 
talking about and you know,

1313
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,790
I hadn't even thought about,
oh man.

1314
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:25,503
Okay,
well,

1315
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:26,430
okay,

1316
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:31,430
here's a weird thing.
All right,

1317
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:03,620
well,
the rate at which my camera equipment is

1318
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:06,234
crashing seems to be accelerating.
So it appears that discussion of the 

1319
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:11,880
onus Mundus is

1320
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,950
irritating the structure of reality in 
some manner.

1321
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,870
Anyways,
let's get back to it for a minute.

1322
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:21,260
So this is a different way of 
conceptualizing the world.

1323
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,630
I think it's a phenomenological 
perspective,

1324
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:25,550
so,
and I don't know what to make of it.

1325
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:30,551
So think about it this way.
So it looks like your left hemisphere is

1326
01:18:31,191 --> 01:18:34,160
specialized for operation in territory 
that you understand.

1327
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:34,994
So it's specialized for operation in 
those places where behavioral patterns 

1328
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:39,704
have been made habitual and explicit,
whereas the right hemisphere is 

1329
01:18:43,461 --> 01:18:47,390
specialized for response to chaos itself
to the unknown.

1330
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:51,770
And what that implies is that the 
division that's expressed,

1331
01:18:51,771 --> 01:18:52,604
for example in the in Yang symbol,
which is essentially chaos and order is 

1332
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:56,474
actually actually represents something 
fundamental about the structure of 

1333
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,220
reality.
Now you might say,

1334
01:19:01,221 --> 01:19:02,054
well only the structure of reality in so
far as biological organisms 

1335
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:05,804
conceptualize it,
but I don't know if we can talk about 

1336
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:11,810
the structure of reality outside the 
conceptions of biological organisms.

1337
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:12,883
Like if you're a strict believer in 
objective material reality in that 

1338
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:18,170
transcended existence of strict material
reality,

1339
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:19,430
then you might say,
well,

1340
01:19:19,431 --> 01:19:20,264
you,
of course you could talk about it 

1341
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:21,494
because strict material reality exists 
in the absence of biology and 

1342
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,634
consciousness,
but it isn't so obvious to me that 

1343
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:33,280
material reality does exist in the 
absence of consciousness because I can't

1344
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:37,250
conceptualize what existence would mean 
in the absence of consciousness.

1345
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:39,500
Like is there time?
Is their duration,

1346
01:19:39,501 --> 01:19:42,740
is their size?
All of these things are relative.

1347
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,753
In some sense.
All of these things presuppose a 

1348
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:48,560
conscious observer even in the 
materialist description.

1349
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:54,430
So it looks to me like what reality is 
is this newness Mundus that union Paulie

1350
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:57,890
we're pointing to,
it's chaotic potential.

1351
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,903
Now,
I also think that we treat each other 

1352
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:03,410
that way.
So if I'm treating you properly,

1353
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,483
then I treat you as if you're a moral 
agent who is actively engaged in the 

1354
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:08,574
transformation of the chaotic potential 
that manifest itself as the dawning of 

1355
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:15,570
the future,
and that attracts your attention.

1356
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:18,070
I treat you as if you're an act of moral
engage,

1357
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:19,103
active moral agent,
engaged in making the moral decisions 

1358
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:25,770
that determine how that potential is 
going to manifest itself.

1359
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:29,100
And if I don't treat you that way,
then I'm patronizing.

1360
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:29,934
I don't give you your full,
I don't grant you your full stature as 

1361
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:35,760
an,
as a a sovereign being.

1362
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:40,680
And I impinge upon your knit at your 
intrinsic value,

1363
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:44,430
the same value that that allows you to 
claim,

1364
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:48,000
um,
the existence of natural rights and also

1365
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,460
the presence I would say,
of natural responsibility.

1366
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,473
So I treat you as if you're well,
I would say made in the image of God in 

1367
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:56,454
the genesis terminology that you are 
part of the process that turns the Tohu 

1368
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:05,040
wa Bohu of should I never pronounced 
properly,

1369
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,620
um,
into habitable order.

1370
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:10,530
And I think that that's the soonest 
Mundus.

1371
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:14,040
And I think that that's reflected in 
your neurological structure.

1372
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:14,873
And I think the fact that it's reflected
in your neurological structure and in 

1373
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:18,054
the neurological structure of animals 
with this almost universal dual 

1374
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:27,450
hemisphere neurological structure,
which also by the way is it is something

1375
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:29,400
that's necessary even in neural 
networks,

1376
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,080
which is where we got the idea for 
plasticity and stability by the way,

1377
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:34,914
for the in the big five aspects,
scale models in the higher order 

1378
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:38,670
personality factors.
Um,

1379
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,463
I think the fact that that bifurcation 
is reflected in neurology is a 

1380
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,930
reflection of the fact that it's,
it exists in reality.

1381
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,990
Now of course,
defining reality is no simple thing.

1382
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,580
You know,
it's,

1383
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,250
you can think about it as an objective 
materials,

1384
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:01,020
but you can also think of reality as the
sum total of that which is experienced.

1385
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,063
And those aren't the same things.
They aren't the same fundamental 

1386
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:05,034
presuppositions.
And I think that we've predicated our 

1387
01:22:08,431 --> 01:22:09,264
society in so far as our society is 
functional on the proposition that each 

1388
01:22:14,371 --> 01:22:18,380
individual is a sovereign entity.
Um,

1389
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,733
what would you say characterized by a 
spark of divinity that uses the 

1390
01:22:23,431 --> 01:22:24,264
responsible truthful word to confront 
the chaos of potential and generate the 

1391
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,900
habitable order?
That is good.

1392
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:32,393
I think,

1393
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,693
I think we act out and look guys,
I'm going to call it a night eight 

1394
01:22:54,231 --> 01:22:55,064
because obviously this has gotta be 
getting somewhat annoying for you to be 

1395
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:03,871
constantly interrupted by these idiot 
software crashes and um,

1396
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:07,990
it's also approaching nine o'clock.
So even with the delays,

1397
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:12,991
that's a good hour and a half.
And so I think maybe we'll call it a day

1398
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:16,360
and um,
I didn't get too many questions,

1399
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:18,400
although some of them were very,
very complicated.

1400
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:19,234
And I would like to thank you for tuning
in and maybe I can remind you again 

1401
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,103
about self authoring Dotcom and 
understand myself.com and the discount 

1402
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:31,204
coupon code September.
So if you guys want to try out those 

1403
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:36,880
programs,
I think they're real helpful and I think

1404
01:23:36,881 --> 01:23:40,000
that's how people experience them.
Then you can do that.

1405
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:40,834
And then all have another q and a 
probably I would say probably in mid 

1406
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:51,130
October because I'm on the road now.
You can see that in Jordan B.

1407
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:51,491
Peterson.
Dot.

1408
01:23:51,491 --> 01:23:53,160
Call Matt Events.
Um,

1409
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,123
I'm on the road now until mid October.
And so I'll do another q and a then and 

1410
01:24:00,401 --> 01:24:01,234
hopefully have an update on the 
educational progress of the educational 

1411
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:06,070
material and all of that.
And so,

1412
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:09,850
um,
thanks very much for tuning in and,

1413
01:24:09,851 --> 01:24:11,680
uh,
I hope you enjoyed the discussion.

1414
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:17,020
It got quite well far beyond what I 
thought it would get too.

1415
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:18,063
I haven't talked about that newness 
Mundus idea for a long time and it's 

1416
01:24:20,801 --> 01:24:22,210
very,
very radical idea.

1417
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,410
It's sort of central.

1418
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,100
That idea is central,
I would say,

1419
01:24:46,101 --> 01:24:46,934
or at least central in an implicit sense
to maps of meaning and God fucking 

1420
01:24:53,871 --> 01:24:54,704
thing.

1421
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:01,693
Yeah.

1422
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,010
All right,
well look,

1423
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:04,873
obviously the technological problems are
mounting it exponentially by all 

1424
01:25:09,441 --> 01:25:12,230
appearances.
So I'm going to call it a night.

1425
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,200
Thank you very much.
And uh,

1426
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,760
good luck to all of you.
Get your lives together,

1427
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:17,870
man.
It's,

1428
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,990
it'd be a good thing for everyone,
including you,

1429
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:26,740
but also everyone else and maybe the 
structure of the world itself.

1430
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:30,850
I really believe that's true by the way.
So for what that's worth.

1431
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:31,750
Okay,
guys.

1432
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,583
Bye.

1433
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:41,443
Okay.
