1
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm here today with in a new place 
trying out something new.

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm talking to Charlie Kirk and Charlie 
is a native of Chicago and he's been 

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,091
working,
building an organization in the US to 

4
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:29,700
promote free speech on campuses for,
for how long now?

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,320
It's been six years now.
Okay.

6
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:36,321
Well I'm gonna let you take it away and 
tell people exactly what you've been up 

7
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:36,321
to.
Sure.

8
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:36,321
So I,
uh,

9
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:39,190
started this organization called turning
point USA when I was 18 years old.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,230
Uh,
took a very unusual path to it.

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,010
I decided to start this movement instead
of going to college.

12
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,070
I saw something brewing in the states 
that I felt more instinctual than 

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,470
anything else,
that there was a countercultural kind of

14
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,590
revolution that needed to happen on our 
college and high school campuses.

15
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:01,591
And I saw it through social media and I 
saw it from my local high school 

16
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:05,191
community that my generation was being 
so inundated with cultural Marxism and 

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,000
also economic Marxism,
but even worse,

18
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:12,001
it was a cultural side of it and that my
generation was yearning for a different 

19
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,280
perspective and political viewpoint or 
at least ideological diversity.

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,860
And the capacity to have your viewpoints
challenged.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,030
So it started as kind of a whim.
Um,

22
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,830
has ended up to be a quite large success
when I started this organization,

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,420
I had no idea what I was doing.

24
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,430
I had no political connections and no 
money.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,750
So,
um,

26
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,550
that,
uh,

27
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,630
that was a good start.
So what,

28
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,060
so you,
you started thinking about this when you

29
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,310
were in high school.
That's great.

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,560
Okay.
So what happened in high school and how 

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:40,930
did you come to these conclusions and 
what motivated you?

32
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,030
Always loved history,
economics,

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:47,170
and of the more conservative persuasion.
My lifelong ambition.

34
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:49,810
I wanted to go to the United States 
Military Academy at West Point,

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,360
which is a very difficult school to get 
into in the states.

36
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:58,361
So I got my congressional nomination,
which is the first of a two step 

37
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,250
process.
And then I ended up being waitlisted and

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,140
denied,
uh,

39
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,440
my senior year of high school,
which totally shattered me,

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,810
but ended up being the best thing that 
ever happened to me,

41
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,470
uh,
because it really made me reflect on who

42
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:13,471
I was and what I wanted to do.
And what I realized is my motivation to 

43
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:16,891
go to the military academy was that I 
was a patriot and I love my country and 

44
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:20,341
I wanted to serve in some capacity,
but I felt like the west was under 

45
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:20,740
attack and I still feel that to this 
day.

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,620
So.
And so why do you think you develop

47
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,690
the sense of patriotism and in say 
junior high and high school when,

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,010
when that is increasingly lacking?
I would say not only locking,

49
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:33,680
but seriously criticized.
What made you different?

50
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,840
It's difficult to say.
I definitely love my country based on my

51
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,010
upbringing,
but my,

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,050
my,
my,

53
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,050
my,
my parents are generally center,

54
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:42,660
right people.
And we're always taught,

55
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,970
you know,
patriotic values from a young age.

56
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:46,440
Read the constitution,
you know,

57
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,060
around the dinner table,
things like that.

58
00:02:48,061 --> 00:02:51,330
But I'm disagreeable by nature.
And so when my parents,

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
when my teachers would go out of their 
way to make anti American or anti 

60
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,201
patriotic statements and only made me 
reaffirm my own beliefs and dig in 

61
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:00,850
deeper and want to challenge that even 
more,

62
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,480
which I then sought out the great 
thinkers of the American founding,

63
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,950
the federalist papers,
the US Constitution,

64
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:11,951
and down that rabbit hole I went to the 
great thinkers that created Western 

65
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,910
civilization both intentionally and 
unintentionally,

66
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,680
whether it be aristotle and all the 
great enlightened,

67
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,710
you know,
thousands of years of writings that the 

68
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,710
founding fathers drew inspiration from.

69
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,060
And did you do that on your own?
That's correct.

70
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:27,061
It was autodidactic.
So it was self taught in middle school 

71
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:27,061
as well,
but it was,

72
00:03:27,061 --> 00:03:31,921
it was driven by this inspiration of I 
want it to be able to effectively 

73
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:36,040
articulate my beliefs and values and 
ideas to a core of teachers that felt as

74
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,530
if they had to indoctrinate me to hate 
America,

75
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,600
hate free enterprise and hate free 
speech.

76
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,030
So I grew up in a rather generally 
liberal area.

77
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:47,140
The northwest suburbs of Chicago and the
teacher community for the most part,

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,710
they were not trying to allow a free 
flow of ideas.

79
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,910
They were trying to impose a specific 
doctrine upon their students and being a

80
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,940
disagreeable contrarian by nature,
I would always debate them and I would 

81
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,160
find satisfaction and proving them wrong
as you know,

82
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,530
as wrong or right is that might be.
That's just who I was.

83
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,600
So we always have been.
And then by doing so I sought out these 

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,500
books.
I sat out these ideas and I found Milton

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Friedman and I found individuals that,
that articulated what I knew to be true 

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,820
and I only went down that path even 
further.

87
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,460
So what did that do for your social 
life?

88
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,080
Just out of curiosity,
how were your,

89
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,390
how were your peers reacting to this?
Um,

90
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,660
so it's quite interesting you,
you mentioned that throughout high 

91
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,001
school I was heavily involved in 
football and basketball and it 

92
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,460
generally,
well liked individual,

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,480
um,
ever since my graduation of high school 

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:38,500
in my entrance into political and social
activism,

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,310
the hostility towards my from my high 
school community towards me has been 

96
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,410
extreme.
And I'm not trying to play a victim.

97
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,700
I'm fine with it.
I really.

98
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,720
Those people were never my friends.
They just pretended to be them to be,

99
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,480
to be as such.

100
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,690
But it's amazing to me that you just 
have a different viewpoint on how the 

101
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,690
world should work.
That people on the left will immediately

102
00:04:55,691 --> 00:04:58,030
ostracize you and categorize you 
differently.

103
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,140
And I always say,
you know,

104
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:04,141
I'm a conservative.
I don't look at people that are on the 

105
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,691
left any differently than I did.
I looked at who they are as a character 

106
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:07,690
and as a person.
And the politics are just layered on top

107
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,550
of that.
The left is completely different,

108
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,950
is if you disagree with them.
That's who you become.

109
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,200
And I think that's one of the most 
cancerous and divisive aspects of modern

110
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,190
political culture today is that,
um,

111
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,250
especially my generation,
if you dare not be a leftist or dare not

112
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,400
be a liberal,
then you're somehow less human or you're

113
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:32,401
somehow less acceptable to them or 
you're immediately intolerant or racist 

114
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,580
or bigoted or homophobic.

115
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,870
Which of course is untrue.
But it's almost as if they view you as a

116
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:42,871
subspecies of them,
which I'm experiencing every day and 

117
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:43,090
some of the categorizations thrown 
towards you.

118
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,470
It seems that in popular culture that 
remains consistent.

119
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:46,850
So,
so.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,480
Okay.
So tell me about your organization.

121
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,610
Tell me its scope now and in what should
be doing and then we can talk about how 

122
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:54,760
you built it.
Of course.

123
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:58,160
So we're on 1300 college in high school 
campuses across the states.

124
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
We have 115 people on full time staff 
and last year we raised 10 and a half 

125
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,080
million dollars a with 25,000
active donors and some big ones,

126
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,420
some small ones with some of the 
largest,

127
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,900
most successful American business people
that had been investing in us.

128
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,860
And I just started it from nothing,
just I traveled 340 days a year,

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:20,910
um,
and meeting with investors and business 

130
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,880
people and entrepreneurs that are 
worried that America is in grave decline

131
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,150
and I'm able to present them with a 
strategy and a plan and a vision that 

132
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,820
can help turn that around.

133
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,820
No Pun intended,
a organization's called turning point 

134
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,161
USA.
And so we host the nations largest 

135
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:36,161
annual gathering of young conservatives 
will have 5,000

136
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:41,081
students there this upcoming December,
of which you're the most requested 

137
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:41,840
speaker off the charts I might add.
Um,

138
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,500
and the scope of the organization is 
dramatic and immense.

139
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,960
Will we have a young women's leadership 
summit in June.

140
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,590
We'll have 1200 young ladies from across
from all 50 states attend,

141
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,190
that's in June in Dallas,
Texas.

142
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Um,
and so we will host over 100 events a 

143
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,951
year off campus with over 250 student 
activists and leaders that we train 

144
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:06,620
towards what I like to call more 
principle based activism things that,

145
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,110
you know,
created the West free speech dialogue,

146
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,690
a free enterprise private property 
rights,

147
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,570
natural rights,
really diving into the deep ideas,

148
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:19,571
not this sort of social justice left 
this activism that is taught from our 

149
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:19,571
lecture halls.

150
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,790
Um,
so the scope of the organization has 

151
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,790
really grown dramatically.
We're on a $15,000,000

152
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,270
budget this year.
Um,

153
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,310
and it's,
it's been quite an experience and a 

154
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,770
blessing to say the least right place,
right time with a great group of people.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,980
And how many,
how many campuses now a 1300 college and

156
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,170
high school campuses represented 
throughout the states.

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
And so what's happening at the high 
school level,

158
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,220
chapter development,
it's quite interesting.

159
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
We have seen an explosion of high school
interest and chapter development over 

160
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,391
the last couple of years,
especially because the activism that is 

161
00:07:49,391 --> 00:07:53,441
so prevalent in our colleges has now 
stepped down into our high schools and 

162
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:57,920
so students that are finding my videos 
are finding Dave and or Ben Shapiro,

163
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,410
Dennis Prager,
your content there are now 14,

164
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,740
15 and 16 and they seek out that content
because they have to,

165
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:08,741
if they want to be able to defend their 
beliefs because it used to be that 

166
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,490
college used to be the only place that 
these ideas were really.

167
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,820
I'm not the only place I should say,
but the,

168
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,250
the,
the,

169
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,610
the main focus of the left was colleges 
no more.

170
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,170
I mean they are teaching the,
the beginning stages of postmodernism as

171
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:24,580
early as freshman year in high school 
where there is no such thing.

172
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:24,680
Yeah.

173
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,920
Stereo is early as grade one.
That's correct.

174
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,880
Yeah,
that's right.

175
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:33,800
So in Ontario,
the elementary teachers association,

176
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,070
that's not quite the right name,
maybe,

177
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:40,010
so Ontario Teachers' federation and I 
can't remember at the moment,

178
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:45,011
but they've put in a,
they put together a social justice 

179
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:45,290
curriculum from grade one to grade 
eight,

180
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:49,730
which even bends the study of literature
itself in a social justice direction.

181
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:54,731
So there so shameless that they're 
willing to bend art to the purposes 

182
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,370
political propaganda.

183
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
It's stunning.
It is.

184
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:02,561
It's quite remarkable.
So what do you expect from the high 

185
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:02,561
school chapters?
What do you,

186
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,800
what is it that they're doing that you 
think is good and useful?

187
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
So it's,
it's a different strategy and it's 

188
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,940
different implementation that are staff.
Staff goes about when they deal with 

189
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,871
high school students.
The number one thing with high school 

190
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,421
students,
the high school chapters that we deal 

191
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:17,760
with is trying to make it culturally 
acceptable to believe these conservative

192
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,610
ideas.
So even if they meet weekly and bring in

193
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,050
a guest speaker of a local,
you know,

194
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,160
political nature or they watch video,
it's much more of a comradery building 

195
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,181
activity in high school than in college.
And I say that because in the mindset of

196
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:34,560
being in high school is quite different 
in college,

197
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,140
you're,
you're entering into kind of that rugged

198
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:40,290
independence.
I want to rebel or conform to my parents

199
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:45,291
ideology in high school,
you still are still very much anchored 

200
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:49,100
to your local and cultural institutions,
your high school football team or 

201
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,620
basketball team.

202
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,150
And so,
but we've here.

203
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,370
That's exactly right.
Whereas College,

204
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,480
by the time the dynamic of the geography
of college you break,

205
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,280
you try to break out of that.
Um,

206
00:09:59,281 --> 00:09:59,940
but we,
we,

207
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:04,941
we,
we try to hold them the high school 

208
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:06,090
chapters to a specific standard of at 
least meeting weekly,

209
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:08,130
trying to go to some of our big national
events,

210
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,310
hosting guest speakers,
debates and lectures.

211
00:10:10,311 --> 00:10:14,250
So a great example is in the states,
there was that horrific shooting down in

212
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:19,251
Parkland high school.
I'm going to go down and I'm actually 

213
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:19,500
going down to MSD,
um,

214
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,040
uh,
the,

215
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:25,041
uh,
the school where the shooting took 

216
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,041
place.
I'm going to give a speech on the second

217
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,041
amendment,
natural rights.

218
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:29,240
They're not allowing me on campus,
but I'm doing it right across the 

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,240
street.
So that's one of the groups,

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,090
we have a Tuesday coming up this 
Tuesday.

221
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,900
They say it's highly controversial,
which I don't consider it to be.

222
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Um,
the second amendment is,

223
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,120
some would say a controversial thing.
People that aren't in the states by the 

224
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,150
first amendment is controverted.
That's exactly,

225
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,480
that's what I was going to say is that 
the idea of natural rights doesn't,

226
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,940
shouldn't offend anyone,
but unfortunately it does.

227
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:52,941
So that's one example of an event that I
have on a high school kind of arena that

228
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm doing coming on.
Okay.

229
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,430
And then at the university level you 
have,

230
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,150
you said 1,513,
so 1300 is the number of high school and

231
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:03,420
college combined.
So that's divided about 900 college,

232
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,510
400 high school.
Do you have any estimate for total 

233
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,510
membership?
It's difficult to say.

234
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,311
So to give you an idea,
we had 3000 students attend our annual 

235
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,300
meeting last year and we had over 14,000
applications.

236
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,820
Um,
and so membership as well beyond that.

237
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,110
Um,
but it's definitely the tens of 

238
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,110
thousands are total data list is in the 
hundreds of thousands.

239
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,340
We have over million facebook followers,
either half a million followers on 

240
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,390
twitter memberships.
A very difficult thing to pinpoint.

241
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
We don't want to define.
That's correct.

242
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:37,161
We don't want to be like the arp where 
you have 7 million people on your 

243
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:37,161
mailing list and you pretend they're all
members,

244
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:41,900
but I were very much more into the 
quality of leadership than the quantity 

245
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:41,900
of leaders,
so that's the one thing.

246
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,940
I'd rather have 100 dedicated,
principled,

247
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,220
a movement driven student leaders than a
thousand that are just kind of 

248
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,010
lackluster and are there for the free 
pizza or pop [inaudible] and what are 

249
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,680
you hoping for from the university 
chapters,

250
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,670
so that's much more disruptive.
We want to challenge the status quo,

251
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:05,671
head on and do everything we possibly 
can to try to change the trajectory of 

252
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:09,940
our organ of our generation.
And so our organization offers that in a

253
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,520
lot of different ways,
whether it be offering guest speakers on

254
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:13,630
campus such as myself.

255
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:18,630
So this last week I spoke at the 
University of California Berkeley and 

256
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:18,630
University of California,
Los Angeles,

257
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,250
a UC Berkeley and Ucla.
One day after the other,

258
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:24,130
we had a packed house,
a every seat filled.

259
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,320
We had a lot of protestors,
a lot of opposition,

260
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,840
hundreds of thousands of people watch 
the live stream.

261
00:12:28,841 --> 00:12:30,940
That live stream will hit a million 
people on.

262
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,970
I'm kind of going a retroactive views 
happening right now throughout this next

263
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,400
week.
But you said you were there with Ruben 

264
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,140
and that's great.
I was there with Dave Rubin and Candice 

265
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Owens.
Candice Owens works for us.

266
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,780
She's our communications director.
Oh,

267
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,380
okay.
Yeah,

268
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:45,910
so candice is a superstar.
In fact,

269
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:48,850
she just got a nice shout out from Kanye
West saying,

270
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,980
I love the way candace owens thinks,
which honestly is a.

271
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,340
it's hard to even put into words the 
significance of a rap.

272
00:12:57,341 --> 00:13:02,341
Artists like him singling out a 
conservative minded pundant like 

273
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:07,051
candice.
I think there's a seismic shift 

274
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:08,941
happening in American,
the black community that is going to be 

275
00:13:08,941 --> 00:13:10,370
a generational ideological civil war in 
the words of Canada.

276
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,880
So and so.
We went to UC Berkeley and Ucla,

277
00:13:12,881 --> 00:13:17,881
and what's interesting about Candice 
Owens is she uses identity politics 

278
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:21,331
against the left and so truth is truth 
should be colorblind and any individuals

279
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,050
should be able to say what they want to 
say despite their skin color,

280
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,580
their gender unfortunately is not the 
case on a college campus.

281
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,950
So I'll say something that might trigger
the audience,

282
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:34,951
but candace will say that and they're 
perfectly okay with that and that 

283
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:38,311
shouldn't be the case,
but that just shows how it must be 

284
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:41,911
harder for her on the contrary side to 
be conservative and block without a 

285
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,540
doubt.
And the,

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,420
the,
the societal punishment she receives for

287
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:48,670
that is horrific.
Like what,

288
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,440
what's happening?
What are the things that they see?

289
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,960
The words they call her.
I wouldn't even repeat on camera,

290
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:56,290
but you know,
the nice ones are uncle Tom Coon,

291
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,400
things of that nature.

292
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,310
Um,
she has a very,

293
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,460
just the harsh backlash for what she 
believes in,

294
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:08,461
what she feels because how dare she 
stray away from the ideological monopoly

295
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:11,200
that the left has on the black 
community.

296
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:12,550
And for those that people that don't 
know,

297
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:15,880
that might be watching internationally,
the Democrat Party receives 90,

298
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:19,030
sixth and 97 percent of all black voters
in America,

299
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,670
despite the Democrat policies having 
the,

300
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,500
the worst impact on the black community.
And so candice is trying to wake up that

301
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:31,501
community and so we're happy to have her
as our communications director and help 

302
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:31,501
enhance her,
her,

303
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:35,611
um,
her vision to try to a least get people 

304
00:14:35,611 --> 00:14:35,611
to think differently.

305
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,920
I'm going to talk to Warren Farrell 
later today.

306
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,020
And he just wrote a book called the boy 
crisis.

307
00:14:41,021 --> 00:14:46,021
And in there he talks a fair bit about 
the pernicious effects of 

308
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:49,351
fatherlessness.
And that's something that I'm very 

309
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:49,351
interested in,
in,

310
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:49,351
in,
in Ontario,

311
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:54,271
we have as part of standard political 
policy that all families are equal,

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
you know.
And the idea there is that respect 

313
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,020
should be given to familial units 
regardless of their structure.

314
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,410
And you know,
there's something to be said for that 

315
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,410
because people have to struggle through 
life the best they can,

316
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,690
whether they're single parents are or 
regardless of how they put their family 

317
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:17,921
together.
But the empirical data on the 

318
00:15:17,921 --> 00:15:20,440
catastrophe of fatherlessness is 
extraordinarily solid in deep and it 

319
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,701
seems to be something in principle 
that's a particular place for the black 

320
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:25,610
community that's currently.
I guess I'm wondering too,

321
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,190
like with the conservative approach to 
that are,

322
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,270
are,
have you guys focused on the problems of

323
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:34,110
fatherlessness and,
and what,

324
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,420
what's your take on that?

325
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Oh,
and without a,

326
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,580
without a doubt,
if I had to pinpoint one,

327
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,670
um,
societal trend that has harmed the black

328
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,270
community most who'd be the rise of 
single motherhood in the US.

329
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,510
So to give a number just to,
to so people understand the single 

330
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,751
motherhood rate in the 19 sixties,
about 18 percent in the black community 

331
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:58,140
now 77 percent,
77 percent of us blacks will grow up 

332
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,000
never knowing their father if there is 
no,

333
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,030
there's no rational argument that,
that is healthy for a society.

334
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,300
And the reason for that,
there's an article in the Atlantic 

335
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,490
monthly just two weeks ago showing that 
which is,

336
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,230
which is more notable,
right?

337
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:14,380
Because it's not like the Atlantic is a 
right leaning magazine anything,

338
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:15,450
but yeah.
Yeah.

339
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,500
And you know,
I mean,

340
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,090
they can be

341
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:22,170
and handed when they're at their best 
and they reviewed the new evidence that 

342
00:16:22,601 --> 00:16:27,601
was presented in this research paper,
which I also read showing that if you 

343
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:32,401
look at those few locales where poor 
black people and poor white people do 

344
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:37,501
approximately as well,
if you track them over as a reasonable 

345
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:37,920
amount of time,
um,

346
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,340
the,
the thing that characterizes the high 

347
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,980
functioning poor poorer places is the 
presence of fathers.

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,120
That's

349
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,120
exactly right.
They said that not only the researchers 

350
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,170
claim that not only was that good in the
immediate family,

351
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:58,310
so they have your father around,
but in neighborhoods where having 

352
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,301
fathers around is the norm.
Every boy in particular does better in 

353
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,170
the neighborhood since right?
And every single crime goes down,

354
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:09,240
the likelihood of not going to prison 
obviously goes down.

355
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,370
But the interesting questions we have to
ask why?

356
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,410
So we as conservatives always try to 
ask,

357
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,590
what is the reason this is happening at?
Whereas the left,

358
00:17:16,591 --> 00:17:19,800
I don't always think they go through 
that or they ignore it willingly.

359
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,550
The reason is because the great society 
that was passed by Lyndon Baines Johnson

360
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:28,551
in the 19 sixties where the US 
government literally subsidized single 

361
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:33,411
motherhood where if you got married,
you lost your government check and it 

362
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:37,671
still exists to this day in the states 
where the idea and the intention was,

363
00:17:37,861 --> 00:17:39,510
well,
let's try to help single mothers.

364
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,950
Okay,
that's fine.

365
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't think anyone doesn't.
Doesn't want to help single mothers.

366
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,970
The problem is as soon as you get 
married,

367
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:49,971
you lose that checked because it was a 
program designed for single motherhood 

368
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:51,210
and so you incentivize bad behavior.
You get more of it,

369
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,700
and that's exactly what you've seen in 
the states.

370
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:58,701
You couple that with a disastrous public
education system run by public sector 

371
00:17:58,701 --> 00:18:01,290
teacher unions that have no 
accountability protected by tenure,

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,500
and I'm really embrace mediocrity.
It's highest form with I'm failing urban

373
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:12,831
cities with Democrat mayors that have no
grasp of free enterprise or how to 

374
00:18:12,831 --> 00:18:16,701
properly run any sort of organization,
let alone a massive municipality or 

375
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:20,900
city.
That's why you have the black community 

376
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:20,900
failing so much.
The final point I'll say is this,

377
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,580
in the states,
the two poorest communities by race,

378
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:24,530
if you will,
um,

379
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,300
are the two communities that receive the
most government assistance per capita,

380
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,820
the native American community and the 
African American community.

381
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,120
And so we can draw a direct correlation 
in distinction between the rise of the 

382
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,730
welfare state in America and actually 
the decline of the black community,

383
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:43,731
native American community and,
but the solution to that is black 

384
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:46,911
fathers.
And so we always say black fathers 

385
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:46,911
matter whether it seems

386
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,650
to be an employment issue too.
And I mean that's a complicated problem 

387
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,411
because you know that the employment 
market for people who are less skilled 

388
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:53,750
has,
has been,

389
00:18:53,751 --> 00:18:54,710
I would say,
in decline,

390
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,670
especially on the male end of the 
distribution.

391
00:18:56,671 --> 00:19:01,671
And one of the stats that feral sites is
that three quarters of women will not 

392
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,560
consider seriously dating and unemployed
man.

393
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,890
Whereas one third of men would have a 
problem dating an unemployed woman.

394
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,300
So there's obviously a gender bias 
there.

395
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:19,301
And I think there's a reason for that.
I think that it's grounded and it's 

396
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:21,560
grounded in both rationality and 
evolutionary biology.

397
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:26,561
The evolutionary biology element is that
women across cultures tend to mate 

398
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,480
across and up hierarchies,
let's say.

399
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,660
That's right,
and the reason for that I think is that 

400
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,690
there are logically,
and this is where the logic comes in as 

401
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,561
well as the biology.
They're looking for a partner that can 

402
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,620
be of substantial economic utility,
practical utility when they put 

403
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,460
themselves in the vulnerable position of
having a child.

404
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:51,910
So then you also have this additional 
problem is if the employment situation 

405
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,530
tanks in any serious way than men become
less desirable as partners and your 

406
00:19:56,721 --> 00:20:01,721
claim.
I guess in part is that by filling that 

407
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,941
void,
the government actually contributes to 

408
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:04,010
the problem rather than than addressing 
it.

409
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,070
It's exactly.
That's tied in I suppose too,

410
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,930
with the high rates of incarceration for
black people in the united

411
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,990
given negative feedback loop where you 
get more of that bad behavior.

412
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:15,440
So the black fathers go to prison,
so they're not there to raise the kids.

413
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,450
The kids go to gangs,
so they'll end up either dead in prison,

414
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,490
hopeless or completely directionless.
The black single mothers who want to 

415
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,980
continue to do what's right for the 
community,

416
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,870
they have a,
they're left with very few choices,

417
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,840
have more kids,
so it's a negative feedback loop,

418
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,610
so you have,
you have bad behavior,

419
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:37,190
reinforcing bad behavior,
subsidized by the government.

420
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,550
Then you have the complete destruction 
of what used to be a somewhat civilized 

421
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:48,310
portion of American life,
which if you look at the worst areas in 

422
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:48,310
America,
it's the inner cities,

423
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,850
predominantly with the African American 
community and so that the final,

424
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,600
the interesting point is how on earth is
it that black people today,

425
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,600
their grandfathers lived a better life 
than their fathers was?

426
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,290
America is America is more racist today 
than it was in the 19 sixties.

427
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:07,291
Absolutely not.
America's become significantly less 

428
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,531
racist,
but if you look to the American left or 

429
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:11,320
the social justice warriors of the 
academic and the Neo Marxist,

430
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,590
they pinpoint racism as the significant 
driving force to why black people are 

431
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,230
doing poorly in America.

432
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,160
Yeah.
Well that's,

433
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:23,230
that's a problem too that I've talked 
about with regards to gender inequality 

434
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,400
in pay,
which you've been wonderful.

435
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,270
Yeah.
Well,

436
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,690
um,
there's a lot of different reasons for 

437
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,780
different.
If you analyze differences in important 

438
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,020
attributes by group,
whatever your group measure is,

439
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,140
you're going to find that there's a 
dozen contributors,

440
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:44,141
you know,
just to pick a multivariate analysis to 

441
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,141
use your quote.
Yeah.

442
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,141
Well,
and the thing is,

443
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:48,341
is that you can,
you can attribute a certain amount of 

444
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:49,250
the difference in success between groups
to,

445
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,150
let's call it racial attitudes or 
ethnocentrism on the part of the 

446
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,090
dominant group.
It's complicated because in the U,

447
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:02,190
s Asians do rebel spectacularly well.
Jews do well.

448
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,610
Nigerians do pretty damn well.
Black immigrants do quite well.

449
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,690
That's correct.
So,

450
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,590
so it's much more complex than a simple 
racial analysis would indicate.

451
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,860
And the problem I guess in part with the
group fostered analysis is that people 

452
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,841
make the claim that a single factor,
prejudice essentially is the cause of 

453
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:24,830
all the problems.

454
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,830
And then that has the additionally 
pernicious effect of blanketing everyone

455
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:34,870
who isn't in the oppressed group that's 
being spoken for at the moment as 

456
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,500
oppressors.
And also,

457
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,930
and this is an even more pernicious 
element,

458
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,020
and I,
I really believe that this is part of 

459
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,020
the fundamental motivation of the 
pathological left,

460
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,500
is that there's a war on the idea of 
competence itself,

461
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,170
you know,
because if you take someone who's worked

462
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:56,171
hard and,
and being productive and being useful 

463
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:57,770
and admirable in all the ways that you 
might hope someone was,

464
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,640
and then you tell them that the only 
reason that they've been successful is 

465
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,280
because of their skin color,
let's say,

466
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:09,281
and this systemic racism next 
characterized as the society than what 

467
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:12,821
you do is undermine the entire idea that
competence itself might be the basis of 

468
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:16,250
a hierarchy and that way.
And I really think that,

469
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:21,251
that,
that desire to undermine the idea that 

470
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:24,281
hierarchies can be based on competence 
is associated with the deep Marxism 

471
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:27,410
that's associated with the radical left.
And I can't think of an idea that's more

472
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,300
pernicious than that.

473
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,650
That's right.
And I have to tell you,

474
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,110
Jordan,
I've been doing this for a long time,

475
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,350
but I've been doing it for at least an 
equivalent,

476
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,650
you know,
six years of college activism and 

477
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,841
organizing.
And your video on postmodernism and neo 

478
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:43,450
Marxism,
I remember exactly where I was.

479
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,800
I was driving to the University of 
Michigan just a couple months ago and I,

480
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,280
I literally my car,
I said I finally get it.

481
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,150
I finally understand what is motivating 
these people,

482
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,360
the philosophy behind it,
and it was an hour and a half video 

483
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,060
where you really dissected postmodernism
and it's exactly,

484
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,760
it's exactly what you just said.
They,

485
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,960
they want the death of the individual,
the death of logos,

486
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,560
that any sort of success can be 
attributed to some sort of red

487
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,380
prejudice.
That's exactly right.

488
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,790
The equation of success with our 
literally purchased.

489
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,560
I can't explain to you how significant 
that was.

490
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,190
I also think that's tied in with what 
you might describe as the,

491
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,440
let's say,
the decline of boys,

492
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:26,140
assuming that that sort of thing is,
is reasonable.

493
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,140
Um,
if you tell boys that the pay,

494
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,320
first of all that society is a 
patriarchy,

495
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,190
which it isn't.
If you tell them that and then you say,

496
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,220
well,
not only is it a patriarchy to corrupt 

497
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,220
patriarchy,
it's a corrupt,

498
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,220
destructive,
racist,

499
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,700
prejudice,
patriarchy,

500
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,980
and that anyone who succeeds and it is 
therefore a corrupt prejudice and racist

501
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,590
because that's how you would succeed in 
a hierarchy like that.

502
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:55,900
Then what you do is you associate in the
minds of people who might participate in

503
00:24:55,901 --> 00:25:00,901
the project,
the idea that any success whatsoever is 

504
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:03,661
actually a moral flaw.
And I've seen that happen to lots of 

505
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:06,691
people,
had a friend in particular who bought 

506
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:06,691
that line and he had other problems as 
well,

507
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:10,720
but he really believed that active 
engagement with the world,

508
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,990
any pursuit of success on his part for 
him and for his family and for his 

509
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:20,341
community,
but let's say for him to begin with was 

510
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:20,341
merely,
um,

511
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:24,840
was merely engagement in the process by 
which the entire world is being 

512
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,750
destroyed and brought to its knees.

513
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,890
He really believed that and it really.
Many things destroyed him.

514
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:32,470
But that was certainly one of the things
that destroyed him.

515
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:35,650
And you know,
there's no differentiation in history is

516
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,140
obviously a bloody nightmare.
And there's no way around that,

517
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,530
but it's necessary to differentiate 
between activity that is good and 

518
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:50,911
activity that is evil,
and to state that all activity that 

519
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:55,861
supports the patriarch in God,
I can't stand it that we even have to 

520
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:55,861
use that language,

521
00:25:55,861 --> 00:26:00,270
but it's it,
it is more widespread and universities 

522
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,390
than people realize you understand it.
But for most parents,

523
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,930
there is a concerted effort to de 
legitimize and I wouldn't say destroy 

524
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,030
the idea of the white Christian male in 
North American school,

525
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,090
especially the male aspect of it.
We're taught from the beginning stages 

526
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,270
that there is a patriarchy.
It's rigged against women.

527
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,630
When in reality,
the numbers show men are far more likely

528
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:25,390
to commit suicide.
Men are not living as long as women.

529
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,360
Men are much more likely to go to 
prison,

530
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,910
much more likely to declare bankruptcy,
much more likely to be killed at work.

531
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,940
That's exactly right.
Women are graduating in college in 

532
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,140
record numbers.
Women 14 or 15 years have a dominated in

533
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:43,141
the math,
got more master's degrees and more phds 

534
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:43,141
than men.
Um,

535
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,130
and there's another interesting stat to 
that

536
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,100
you never hear discussed by feminists 
and it actually drives me.

537
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,050
It's one of the many things that drives 
me to distraction,

538
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,660
let's say,
is that man,

539
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,410
let's,
except for a moment that all that on 

540
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,470
average men make more money than women.
Although the reasons for that,

541
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:04,020
as we've already discussed,
are extraordinarily complicated.

542
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,060
Women spend.
The last time I looked something 

543
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,610
approximating 75 to 80 percent of the 
consumer dollar.

544
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,390
It's exact and you can make a real.
At least you can pose it as a question.

545
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:15,960
It's like,
well,

546
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,110
who has the economic upper hand?
Is it the person who makes the money or 

547
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,401
is it the person who spends the money?
And I think that's a real question 

548
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:28,170
because most of the men that I know that
are worth their salt,

549
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:33,171
it's like the competitive guys.
Often they're out for money because 

550
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:33,830
that's the way they keep score.

551
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,870
The competition.
You really see that in places like law 

552
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:41,181
firms where it's correct.
Everyone's heavily competitive and 

553
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:44,000
they're always,
they always have an eye on the bonus 

554
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,251
because they're trying to climb up the 
hierarchy and in large part from a 

555
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,880
biological perspective that's actually 
to make them attractive to women.

556
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,280
So,
but if,

557
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,310
if the,
if men are generally men or are 

558
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,090
motivated to earn heavily,
to be attractive in part,

559
00:27:57,091 --> 00:28:02,091
which is certainly part of it,
and to take their place in the male 

560
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:02,091
hierarchy and,
and to succeed there,

561
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,400
then it also means that a huge part of 
their motivation is to distribute the 

562
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,820
money and you know,
and to distribute it to who?

563
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:13,821
Well,
at least in principle to their wife and 

564
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:13,821
their kids.
And I mean if you,

565
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:18,350
if you're a man of any utility and you 
meet another man who's fundamentally 

566
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,510
oriented,
it is selfish direction.

567
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,510
Who's hoarding his money without any 
concern for how it might be utilized?

568
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Who's spending it all on,
let's call them juvenile adolescent 

569
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,710
impulsive pleasures.
Refusing to share.

570
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,860
It's not like that.
Someone that you admire in someone you 

571
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:39,860
have contempt for right away.
Right?

572
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,570
And so if you ever meet someone who's 
like the stereotype of the successful 

573
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:50,031
patriarchal male,
then he's not somebody that fills you 

574
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:51,180
with admiration.
You're looking for someone who.

575
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,430
And the people I know that have been 
successful financially that I've admired

576
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:59,040
and there's been many of them have done 
amazing things.

577
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,820
They've produced technologies that are 
world changing often,

578
00:29:02,821 --> 00:29:07,821
you know,
and but they're hyper concerned with 

579
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:11,780
what it is that they're going to do with
their money and how it should be well 

580
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:11,780
spent and where it would do the most 
good.

581
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,050
And like,
I don't want to whitewash,

582
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,040
I don't want to whitewash our society,
but the idea that people are 

583
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,301
fundamentally motivated by the sorts of 
selfish motivations that only accrue 

584
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:27,840
benefit to them and no one else is.
It's a preposterous claim.

585
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,600
And I,
I just don't see any evidence whatsoever

586
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,340
that that's the case.
I agree.

587
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:35,760
And one of the other components of it 
that is taught in our schools,

588
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:40,761
which one of the top things I have to 
dispel is the idea that just because 

589
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:41,710
someone gets rich,
someone got poor,

590
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,330
the zero sum game.
And so there's an idea that has 

591
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,270
penetrated the minds of youth in America
that I can't believe.

592
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:49,750
It's like,
oh,

593
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:52,600
this guy has a million bucks.
He must have stole it from someone else.

594
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,840
Wrong.
You,

595
00:29:53,841 --> 00:29:56,320
you had to create value in order to get 
that money,

596
00:29:56,321 --> 00:29:58,390
in fact,
or at least some people do that,

597
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:01,960
like you could say and should say that,
you know,

598
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:05,500
in every hierarchical enterprise of any 
scale,

599
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,490
there's going to be a fractional 
criminal element without maybe you could

600
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:09,850
say,
well,

601
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,700
it's five percent of the sum total of 
the activity.

602
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,360
And the problem with the criminal part 
of it is that it tends not to be very 

603
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:18,360
self sustaining,
you know?

604
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,740
So you hear,
well there's lots of psychopaths in 

605
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:22,740
business.
It's like,

606
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:22,740
yeah,
but they can eat,

607
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,040
they get pushed out,
they do.

608
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:29,041
And they otherwise they have to move 
from place to place because their 

609
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:29,041
reputations followed them around.

610
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,600
And your reputation is actually quite 
fragile.

611
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:32,710
And so you could say,
well,

612
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,400
amongst the pool of people who are 
wealthy,

613
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,530
there's a element that have obtained 
that wealth through,

614
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,230
um,
through means that aren't admirable.

615
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Sure.
For reasons that aren't socially 

616
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,260
beneficial,
but to then say then say,

617
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,760
because of that existence of that small 
fraction of people,

618
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,770
which is actually ineradicable right,
you,

619
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,780
you,
you can't have a certain amount of 

620
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:58,780
freedom without a certain amount of 
criminality.

621
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,980
I think the American America is a really
good example of that.

622
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,060
To say that that means that everyone 
who's been successful is a thief.

623
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,390
It's like you have to be very careful 
when you make a claim like chef because 

624
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,100
it also means that if you're successful,
then you're a thief and that's a hell of

625
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:15,730
a value structure to adopt and I would 
make the argument that the mark,

626
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,160
the free market system forces you to be 
a better person.

627
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:23,430
It forces you to tell the truth and 
create a better product and treat your 

628
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,581
customers well and to be responsive when
something goes wrong or to lower your 

629
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:30,430
price or to improve the mechanism of 
which you are interacting with.

630
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:35,410
The customers aren't demanding that they
don't have choice,

631
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,060
you know,
and that's another.

632
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,530
That's another example of a different 
kind of cognitive problem,

633
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:44,080
let's say,
is that people are taught,

634
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,550
people aren't taught that.
Comparing what we have to.

635
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:51,820
They're hypothetical politically,
politically,

636
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,510
ideologically motivated.
Utopia is actually a bad idea,

637
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,680
you know,
because it's,

638
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,600
it just isn't difficult to take a look 
at a system like our system and say,

639
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,930
well,
look at all the problems that has 

640
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,300
compared to a hypothetical system that 
doesn't have any problems at all.

641
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,050
It's like,
well,

642
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,520
yeah man,
there's problems.

643
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,360
There's,
you know,

644
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:15,361
we've,
we've taken like 99 percent of the fish 

645
00:32:15,361 --> 00:32:16,060
out of the ocean and,
and you know,

646
00:32:16,061 --> 00:32:21,061
the degree to which our current level of
economic activity is truly sustainable 

647
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:22,390
without alteration is at least 
debatable.

648
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,960
Even though I don't think it's nearly as
terrible as people make out,

649
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:30,961
make it out to be.
But I don't think it's disputable that 

650
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,120
our current socioeconomic structures are
the most productive and the most free 

651
00:32:36,401 --> 00:32:39,830
structures that have ever been produced 
by people anywhere in the world.

652
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:44,831
And one of the things you can say about 
capitalism and free enterprise and and 

653
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:50,650
the western stress on individuality is 
that even though it does produce 

654
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,370
inequality,
a all systems produce inequality and and

655
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:56,570
without any real distinction between the
right and the left,

656
00:32:56,571 --> 00:33:01,571
by the way,
because I'm so new book called the Great

657
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:07,330
Leveler by Walter Shadelle,
who I'm going to be talking to later 

658
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:07,330
this month.
He did an analysis,

659
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,570
empirical analysis trying to figure out 
if you,

660
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,930
if you grouped governments by right wing
philosophy say or by left wing 

661
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:18,230
philosophy and then you calculated 
inequality coefficient.

662
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,180
Would that left wing organizations be 
characterized by reduced inequality?

663
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,210
And the answer was no.
There's no evidence that they are.

664
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,390
And what that points to,
and this is something very fundamental,

665
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,450
it's far more fundamental than that 
political,

666
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,720
is that inequality is the rule in 
cooperative slash competitive 

667
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,780
organizations.
You can't pause it,

668
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:43,560
a value without producing a hierarchy,
right?

669
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,620
Because you pause it,
devalues,

670
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:46,550
say this is worth doing.
And everyone says,

671
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,540
yeah,
this is worth doing.

672
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,780
Well.
Then what happens automatically is that 

673
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,090
it turns out that some people are better
at doing it than other people.

674
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,240
No matter what it is,
I'm going to get better and better at 

675
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,641
it.
Like the cradle plus you're talking 

676
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:02,080
about too,
and then they start getting better at 

677
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,821
it.
So the problem is is that without you 

678
00:34:03,821 --> 00:34:04,160
with if you're going to pause it,
value which you have to do,

679
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:09,161
if you're going to act and immediately 
you create a hierarchy and you also 

680
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:12,260
build into the value claim,
the claim that a is better than b.

681
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,820
You also build into that the idea that 
if a is better than B,

682
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:21,821
than people who are doing better at a 
should be differentially rewarded 

683
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:25,571
compared to people who who aren't.
There's no way around that if you're 

684
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:26,900
going to play the game and so you're 
stuck with an equality,

685
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,080
but there isn't any evidence that that 
social engineering policies are really 

686
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:36,440
very good at dispensing with inequality,
which is a fundamental political problem

687
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,300
and no one really knows what to do about
it.

688
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,740
But criticizing the entire society.
I mean,

689
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:46,070
the thing about the west and this is 
increasingly true all over the world,

690
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:51,071
is that it's generating our approach 
generates a tremendous amount of wealth 

691
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:51,800
for.
I mean it even happened in China,

692
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,670
you know,
despite their exceptionally totalitarian

693
00:34:55,671 --> 00:35:00,671
leanings,
and so what happens with the lefties is 

694
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:00,890
that they say,
well,

695
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,250
inequality as a consequence of the west 
and the consequence of capitalism,

696
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:08,030
which is palpably false claim and say,
well,

697
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,760
because it produces inequality,
then it's a corrupt system.

698
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,300
It's like,
no,

699
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:15,020
every system produces inequality,
but hardly any also produce wealth.

700
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,260
That's correct.
And Mobility and and reward for 

701
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,231
creativity,
entrepreneurial activity and risk 

702
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:23,231
taking.
That's,

703
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:26,550
that's something that the free market 
system is quite unique at and whereas a 

704
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,760
more neo Marxist view,
how do you get rich and a socialist?

705
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,890
You run for political office.
That's true.

706
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:35,891
Exploitation is you run on the best 
intentions of the public while 

707
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:38,670
implementing what you believe to be the 
best socially engineered construct.

708
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,430
Look at Venezuela.
I mean the leaders are doing just fine.

709
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,220
Meanwhile,
people are dying on the streets,

710
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,420
you know,
13,000

711
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:47,490
percent inflation,
so on and so forth.

712
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:52,491
So I have a question for you and I've 
watched hundreds of hours of your 

713
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:57,201
content on the Internet and you've 
opened up my mind in ways I cannot 

714
00:35:57,201 --> 00:35:57,420
describe.
You've made me a better speaker.

715
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,160
You've made me a better lecture,
a better person,

716
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:04,161
more organized,
more I can draw a direct corollary to 

717
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:08,061
our organization's budget and everything
from when I first interacted with your 

718
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,070
content because I'd never heard anyone 
describe the reality of life.

719
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,630
Life is suffering.
What are you going to do about it?

720
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,350
Just so bluntly and so directly,
but with struggle up the.

721
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:19,990
Damn.
That's,

722
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:24,991
that's exactly right.
With a roadmap to deal with that 

723
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:28,940
because.
And I'll tell you something cool and 

724
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940
then I'll get the other question.
No,

725
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940
no,
no,

726
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:28,940
no,
no,

727
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,891
no problem.
We have this program and it might be 

728
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,670
something in the future off your 
pronunciation.

729
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,680
Yeah.
I've used it with people that have done 

730
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:39,680
that with drug problems.
Huh?

731
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,880
Well,
we have a fairly new study that came out

732
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,300
last year.
I'm from Mohawk College.

733
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,750
She's a junior college,
um,

734
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,580
with the vocational element.
And the kids came in during the summer 

735
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,720
in their orientation and spent an hour 
writing out their life plan,

736
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:58,950
right?
How,

737
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,040
how they,
what they would like to have in their 

738
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,670
life across six standard dimensions,
intimate relationship,

739
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,880
family education,
care of their own mental and physical 

740
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:17,040
health strategies for dealing with 
temptation like drug and alcohol use,

741
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:22,110
um,
useful application of their time outside

742
00:37:22,111 --> 00:37:25,560
of,
outside of their obligations.

743
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,440
So the question is,
it's like it's,

744
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,540
it's,
it's sort of predicated on a new 

745
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:33,540
testament principle,
I would say in part,

746
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,350
which is know if you could have what you
wanted by asking what,

747
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,720
what would you ask asking you shall 
receive knock and you will answer it.

748
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,000
It's in Matthew.
Yeah,

749
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,590
exactly.
It's in Matthew and,

750
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,500
and the idea there,
I think from a psychological perspective

751
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:49,770
is that while you're not going to get 
what you want,

752
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:52,200
unless you know what it is and you're 
not going to hit target lists,

753
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:57,201
you aim for it course and you can't even
organize your perceptions in 

754
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,170
relationship to the world unless you 
have a goal.

755
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Okay?
So you write down what you think you 

756
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,781
might want and need in order to stand 
your life and then you write for awhile 

757
00:38:05,781 --> 00:38:07,890
about how,
what your life could be like in three to

758
00:38:07,891 --> 00:38:10,170
five years if you put your,
if you,

759
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:13,020
what your vision would be for your life,
three to five years.

760
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,020
And then you read a counter vision which
is an analysis of where you might be in 

761
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,801
three to five years if you let all your 
bad habits take the upper hand and then 

762
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:22,080
you write a plan.
Okay.

763
00:38:22,081 --> 00:38:25,380
And it takes a long time to do a really 
good job of that.

764
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:28,260
But it turns out that you can do a bad 
job of it in about an hour.

765
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:33,590
And so we had kids at Mohawk do it for 
an hour when they came in for their 

766
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:39,771
summer orientation and it knocked the 
dropout rate for young men down 50 

767
00:38:39,771 --> 00:38:43,831
percent.
And so I thought it just just blew me 

768
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:46,240
away because it's sad,
you know,

769
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,490
I thought,
just look at that.

770
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,520
If you get young guys to sit down and 
think for an hour about what they would 

771
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:59,461
like their life to be,
it decreases the probability that 

772
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:00,010
they'll drop out of college by 50 
percent.

773
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,320
It's a kind of hell man kind of 
correlation.

774
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,460
It's just stunning.
Well,

775
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,760
it's.
We have three studies demonstrating that

776
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,360
was the biggest effect.
I've seen it.

777
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:07,870
I,
I,

778
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,020
I'm dealing currently with one of my 
best high school buddies that was an 

779
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,400
opioid since a huge problem in America 
and I'm guessing here in Canada it is as

780
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:16,540
well.
Not as well versed in it.

781
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,930
And I sat him down and I did the future 
authoring program and it changed his 

782
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,110
life and you know,
and I made him watch all your videos and

783
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,360
became hooked on it and it saved no 
opiates.

784
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,030
Yeah,
you saved his life.

785
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,220
I can say that.
And you changed my life.

786
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:33,130
I wouldn't say you say it because I 
wasn't in that same dire condition,

787
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:36,160
but the number one thing I said to him,
I said,

788
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:41,161
listen buddy,
and I can use his name to protect his 

789
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:41,161
privacy.

790
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:41,161
I said,
your whole life,

791
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:41,860
you've been seeking freedom.
He's like,

792
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:42,940
yeah,
that's what I've been told.

793
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:47,941
I said,
things in life that give you meaning 

794
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:47,941
will come from responsibility and 
that's.

795
00:39:47,941 --> 00:39:52,340
That's what click.
One of the things that you said that 

796
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,340
really clicked with me,
a good thing to know,

797
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,400
man,
we have inundated,

798
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,190
especially young men,
go seek freedom.

799
00:39:57,191 --> 00:39:59,290
Go do you want how you want to do it 
when you want to do,

800
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:02,590
which is fine.
There's nothing inherently wrong to that

801
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:05,500
when you're young,
but if you really want meaning,

802
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,780
if you want satisfaction,
if you want direction,

803
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,350
it's the stuff that has consequence.
It's family work.

804
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,970
That's exactly right.
Freedom is.

805
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,880
Freedom is not teaching young millnet 
intentionally.

806
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,020
That's the other thing I wanted to get 
to,

807
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:19,270
but go ahead.
I think it's intentional.

808
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:24,271
I think it is too because it's part and 
parcel of the idea that the productive 

809
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:29,610
activity of young men,
and this also goes for the masculine 

810
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,060
symbolically masculine activity of young
women by the way,

811
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:36,061
but the productive activity of a young 
man is indistinguishable from the 

812
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:36,061
forest.

813
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:40,290
That gives rise to the,
to the crushing tyranny of the 

814
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:40,290
patriarchy.
It's like,

815
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,830
well,
and that also gives young men at a moral

816
00:40:41,831 --> 00:40:43,840
excuse not to engage in life.
It's like,

817
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,530
well,
you know,

818
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,950
productive activities.
See it all the time.

819
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,000
I've been told I'm a horrible person my 
whole life.

820
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,500
W,
w what uses this to me?

821
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,270
I'm going to go play video games in my 
basement.

822
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:58,140
Yeah.
I've been told from all my teachers and 

823
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,140
my parents that,
you know,

824
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,441
it's rigged.
You know that I'm a horrible individual 

825
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:05,011
just because I'm a man and it really 
diminishes a men that might want to 

826
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,330
succeed.
And I see it happen all the time.

827
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,360
Yeah,
well it gives them an excuse to the 

828
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,120
useless part of men that don't want to 
succeed because it's easy to sit around.

829
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:18,150
I mean,
it isn't because the longterm 

830
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,150
consequences of that are just absolutely
devastating.

831
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,760
Start.
See.

832
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:21,070
So when we have a discussion about 
freedom,

833
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,390
you know,
we might also say,

834
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:23,290
well,
the freedom is.

835
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,110
I think this is right,
is it's freedom to pick your poison.

836
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,240
It's freedom to pick your 
responsibility.

837
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,140
That's good.
We might say,

838
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:29,690
well,
there's,

839
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,730
there's a set of weights in front of you
that you have to pick up in order to 

840
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,231
stand yourself,
because that's the other thing I think 

841
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:38,231
about human beings.
Well,

842
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:42,190
you know,
we conscientiousness is a trait and it 

843
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,700
we don't have an animal model for 
conscientiousness.

844
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,590
In fact,
we don't understand conscientiousness at

845
00:41:45,591 --> 00:41:46,370
all from a,
from a,

846
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,790
from a psychological or Darwinian 
perspective.

847
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,830
Well that's,
that's more complicated because I'm 

848
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:57,430
conscientious.
Men tend to do better and so they're 

849
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,430
going to be more successful,
but.

850
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,120
But we don't have a model for what 
conscientiousness is,

851
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,460
but but conscientiousness is at least in
part this the the necessity to carry a 

852
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:12,281
load for yourself and for other people 
or to suffer guilt and shame as a 

853
00:42:12,281 --> 00:42:12,320
consequence.

854
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,710
And so that's.
That seems built in especially to 

855
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:17,710
conscientious people.
Now,

856
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,271
conscientious people didn't more tend to
be more conservative because that's one 

857
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:25,901
of the predictors of conservatism,
but it could easily be that freedom is 

858
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:28,220
the freedom to choose your yoke,
let's say,

859
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,460
and you and then you choose the weight 
that you have to carry so that you can 

860
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,141
justify your miserable existence to 
yourself so that you can go to bed at 

861
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:38,720
the end of the night and you can think,
look,

862
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:43,721
I,
I did what I needed to do to set things 

863
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:46,181
right today and I don't have to carry 
the existential wait around of my 

864
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:48,530
failure and uselessness.
As a consequence.

865
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,650
The existential psychologist in the 19 
fifties who emerged out of the chaos of 

866
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,151
world war two were very much.
I'm very much concentrated on the idea 

867
00:42:58,151 --> 00:42:59,300
of existential guilt.
You know,

868
00:42:59,301 --> 00:43:04,301
that you owed,
you owed being a ransom for your 

869
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:08,690
existence and the way that you paid that
ransom was to work for the betterment of

870
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:08,990
being.

871
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,400
I mean,
it's a very ancient idea,

872
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,460
but of course,
but it is the one idea I think that 

873
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,960
gives people the self respect,
not self esteem,

874
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,400
the self respect that's necessary to 
carry them through terrible times and to

875
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:24,260
use a story that people are familiar 
with.

876
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:29,740
When I'm asked to what,
what is Jordan Peterson done for your 

877
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:29,740
members?
People,

878
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:33,521
United States,
he has to stop acting like Peter Pan so 

879
00:43:33,521 --> 00:43:36,140
that they can actually be a man and not 
a boy.

880
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,900
The Peter Pan Story is a really 
interesting one.

881
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:43,130
A because Peter Pan Pan means 
everything,

882
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:45,650
right?
Technically that's what pan means.

883
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,970
And Peter Pan Wants to be a child 
because a child can be anything.

884
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,110
It can be everything.
Right?

885
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:56,111
So what you have in childhood is that a 
plethora of potential and the problem 

886
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:58,130
with growing up is that you have to 
sacrifice that,

887
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,970
that pan potential for a defined 
actuality,

888
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:04,760
right?

889
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,330
That's,
that's,

890
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,360
that's to grow up and become something 
instead of staying potentially anything.

891
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:15,910
Now,
the problem with Peter Pan is that he 

892
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:17,270
looks into the world and,
and sees captain hook as his role model.

893
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:19,530
Right?
And so that's his model for,

894
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,610
for adulthood and hook is terrified of 
death.

895
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,780
That's the crocodile is chasing him with
a clock in his stomach and the crocodile

896
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,700
already has a piece of it,
but it's got a taste of him.

897
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:32,370
And so hook is constantly chased by the 
dragon of chaos essentially.

898
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,910
That's already got a taste of him.
And because hook is terrified of his own

899
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:38,850
mortality and terrified in general,
he's a tyrant.

900
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,910
And so pan looks at Hook and says,
well,

901
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:44,760
if that's adulthood,
I'd rather stay king of the lost boys.

902
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:46,870
That's exactly right.
And so yeah,

903
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:48,650
it's a very powerful story.
Well,

904
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,940
which is why people still tell it 100 
years later.

905
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,350
That's correct.
But what I see,

906
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,950
at least from my experience is that the 
I,

907
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
that idea of staying a boy is idolized 
and is made more culturally acceptable 

908
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:09,410
in America than ever has been.
And it's almost as if that you,

909
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,460
you ask a young man that is generally on
the direction towards,

910
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,540
um,
hopelessness and just kind of what you 

911
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:22,131
bring men out of it is they look towards
that MTV vh one lifestyle of being able 

912
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,450
to do whatever you want to do,
how you want to do it,

913
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,420
get extraordinarily drunk,
have no responsibility,

914
00:45:27,421 --> 00:45:29,460
be with women all day long.
What happens?

915
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:33,150
You do that for a couple of years.
You end up a horribly miserable person.

916
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,250
And so.
But here's my question,

917
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:36,240
is,
yeah,

918
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:38,340
you don't want to be the oldest guy at 
the frat party.

919
00:45:38,341 --> 00:45:39,180
No,
that's correct.

920
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,380
No,
that's pretty dismal.

921
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,220
But it's.
Here's my,

922
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,640
here's my distinction though,
is that in some ways it's the women that

923
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,240
are embracing the masculine archetype 
and some ways that are being successful.

924
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:48,900
I mean,
they're,

925
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:50,880
they're being extraordinarily 
responsible and they're,

926
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,370
they're feeling a lot of these positions
quicker than men can't.

927
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,760
I mean they're.
And they're graduating at higher rates 

928
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:58,760
of college and they're declining.
They're declining motherhood,

929
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,900
or they're at least suspending it 
throughout the west,

930
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,520
which is,
you could argue for either ways.

931
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:05,400
There's reasons for that,
but I guess my question is,

932
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,460
well,
I think that the expression of the 

933
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,051
masculine spirit and women isn't 
denigrated like women don't get accused 

934
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:16,530
of contributing to the patriarchy even 
when they take positions in society that

935
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:20,880
you would think are fully patriarchal 
now and which is a strange thing.

936
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:25,380
So women who go to law school and then 
and then practices corporate lawyers say

937
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,920
aren't subject to the same,
what would you call it?

938
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Claim that their activity is 
facilitating that the decline of the 

939
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,050
planet.
I guess because they're seen as well.

940
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:42,050
They're there because of their gender.
I suppose they're seen as as as leaders 

941
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,430
of the rebellion against the patriarchal
spirit.

942
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,680
Even though structurally it boils down 
to the same thing.

943
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,930
Sure.
So that masculine,

944
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,410
classically masculine,
symbolically masculine,

945
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,890
yearning for hierarchical productivity 
and competition is rewarded in women but

946
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:03,741
not in men and which is also a very 
perverse thing because it doesn't make 

947
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:07,971
any sense.
It makes sense through the 

948
00:47:07,971 --> 00:47:10,161
postmodernists view,
which is they're just undoing the 

949
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:10,161
oppressor ship of the man and the last 
one,

950
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,600
hundred 50 years.
So the ends justify the means.

951
00:47:12,601 --> 00:47:17,601
That's the way they look at it.
Whatever power women can take from men 

952
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,050
is a good thing.
That's the way they look at it.

953
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,970
Well,
there's a funny thing about that too,

954
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,720
that like I really need this and 12 
rules for life.

955
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:26,830
I was looking at some of the pew 
research data,

956
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:28,800
and I don't remember the figures 
precisely,

957
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:33,801
but the last 15 years,
the percentage of women who young women 

958
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:38,821
who claim that they would like to be 
married in a permanent relationship has 

959
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:39,610
gone up a substantial amount.

960
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,880
I don't remember what it was at 50 
percent approximately springs to mind,

961
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,190
but a lot at the same time.
It's declined almost the same degree 

962
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:53,740
among young men and so what's.
What's perverse about this,

963
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:59,010
this is something I've talked to my 
daughter a fair a bit about is that I 

964
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,310
mean if you ask young women what they 
want,

965
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,490
I don't know if they can answer because 
I don't know if they know if they're 19 

966
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,551
or 20 because I think their heads are so
muddled by what they've been told that 

967
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:12,091
they don't really know,
but my sense is that women want the 

968
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:15,580
opportunity to develop their career in 
whatever direction they see fit and fair

969
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:20,581
enough,
but they want an intimate relationship 

970
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,790
and usually I'm monogamous,
one that's permanent and they want to 

971
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,150
have the opportunity to have kids and 
what you see happening.

972
00:48:25,151 --> 00:48:27,580
Inevitably,
and I believe this to be the case.

973
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,320
I've watched very carefully as I've,
as I've grown up and go to older because

974
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:37,060
I've worked with women my whole life is 
that women are less,

975
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,510
are less compelled by their career as 
they approached their thirties and more 

976
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:46,231
compelled by the desire to have a 
permanent relationship and biological 

977
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:46,600
too.
I would argue too.

978
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,460
Well,
I mean I think it's.

979
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,480
It's a biological necessity because 
women have to have children relatively 

980
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:55,480
young.
That's correct,

981
00:48:55,481 --> 00:49:00,481
but it's interesting to watch it 
phenomenologically and even the women 

982
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:04,291
that I've seen who've had very high 
powered careers is that as they move 

983
00:49:04,291 --> 00:49:04,810
into their,
especially their early thirties,

984
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,890
they start to realize that the career is
a pretty one dimensional enterprise,

985
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:13,891
even if it's a good career because even 
good careers are still jobs and good 

986
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,150
careers.
They're also very hard jobs.

987
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:20,770
They're like 70 hour a week jobs and 
they're full bore commitment jobs and to

988
00:49:20,771 --> 00:49:25,150
figure out how to have a career like 
that and to have a life,

989
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,090
to have a family,
to have an intimate relationship,

990
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:30,520
to have children and then to also be 
able to take care of them.

991
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,820
That's a very complex.
It's very complex job to manage and so 

992
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,130
what's strange is I think what's strange
is that the very things that the 

993
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:44,350
radicals are undermining,
like the monogamous family,

994
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:49,890
are actually those things that women 
most want,

995
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,180
especially as they approach their 
thirties.

996
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,780
And so this is a catastrophe on both 
ends of the,

997
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,960
of the gender distribution.
So if there's one thing I would love to 

998
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,780
get your opinion and take on is an 
ideal,

999
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:06,100
what these college radicals is the,
at least the professors that people that

1000
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:09,250
should know better of the roots of 
Western civilization.

1001
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:14,520
The only description that I could give 
to their motivation is some people just 

1002
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:19,531
want to see the world burn.
It's almost as if they want chaos for 

1003
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:22,870
the sake that they were not able to 
contribute meaningfully mindfully.

1004
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:26,380
I would love your take on that from a 
social psychologist brother-in-law about

1005
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:27,700
this,
and I've thought about it.

1006
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,060
What is their intention?
What is.

1007
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,750
Well,
the question is to some degree,

1008
00:50:32,751 --> 00:50:35,090
what's the intention of resentment and 
failure?

1009
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,710
Correct?
Look,

1010
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,700
let's say that you.
Let's say that you.

1011
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:45,820
Everything hasn't turned out for you the
way you want it and you're angry about 

1012
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,181
that and maybe you're angry about the 
people who have been successful because 

1013
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,151
they cast you in a dim light,
and so there's the anger that motivates 

1014
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:52,820
the desire for destruction.
That's resentment,

1015
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,950
right?
And you never want to underestimate evil

1016
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:55,990
triad,
right?

1017
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,280
Greed,
envy and resentment.

1018
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,030
Something something like arrogance,
arrogance,

1019
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,990
arrogance,
deceit and resentment.

1020
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,450
That's,
that's a bad trial that'll take you down

1021
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:11,050
and the thing about the thing,
so there's anger and maybe the anger you

1022
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:15,200
want everything to burn,
but there's also the idea to that,

1023
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,830
and this is part of the reason that 
inequality actually is a problem for 

1024
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,311
people on the right and on the left is 
that if you put people into a position 

1025
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:27,080
where they don't have what they need and
want and they can't see a way to get it,

1026
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:32,470
they have high motivation to flip the 
game board over and start again or maybe

1027
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:34,640
to try to play a new game.

1028
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,810
And so part of the reason that those on 
the right for example,

1029
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,190
have to be careful not only to raise 
wealth overall,

1030
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:48,191
but also to be careful about inequality 
is that as societies become more 

1031
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:52,031
unequal,
the motivation for those who feel 

1032
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:54,680
dispossessed to flip the entire game 
overgrows and grows quite rapidly.

1033
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,610
And I'd see that sort of resentment in 
the universities.

1034
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:01,400
Although it's to some degree,
it's difficult to say why.

1035
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:06,401
Because of course university professors 
aren't unsuccessful by any stretch of 

1036
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:11,651
the imagination.
Well compensated and they have very 

1037
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:11,651
secure positions,
but that,

1038
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:16,480
but there's still on an anti capitalist 
ethos that runs through the 

1039
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,951
universities.
That's difficult to make a to make a 

1040
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:20,951
case for it.
Is it?

1041
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:22,730
Is it an.
I tried to figure out,

1042
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:27,790
is it that I know better than you sort 
of thing and you deal with these 

1043
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,411
professors?
Is it that I'm a smarter individual and 

1044
00:52:32,411 --> 00:52:33,030
we can create society more equitable?

1045
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,100
Yeah.
It's partly that.

1046
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:35,210
It's Hubris,
right?

1047
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:37,730
Yeah.
That's partly the rationalist UK Hubris.

1048
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:38,570
Yeah,
absolutely.

1049
00:52:38,571 --> 00:52:43,571
That you know that you can systematize 
utopia and that you're smart enough to 

1050
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:49,301
do that doctorate.
I can figure this stuff out so well and 

1051
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:51,860
that you're systematizing of utopia 
isn't going to generate an unexpected 

1052
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:55,901
consequences.
Now know social scientists should be 

1053
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:58,520
much smarter than that because if you're
a social scientist who has any sense,

1054
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:04,090
what you learned from your research is 
that the probability that you can 

1055
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:07,421
predict the outcome of your procedure,
which is what you're trying to do as a 

1056
00:53:07,421 --> 00:53:07,610
scientist,
is very low.

1057
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,060
You're running experiment predicated on 
a hypothesis.

1058
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:16,120
You'll put the procedure in place that's
supposed to put pros to produce the 

1059
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,990
hypothesized outcome and likely is not,
it doesn't.

1060
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:23,020
And those are,
that's under simple conditions in the 

1061
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,020
lab where you can control almost 
everything.

1062
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,610
And then there's also the case that,
and this has been well known among good 

1063
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,271
social scientists for a long time,
is that large scale social engineering 

1064
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:37,311
projects almost never produced the 
results that are in that are intended 

1065
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:41,950
and they pr because systems are very 
complex and you tweak one thing and you 

1066
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:46,071
think you're only tweaking one thing,
but you're tweaking 20 things and a lot 

1067
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:49,551
of the things that you tweak 
inadvertently kick back and get that 

1068
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:49,800
too.
Yeah.

1069
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,640
Yeah.
So,

1070
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,690
um,
it's,

1071
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:58,710
it's,
it's a hard thing to push it because I 

1072
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:59,010
get this question a lot from because 
this is all I deal with.

1073
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:04,011
I deal with the leftist activists and 
the social justice mind and to things 

1074
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:09,501
that are so important.
The activists are taking over 

1075
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:11,721
governments now and at a rapid rate.
The Democrat Party in America has been 

1076
00:54:11,721 --> 00:54:14,670
taken over by the social justice neo,
Marxist postmodernist left,

1077
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,150
um,
and that it's extraordinarily dangerous 

1078
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:20,670
to the west and east,
but I'm always,

1079
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,700
I'm always asked by people what 
motivates them because it's so damn 

1080
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:25,770
obvious.

1081
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:29,280
The ideas that they're trying to advance
don't work.

1082
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,870
I mean,
we have a plethora of,

1083
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,370
with a century of evidence that central 
planning will weaken.

1084
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,770
Societies will cause or will cause 
civilization.

1085
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,570
Civilized chaos,
civilization,

1086
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,900
chaos will not create wealth,
will cause debt.

1087
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,900
So what still motivates them?
I think part of it is just,

1088
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,060
it's,
it's actually complexity.

1089
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,850
It's like I've been thinking about this 
and it's easy.

1090
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,740
It's relatively straightforward to 
identify pathology on the right,

1091
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:58,690
I think.
And basically you,

1092
00:54:58,830 --> 00:55:02,370
you look at claims of racial superiority
and the right wing identity,

1093
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:05,010
politics types who were making claims of
racial superiority.

1094
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:05,850
Everyone says,
well,

1095
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:10,851
you know,
you're wandering down the Nazi pathway 

1096
00:55:10,851 --> 00:55:11,040
and that's unacceptable.
And virtually everyone,

1097
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,070
you know,
99 percent of people agree that that's a

1098
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:16,170
bad idea.
But on the left,

1099
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:21,171
the problem is,
is that it's clear that some 

1100
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:24,560
concatenation of leftist policies when 
taken to extreme producer catastrophe,

1101
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,270
right?

1102
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:28,920
But it's not just the economic,
it's the cultural too.

1103
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,710
Absolutely.
But the problem is it's not that easy to

1104
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:35,880
point to which policies you know.
So if you read the Gulag archipelago,

1105
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:38,760
for example,
social units and his work on prison camp

1106
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:43,761
system,
he does a really good job of detailing 

1107
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:47,391
out the relationship between the Utopian
policies of the Lennon nests and the 

1108
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:49,020
catastrophes that have occurred.
But it's not simple.

1109
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,730
You can't point to one thing and you 
say,

1110
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:55,731
oh,
well that's like a racial superiority 

1111
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:55,731
charger.
It's because,

1112
00:55:55,731 --> 00:55:57,900
well,
we want to foster inclusion of oppressed

1113
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,670
group who could be against that,
right?

1114
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,750
Right.
And we want to,

1115
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,790
we want to level the playing field will 
go,

1116
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,500
yeah,
well exactly.

1117
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:09,501
And so in isolation,
each of these ideas not only sounds 

1118
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,670
plausible but sounds positively 
beneficial,

1119
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:16,850
but the problem is is that you put a 
number of them together and somehow 

1120
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,140
things tilt in a direction that's 
really,

1121
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:20,820
really terrible.

1122
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:21,840
But that isn't it.
This is,

1123
00:56:21,841 --> 00:56:24,370
this is the other part of it that I try 
to dive into.

1124
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:27,300
I asked,
when I do my speeches on campuses,

1125
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:29,980
I asked a series of five questions and 
one of the first question is,

1126
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:35,220
are people good or bad by nature?
The Neo Marxists will get in front of a 

1127
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,510
mic and I have these videos that have 
10,

1128
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:39,870
15 million views where they'll try to 
argue me.

1129
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:42,160
That argued to me that people are are 
good by nature.

1130
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:44,440
It's just the social construct that 
makes them bad.

1131
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:46,870
That's one of the big problems is 
definitely,

1132
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,510
but you're the expert here.
I mean,

1133
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:52,870
you've been doing this for decades and 
you have plethora of research.

1134
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,200
My argument is always,
well then why do we have to teach 

1135
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,151
goodness to our youth?
Why do you have to tell young people to 

1136
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:02,371
stop crying?
Why do young people pick their parents 

1137
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:02,371
against each other?

1138
00:57:02,371 --> 00:57:02,371
There?
Were there ever taught that behavior?

1139
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,730
Of course la even aggression,
like evidence that aggression is a.

1140
00:57:05,731 --> 00:57:07,730
nate is.
I think it's.

1141
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,880
Well,
I don't think it's overwhelming.

1142
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,640
It's inclusive.
We evolved from chimpanzees.

1143
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:13,630
They go to war,
right?

1144
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,240
I mean,
but,

1145
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:14,710
but,
but,

1146
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:19,740
but that's,
that's one of the key things is how did 

1147
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,980
the neo Marxist find any sort of,
you know,

1148
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:26,220
any sort of intellectual consistency 
with believing that then they teach 

1149
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:30,691
young people that,
that this is all just a flawed social 

1150
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:33,181
construct,
but we're actually good people by 

1151
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:33,181
nature,
not aggressive.

1152
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:36,510
We're not prejudiced in any sense.
It's a compelling story because it's 

1153
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:36,780
half the true,
you know,

1154
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:41,790
I mean,
part of the reason that human endeavor 

1155
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,920
is pathologized is because there's a 
tyrannical element to social 

1156
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,521
organization and so you can say,
well people are basically good and 

1157
00:57:50,521 --> 00:57:55,030
culture makes them bad and you can tell 
a good story using those axioms.

1158
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:56,710
I mean,
you can reverse it and you can say no,

1159
00:57:56,711 --> 00:58:01,711
people are basically like uncivilized,
barbaric as individuals and that only 

1160
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:04,420
society makes them good to the degree 
that they're good.

1161
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,700
That's the difference between Hobbes and
Rousseau,

1162
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,560
right?
Because Russo would argue for the former

1163
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:12,610
and hobbs for the ladder and you can 
make a very strong case for both.

1164
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:17,611
And because the case is compelling,
you don't necessarily hear the other 

1165
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:17,611
side of the story.
Sure.

1166
00:58:17,611 --> 00:58:18,160
So,
and that's,

1167
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:22,030
that's the thing about ideologies is 
that they tend to tell half the story in

1168
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:27,031
a compelling way and I mean it's also 
kind of a nice story if you're a naive 

1169
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:28,150
person because you think,
well,

1170
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,240
I'm a good person and everybody else I 
know is good.

1171
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,310
That must come from somewhere.
So it's really interesting you say that.

1172
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:38,400
So we are at Ucla and this is a very 
interesting thing and there was a black 

1173
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:38,430
woman that said,
candace islands,

1174
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,790
I think you're a white supremacist.

1175
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,200
Of course,
another black woman.

1176
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,970
And I asked her,
I said,

1177
00:58:42,971 --> 00:58:44,170
wait a second,
are you a racist?

1178
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,150
Are you racist?
No,

1179
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,330
I'm not.
Then where's the line?

1180
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:49,330
Where does one stop becoming racist?
Because you're not.

1181
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,130
Of course,
right?

1182
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,700
You wouldn't be saying this if you 
weren't.

1183
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:53,980
So what do I have to do to be more like 
you?

1184
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,530
It's like everyone else has a horrible 
person except me.

1185
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,340
Yeah.
You know,

1186
00:58:57,341 --> 00:58:59,410
it's that kind of narcissism,
self centerdness.

1187
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,200
There's a great quote by Dennis prager 
where he said,

1188
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:04,660
growing up in the 19 seventies and 
eighties,

1189
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:09,070
we taught our youth that they were the 
problem in America was a good thing.

1190
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:12,520
Now it's the exact opposite.
Now it's that America is the problem and

1191
00:59:12,521 --> 00:59:17,521
you're the greatest thing ever.
I'm one of the most impactful analysis 

1192
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:20,080
you ever made was kind of something Carl
June said is,

1193
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,010
you know,
treat others the way,

1194
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:26,080
want to be treated,
but that you don't always want to be 

1195
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,080
treated with,
you know,

1196
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:26,900
ubiquitous love and kindness.

1197
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,640
You want to be sometimes have discipline
thoughts and let lot.

1198
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,730
I mean,
one of the things I've learned as a 

1199
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:36,730
clinician while in,
as,

1200
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:38,900
as a private person for that matter,
is that we outsource our sanity.

1201
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,450
You know,
the psychoanalysts believed,

1202
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:46,451
and most psychologists believe that your
sanity is sort of something you carry 

1203
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:46,451
around in your,
in your ego,

1204
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:49,620
in your head.
And if you're saying it's because your,

1205
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:53,180
your psyche as well structured.
But that's actually not true.

1206
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,130
It's true to some degree.
But,

1207
00:59:55,310 --> 01:00:00,310
but what's more true is that the way you
stay sane is by knowing how to behave in

1208
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,910
a manner that makes you sufficiently 
acceptable so that other people will put

1209
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:08,180
up with you and then you surround 
yourself with other people and hopefully

1210
01:00:08,181 --> 01:00:13,181
they're doing reasonably well.
And every time you do something stupid 

1211
01:00:13,181 --> 01:00:13,940
they slap you on the side of the head,
you know,

1212
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:18,941
either fairly gruffly or subtly by 
raising an eyebrow or failing to listen 

1213
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:24,461
to you or not,
not phoning you to go out for a beer on 

1214
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:24,940
Friday night because then you change 
your behavior a little bit.

1215
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,270
You reflect,
you say,

1216
01:00:26,271 --> 01:00:31,271
we,
I have to do something different while 

1217
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:31,271
in you.
If you're lucky,

1218
01:00:31,271 --> 01:00:33,521
you have 20 people around you that are 
always tapping you and telling you when 

1219
01:00:33,521 --> 01:00:37,450
you're funny and witty and interesting 
and when you're boring and stupid or 

1220
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:37,450
more that or less.
Right?

1221
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:37,880
Right,
right.

1222
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,900
And so,
so you.

1223
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:44,000
So this,
the social structure plays a key role in

1224
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,820
maintaining individuals sanity.
There's no doubt about that.

1225
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,770
So I,
I want to switch this a little bit.

1226
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,410
I want to get back to some things that 
are more specific to you,

1227
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:56,411
so let's talk about your plans for your 
organization over the next couple of 

1228
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,720
years and your goals,
you know,

1229
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:01,850
because a critic might say,
well,

1230
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,620
you know,
you're complaining about activism on the

1231
01:01:03,621 --> 01:01:08,621
left,
but here you are engaging in activism 

1232
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:08,621
and who cares if it's on the right or 
the left.

1233
01:01:08,621 --> 01:01:12,170
It's still activism and that carries 
with it all the problems of activism.

1234
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,910
So I'd like you to address that,
but also then to say where you're headed

1235
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,880
and how you expect to get there and why.
Sure.

1236
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,060
So first I would say we have to reclaim 
the term activism.

1237
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:27,170
Activism for the right ideas is virtuous
and correct and always has been,

1238
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:30,220
I think throughout Western civilization 
and we're on the side now we're,

1239
01:01:30,221 --> 01:01:33,950
we're fighting for intellectual and 
ideological diversity and free speech.

1240
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,150
Not Activism does not necessarily mean 
you have to storm the president's office

1241
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:43,151
or defy the rules that be,
but it does mean you try to be 

1242
01:01:43,151 --> 01:01:46,660
disruptive on campus wherever necessary.
As long as you're not doing what the 

1243
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:51,971
left does,
which is trying to suppress someone 

1244
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:52,460
else's rights to speech or try to,
you know,

1245
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:55,190
destroy private property.
So I'll give you a great example.

1246
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,920
Me going to UC Berkeley with Dave Rubin 
and Candice Owens.

1247
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,330
That's a form of activism.

1248
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:02,750
We were welcomed by our group there on 
campus.

1249
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,720
I'm the young Republican group,
but there was petitions trying to get us

1250
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:08,300
off campus.
There was an immense hostility.

1251
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:10,310
The administration did not want us 
there.

1252
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:13,370
We had to pay thousands of dollars for 
security fees and for police.

1253
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,200
Yeah.
That host security fee thing.

1254
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:17,330
That's pretty.
That's extraordinarily cumbersome.

1255
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,800
It well and it essentially so 
underhanded.

1256
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:24,801
Absolutely.
It's so unbelievably underhand and so 

1257
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:27,351
there's some.
There's an interesting distinction here 

1258
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:27,351
that I want to.
I want to make an.

1259
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:30,590
I'd love to get your analysis.
I don't want to deviate too much from 

1260
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,661
your question,
but for doing this for the years I've 

1261
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:32,661
done this,
I'm almost daily.

1262
01:02:32,661 --> 01:02:34,530
One of our groups will get disinvited 
from campus,

1263
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:36,180
had their funding cut.
Well,

1264
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:41,240
I will get shouted down,
fire alarms polled windows smashed 

1265
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,510
daily.
Conservatives will try to get disinvited

1266
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,170
from campus.

1267
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:46,380
I've never once seen a conservative 
student,

1268
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:48,330
a student group,
a conservative group,

1269
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:53,331
or considered professor,
tried to disinvite or try to prevent a 

1270
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:53,331
liberal from coming on campus,
not once,

1271
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:57,950
not once.
So you have here the left being the 

1272
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:58,320
predominant political viewpoint on 
college campuses,

1273
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:03,321
a monopoly,
yet they do everything they can to 

1274
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,601
prevent anyone else from challenging 
that viewpoint and we conservatives are 

1275
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:09,171
in the political minority and we 
perfectly allow the free discussion and 

1276
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:10,230
free flow of ideas.
So to answer your question,

1277
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,500
at least from the activism standpoint,
if someone would be a critic of they 

1278
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:15,500
say,
well Charlie,

1279
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:15,500
you're just doing the left is doing.
No,

1280
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,870
I will defend a socialist right to be 
wrong to the death.

1281
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,940
I think that free speech and dialog 
discussion is,

1282
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,180
is the solution.
Well,

1283
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:28,650
I do think to the marketplace of ideas,
civil behavior is unbelievably useful.

1284
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:33,650
You know,
one of the things that I've experienced 

1285
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:36,471
over the last couple of years is that if
I keep my head and I stay reasonable in 

1286
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:42,270
the face of provocation,
which can be very severe at times,

1287
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:43,920
fire alarms,
being pulled in,

1288
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,510
people blowing air horns,
you know,

1289
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:49,590
a foot away from me and getting in my 
face in a serious way.

1290
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,850
I'm as I'm leaving places that I've been
speaking and carrying a garage which is,

1291
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:58,851
you know,
really pushing it a bit too far as far 

1292
01:03:58,851 --> 01:04:00,770
as I'm concerned.
And pounding on windows and doors and 

1293
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:00,770
creating.
Sure,

1294
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:01,560
yeah,
it's primal.

1295
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:07,220
A good thing to really teach your,
your participants is that there remain 

1296
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:13,580
civil and not to engage in acts that 
discredit them regardless of the 

1297
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:17,190
provocation.
And that's no firearm alarm polling,

1298
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:22,520
that's never yelling people down.
Civil dialogue and proper behave and we 

1299
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:23,430
win converts by doing that.

1300
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,040
And um,
uh,

1301
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,050
and I'll,
I'll send you a couple of videos of,

1302
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:30,390
and I've taken a cue from you.
The way you handled that BBC interview,

1303
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,370
which went Shayla for.
Yeah.

1304
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:33,120
So I'm sorry.
Yeah,

1305
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,270
the UK.
It was extraordinary.

1306
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:39,450
You had every right to pull her tongue 
out.

1307
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:44,480
She was being just,
I mean it was almost impressively 

1308
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,261
ignorant what she was doing.
Yet you remain so calm and so in control

1309
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:50,430
and I think if you,
even though you had a right to do it,

1310
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:54,750
if you would have went a little bit more
towards the direction of Abrasiveness or

1311
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:57,450
confrontational,
you wouldn't have been as effective.

1312
01:04:57,451 --> 01:04:58,860
I learned something,
you know,

1313
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:04,120
and this is something that's worth 
knowing is that just because you're 

1314
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,610
being attacked doesn't mean that's a bad
thing.

1315
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:07,350
You know,
like for now,

1316
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:12,210
let's say that I go and give a talk,
well two things can happen.

1317
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:17,420
I can either give the talk and film that
and put it on youtube and then there's 

1318
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,110
the advantages of that.
Or I can go give the talk and be shouted

1319
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:25,111
down by protestors.
Like the ones at Queen's university 

1320
01:05:25,111 --> 01:05:26,190
literally stormed the stage.
I saw that big storm,

1321
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:27,430
this new,
handled it beautifully,

1322
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:29,530
and then you said something like,
this is exactly,

1323
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,960
you know,
why we're doing what we're doing,

1324
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,940
or something to that effect.
And there's a couple of things.

1325
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:38,941
The first thing is it's not such a 
terrible thing for people who are 

1326
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:43,141
unreasonable to manifest or 
unreasonableness and then to have that 

1327
01:05:43,141 --> 01:05:44,200
publicized,
that's a good thing.

1328
01:05:44,201 --> 01:05:49,201
We do a lot of it and the second thing 
is is that just so there's the event 

1329
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,190
which would be the place that you're 
speaking,

1330
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:54,220
but then that's not the event because 
all of this is filmed.

1331
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:59,610
The event could easily be in the two 
months after it and so one of the ways 

1332
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:05,131
that you can keep your head in this sort
of situation is to understand that it 

1333
01:06:05,131 --> 01:06:09,211
isn't obvious when things are unfolding,
what's good and what isn't and if you 

1334
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:11,110
like that interview.

1335
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,070
Sure.
I mean,

1336
01:06:12,071 --> 01:06:17,071
my sense of the interview was that they 
were going to just cut it to five 

1337
01:06:17,071 --> 01:06:20,971
minutes,
which is what they broadcast and do 

1338
01:06:20,971 --> 01:06:20,971
everything they could to make me look 
like a fool,

1339
01:06:20,971 --> 01:06:25,470
you know,
but they put the whole thing up because 

1340
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,220
they didn't have any idea what happened 
in that interview.

1341
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:32,670
No one knew.
It's not like channel four news that 

1342
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:32,670
that was a disaster and they put it up 
anyways.

1343
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:37,860
They thought the interview went fine and
then were absolutely shocked by the 

1344
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,821
public response,
but by that time it was too late to 

1345
01:06:41,821 --> 01:06:44,461
bring it down,
but my point is that it's a lot easier 

1346
01:06:44,461 --> 01:06:47,821
to keep your head if you don't jump to 
conclusions about what's happening in 

1347
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,610
the moment,
being what's actually happening.

1348
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:54,500
So like it's a long game.
The short case,

1349
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,410
so interesting you say that.
So I went to the,

1350
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:00,770
the anti-gun march in Washington DC and 
I went and challenged some of these anti

1351
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:05,771
gun protestors and I had someone follow 
me around with a camera and I had four 

1352
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:06,160
hours of discussions with people.

1353
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,460
There was one discussion that I didn't 
even remember with a woman.

1354
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:14,490
It was about second amendment rights.
We put it up nine and a half million 

1355
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,211
views and I couldn't understand what it 
was and she was kind of getting very 

1356
01:07:18,211 --> 01:07:18,460
abrasive,
but she was saying such crazy things,

1357
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:20,770
but I must've struck a chord.
And so interesting you say that,

1358
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:24,720
that there's.
There's two realities and really there's

1359
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:29,730
one where you have.
It's how it's perceived when you're 

1360
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:30,550
there,
how people feel and how it sounds,

1361
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:31,390
you know,
Echo,

1362
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:36,391
location wise and all that,
but also the people that watch it when 

1363
01:07:36,391 --> 01:07:38,941
you cut it up or the video afterwards,
which in some ways is even more 

1364
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:38,941
powerful.
Well,

1365
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:38,941
it,
it,

1366
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:39,110
it's,
it's,

1367
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:40,750
it is more powerful,
period.

1368
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:46,050
Well,
this is also why I think it's so useful 

1369
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:46,050
just to say what you think you know,
in,

1370
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:49,060
in a more fundamental way,
because one of the ideas that has guided

1371
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:52,270
me in doing what I've been doing is that
you wanted,

1372
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:57,250
you want to let go of the consequences 
of your actions and say what you believe

1373
01:07:57,251 --> 01:07:57,880
to be true.

1374
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That doesn't mean you should be a full 
about it or that you should say 

1375
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,820
everything all the time,
but the reason that you.

1376
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:07,390
This is this fundamental hallmark of 
faith.

1377
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:12,391
I believe in faith in the truest sense 
is the belief that truthful speech 

1378
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:18,661
redeemed the world and that's a weird 
faith because what that means is that 

1379
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:23,710
let's say you say some things and you're
doing your best to be truthful and you 

1380
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:23,900
get in trouble.
You Think,

1381
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:25,130
oh my God,
that didn't work.

1382
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:30,131
It's like,
actually you don't know whether or not 

1383
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:31,370
it worked because you can't calculate 
the full consequences of your action.

1384
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,400
And so it could be that it worked just 
fine,

1385
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:39,401
but it was painful in the short term and
lots of things that worked fine or 

1386
01:08:39,401 --> 01:08:41,330
painful in the short term.
And so there is a leap of faith that has

1387
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:41,900
to be made.

1388
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:46,900
And I think that the reason that the 
biblical corpus is so powerful in part 

1389
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,771
is because it's predicated on the 
fundamental assumption that truthful 

1390
01:08:50,771 --> 01:08:54,410
speech turns the potential of of 
reality.

1391
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:59,240
The potential is but you free well that 
which is,

1392
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:01,130
which is who the hell would ever believe
that,

1393
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:02,150
right?
Because that isn't what,

1394
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:07,270
that isn't how it looks.
What it looks like is that the truth 

1395
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:07,420
will get you in trouble.
Of course,

1396
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:09,980
what happens is it gets you in trouble 
in the short term and,

1397
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:13,130
and freeze you in the and other people 
in the medium to longterm.

1398
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,990
And so,
okay,

1399
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,480
so back to your plants.
So where are you headed in the future?

1400
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:19,160
So the organization is,
uh,

1401
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:21,350
is growing rather dramatically.
It's quite exciting.

1402
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:23,540
So we have what's called vision 20,
20.

1403
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:27,290
We want to help move youth sentiment 
towards free enterprise and free speech,

1404
01:09:27,291 --> 01:09:29,930
kind of those general issues,
20 points by 2020.

1405
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,720
So we're ramping up our organization 
dramatically,

1406
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,820
um,
to hopefully a $20,000,000

1407
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:36,500
budget and the higher,
you know,

1408
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,870
over 200 people on staff across the 
states,

1409
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:40,300
which will be a,
um,

1410
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,560
a monumental accomplishment to able to 
do is near field staffers.

1411
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:48,580
These are organizers and in some ways my
whole perspective from the very 

1412
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:50,020
beginning,
I called ourselves the move on.org

1413
01:09:50,021 --> 01:09:55,021
or the right now move on.org
as a political social activism 

1414
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:56,180
organization based in the states for far
left wing causes.

1415
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,530
I,
I don't.

1416
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,930
And to this day with,
this is what drives our organization.

1417
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:03,380
I don't think the left should have a 
monopoly on grassroots activism and they

1418
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:05,540
almost always have,
um,

1419
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,600
there's no reason for that lot.
The biggest is that we have a builtin 

1420
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,000
counterrevolution bring on our college 
campuses,

1421
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:18,001
uh,
students that are being punished for 

1422
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:19,991
thinking differently and there is an 
organic uprising of students that are 

1423
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:21,890
joining our organization,
attending our events,

1424
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:27,160
you know,
implementing leadership positions in 

1425
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,940
student government and other places 
because they're fed up,

1426
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:33,970
they've had enough and I can't tell what
it would be really good if it for about 

1427
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,931
15 years it wasn't the most left leaning
radicals who controlled the student 

1428
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:39,020
newspapers and the student union.

1429
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,130
So it's been like that since I went to 
college back in the 19 nineties,

1430
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,920
1972.
The programming we're implementing,

1431
01:10:44,921 --> 01:10:49,921
it is encouraging our students to run 
for student leadership on campus rather 

1432
01:10:49,921 --> 01:10:49,950
successfully.
Um,

1433
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
and there's a lot,
there's a lot that we can show to 

1434
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:55,000
actually change the campus culture and 
climate by doing so that,

1435
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,890
that these student unions aren't 
divesting from fossil fuels,

1436
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:03,040
fuels are saying there's no such thing 
as genders or just astonishingly 

1437
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,590
radical,
you know,

1438
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:06,680
sentiments.
And so as an organization more broadly,

1439
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:07,710
um,
there,

1440
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,560
there's a lot of different ways we 
measure success.

1441
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,020
Things I can talk about publicly and 
things I can't talk about publicly,

1442
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,550
but we,

1443
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:19,940
we are,
we are very concerned about the current 

1444
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:22,980
trajectory of the west and I believe in,
I said this many times,

1445
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:24,840
I believe the greatest threat to Western
civilization.

1446
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:29,841
What is,
what's happening on American college 

1447
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:29,841
campuses?
Um,

1448
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,080
it's even more so than any other 
geopolitical flow.

1449
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:34,620
It's more so than what's happening in 
Washington dc because more than anything

1450
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:39,621
else,
you have a generation that has been 

1451
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:39,780
inculcated to believe that America is a 
mistake.

1452
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,600
Everything about the West is wrong.
Well,

1453
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:45,210
the thing is there,
America is a mistake and so is the west,

1454
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:47,190
but compared to other mistakes,
it's pretty damn.

1455
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,600
Like you said,
it's life is suffering.

1456
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:52,170
It's finding the words.
It's finding the best,

1457
01:11:52,171 --> 01:11:55,350
worst model that is possible and what so
divine.

1458
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:58,500
I think about what the founding fathers 
realized is they said,

1459
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:02,390
yeah,
people suck that systems get corrupted.

1460
01:12:02,910 --> 01:12:04,530
Civilizations are ruined.

1461
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,770
Things fall apart essentially.
So how do we decentralize that to the 

1462
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:14,271
furthest extent so that we can have a 
hedge against the inevitability of human

1463
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,090
agree with you completely.
I do think that that was the.

1464
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,800
That's the fundamental stroke of genius.
It isn't.

1465
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:24,950
How can we bring about utopia is how can
we design a system that idiots can't 

1466
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,340
screw up too badly given that we're all 
idiots?

1467
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:27,290
Precisely.
Yeah.

1468
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,510
That's real wisdom and it's,
and it's,

1469
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,710
it's,
it's real humility to it is.

1470
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:33,360
It is.
It's real humility as well.

1471
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:38,420
It means that you don't overreach 
yourself is that you're not presuming 

1472
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,930
that you know enough to bring about 
heaven on earth,

1473
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:42,960
but that maybe you can stave off the 
worst excesses of hell.

1474
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:48,050
That's right,
and what we teach our students and 

1475
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,481
what's not taught in our schools is the 
American founding was the first 

1476
01:12:50,481 --> 01:12:54,171
political revolution where the victors 
voluntarily gave up political power 

1477
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:54,171
wash.

1478
01:12:54,171 --> 01:12:58,730
It could have been the Washingtonian 
Hamiltonian Jeffersonian monarchy that 

1479
01:12:58,730 --> 01:12:59,580
rule America for the next 200 years.
They would have done quite well,

1480
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:04,790
rich and natural resources,
unaccompanied land that they could have 

1481
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,001
took over,
but what was so amazing to them and 

1482
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:08,001
their motivations,
I believe were pure,

1483
01:13:08,001 --> 01:13:10,440
is that they wanted to try something 
completely and totally different.

1484
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,960
They did not want to embrace that which 
they rebelled against,

1485
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,200
and as you said,
the humility for them to implement a 

1486
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:18,200
system has been replicated all 
throughout the west.

1487
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,790
I mean the idea of natural rights and 
decentralized government in democratic 

1488
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:22,790
elections,
in a constitutional republic.

1489
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:24,720
It's what built Western civilization,
Spain,

1490
01:13:24,721 --> 01:13:25,350
Portugal,
France,

1491
01:13:25,351 --> 01:13:30,351
Denmark,
they all have some form of that 

1492
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:30,351
governance,
a little differences here and there.

1493
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:31,920
And,
but now that's being challenged.

1494
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:37,220
That wealth of prosperity and standard 
of living increase and human rights 

1495
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,320
accomplishments is now being in our 
university center.

1496
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:39,680
No,
that was.

1497
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,390
This is all wrong.
This is all a racist,

1498
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:47,391
homophobic,
bigoted construct designed to benefit 

1499
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:50,121
white males.
It's a patriarchy must uproot the 

1500
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:50,121
system.
And so more broadly,

1501
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:55,000
um,
we are unbelievably privileged and 

1502
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,880
blessed to live in Western civilization 
even more specifically as an American.

1503
01:13:56,881 --> 01:14:01,881
I'm lucky to live in America and I'm 
going to fight every single day through 

1504
01:14:01,881 --> 01:14:06,471
the conduits and the vehicles that I've 
created to try to save this experiment 

1505
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,640
because the,
the,

1506
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:12,070
the,
the move that makes that something other

1507
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,420
than Jingoistic,
patriotism is the move that says this is

1508
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:19,150
all good fortune.
And that and,

1509
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:24,270
and that we should be grateful for that 
and that our moral obligation is to 

1510
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,910
sustain that,
to take up the responsibility,

1511
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,700
ability necessary to sustain that and to
improve it.

1512
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,330
It's not ours by birthright.
Not,

1513
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:35,140
not by any means.
This is also why,

1514
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:35,830
you know,
I'm,

1515
01:14:35,831 --> 01:14:37,480
I'm loath to,

1516
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:43,970
this is why I have trouble with right 
wing identitarianism because the right 

1517
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:47,421
wing identitarian tend to take to 
themselves the positive attributes of 

1518
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:51,381
their states without having to do the 
work necessary to place themselves among

1519
01:14:51,961 --> 01:14:54,570
the people who were the actual founders,
without a doubt.

1520
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:57,450
So it's identity politics or the right.
Yeah.

1521
01:14:57,780 --> 01:14:59,070
So,
all right,

1522
01:14:59,071 --> 01:15:04,071
so where can people learn more about 
your organization so that they ignored 

1523
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:07,550
our website [inaudible] dot com.
We have a massive conference coming up 

1524
01:15:07,550 --> 01:15:08,680
that I mentioned that we'd love to,
you know,

1525
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:12,420
of course have you keynote and you're.
And I'll say that I don't know if I said

1526
01:15:12,421 --> 01:15:13,530
this,
if I repeat myself,

1527
01:15:13,531 --> 01:15:14,850
I apologize.
You know,

1528
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:19,851
I've seen you save people's lives and 
you've changed my own and you're the by 

1529
01:15:19,851 --> 01:15:24,171
far the most requested speaker.
And I guess the question I have for you 

1530
01:15:24,171 --> 01:15:25,230
in the time,
the short time we have remaining,

1531
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:27,690
I guess is um,
have you,

1532
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:32,720
have you seen any of this visibility or 
popularity or fame change you or at 

1533
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:35,970
least change your pattern or your style 
of life or any of that?

1534
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:41,130
No,
it's completely changed it in some way 

1535
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:41,130
somehow.
How do you,

1536
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:44,100
how do you keep order in this?
Because it's chaotic,

1537
01:15:44,101 --> 01:15:46,140
isn't it?
I'm not very well,

1538
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:48,780
I from the master of your 
infrastructure.

1539
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,650
Sure.
You know,

1540
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:54,651
so I have more and more people helping 
me all the time and we've been fortunate

1541
01:15:54,661 --> 01:15:59,661
because we,
meaning my family because we've gone 

1542
01:15:59,661 --> 01:16:02,841
through this as a family.
We've been fortunate that people who 

1543
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:06,680
have the expertise necessary to help us 
with this have showed up at opportune 

1544
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:10,551
times.
And I've had enough people around me 

1545
01:16:10,551 --> 01:16:13,071
with their eyes open to help me point 
myself in the right direction and Fal 

1546
01:16:13,071 --> 01:16:17,000
myself that help.
I would say what it's done to me 

1547
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,811
personally,
mostly is just to make me more careful 

1548
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:27,440
because the costs of mistakes are while 
the cost of mistakes for me over the 

1549
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:31,071
last two years have been incredibly high
because precise and watching my every 

1550
01:16:31,071 --> 01:16:35,691
move,
including things that I've done in the 

1551
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:37,761
past to see if there's any credible 
evidence that I.

1552
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:42,940
Many of the terrible things that people 
would like me to be because it's a pain 

1553
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:43,810
in the neck for my leftist

1554
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:52,080
opponents,
let's say if I'm not a brute because 

1555
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,990
then I have to be contended with 
seriously.

1556
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:58,380
And so everything I've said and done,
it's been going over with a fine tooth 

1557
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,290
comb.
And luckily so far that's worked out.

1558
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,250
Although,
you know,

1559
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:05,630
that's grace of God and all of that.
And so mostly it's made me more careful 

1560
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:09,130
and more awake and more nervous all at 
the same time.

1561
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,330
You know,
just I wanted to say that you've,

1562
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:16,380
you've kept an unbelievable discipline 
of consistency throughout your career 

1563
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,920
and what I always joke around and we'll 
do that to you.

1564
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:21,260
Well,
in proper humility,

1565
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,520
which you have.
And um,

1566
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:26,930
few read enough 20th century history and
you actually tried to understand it,

1567
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:31,931
that'll make you humble enough and 
because you start thinking that if you 

1568
01:17:31,931 --> 01:17:32,000
have any sense and you read that 
history,

1569
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:37,001
you don't read it as a victim and you 
don't read it as the person that would 

1570
01:17:37,001 --> 01:17:37,001
set things right.

1571
01:17:37,001 --> 01:17:38,420
You read it as a perpetrator and you 
think,

1572
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,040
oh yeah.
So that's what people relate to it.

1573
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:42,710
I'm like,
that's what really,

1574
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:44,450
um,
again,

1575
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:49,451
open my eyes.
One of the stuff you said is imagined 

1576
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:49,451
being a prison guard,
Fitz Morris' imagined.

1577
01:17:49,451 --> 01:17:50,720
Enjoying it.
That's right.

1578
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:52,720
Imagine benefiting from it,
right?

1579
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:53,810
Which,
which you would.

1580
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:55,530
And you think you're such a good guy.
Really.

1581
01:17:55,531 --> 01:17:57,830
You'd stand up to the SS if you were 
part of them.

1582
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:00,470
And as you said,
the real evil of Hitler is,

1583
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,630
he didn't even use the utility of the 
Jews.

1584
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:07,631
He tried to kill Morris.
Has Civilization was crushing around 

1585
01:18:07,631 --> 01:18:07,790
him.
That's sinister stuff.

1586
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:13,260
I mean,
it would've made more sense to put in 

1587
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:13,260
the work camps to make rifles and you 
know,

1588
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,490
and bombs instead he tried to kill more 
of them and all that.

1589
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,610
That does seem to indicate that the 
fundamental motivation was destruction.

1590
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,620
That's regardless of the overlaying 
story,

1591
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,710
which I think is a perfectly reasonable 
hypothesis.

1592
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,360
Okay.
So let's say again,

1593
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:27,120
the website.
Sure.

1594
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,950
It's a TP USA.com.
So TP USA.com,

1595
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,230
they can follow me on twitter.
Uh,

1596
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:36,260
Charlie Kirk Eleven and um,
we're,

1597
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,850
we're fighting for the ideas that,
that created once.

1598
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:40,580
It would be nice,
you know,

1599
01:18:40,581 --> 01:18:45,581
to,
to think hard about how a couple of 

1600
01:18:45,581 --> 01:18:46,670
things that might be useful adjuncts and
maybe you guys have thought this through

1601
01:18:46,671 --> 01:18:48,230
to your organization is,
you know,

1602
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:53,231
there are places like the Founder 
Institute in California that are doing 

1603
01:18:53,231 --> 01:18:57,161
everything they can to start to help 
early stage entrepreneurs and it might 

1604
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:59,060
be really nice to make part of your,
um,

1605
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:04,750
your message,
the necessity for the people who are 

1606
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,650
part of your organization to,
to make a life plan,

1607
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:11,890
to figure out how they're putting 
themselves together as individuals to 

1608
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:12,950
center the activism on that.
And then to say,

1609
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:17,951
well,
you have to stand up and talk and speak 

1610
01:19:17,951 --> 01:19:21,010
whenever you're right to do that or your
responsibility to do that as being 

1611
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:21,080
interfered with.

1612
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:26,080
But the fundamental thing that you have 
to concentrate on is putting your life 

1613
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,290
in order that,
that keeps the Hubris at bay at least to

1614
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:32,291
some degree that that's correct.
And when you have 1200 women coming 

1615
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:32,300
together in June,
that's correct.

1616
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,200
Yes.
Phoenix.

1617
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:34,190
Oh,
that's in Dallas.

1618
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:39,220
That's in Dallas.
Of course you have an open invite to 

1619
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:39,220
everything and anything.
Well that's curious that,

1620
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:39,830
that'd be something.
Well,

1621
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:41,510
I'm interested in both of those,
you know,

1622
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:46,530
and I would like to.
I haven't spoken to enough to young 

1623
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,331
women.
I don't think we're doing a young men 

1624
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:49,331
summit,
I think next summer to,

1625
01:19:49,331 --> 01:19:50,420
of the design around you.
But the young women is interesting.

1626
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:52,160
I'll tell you why.
Um,

1627
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,760
I,
it is extraordinarily hard to be a young

1628
01:19:55,761 --> 01:20:00,761
conservative on American college campus.
It is a multiple of difficult to be a 

1629
01:20:00,761 --> 01:20:03,770
young conservative woman.
There's an expectancy of leftism.

1630
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,190
There is a hostility towards espousing 
any sort of conservative

1631
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,440
and the gathering of young ladies 
together in this,

1632
01:20:11,660 --> 01:20:12,900
in a,
in a summit,

1633
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:14,320
if you will,
which has grown dramatically.

1634
01:20:14,321 --> 01:20:19,321
We have 300,
800 and 1200 has been so useful and I'm 

1635
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:23,001
a very firm believer in um,
gender segregated education at times and

1636
01:20:23,701 --> 01:20:25,380
that's a horrible term,
but you know what I mean?

1637
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:28,220
Essentially having women only events,
um,

1638
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:30,780
there's something quite special that 
happens and same with mental events.

1639
01:20:30,781 --> 01:20:34,420
That's where the fraternity and sorority
structure came across in North American.

1640
01:20:34,421 --> 01:20:36,900
And so we'd love to have you maybe take 
a look at that.

1641
01:20:37,490 --> 01:20:39,140
Yeah,
well that would be.

1642
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,640
I'll do that and we can stay in touch 
about that.

1643
01:20:41,641 --> 01:20:42,750
And so.
All right,

1644
01:20:42,751 --> 01:20:47,751
well thank you.
We should probably bring this to a 

1645
01:20:47,751 --> 01:20:47,751
close,
so.

1646
01:20:47,751 --> 01:20:48,030
Great honor.
Thank you so much for agreeing to know.

1647
01:20:48,031 --> 01:20:49,980
Thank you.
This is one of the greatest honors of my

1648
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:50,640
life.
Thank you.

1649
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:57,030
The problem with wanting to be friends 
with your child is that that's not good 

1650
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,990
enough because as a parent,
you're not less than a friend.

1651
01:20:58,991 --> 01:21:02,380
You're far more than a friend.
You're someone that's going to be in the

1652
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:05,410
child's life for the duration of your 
life with any luck.

1653
01:21:05,710 --> 01:21:10,710
You're a longterm island of stability in
a sea of turbulence and the child needs 

1654
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:15,580
that far more than than he or she needs 
a friend.

1655
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:21,300
Parents need to be courageous because 
they have to let their children go and 

1656
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:25,651
make mistakes.
You have to let your child fall when 

1657
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:28,171
they're learning to walk.
They bump themselves up against the 

1658
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:31,291
world a lot and you don't want to do any
more for your child than you absolutely 

1659
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:36,061
have to,
and it means that there's a certain 

1660
01:21:36,061 --> 01:21:36,940
amount of detached harshness that has to
go along with your love and compassion.

1661
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:41,560
You have to stand back and let your 
child stumble forward towards mastery.

1662
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:46,800
Today's parents are terrified of their 
children because they're often afraid 

1663
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,491
that if they intervene in their lives,
that they'll make a mistake and that 

1664
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:53,761
that will be irrevocable and you have to
have the courage of your convictions.

1665
01:21:53,891 --> 01:21:57,430
When you have children and you have to 
understand that if you do make mistakes,

1666
01:21:57,431 --> 01:22:00,010
that you can learn and you can be 
forgiven.

1667
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:05,430
You don't have to be a perfect parent,
although you should aim up with your 

1668
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:09,061
children.
Parents are terrified of making 

1669
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:09,061
mistakes,
and that means that they're terrified of

1670
01:22:09,061 --> 01:22:12,160
being parents and they and that stops 
them from being parents.

1671
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:30,250
The.
