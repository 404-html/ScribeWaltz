26
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:41,744
tonight.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,440
[inaudible]

28
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,300
I hope I didn't miss anybody.
Did I miss somebody?

29
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,190
Oh,
pardon me.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,070
Uh,

31
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,620

He snuck in.

32
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:59,250
I don't know how he got in here without 
me,

33
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:00,021
Xenia,
Sean,

34
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,970
but uh,
thanks for being here as well.

35
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,523
Um,
I should also mention just a couple 

36
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,750
items before we begin to see evening.
Um,

37
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,280
there is a washrooms outside the main 
doors and to the right femoral,

38
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,420
the uh,
looking for the washrooms.

39
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,390
There's also a,
um,

40
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,920
trying to keep the flashes and the 
recordings to a minimum.

41
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,170
We do have a couple of photographers 
here tonight.

42
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,150
Um,
there,

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,050
this evening's event is being a fully 
recorded,

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,400
a video and audio and will be published 
online in its entirety.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,613
So,
uh,

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,733
don't need to do any other recording 
that will all magically appear on the 

47
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,520
Internet sometime tomorrow,
I would imagine.

48
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,580
So.
Um,

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,943
and it will of course will be free and 
available to everybody after tonight's 

50
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,830
presentations.

51
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,680
Um,
and I,

52
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:57,514
and I guess I should also state that 
this is not a partisan or political 

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
event tonight.
Um,

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,133
we will have a question and answer 
period after Dr. Peterson has made his 

55
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,014
presentation.
And I know many people here know much 

56
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:20,710
about Dr. Peterson.
He is widely read and,

57
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
uh,
knowledgeable and in saint full on a 

58
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,970
great many subjects.
But we would like to see the questions,

59
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,600
uh,
um,

60
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,150
relevant to tonight's topic.
Um,

61
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,090
so,
and with that,

62
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,290
I think I'll
just start a little bit about myself.

63
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,940
Before being elected,
before entering politics,

64
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,583
I like many other people was 
increasingly getting disappointed with 

65
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,254
the,
with the way government was conducting 

66
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:59,920
itself with the ever increasing 
government laws,

67
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,173
their rules,
their regulations that in my view were 

68
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,200
unduly infringing on what I considered 
my own personal jurisdiction,

69
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,970
my own personal responsibility.
And,

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,953
um,
and also how these increasing role of 

71
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,394
government was shifting and altering 
society in ways that I felt 

72
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,613
uncomfortable with,
that I felt were contrary to my beliefs 

73
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,470
and my values.

74
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,700
And like most people,
um,

75
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,283
I grumbled about it and grumbled and 
spoke with other people who grumbled 

76
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:50,641
about things.
But we didn't do very much about it.

77
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,130
We just board green and bore and the the
ever increasing role of government.

78
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,683
But back in 2002 very fortunately,
I came across a few other fellows who 

79
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,960
had very much same attitudes and values 
as myself.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,410
And in 2002,
four of us,

81
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,500
four of us met around a kitchen table,
um,

82
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,730
at Moreau and Ruth Bose home owed on the
concession for Ramsey.

83
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,280
And we decided that it was time to act.
Now,

84
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,500
none of us actually knew what that 
meant.

85
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
None of us had actually ever done 
anything about government,

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,333
but we knew that we needed to speak out 
and we knew that we needed to make a 

87
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:49,520
difference.
So we formed,

88
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,190
formed a group and we called it the 
land,

89
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,024
our land owners association.
And I was asked to be the spokesperson 

90
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,170
and the president of that New 
Association of four people.

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,880
And then of course we said,
that's great.

92
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,990
Now what do we do?
Well,

93
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,500
we decided to hold a meeting not far 
from here.

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,641
Indeed.
Oh,

95
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:22,110
lab over in beckwith township was their 
first meeting of the landmark landowners

96
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:25,440
association.
We went around the area,

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,210
we put up posters on Hydro Poles,
poles and telephone poles.

98
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:35,211
We put posters up in the general stores 
and the stores around the area.

99
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,003
And um,
and we also send a few letters to the 

100
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:42,490
newspapers,
um,

101
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,110
indicating what our concerns were.
And we wanted to see,

102
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,843
you know,
because we really had no idea if there 

103
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:56,520
was anybody else who thought like we 
did.

104
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,073
We knew there was a four of us,
but we didn't know if there was any 

105
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:02,850
others.
So we held this meeting,

106
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,070
um,
decided to give it a goal.

107
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,220
And surprisingly the hall was packed in 
Becker's township that night.

108
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,640
Um,
and people came,

109
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,700
they shared their stories.
The,

110
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,030
um,
um,

111
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,240
shared that they had similar thoughts,
similar beliefs,

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,780
similar values.
And at the end of that night,

113
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,640
our association of four people became an
association of 90 people.

114
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,153
And within the next five years,
the Lennar glam donors would grow to 

115
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,310
include chapters from around the 
province

116
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,140
and a membership of 15,000 people.
People found a vehicle to speak out.

117
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,163
Through that association,
they found a vehicle to become involved 

118
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,750
and to make a difference.
Excuse me.

119
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,063
Okay.

120
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,593
During those years,
we held many town halls in every corner 

121
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:16,824
of the province.
We provided testimony at government 

122
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:21,354
committee hearings.
We argued with politicians and 

123
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:27,750
bureaucrats alike in many different 
forms.

124
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,600
We had the Senate committee come out,
uh,

125
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:33,663
to murals house.
They wanted to hear more about our 

126
00:08:36,571 --> 00:08:39,210
stories.
Many people,

127
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,343
politicians and parties asked to meet 
with us and we had politicians and 

128
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:46,464
political parties knocking on our doors,
seeking our support and seeking our 

129
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,360
advice.
Now,

130
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:58,590
many of you will that we didn't just 
confine ourselves who the two,

131
00:08:58,591 --> 00:08:59,424
the gentlemanly arts of diplomacy in 
discussions with the landmark land 

132
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:03,214
owners as well.
On occasion we did a take activism and 

133
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,114
our voice to different heights.
We conduct conducted skits and plays at 

134
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,814
farmer's markets.
We shuttered and closed down government 

135
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,284
buildings.
We had a catalog action on Parliament 

136
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,423
Hill.
We held tractor rallies and closed down 

137
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:28,710
highways and bridges throughout the 
province.

138
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,923
We were very fortunate that we had a 
great many members with a great many 

139
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:35,664
skills and also a lot of creativity and 
passion for our subjects in our demand 

140
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:49,131
for greater personal responsibility and 
less government involvement.

141
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,053
In our property.
I learned many valuable lessons through 

142
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,114
those years,
many which were quite contradictory to 

143
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,514
the conventional wisdom.
The first lesson I learned is that we 

144
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:13,020
have a mistaken belief that political 
leaders are leaders.

145
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It became clear to me that most 
politicians are followers,

146
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,623
not leaders,
and that people must demonstrate and 

147
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:31,011
she'll government and politicians alike,
that in order to change a policy,

148
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,493
change an activity or an issue,
politicians require a demonstration of 

149
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,424
public support.
Political parties often use polling or 

150
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,700
focus groups to determine where it's 
safe to go.

151
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,810
And when I'm speaking about politics and
government,

152
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,180
I'm leaning more to the provincial and 
federal side of politics as well.

153
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,660
I want to make that clear.
Municipal politics is very much,

154
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,853
of course,
it's not a party oriented system at 

155
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:11,331
municipal level and there's a a great 
many differences at the municipal level,

156
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,810
but political parties use that,
those focus groups and polling to try to

157
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:23,820
determine where it's safe for them to 
go.

158
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,273
But in doing so,
it really negates in diminishes that 

159
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,590
fundamental principle of representative 
democracy,

160
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,503
elected people and parties speaking with
and knowing the pulse of their 

161
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,340
communities,
their constituents,

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
their constituency,
but also it helping to lead and advocate

163
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,390
for change for the better.
In short,

164
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,000
democracy does not mean to government.
It does not mean politicians,

165
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,990
although they are both necessary 
ingredients.

166
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,890
Representative democracy means you and 
me.

167
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,473
It means us.
That's what representative democracy 

168
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,243
must have for it to function properly.
It does not include the words they or 

169
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,834
them.
It is you and I for a representative 

170
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,364
democracy to work
the other lesson and I often often 

171
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:39,790
during those days with the land owners,
I would be approached by people.

172
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,523
People would come up to me and many 
venues and invariably they would say 

173
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,320
something like,
along this line,

174
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,920
someone ought to do something about 
this.

175
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,740
Always they would come up to me,
say someone ought to do something,

176
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,780
and that went on for quite a period of 
time.

177
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,433
It took me a little while to catch on 
that when they were saying someone they 

178
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:11,860
met me or when they said someone,
it meant not them.

179
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,443
Right.

180
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,940
And,
and I did learn that,

181
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,913
you know,
I had listened to their suggestion and 

182
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:26,080
their idea and when they told me then 
someone ought to do something,

183
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,010
I would agree with them and say,
someone ought to.

184
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,160
And I know where you can find that 
someone.

185
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,420
And they would look at me
with a questioning look and say,

186
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,294
well,
who?

187
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,003
And I would say,
look in the mirror and you will find 

188
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,590
that very someone that you're looking 
for.

189
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,023
And until you do look in the mirror,
you will never find that someone who 

190
00:13:53,561 --> 00:13:57,040
ought to do something.
And that was a,

191
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,310
um,
um,

192
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,310
it actually worked.
It actually got people,

193
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:06,664
it motivated people to actually think 
about what they were saying and think 

194
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,290
about what they were doing and what they
wanted to do.

195
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,020
I could go on and on about the lessons 
that I learned,

196
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:27,570
um,
the rewarding actions and activities and

197
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:32,620
the successes that we enjoyed with the 
land owners.

198
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,930
But tonight I know that there's someone 
who has a far broader,

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
far deeper understanding and 
understanding of the importance of civic

200
00:14:45,371 --> 00:14:48,190
engagement,
the understanding,

201
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,893
and also the thoughts and knowledge of 
how to help find people to find their 

202
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:00,860
voice and to become influential.
Tonight.

203
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:04,730
We are honored to have that individual 
here tonight.

204
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,870
He is a professor of psychology at the 
University of Toronto.

205
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,783
He's a clinical psychologist.
He is bringing knowledge and insight of 

206
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,653
humanity to tens of thousands of people 
through his online activities and is 

207
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,870
free university lectures.
And I'll tell you,

208
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,310
I'm not one to generally watch 
university lectures,

209
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,310
let alone,
uh,

210
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,163
lectures on psychology.
But I started watching his lectures on 

211
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,770
maps of meaning and I was astonished,
you know,

212
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,383
uh,
the first one was like two and a half 

213
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,674
hours in length and I watched the first 
five of them and I think it was the 

214
00:15:55,821 --> 00:16:00,380
first five of them was a,
well part of it.

215
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,483
It'll do over 10 hours.
I'm not going to get into all the 

216
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,084
details over 10 hours,
but these lectures was 10 hours of 

217
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,410
breaking down in dissecting and 
understanding a story.

218
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,250
The Story of Pinocchio.
No,

219
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,840
I found that amazing that I,
that I could watch these lectures first.

220
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,820
But you know,
I,

221
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,260
I've,
I know about,

222
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,113
I know the story of Pinocchio.
It wasn't that interesting to me as a 

223
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:35,200
kid,
the hub,

224
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,513
and it certainly wouldn't have taken me 
10 hours to describe the story to 

225
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:46,220
anybody else.
But anyway,

226
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,060
so that's just an aside.
If you want to really buy something,

227
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:50,894
I find that interesting.
But I also first came across this 

228
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,140
individual years ago.
Uh,

229
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,510
I'm an avid watcher of TV,
owes a agenda with Steve Pakan,

230
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,753
um,
gets into a lot of provincial policy 

231
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,360
and,
uh,

232
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,690
I find Steve Pagan,
the,

233
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,320
um,
very credible journalist and uh,

234
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,393
often this fellow would be on Steve 
Pagans agenda show and I would watch 

235
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:19,640
with interest,
uh,

236
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,920
when he was there.
So,

237
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:24,643
but in my estimation,
this gentleman is one of Canada's 

238
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:32,540
foremost thinkers and with a very 
significant twist.

239
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,093
He has a courage and the conviction to 
speak out against some of those false 

240
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:44,270
woods of conventional wisdom and 
political correctness.

241
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,890
I know he has much to offer,
a lot of wisdom and

242
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,180
it is my pleasure to welcome to 
commonplace and Dilana County,

243
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,890
Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson.

244
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,080
They're on this tonight.

245
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,740
You can hear me.
Okay,

246
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,613
here we go.
Thank you Mr [inaudible] for the 

247
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:11,270
introduction and also for the 
invitation.

248
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,733
So not everyone will invite me places.
So it's nice when an invitation shows 

249
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,540
up.
Yeah,

250
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,170
yeah.
And when I'm actually allowed to speak,

251
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,004
that's also good.
So I have a habit of not preparing my 

252
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:29,204
talks until really the last minute.
And I mean that's not exactly true 

253
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:33,224
because I've been thinking about what 
I'm going to talk to you about tonight 

254
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:39,650
for a very long time.
But I really only got the title for this

255
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:43,370
talk firmly in place about half an hour 
ago.

256
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,823
And,
and one of the things I'd like to do 

257
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:49,250
when I'm speaking to people is to tell 
them what I'm thinking about,

258
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,470
not what I've already thought about,
you know,

259
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,810
and certainly not what I know,
but what I'm thinking about,

260
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:58,130
what I'm trying to figure out.
And so one of the things that's happened

261
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,680
to me over the last year,
somewhat surprisingly,

262
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,514
is that I'd been invited to speak in 
front of a lot of conservative groups 

263
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,283
and,
uh,

264
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,550
a lot of them were conservative groups 
that were composed of young people.

265
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,320
And that was interesting,
you know,

266
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:13,154
because conservatism
isn't something that's necessarily all 

267
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:18,674
that easy to sell to young people 
because they tend not to be that 

268
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:23,550
conservative to begin with.
Um,

269
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,500
conservatism also tends to have quite a 
lot to do with things that you shouldn't

270
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:29,900
do and instead of things that you might 
be allowed to do.

271
00:19:29,901 --> 00:19:31,820
And so there's a restrictive element of 
it.

272
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,240
It's also perhaps less attractive to 
young people then it might be,

273
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,403
people do tend to get more conservative 
as they get older as their personality 

274
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:40,250
shift.
And so,

275
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:43,880
but what I saw was very interesting 
because I saw,

276
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,340
and then this was particularly true of 
young men.

277
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,670
Um,
and I,

278
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:50,270
I haven't quite puzzled that out yet,
but you know,

279
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,373
I would talk about what was going on in 
the universities and what I thought 

280
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,660
might constitute a reasonable antidote 
to that.

281
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,470
And that was not only in the 
universities but also politically,

282
00:20:00,471 --> 00:20:01,304
but,
and that was both the adoption of 

283
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:04,934
responsibility instead of the incredible
and constant stress that's being placed 

284
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:09,554
on rights and also the responsibility of
the citizen to speak forward what he or 

285
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:19,691
she believed to be true or at least to 
not speak what they knew to be false,

286
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:21,494
which is at least a good place to start.
And one of the things I found so 

287
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:27,860
remarkable was that this was actually a 
salable message to young people.

288
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,113
And that surprised me because you know,
you wouldn't necessarily think that you 

289
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,374
would turn a lot of lights on any young 
audience by talking to people about 

290
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,230
truth and responsibility.
I think if you,

291
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,710
if you went to a marketing agency and 
told them that that was going to be your

292
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:43,544
political message to young people,
they would tell you to go back and you 

293
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,010
know,
flesh out another plan,

294
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,993
sketch out another plan.
But maybe young people have been talked 

295
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:55,510
to enough about rights for maybe about 
the next 15 decades.

296
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:58,270
That's what I would think.
And so maybe there's a hunger,

297
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,104
a rising among young people for 
something that has a little bit more 

298
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,603
respectability,
let's say a little bit more depth than 

299
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,530
the constant emphasis on,
on

300
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,150
doing whatever you want,
whenever you want.

301
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,620
Let's,
let's put it that way.

302
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,140
The thing about that and the thing about
rights in general,

303
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,890
the idea of rights is that rights don't 
really give you much direction,

304
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,783
right?
They,

305
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
they tell you what you are in principal 
allowed to do,

306
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:26,430
but they don't really tell you what you 
should do and it actually turns out that

307
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:29,070
you need to know what you should do 
because you need to do something right.

308
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:33,150
People are active and our lives don't 
have any meaning without something to do

309
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:36,350
and it and something that you should do.
It can't just be something that you want

310
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:39,060
to do that's too shallow.
There's no deep meaning.

311
00:21:39,061 --> 00:21:41,520
There's no enduring,
there's no sustaining meaning in that.

312
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,820
It's just impulsiveness and [inaudible].
And maybe that's okay.

313
00:21:44,821 --> 00:21:45,654
In some sense,
maybe that's entertaining and maybe 

314
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:47,544
it's,
and maybe it's impulsively exciting and 

315
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,650
fun and there's some,
there's some utility in that for life.

316
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,450
But life is a very difficult journey.
Let's say it involves a lot of suffering

317
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,310
and ill.
It involves a lot of,

318
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,150
of heavy existential weight.
And you need to be able to put something

319
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,480
of value up against that so that you can
withstand your life and you can stand up

320
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:09,864
with some dignity and you can contribute
to your community and you can feel that 

321
00:22:12,091 --> 00:22:14,110
you're a worthwhile person,
you know,

322
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,963
in spite of all the things that are,
that you're doing wrong and in spite of 

323
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:18,774
all the problems that you have.
And so then people need to know what 

324
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:21,654
they should do.
And one of the things they should do is 

325
00:22:22,891 --> 00:22:23,724
take responsibility.
And another thing they should do is try 

326
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:26,064
to tell the truth because those two 
things help them live proper lives and 

327
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,820
then help society organize itself 
properly.

328
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,410
And that's,
that's good.

329
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:35,910
That's good for everyone.
So,

330
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,433
and so it turns out that when you tell 
young people that they're pretty damn 

331
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,274
happy about that.
And so one of the things I thought I 

332
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:43,854
would do tonight is talk about what 
conservatives might have to offer to 

333
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:51,360
young people as a saleable message.
You know,

334
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:54,030
because the other thing I've learned 
over the last year,

335
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,073
and this was quite

336
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,230
revealing,
let's put it that way.

337
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:03,100
I'll start with a brief or story just as
a little intro to this.

338
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,413
In the last three weeks,
some of you may know that there was 

339
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,804
quite a political storm that emerged,
particularly among journalists over the 

340
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:12,244
issue of cultural appropriation.
A number of journalists got in real 

341
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:15,994
trouble for transgressing the 
politically correct norms in 

342
00:23:19,541 --> 00:23:23,360
relationship to cultural appropriation.
Tremendously ill defined.

343
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:26,920
And let's call it pathological concept.
We could start with that,

344
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,450
but,
but the thing that was so interesting,

345
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:33,730
and I think I probably talked to 10 of 
Canada's top 20 journalists,

346
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:36,310
that would be a reasonable estimate.
Most of them in print,

347
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,144
but not all of them.
Every single one of them told me that 

348
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,150
they were censoring themselves.
Or you think about that,

349
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:44,320
man,
that's no joke.

350
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:46,250
In a country like this and these people,

351
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,791
you'd think,
well,

352
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,500
if anyone has power,
they have power.

353
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,000
It's like,
well they don't really have power.

354
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,983
They have competence and influence and 
that's not the same thing as power and 

355
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,434
they're bloody afraid of being hung out 
to dry if they say the wrong thing and 

356
00:23:57,021 --> 00:24:00,830
you think about where our damn country 
is when the 10 most powerful journalists

357
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:03,950
in the country are afraid to write and 
say what they think,

358
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,510
that's not a good thing,
man.

359
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,523
That's not a good thing.
I don't care what it is that they want 

360
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:11,870
to say or think the fact that they're 
not only did they tell me that they were

361
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:12,704
censoring themselves and that they felt 
that they would be hung out to dry if 

362
00:24:15,141 --> 00:24:15,974
they said the wrong thing,
but they also told me that they were 

363
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,760
being censored by their editors.
And so,

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,833
you know,
in a country that has a great tradition 

365
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,433
and a tradition that's much longer than 
this country has been around of freedom 

366
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:31,844
and free speech and free press for us to
be in a situation now where our major 

367
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:37,304
journalists are afraid that if they 
misstep inappropriately in this new 

368
00:24:40,971 --> 00:24:44,030
found political landmine that they're 
going to be done.

369
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,400
That is not good.
Right.

370
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,640
That's a bad diagnostic sign.
Okay,

371
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,474
well I said that story was a little 
intro to the other story was going to 

372
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,450
tell you.
And then,

373
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:58,451
so I've been fortunate enough over the 
last several months to meet,

374
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,923
not the majority of the people who ran 
for the leadership of the Federal 

375
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,993
Conservative Party,
but most of them,

376
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
including the people,
the person who Andrew,

377
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:10,190
who recently won.
And uh,

378
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,073
they all told me the same thing,
which was also interesting was that the 

379
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,850
conservatives were afraid to be 
conservative.

380
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,743
And for exactly the same reason,
they were afraid that if they put 

381
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,594
forward valid conservative perspectives 
that they would be isolated and mobbed 

382
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,310
and taken down and,
and that made them censor themselves and

383
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:33,470
not be willing to speak up.
And I thought,

384
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:35,570
and I told each of them when we 
discussed this,

385
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:38,000
the same thing was if you guys are 
afraid to talk,

386
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,830
you've already lost.
You want as well,

387
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:42,470
just pack up and go home.
It's done.

388
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,700
Now,
you know,

389
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:44,690
as a psychologist

390
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,800
[inaudible]

391
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,420
I gotta say I'm not making a case for 
conservatism.

392
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm not here to make a political case.
Right?

393
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,833
I'm here to make a philosophical and 
psychological case and I think that's 

394
00:25:59,571 --> 00:26:02,000
what I've been doing all along.
It has political implications.

395
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,360
So I'm not saying that you should be 
conservative or that conservative is the

396
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,194
only way to be cause I actually don't 
believe that for for a variety of 

397
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,434
reasons.
One of the reasons is that I know that 

398
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,543
political belief is determined in large 
part by temperament and personality and 

399
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:19,100
that's very strongly biologically 
influenced.

400
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,710
And so conservatives tend to be lower 
and openness,

401
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:22,544
which is a trait associated with 
creativity and higher in 

402
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:25,514
conscientiousness,
which is a trait associated with 

403
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,973
industriousness and orderliness.
They tend to make good managers and 

404
00:26:30,231 --> 00:26:31,064
administrators and lawyers,
they tend to make good conservative 

405
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,520
business types.
That's,

406
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,620
that's their forte,
that's their niche.

407
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,190
And that's a valid place to be in a 
valid thing to be.

408
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,233
And you know,
conservatives aren't so good at being 

409
00:26:42,591 --> 00:26:43,424
entrepreneurial.
They're not so good at being artistic 

410
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,350
and creative.
That's not their niche.

411
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,130
That's more the niche of the liberal end
of the spectrum as far as I'm concerned,

412
00:26:50,131 --> 00:26:52,530
for the political system to function 
properly,

413
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,550
you need proper representation for all 
the temperamental types and they need to

414
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,560
be engaged in dialogue.
So,

415
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,260
but the thing is is that when the 
conservatives are saying,

416
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,220
well,
you know,

417
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,090
especially when they're perhaps thinking
about leading the damn party,

418
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,013
let's say that they're worried about 
speaking their mind in a conservative 

419
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:13,170
manner,
that's just not a good thing.

420
00:27:13,171 --> 00:27:14,004
That means that something's gone wrong 
with our political system and seriously 

421
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:17,160
wrong.
You know?

422
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:17,994
And the other thing that,
another thing that I've noticed it 

423
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,180
thing,
you know when,

424
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,510
when this all,
some of you may know and some of you may

425
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,940
not know that I made a couple of videos 
back.

426
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,773
September 27th I woke up one night 
because I couldn't sleep and I thought 

427
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,040
are usually going right if I can't sleep
because I've got something to figure out

428
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:35,874
and,
but I've been playing with youtube 

429
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,254
videos,
I've been putting my lectures online 

430
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:41,880
since 2013 and by last April they had 
about a million views.

431
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:43,200
And so I thought,
wow,

432
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,270
that's,
that's really something man.

433
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,373
You know,
like you write a book and you sell a 

434
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,770
million copies,
you're one happy character.

435
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,400
And I thought I had a million views is a
very large number of views.

436
00:27:53,401 --> 00:27:54,234
It really tuned me into the fact that 
youtube was something completely other 

437
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:58,140
than what I thought it was.
But anyways,

438
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,090
that night I thought,
oh,

439
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,720
I'll get up and make a video instead of 
writing it down.

440
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,800
And this was a video about bill 
[inaudible],

441
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,130
which by the way,
the Senate just passed,

442
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,130
right?
Half the Conservatives voted for it.

443
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,910
Despite the fact that the justice 
minister was presented with an amendment

444
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,050
that clearly indicated that bill 
[inaudible] would not infringe upon free

445
00:28:19,051 --> 00:28:21,600
speech and refuse to consider the 
amendment.

446
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,530
So that's where we are.
There's compelled speech is now,

447
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:26,364
the law in Canada isn't yet,
but it's going to be very soon and half 

448
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,050
the conservatives voted for that damn 
bill.

449
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,460
And I can tell you to,
you know,

450
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,680
people have gone after me for being,
you know,

451
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,533
anti-trans gender and bigoted and phobic
and all that nonsense that the left 

452
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,520
tends to hurl at people.
It's not the case.

453
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,354
I read that damn legislation and I read 
the policies surrounding it and I know 

454
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,930
perfectly well that the way it's 
formulated right now,

455
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,260
it will do more harm to the people it 
purports to protect than good.

456
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,100
That'll take about 10 years to unfold.
But it's so incoherent.

457
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,300
And the,
the,

458
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,203
the,
the principles upon which that 

459
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:00,624
legislation and its surrounding policies
are based are so paradoxical and 

460
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:04,704
contradictory that they will act 
themselves out because that's what 

461
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:10,920
happens with paradoxical beliefs and 
tangled people up like the Matt,

462
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,120
like Thai tangled people up in them like
mad.

463
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,400
And we'll see that happen over the next 
decade.

464
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,910
And it's partly because the people who 
put bill six see 16 forward,

465
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,270
especially with regards to its 
surrounding policies.

466
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,104
The ones that are detailed out on the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission website 

467
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,050
don't give a damn about transgender 
people as far as I'm concerned there.

468
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,033
There's another agenda at work that's 
driving their entire political force 

469
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,234
forward.
And the transgender types were just 

470
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:38,790
flavor of the month,
right?

471
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:42,550
They were poster boys for moving this 
agenda forward.

472
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,910
And so the fact that the legislation 
isn't going to do them any good,

473
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,763
you're the transgendered people,
any good isn't going to stop the people 

474
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:52,090
who put the legislation forward.
So anyways,

475
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,930
I made these videos and I put them on a,
on youtube and well,

476
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:01,840
to say that they caused a storm is 
somewhat of an understatement.

477
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,680
I mean,
it's just been,

478
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,580
I just,
I,

479
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,453
I don't even know what to think about.
It's completely an absolutely surreal 

480
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:09,670
what,
what's happened to me.

481
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,540
All right,
good.

482
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:12,010
And as a consequence of that,
I mean,

483
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,410
I don't know how many people have 
watched those original videos,

484
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:15,244
like 350,000 and I think now about 50 
million people have watched videos 

485
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,080
associated with this sequence of events 
that I'm describing,

486
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:23,914
which is just 350,000 people watched the
testimony that I gave before the Senate 

487
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:32,800
on bill [inaudible].
You bloody well know that the apocalypse

488
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:37,801
is close when 350,000 people around the 
world watch a Canadian Senate hearing.

489
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,660
So I really,
I mean,

490
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:42,340
really what's going on man?

491
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,290
[inaudible]

492
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,650
so anyways,
you know,

493
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:50,484
so you know,
I said well the journalists are nervous 

494
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:55,950
in the and the,
and the conservatives are nervous and,

495
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,260
and uh,
well then you know,

496
00:30:58,261 --> 00:30:59,094
when I,
when I put myself out in and made these 

497
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:02,034
videos,
which are really didn't expect to 

498
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:03,984
attract much attention at all,
I just assumed that I was going to 

499
00:31:05,401 --> 00:31:07,350
clarify what I was thinking a little bit
and you know,

500
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:08,184
and see what happened.
I kind of a curious person now that'll 

501
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,170
teach me but I'm kind of a curious 
person.

502
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:14,790
And so,
um,

503
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,773
but then you know,
I also experienced firsthand what 

504
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,680
happens when you do something like that.
Now Watch,

505
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,300
I got nailed right.
It got,

506
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,253
especially for about three months,
things were pretty up in the air at the 

507
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,440
university sent me two letters telling 
me that it,

508
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,820
it was so funny cause I remember I made 
this video and I said,

509
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,830
you know,
under this new legislation,

510
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,490
making this video,
criticizing this legislation is probably

511
00:31:35,491 --> 00:31:36,324
illegal.

512
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,313
And so then the unit and people of 
course reacted to me as if I was 

513
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,550
scaremongering,
which by the way,

514
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:42,384
was the right response.
When you hear someone in a stable 

515
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:46,380
society stand up and say,
excuse me,

516
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,693
there's a,
there's something rotten at the base 

517
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:49,914
here and it's affecting the manner in 
which the legislation that our country 

518
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:53,520
is producing is,
is,

519
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,880
is being rolled fourth,
when they say that you should think that

520
00:31:56,881 --> 00:32:00,510
person is probably a charlotte and has 
something wrong with them because look,

521
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,000
the culture works pretty good.
The country has worked really well for a

522
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:03,834
long period of time.
And so the logical initial response 

523
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,020
should be,
yeah,

524
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:07,854
you think there's a fundamental problem,
why shouldn't we just assume that 

525
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:10,464
there's a fundamental problem with you?
And one of the ways that you determine 

526
00:32:13,741 --> 00:32:14,574
that is you throw things out the person 
metaphorically and see if any of them 

527
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:18,660
stick.
Right?

528
00:32:18,661 --> 00:32:19,411
So,
you know,

529
00:32:19,411 --> 00:32:23,310
I was a big get to know homophobic and 
transphobic and a racist.

530
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:24,144
That one,
I don't know where the hell that one 

531
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:26,280
came from.
I think it was because I,

532
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,700
I criticized the two.
Uh,

533
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,820
what would you call reprehensible women 
who started black lives,

534
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,530
the black lives matter movement,
Toronto.

535
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,364
It isn't because they're black.
It's because the reprehensible black or 

536
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:38,660
white man,
if you're,

537
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,393
you're reprehensible.
That's sort of the definition of not 

538
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:43,640
being racist.
Right?

539
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,953
So

540
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,340
anyways,
so,

541
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:56,850
so,
so there were a couple of demonstrations

542
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,070
and then the press jumped on me to some 
degree.

543
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,020
They didn't do too bad a job I didn't 
think.

544
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,280
And then the university thankfully wrote
two letters saying that what I was doing

545
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:08,010
was probably illegal and that it 
violated the,

546
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,933
the uh,
Ontario Human Rights Commission's 

547
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,184
policies and probably the university's 
policies as well as far as they were 

548
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:15,690
concerned,
which really wasn't the case.

549
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,970
And the letters also contained a number 
of untruths,

550
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:20,880
which I detailed because I read them on 
Youtube too,

551
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,400
which is actually quite helpful and 
handy that,

552
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,563
you know,
if someone writes me a letter that 

553
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,270
purports to lay out a set of facts,
then I can just read it.

554
00:33:30,271 --> 00:33:31,104
I don't even have to comment on it.
I can read it and let people make up 

555
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:35,280
their own minds,
which they did so,

556
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,140
so well.

557
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,973
And so my job was in del in in doubt,
but the fact that the university went 

558
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,190
after me actually turned out to be 
extremely helpful.

559
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:45,600
Right.
Because I had said,

560
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,583
look under the provisions of this new 
legislation and legislation like this 

561
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:54,330
that's already in place in Canada,
what I am doing criticizing this bill is

562
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:56,190
probably illegal.
And everyone said,

563
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:57,210
no,
you're crazy.

564
00:33:57,211 --> 00:33:58,560
You know you're,
there's something wrong with you.

565
00:33:58,561 --> 00:33:59,460
You're off.
You're a,

566
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,250
you're a scaremonger on a rabble rouser 
and all of that.

567
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,930
And then the university wrote a letter 
saying what you did violate it,

568
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,473
you know,
the university policy and probably the 

569
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,580
Ontario Human Rights Commission's 
policies and the law.

570
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,510
And I thought,
great,

571
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,523
you had your lawyers take a look at it.
I couldn't have asked for a more 

572
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,473
stronger statement,
a stronger statement in support of what 

573
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:20,154
I had said,
especially because it certainly wasn't 

574
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:23,010
written in support of what I had said.

575
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,203
So,
and then the journalists started to pay 

576
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:28,290
attention to what I had actually looked 
at and they read it and they thought,

577
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,380
Oh hey,
look at that,

578
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:30,214
that aren't dead.
Ontario Human Rights Commission website 

579
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,670
policy mass is actually quite a nest of 
spiders just like he said.

580
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:39,630
And so it turns out that there is 
something rotten in the state of Denmark

581
00:34:39,631 --> 00:34:42,870
and that's just not so good.
And so like this is a good country man.

582
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,883
That's why people want to come here.
It's one of the best countries in the 

583
00:34:45,811 --> 00:34:46,644
world.
Maybe it's the best country in the 

584
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,051
world.
I mean,

585
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,940
we don't want to get too high on her 
horse about that.

586
00:34:50,941 --> 00:34:52,710
And God,
aren't we fortunate,

587
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,990
but it's a pretty good place,
you know?

588
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:55,943
But it's not what it used to be.
And the people who are running it are 

589
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:01,470
not who you think they are.
So for example,

590
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,483
provincially,
let's take it the title that the people 

591
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:09,030
who follow Kathleen Wynne have is 
liberal.

592
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:09,923
They are not liberals,
they are radicals and they're radicals 

593
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:13,524
of a sword.
I used to work for the NDP when I was a 

594
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:15,504
kid back in the 70s and the people who 
are influential in Kathleen wins 

595
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:20,484
government and who are making the sort 
of policies that I regard is 

596
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:23,304
particularly reprehensible,
are the kind of radical leftists that 

597
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:31,251
the NDP working class socialists that I 
knew in the 1970s would have regarded as

598
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:32,874
the,
as the unacceptable fringe of the 

599
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,410
Socialist Party.
And they're now defunct.

600
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,110
They have now defined themselves as 
centrist liberals.

601
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,123
They are not,
and what they're doing is not centrist 

602
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:44,304
and it's not liberal.
And so that's another thing for the 

603
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:46,764
conservative party to start thinking 
about because you have a whole bunch of 

604
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,124
liberals you could go out there and 
capture because they've been abandoned 

605
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,720
by their own party.
And that's for sure.

606
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:55,554
And it's something that should be taken 
advantage of because well we need some 

607
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:58,944
conservatives and we need some 
socialists and maybe we need some 

608
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:01,944
liberals and the Liberals and the 
Conservatives are getting damn scarce 

609
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,510
among the people who actually make 
policy at not only at the provincial and

610
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:11,220
federal level but also at mid level.

611
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,790
Admitted at the top end of mid level 
administration is everywhere as well and

612
00:36:14,791 --> 00:36:15,624
that's not accidental.
It's partly because unbeknownst to the 

613
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:20,760
majority of society for the last 30 
years,

614
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,594
the damn universities have been doing 
nothing but training and targeted 

615
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,453
training,
radical leftist activists and if you 

616
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:30,744
don't believe that you just go on the 
web and look up like 10 women's studies 

617
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:38,430
programs and read what they say.
You don't have to listen to me.

618
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:40,380
You don't have it.
I don't want you to believe me.

619
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,110
You just go out there and find it for 
yourself.

620
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,190
And there the activism is devoted to a 
certain key set of ends and one of them,

621
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:48,900
for example,
here's a word to remember.

622
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,640
Equity.
Okay,

623
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,190
that's replaced equality of opportunity.
It's like,

624
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,630
okay,
equality of opportunity.

625
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:57,210
That's a tough one to bring about.
You know,

626
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,163
you need a fair bit of government 
intervention to bring about equality of 

627
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:01,040
opportunity.

628
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,480
It's maybe it's a noble goal,
it's a tough one to attain.

629
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,463
But equity,
equity means equality of outcome and 

630
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,680
you're seeing equity everywhere and 
that's what it means.

631
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,843
And so the people who are pushing this 
radical agenda are pushing things that 

632
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,244
are,
that are inimicable to our traditions 

633
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,740
and,
and practices of governance.

634
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:25,830
You know the Ontario social justice 
tribunals,

635
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,890
because we have social justice tribunals
in Ontario,

636
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
they don't even day now to hide the damn
name.

637
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,213
The social justice tribunals are allowed
to suspend standard jurisprudential 

638
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:41,550
practice in the pursuit of their aims.
It says that right in their policies.

639
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,540
Well you think about that re really 
that's written in your policies.

640
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,110
You can just dispense with classic 
jurisprudential tradition.

641
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,033
So what does that mean?
It means you can do any damn thing you 

642
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:54,420
want.
And so those are the sorts of,

643
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:59,070
I would say subversive and fifth column 
like organizations that are sprouting up

644
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,220
in our society everywhere.
It's not a good thing.

645
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,353
And so look,
when someone stands up and says there's 

646
00:38:05,941 --> 00:38:06,774
something wrong,
the first thing you should ask is what 

647
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,624
makes,
why should I assume that you know what 

648
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,650
the hell you're talking about?
That's a good question.

649
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,693
Well,

650
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,640
you investigate it and you find out 
whether or not the person does know what

651
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:21,474
they're talking about.
And on the issue that I'm describing to 

652
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:25,560
you tonight,
as far as I can tell,

653
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,513
I know what I'm talking about now.
People have been on my case about this 

654
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,743
in a very serious way for quite a long 
time and so far they haven't made any 

655
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:38,710
inroads into arguments and most of the 
time they're too damn cowardly to debate

656
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:39,544
me,
which is also something that's really 

657
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:42,940
interesting because I put out public 
calls constantly.

658
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,460
It's you want to debate about gender and
sex.

659
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:48,040
You just bring it on because that 
happens to me,

660
00:38:48,041 --> 00:38:52,030
happens to be an area of expertise for 
me and I know the damn literature and if

661
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:56,170
you want to come out and make your case 
that all the differences between men and

662
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:57,004
women are socially constructed,
culturally constructed or that there's 

663
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,800
just,
or that they're just a personal whim,

664
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,783
which by the way,
it's exactly what's written into the 

665
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,060
policies surrounding bill [inaudible].

666
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,073
Then you come out and make that case 
publicly and see how well it stands up 

667
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,883
and I know how well it'll stand up 
because that kind of thinking was 

668
00:39:14,321 --> 00:39:15,154
defeated in the scientific realm back in
the 1960s in the universities and what 

669
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:24,280
that meant was that the radicals who 
want it to keep promoting precisely that

670
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:27,970
kind of view just circumvented the 
entire scientific process and started to

671
00:39:27,971 --> 00:39:30,880
implement their demands for their 
particular viewpoint.

672
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:31,923
From a practical policy,
administrative and legislative 

673
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,134
perspective,
knowing full well that they had lost 

674
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,510
100% on the empirical and the scientific
front,

675
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,523
and now what they do instead is 
criticized the scientific endeavor 

676
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,093
itself because it failed to produce the 
results that they assumed would be the 

677
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:48,694
case.
So there's plenty that's rotten in the 

678
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:52,924
state of Denmark and I'm embarrassed to 
state that a tremendous amount of that 

679
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,480
stems from the universities and they're 
in bad shape.

680
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,680
Do not send your children to the 
humanities,

681
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,480
right?
They're corrupt.

682
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,493
They will.

683
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,993
They won't learn to think because the 
postmodernists don't believe in 

684
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,474
thinking.
They won't learn logic because the 

685
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:18,454
postmodernist believe that logic is one 
of the tools that the oppressive 

686
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:25,000
patriarchy uses to sustain its 
oppressive patriarchy

687
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,550
or oppressive patriarchal nature.
They won't learn to write well.

688
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:31,384
That's because writing,
teaching people to write takes a 

689
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:33,454
tremendous amount of effort and perhaps 
they're not so much interested in 

690
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,510
teaching people to formulate their own 
thoughts precisely and carefully as they

691
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:41,344
are interested in producing cult like 
clones to go out and do their activist 

692
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:46,414
work,
which is precisely what they stayed on 

693
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,310
their websites.
So,

694
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,980
you know,
things are not so pretty and,

695
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:51,814
and it's very embarrassing as a member 
of the academy and to come before a 

696
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,130
group of,
uh,

697
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:57,964
of public citizens and say you've been 
betrayed by your institutions of higher 

698
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:03,460
learning.
It's sad,

699
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,740
it's sad and it's not good.

700
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,731
And you know,
you think,

701
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,860
well it's just the university,
it's just an ivory tower.

702
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,390
It's like,
think again man.

703
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,930
What happens in the universities happens
everywhere five years later.

704
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,460
So it's no mere ivory tower issue.
So,

705
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,700
okay.
So a couple of weeks ago,

706
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,593
a couple of months ago I did this 
lecture and Vancouver called the left 

707
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:26,964
wing case for free speech because you 
can actually make a left wing case for 

708
00:41:29,741 --> 00:41:31,090
free speech pretty easily.
Right?

709
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:31,924
It's like,
obviously some people have more 

710
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,784
influence in authority than others and 
just as obviously it's harder for the 

711
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,910
people with less influence and authority
to make their case known.

712
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,490
So clearly they need to be able to make 
their case.

713
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,860
So that's the left wing case for free 
speech.

714
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:46,843
It's fairly straight forward.
I thought it needed to be made because 

715
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,203
especially on the radical left,
people seem to have forgotten that free 

716
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:53,930
speech was actually there.

717
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:59,110
Most what welcome friend and and enabled
them to do whatever good things they did

718
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:02,060
manage to do over the last hundred 
years.

719
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,320
But I made a left wing case and so that 
was easy and reasonably entertaining and

720
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:07,940
you can watch that on youtube if you 
want.

721
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,223
And so tonight what I thought I'd do as 
a counterpart to that is lay out what I 

722
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:16,910
believe might be some tenants for a 
viable 21st century conservatism.

723
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,590
And these are ideas that I'm playing 
with.

724
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:20,630
So I'm going to,
I wrote down about 12 of them.

725
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,640
I don't know if we'll get through all of
them,

726
00:42:22,641 --> 00:42:25,940
but we can,
we can start with a few and this is what

727
00:42:25,941 --> 00:42:28,790
the Conservatives could be selling to 
the public.

728
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:29,923
Now what seems to me to be happening 
instead at the moment is as Kathleen 

729
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,690
Wynne flames out,
not nearly fast enough in my opinion.

730
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:36,524
Yeah.

731
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,733
The attitude among conservatives that 
the provincial party seems to be 

732
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,580
something,
well let's just go like go,

733
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:51,420
let's go cluster in a corner and not do 
anything too stupid because maybe she'll

734
00:42:51,421 --> 00:42:52,254
burn yourself out so badly that we'll 
just win the next election and we won't 

735
00:42:54,211 --> 00:42:55,100
have to,
you know,

736
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:58,500
do anything that will put us at risk.
And I'm not being cynical about that.

737
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:01,470
I can understand the utility of that 
policy.

738
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:02,304
Although I think it's a bad policy and I
think it's a bad policy because there 

739
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:06,474
are some things that seriously need to 
be said about Kathleen Wynne and her 

740
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:09,804
government.
And I could tell you one noble aim for 

741
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:12,924
the provincial conservatives for the 
next election would be to decimate the 

742
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:19,740
provincial liberals.
Not One should be left.

743
00:43:19,741 --> 00:43:21,450
What's,
what's your popularity at right now?

744
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,900
Under 10% if she had a shred of 
integrity,

745
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,310
she would already resigned.

746
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,640
So anyways,
there is a goal for the conservatives,

747
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,563
no liberal sitting after the 2018 
election that would send a message to 

748
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:35,004
the social justice warrior types.
It would also send a message to the 

749
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:41,790
centrists who should actually be 
occupying the positions of power and the

750
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:45,360
Liberal Party that if you allow yourself
to be taken over by a radical fringe,

751
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,700
you're going to get decimated at the 
Poles.

752
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,430
So you know that might be an exciting 
message to sell.

753
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:53,130
Young people get out there and knock on 
some doors.

754
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,780
See if you can take the social justice 
warriors out at the top before,

755
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,420
before they do more damage than they've 
already done.

756
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,433
She's got another year to do plenty of 
damage and you can be sure that she's 

757
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:06,000
going to do plenty more damage in that 
year.

758
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,111
So,
okay,

759
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,120
what else?
Here's some things you might think about

760
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:13,830
if you're a conservative,
these things have become,

761
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:17,730
what would you say?
People are afraid to say them.

762
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,593
Here's the first one.
The fundamental assumptions of Western 

763
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:25,080
civilization are valid.
How about that?

764
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,680
You know,
it's not

765
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,150
you,
it's an accident.

766
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,980
Oh,
here's how you find out.

767
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:34,814
Okay,
which countries do people want to move 

768
00:44:36,381 --> 00:44:37,760
away from?
Hey,

769
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,713
not ours.
Which countries do people wanting to 

770
00:44:40,941 --> 00:44:43,760
move two hours?
Guess what?

771
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:44,743
They work better.
And it's not because we went around the 

772
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:48,890
world stealing everything we could get 
her hands on.

773
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,560
It's because we got certain fundamental 
assumptions.

774
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:53,480
Right.
Thank God for that.

775
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,200
After thousands and thousands of years 
of trying and because of that,

776
00:44:57,201 --> 00:45:01,520
we've managed to establish a set of 
civilizations that are shining lights in

777
00:45:01,521 --> 00:45:02,660
the world.
You know?

778
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:03,494
No,
you can be pretty damn filthy and still 

779
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,800
be a shining light in this world,
right?

780
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:10,310
Because if you look around the world at 
the state of governance in most places,

781
00:45:10,311 --> 00:45:15,311
it's like the most pathological corrupt 
and vicious thugs rule.

782
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,453
And to stand out as an illuminated light
against that background is it so 

783
00:45:19,041 --> 00:45:20,630
difficult?
But nonetheless,

784
00:45:20,631 --> 00:45:21,464
you know,
we're as good as its got and unless we 

785
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:24,824
can come up with something better,
we should be very careful about messing 

786
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:27,710
around with that.

787
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,543
So why don't we start with the 
assumption that we're doing something 

788
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:32,030
right.
One of the things we're doing right,

789
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,864
for example,
is that we actually value the 

790
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:35,710
individual,
right?

791
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,500
The individual has intrinsic value in 
western societies.

792
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,770
Do you know how long it took people to 
formulate that as an idea?

793
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,620
And how unlikely that idea is that poor 
you,

794
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:49,790
you don't useless,
powerless you with all your damn fault.

795
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,660
You're actually worth something.
You're worth something to the point that

796
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:56,600
the law has to respect you.
God,

797
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,290
we don't want to abandon that for some 
halfway did collectivism,

798
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,124
which we're doing as rapidly as possible
because one of the things that 

799
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:04,263
characterizes the radical left types is 
they don't give a damn about you as an 

800
00:46:07,701 --> 00:46:08,534
individual or about individuals at all.
You're black or you're white or you're 

801
00:46:11,901 --> 00:46:14,940
Latino or you're transsexual,
you're homosexual,

802
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:17,210
whatever.
You're a group,

803
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,073
you're a member of a group.
And the only thing that matters is the 

804
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:20,930
group.
Well,

805
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:24,050
I can tell you if the only thing that 
matters is the group,

806
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:24,943
you bloody well don't matter very much.
And then you got to ask yourself just 

807
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:31,160
exactly what sort of people are trying 
to set things up.

808
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:34,970
So it is that the individual doesn't 
matter very much.

809
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:35,983
Well,
it's the sort of people to whom the 

810
00:46:37,191 --> 00:46:41,210
individual doesn't matter very much.
And I might suggest that you don't elect

811
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:42,044
them and that when they attempt to take 
power that you do everything you can to 

812
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:45,180
stop.

813
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:46,013
No.

814
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,080
Okay.
So that's assumption number one,

815
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,723
the assumption number two,
peaceful social being is preferable to 

816
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:02,691
isolation and to war in consequence at 
justly and rightly demand.

817
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:06,480
Some sacrifice of individual impulse.
An idiosyncrasy.

818
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,240
Okay,
so you want to live alone in the bush,

819
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,760
you're going to starve to death and 
beat.

820
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,650
And by black flies,
it's not a good solution,

821
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,693
okay?
So you have to cooperate with other 

822
00:47:15,991 --> 00:47:16,824
people.
And that means you can't get to be your 

823
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:19,074
whimsical self 100% of the time.
It means that most of you has to be 

824
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,690
sacrificed so that you can be 
approximately like everyone else.

825
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:29,250
Now,
that's a real sacrifice.

826
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:30,850
It's,
it's a sacrifice of,

827
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,973
of,
it might even be a sacrifice of some of 

828
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:36,340
the unique qualities that everyone needs
from you,

829
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,233
socialization costs.
But the advantage of it is while we get 

830
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,291
to exist,
look,

831
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,124
we can all sit together in this hall and
no one has their hands around each 

832
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,060
other's throats.

833
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,490
And we're talking about serious things.
Okay,

834
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,324
man,
that's worth something and what it's 

835
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:51,514
worth and parties.
You don't get to be whatever 

836
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:56,710
spectacularly colored creature you want 
to be all the time.

837
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:02,250
You have to do what you can to be normal
and predictable and it's not like normal

838
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:05,470
and predictable is the highest virtue 
because it's not.

839
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:06,663
And then being more than normal and 
being and being unique and creative and 

840
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,490
contributing in that way is 
extraordinarily important.

841
00:48:12,491 --> 00:48:17,380
But the fundamental point is is that 
social being requires the sacrifice of a

842
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,214
certain amount of individual 
idiosyncrasies and that's a 

843
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:23,230
fundamentally conservative claim.
It's like you should be,

844
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:24,093
you should do what everyone else does 
unless you have a really good reason to 

845
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:30,640
vary.
It's a good rule.

846
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,610
It's like you do what people have done 
throughout time.

847
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,430
You grow up,
you find a partner,

848
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,490
you establish a stable relationship,
you get a job,

849
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,720
you make yourself useful.

850
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:41,643
You have some children,
you do something productive and 

851
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,434
interesting with your spare time and you
try to act like a respectable human 

852
00:48:46,991 --> 00:48:48,850
being.
That's what you do.

853
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,520
That's a conservative ethos.
And if you're,

854
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:52,443
if you have something spectacular about 
you that needs to be revealed to the 

855
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:57,130
world,
then break some rules,

856
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:58,180
man,
go right ahead.

857
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,930
I'm dead serious about that.
But most of the time he had don't.

858
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,380
And even if you happen to be a special 
person and you might be,

859
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,513
90% of you still isn't special.
So most of the time you're still going 

860
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,790
to be following the rules and the rules 
aren't there to oh press.

861
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,833
They're there to keep us at,
they're there to keep us away from each 

862
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,254
other's throats because human beings are
very warlike and we're very competitive 

863
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:22,503
and we're very aggressive.
And if we are fortunate enough to have 

864
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:28,054
woven together a social fabric that 
basically renders us peaceful and 

865
00:49:31,541 --> 00:49:32,374
cooperative,
we should try disrupting that at our 

866
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,600
great peril.

867
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Because the general rule for human 
existence,

868
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:48,160
throat the centuries has been per moyle 
and war and we don't have that here.

869
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:52,060
And so thank God for that and it's worth
a bit of a sacrifice.

870
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:56,050
Next.
Equality,

871
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:57,700
equity,
equity,

872
00:49:57,701 --> 00:49:58,630
that's worse,
right?

873
00:49:58,631 --> 00:49:59,464
Equity means equality of outcome.
It means that every single organization 

874
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:04,504
has 50% women and 50% men.
It doesn't matter whether the men and 

875
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:09,790
women differ in their intrinsic 
preferences,

876
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:14,910
which by the way they do the scientific 
literature on that is completely clear.

877
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,933
It was established by the early nineties
it was established in the Scandinavian 

878
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:19,744
countries where they've done most to 
flatten out the socioeconomic 

879
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,003
differential saved between men and women
didn't get rid of the differences 

880
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,500
between men and women.
In fact,

881
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,513
they became exaggerated.
The biggest personality differences in 

882
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:33,290
the world between men and women are in 
Scandinavia.

883
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,153
Just as the biggest differences in 
interests between men and women are in 

884
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,064
Scandinavia.
Because when you get rid of the socio 

885
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:41,810
cultural differences between men and 
women,

886
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,390
the biological differences don't 
disappear.

887
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,060
They maximize.
How else could it be?

888
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,250
And as I said,
the literature on that is clear.

889
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:53,600
And the way that the postmodernist 
radicals react to that is by criticizing

890
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,660
the scientific method itself on their 
computers,

891
00:50:56,661 --> 00:50:57,494
which only work of course,
because of the scientific method 

892
00:50:59,211 --> 00:50:59,630
actually right?

893
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,630
Works.
So

894
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,610
you hear the Egalitarian Clarion call 
everywhere.

895
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:16,343
Everything should be equal.
Everything should be equally 

896
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:20,190
distributed.
We should strive for equity.

897
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,240
It's like wrong,
especially if you're a conservative,

898
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:25,343
wrong.
What we want are just hierarchies of 

899
00:51:29,341 --> 00:51:32,760
competence.
Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.

900
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,000
You know,
if your father has a brain tumor,

901
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,013
you probably want a hierarchy of 
competence for neurosurgeons so you can 

902
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:43,770
pick the one that's the best so that he 
might not die.

903
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,300
That's what a hierarchy of competence is
for.

904
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,140
For the postmodernist,
there's no hierarchy that isn't based on

905
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:49,974
power while because they think the world
runs on power and that's why they're 

906
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:53,934
willing to use power to get what they 
want because it's the only thing they 

907
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:59,490
believe in,
but a valid hierarchy of competence.

908
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,960
It's God.
We need those things,

909
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:03,090
man.
We need the best plumbers.

910
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,400
We need the best contractors.
We need the best.

911
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,690
We knew we need the best carpenters,
we need the best lecturers.

912
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:13,530
There has to be a hierarchy of quality 
now,

913
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,800
not only so that we know who the best 
are and to reward them properly,

914
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:19,590
but so that we can reward them so they 
keep being the best.

915
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,581
It's like,
you know,

916
00:52:20,581 --> 00:52:23,010
if,
if you have a great educator,

917
00:52:23,011 --> 00:52:26,550
if you have a great leader,
if you have a great thinker,

918
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,473
you want to reward them.
So they keep thinking and they keep 

919
00:52:29,251 --> 00:52:31,440
educating so they can tell you 
something.

920
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,140
It's not a reward for their intrinsic 
being.

921
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:38,400
It's a calculated move on your part to 
suck everything out of them.

922
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:39,234
That's valuable as fast as you can.
That's what a hierarchy of competence 

923
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,124
is.
Four.

924
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,280
And the idea is that hierarchies of 
competence don't exist is,

925
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,213
it's so cynical.
It's such a pathologically cynical idea 

926
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,870
and it's actually quite patently untrue.

927
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,960
Because here's an interesting tidbit 
from the psychological literature.

928
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,940
Let's say you want to determine what the
best predictors are for lifetime success

929
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,040
in a Western society.
Well,

930
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,950
what would you hope for?
How about intelligence?

931
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:09,290
There would be a good one.
Let's hope this smart people occupy more

932
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,460
positions of complexity,
right?

933
00:53:11,461 --> 00:53:15,360
Because they're smarter.
What do you want it any other way?

934
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,351
Okay.
And then so,

935
00:53:16,351 --> 00:53:17,184
and that's great.
The number one predictor of 

936
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:22,200
accomplishment in western societies is 
intelligence.

937
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,290
So that means the system works.
What's the number two predictor?

938
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,540
Conscientiousness?
Well,

939
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,180
what's that?
It's a trademark or for hard work.

940
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,380
So who co who gets ahead?
Smart people who work hard.

941
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:35,453
Now that doesn't account for every bit 
of the difference between people in 

942
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:42,210
terms of their hierarchical structure.
Because hierarchies aren't perfect.

943
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:43,044
They're corrupt.
People get to the top sometimes because 

944
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,530
there's psychopathic,
although believe me,

945
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:47,364
a hell of a lot less than you think 
because a psychopath has to keep moving 

946
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:51,384
from place to place because once he 
reveals himself as deceitful and 

947
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,760
untrustworthy,
he has to go find new suckers to fleece.

948
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,360
So the idea that you know,
there's no distinction between a CEO and

949
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,194
a psychopath.
It's like that's only made by someone 

950
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,490
who a knows nothing about psychopaths 
be,

951
00:54:05,491 --> 00:54:06,324
knows nothing about ceos.
And C has something fundamental against 

952
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:13,800
the entire capitalist structure because 
it's simply not true.

953
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,350
Corrupt,
sometimes greedy,

954
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:17,243
sometimes shortsighted,
sometimes running companies that are 

955
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,710
doing their best to auger themselves 
into the ground.

956
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:23,580
And so,
you know,

957
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:26,250
it's bad people running a dying 
organization.

958
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,590
But generally speaking,
it's not the case.

959
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:31,620
Our hierarchies of competence are 
reasonably functional.

960
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,170
And not only are they functional,
they're valuable.

961
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,170
We need to know who the competent people
are and we need to reward them.

962
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:39,750
And even more importantly,
we need to tell young people,

963
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:40,883
hey,
there's some hierarchies of competence 

964
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,970
out there,
like a thousand of them.

965
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,370
Go be a plumber man,
but be a good one.

966
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:48,510
You know,
being honest,

967
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:50,310
one B,
I had a plumber once,

968
00:54:50,311 --> 00:54:51,144
you know it was the night,
it was the night before we were putting 

969
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:54,960
drywall in our house.

970
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,350
We were redoing a house and he had put 
in all the plastic piping,

971
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:00,750
you know,
and I was going to test the joints,

972
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,613
the,
they're supposed to be glued together 

973
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:03,300
with his pipe glue,
right.

974
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,433
And I said,
I told him I had to test the joints and 

975
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:07,650
he said,
well you don't have to test my joints.

976
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:08,730
They never leak.
And I thought,

977
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:09,960
yeah,
that's okay.

978
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:10,913
How about if I test them?
So I went up on the third floor and 

979
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:16,200
filled the pipes with water,
capping them in the basement like you're

980
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:18,720
supposed to.
Like half an hour later I had two inches

981
00:55:18,721 --> 00:55:21,780
of water in the basement.
There were 30 leaking joints.

982
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,753
And that was the night before the 
drywallers were supposed to show up so 

983
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,960
well.
So he wasn't particularly competent.

984
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:30,150
That's the point of that story.
But even more so,

985
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,070
he had put a bunch of the plastic pipe 
outside where the drywall would be,

986
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:36,600
so it would have been sticking through 
the wall.

987
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,700
So I spent a frenetic night,
you know,

988
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:42,360
sewing three plastic pipe and re gluing 
joints so that my,

989
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,430
well,
so that the drywallers could come in.

990
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,710
What's the point?
If you're going to be a plumber,

991
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,544
man,
be a good plumber because otherwise all 

992
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:50,760
you do is go out there and cause 
trouble.

993
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,010
And we don't need people to cause more 
trouble.

994
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,590
We need people to solve problems,
you know?

995
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:57,510
And so you can be a tradesman and you 
can be,

996
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,220
can make a lot of money as a trades 
person.

997
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:02,130
It's a bloody reliable,
honorable,

998
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,810
uh,
forthright,

999
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,703
productive way of making a living.
And there is a hell of a lot of 

1000
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:07,674
difference between a working man who 
knows what he's doing and one who 

1001
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:14,160
doesn't,
both in terms of skill and ethics.

1002
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,590
Right.
And you work with someone who knows what

1003
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:17,940
they're doing,
it's a bloody pleasure.

1004
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,590
They tell you what they're gonna do.

1005
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,200
They tell you how much it will cost,
they go and do it.

1006
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:24,430
It works,
and you pay them perfect.

1007
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,473
Everyone's happy.
And that's what happens when you have 

1008
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,400
genuine hierarchies of competence and so
you to,

1009
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:32,050
you listen to these panderers of 
egalitarianism,

1010
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,120
gell egalitarianism,
inequity,

1011
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,163
and they fail to recognize completely 
that there are differences in ranked 

1012
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,210
between people.
It's not such a terrible thing,

1013
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:41,044
man.
Maybe you wouldn't be a great lawyer 

1014
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:44,650
like it's certainly possible.
Most people aren't.

1015
00:56:44,830 --> 00:56:47,230
But that doesn't mean there isn't 
something you could be great at.

1016
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:51,310
There's lots of hierarchies to attempt 
to climb and if he failed in one,

1017
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,950
go try in another.
But the point is,

1018
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:57,400
you're still trying to aim for the top 
and what the hell are you going to do if

1019
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:59,390
you don't try to aim for the top,
you know,

1020
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:02,470
flap about uselessly and whine about 
your life.

1021
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,470
It's not helpful.
It'll just make you miserable.

1022
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,980
You're not reliable to anyone.
You can't help out in a crisis.

1023
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,990
It's like,
so you tell young people,

1024
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:12,610
and this is another message for 
conservatives,

1025
00:57:12,611 --> 00:57:14,140
like,
I don't care why you're going to do,

1026
00:57:14,141 --> 00:57:16,930
but go out there and make something of 
yourself for God's sake.

1027
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:17,764
Be An honest person and work and get to 
the top of whatever it is that you want 

1028
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:23,500
to get to the top of,
you know,

1029
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:24,191
and,
and,

1030
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,024
and,
and stand up for yourself like a 

1031
00:57:26,861 --> 00:57:27,694
respectable human being and be a bit of 
a light on the world instead of a 

1032
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:32,200
blight.
You know,

1033
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,213
and you can tell young people that and 
they haven't been told that by anyone 

1034
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:36,664
now.
And so the young men are so hungry for 

1035
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:38,480
that,
that it's,

1036
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,070
it's painful to watch.
They're so relieved when funding was,

1037
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,930
someone finally comes up and says,
hey,

1038
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:45,120
you know,
you,

1039
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,160
you get your act together bit discipline
yourself.

1040
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:49,023
See if you can learn to tell the truth.
Concentrate on something for a year or 

1041
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:53,830
two.
You could be a bloody world beater.

1042
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,140
They think freely.
That's possible.

1043
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,100
Wow.
That would be,

1044
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,023
that would be interesting.
That might make life or life worth 

1045
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:01,390
living.
It's like,

1046
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:02,470
yeah,
it might.

1047
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:05,740
So why don't you go do it now?
It's what the damn universities,

1048
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:07,990
we're supposed to be teaching people and
they've forgotten that.

1049
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,690
I went to Harvard month ago,
month and a half.

1050
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,600
You used to teach there and I talked to 
a bunch of students,

1051
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:14,434
you know,
and I told them it's not easy to get 

1052
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:16,780
into Harvard.
You know,

1053
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,883
like you're a Valedictorian if you're at
Harvard and not only are you a 

1054
00:58:20,771 --> 00:58:24,070
Valedictorian,
you're way better than most people at at

1055
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:26,590
least two other things.
Or you don't get in.

1056
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,800
It's so like it's,
I don't know what the acceptance rate is

1057
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,770
like 5% and believe me,
not everybody applies.

1058
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:33,603
So it's a very selective school.
And so why am I saying now it's like 

1059
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:40,960
these are high quality kids.
So I told them what I just told you.

1060
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:45,070
It's like here you are at Harvard.
It's like get yourself educated man.

1061
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,720
Read some books,
learn to talk,

1062
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:49,060
learn to think,
make yourself into something,

1063
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,043
get the hell out there and make the 
world that put you here happy that you 

1064
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,170
were put there in that great 
institution.

1065
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,243
You know?
And they came up to me afterwards and 

1066
00:58:59,051 --> 00:58:59,950
said,
God,

1067
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:03,550
I wish someone would have told us that 
when we were in our first year.

1068
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:04,840
It's like,
Jesus,

1069
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,660
why didn't someone tell them math for 
God's sake?

1070
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:08,494
It's supposed to be the greatest 
university in the world is it's so 

1071
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:13,660
difficult to figure that out.
Well,

1072
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,553
it is.
If that is what you want to have happen 

1073
00:59:16,121 --> 00:59:16,954
in the university,
you want to make cringing Melk sops who 

1074
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:22,580
whine about being victims while they're 
going to ivy league institutions.

1075
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,653
Jesus

1076
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,813
pathetic.

1077
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,620
Here's an old idea from Carl Young.
I really liked this idea.

1078
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:38,670
It's a rough one,
man.

1079
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:39,713
It's like a psychotherapeutic scalpel.
Let's say someone's doing something to 

1080
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:43,344
you.
You don't understand it's producing 

1081
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:45,990
nothing but misery has an outcome.
It's like,

1082
00:59:45,991 --> 00:59:48,420
what the hell is your motivation?
They won't tell you.

1083
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:49,254
Maybe they don't know.
So Carl Jung's advice was look at the 

1084
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:56,040
outcome and in further motivation.
Okay,

1085
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:56,874
so you produce a generation of students 
privileged beyond belief in comparison 

1086
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,710
to the rest of like struggling humanity 
in all of history.

1087
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:05,693
You put them in Ivy League schools and 
they come out thinking that they're 

1088
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:10,260
members of an oppressed group and 
victims.

1089
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,041
It's like,
well,

1090
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,200
why would you,
why would anyone,

1091
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,390
why would that happen?
And the answer is,

1092
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,403
well,
that's what the people who taught them 

1093
01:00:16,891 --> 01:00:19,590
wanted to turn them into and then you 
might think,

1094
01:00:19,591 --> 01:00:20,424
well,
did they do that because they cared for 

1095
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:22,050
them?

1096
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:25,950
It seems bloody unlikely to me.
You take this great raw material,

1097
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:26,784
right?
I mean it's taken a lot of work to make 

1098
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:30,720
an institution like the University of 
Toronto are like Harvard.

1099
01:00:30,721 --> 01:00:34,560
We'd been working on that for thousands 
of years and you invite people in,

1100
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:35,394
you,
thank God we selected you so carefully 

1101
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:38,430
because we think you could be a world 
beater.

1102
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,040
And then what we do is we don't teach 
you how to think.

1103
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:43,890
We don't teach you how to speak.
We don't get you to read great books and

1104
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:47,250
we convince you that you're a victim and
that your culture is corrupt.

1105
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,240
It's like,
great.

1106
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,760
Well those people are no friends of 
those institutions.

1107
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:51,594
I can tell you that.
And they're even less friends of those 

1108
01:00:52,951 --> 01:00:55,530
students.
So hierarchies are cough,

1109
01:00:55,531 --> 01:01:00,240
competence are desirable and they should
be promoted.

1110
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:04,350
So none of this idiot,
egalitarian equity,

1111
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:05,820
it's not good for anyone.

1112
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:07,020
First of all,
it's impossible.

1113
01:01:07,021 --> 01:01:08,910
Second,
it would be murderous to impose,

1114
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:10,920
but third,
even if it succeeded,

1115
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:15,690
it would fail as fast as it succeeded.
That would be how fast it would fail.

1116
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:19,530
Why would you strive for anything if 
there was no opt to strive for?

1117
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:23,700
If everything's flat and equal,
well when you're starving or dying,

1118
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,650
then everyone's equal.
And believe me,

1119
01:01:25,651 --> 01:01:27,870
the egalitarian,
the eye,

1120
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:28,713
he galatarian totalitarians who 
dominated the 20th century knew 

1121
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:36,060
perfectly well how to make people equal 
and they made them equal in ghoulag work

1122
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:36,894
camps and in starvation.
And I'm sure we could attain that if we 

1123
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:42,180
wanted to.
So all right,

1124
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:46,620
next borders are reasonable.
How about that?

1125
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:55,500
Okay,

1126
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,910
the law is the border that stops someone
from stealing your

1127
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,450
laptop.
And if it's an apple laptop,

1128
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,284
while it's the sort of laptop that has 
social justice warrior would carry and 

1129
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:10,214
then the social justice warrior is going
to be very irritated if you happen to 

1130
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:15,980
purloin their laptop.
And then you might point out to them,

1131
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:16,814
you know,
it's a border that protects from having 

1132
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:21,780
that thing taken and they say,
well,

1133
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,490
the border should be open.
It's okay man.

1134
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:26,550
No problem that you hand over that 
laptop right now and everything else you

1135
01:02:26,551 --> 01:02:27,384
own too.
If you don't like borders and you can 

1136
01:02:28,531 --> 01:02:31,530
get rid of the damn walls in your house 
and you don't need doors on your bedroom

1137
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:32,364
either and we can keep an eye on you 
whenever we want and so much for 

1138
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:35,964
borders.
One of the things that really differs 

1139
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:38,184
between liberals and conservatives 
between the left and the right is the 

1140
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:43,560
right is in the right,
likes tight borders between things.

1141
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,750
It's part of being conscientious at 
every level,

1142
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:47,460
conceptually,
sexually,

1143
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:49,950
familiarly provincially,
nationally.

1144
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,180
The right says,
look,

1145
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:52,014
let's keep,
let's keep the borders between things 

1146
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,020
pretty distinct.
And the left says,

1147
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,123
yeah,
maybe not because some of those borders 

1148
01:02:57,961 --> 01:02:58,794
are in the wrong place and a little bit 
more free flow of information wouldn't 

1149
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:02,550
be a bad thing.
And the thing is,

1150
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:03,923
they're right,
but so are the Conservatives and that's 

1151
01:03:05,401 --> 01:03:06,780
why you have to talk.
It's like,

1152
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:07,950
well,
we've got some borders.

1153
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,503
That's a good thing.
Maybe some of them need to be moved 

1154
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,024
around a little bit.
And that's what the political dialogue 

1155
01:03:13,381 --> 01:03:14,214
is for.
But that doesn't mean that borders 

1156
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:16,734
themselves are a bad idea.
There are a great idea because without 

1157
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:20,754
borders,
everything mashes into the same 

1158
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:26,850
untenable state of undifferentiated 
chaos and you can't live in that.

1159
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,570
And so the people who are trying to tear
down the borders conceptually,

1160
01:03:30,571 --> 01:03:31,404
politically,
and practically what they want is the 

1161
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,200
chaos that that would bring.

1162
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:38,250
The either want that or they're too 
foolish to know that their pursuits will

1163
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:40,050
produce that.
So let's,

1164
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:40,973
let's,
let's be a little bit clear that if you 

1165
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:44,370
stand up and say,
yeah,

1166
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:45,870
borders,
they're okay,

1167
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:47,460
they've got their problems,
but they're okay.

1168
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,080
That doesn't make you,
uh,

1169
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,900
uh,
a bigot beyond redemption.

1170
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:52,853
It just makes you someone with some 
sense and it's actually okay to be 

1171
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:57,174
someone with some sense
limits on immigration are also 

1172
01:04:00,991 --> 01:04:01,651
reasonable.
Well,

1173
01:04:01,651 --> 01:04:05,010
we need to figure out what those limits 
are and that's what the bloody political

1174
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:05,844
dialogue is for.
But the fact that it should be limited 

1175
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:09,300
to some degree is also reasonable.
Otherwise,

1176
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:12,540
why not just open the borders and let 
everybody come in?

1177
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,950
Well,
the reason you don't do that,

1178
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:14,784
it's because a complex system cannot 
tolerate extensive transformation over 

1179
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:24,750
too short a period of time.
Now you want immigrants to come in,

1180
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:25,584
especially if they're the sorts of 
immigrants who are likely to contribute 

1181
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:31,440
properly to the success of your polity.

1182
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,360
And lots of immigrants do that.
I mean,

1183
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,400
I think the vast majority,
for example,

1184
01:04:35,401 --> 01:04:38,460
of entrepreneurs in the United States 
come from the Indian subcontinent.

1185
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:41,610
So great in Ho bring them over.
They're highly educated,

1186
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:42,444
they're extraordinarily productive.
They make lots of new businesses and 

1187
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:47,970
then they pump money like back,
like mad back in India.

1188
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,360
Good deal.
But that doesn't mean that we have,

1189
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,090
we have,
uh,

1190
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,600
our arms are open to everyone 
immigration policy because it's complete

1191
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:55,434
rubbish.
All that means is you're not thinking 

1192
01:04:56,671 --> 01:04:57,840
about it.
So when it,

1193
01:04:57,841 --> 01:04:59,820
here's a coded to that for 
conservatives,

1194
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,240
here's something I've been thinking 
about this a lot lately.

1195
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,613
It should not be assumed that citizens 
of societies that have not evolved 

1196
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:12,590
functional individual rights predicated 
Paulie.

1197
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,060
These will hold values in keeping with 
such polities.

1198
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:16,440
So we could say,
look,

1199
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,840
there are a lot of countries in the 
world that are not governed well,

1200
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,910
the vast majority of them,
right?

1201
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:25,863
And they'd be not governed well forever.
And to me that means that there's 

1202
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:30,754
something wrong with the values that are
held collectively by the people who've 

1203
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,490
established those polarities.
Well,

1204
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,503
you shouldn't be naive and assume that 
merely because you moved them to a new 

1205
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:41,194
country,
they're going to let their innate 

1206
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,720
democratic longings flourish.
It doesn't work that way.

1207
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,610
So if you stand up and say,
look,

1208
01:05:53,611 --> 01:05:55,890
you know,
let's be a little cautious.

1209
01:05:56,130 --> 01:06:00,780
Let's make sure that we don't transform 
our society so rapidly that we lose what

1210
01:06:00,781 --> 01:06:02,820
we have.
Let's be careful about that.

1211
01:06:02,970 --> 01:06:06,570
That doesn't mean that you're a morally 
reprehensible demon.

1212
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:11,670
It just means that you're conservative 
and it's a reasonable position to hold.

1213
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,370
So there's no sense in Nepal dicing to 
it for it.

1214
01:06:14,490 --> 01:06:15,323
Now,
that doesn't mean you get to like hide 

1215
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:20,220
your bigotry under a mask of moral 
virtue.

1216
01:06:20,221 --> 01:06:24,120
You know the discrimination issue is 
quite clear as far as I'm concerned.

1217
01:06:24,121 --> 01:06:24,954
So that's associated with bigotry.
If you have two people who are applying 

1218
01:06:28,831 --> 01:06:29,664
for a job,
you should pick the one that's most 

1219
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,124
qualified and not pay any attention to 
any of the other attributes of the 

1220
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,830
person that have nothing to do with the 
job.

1221
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:38,933
Okay.

1222
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:44,940
Right.
I think basically,

1223
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:49,941
I think we figured that out in about 
1965 now we're not doing it perfectly,

1224
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:50,934
you know,
but it's not that much later than 1965 

1225
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,610
and our society particularly in Canada 
is pretty damn open.

1226
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,623
You can come in here and if you work 
hard and if you're fortunate you don't 

1227
01:06:59,941 --> 01:07:02,700
get sick and God smiles on you so to 
speak,

1228
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:05,340
you can be successful.
There's still prejudice,

1229
01:07:05,341 --> 01:07:07,350
unreasonable prejudice and 
discrimination,

1230
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:08,184
but our society is not as the radical 
egalitarian equity promoters have it 

1231
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,120
structurally racist,
bigoted,

1232
01:07:15,121 --> 01:07:17,220
and misogynistic.
No,

1233
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:19,050
not only that.
Just so you know,

1234
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:19,993
there is a review.
There was a recent review published and 

1235
01:07:21,421 --> 01:07:22,254
I mean recent 2017 looking at that damn 
literature on unconscious bias and I 

1236
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:27,504
knew the literature to begin with,
there is no evidence that unconscious 

1237
01:07:30,091 --> 01:07:33,600
bias can be measured properly,
not reliably.

1238
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,523
There's also no evidence whatsoever that
if you do measure it and you can't very 

1239
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:42,531
well that it does any better job of 
predicting actual say bias and,

1240
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,220
and,
and uh,

1241
01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,980
prejudice.
Then just tests of attitude.

1242
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:47,993
So the notion that our culture is 
somehow structurally misogynistic and 

1243
01:07:52,321 --> 01:07:53,154
racist and the reason for that is 
because of the unconscious bias of the 

1244
01:07:56,401 --> 01:07:59,610
monsters who are running it is,
is,

1245
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,460
well maybe it's not wrong,
but I can tell you one thing about it.

1246
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:03,413
It is not a scientifically justifiable 
proposition and that's what it's being 

1247
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:07,614
passed off as.
And I placed that firmly at the feet of 

1248
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,673
the social psychologists with social 
psychology happens to be a fairly 

1249
01:08:13,411 --> 01:08:14,730
corrupt,
disciplined by the way.

1250
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,280
And the people who invented

1251
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:17,113
the implicit association test,
which measures unconscious bias because 

1252
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:20,924
they have not come out publicly to the 
degree that they should have been said 

1253
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,060
are test,
which was for experimental purposes,

1254
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:30,410
is being misused politically.
You know your damn judges now because of

1255
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:31,244
federal five feet,
half to undergo mandatory unconscious 

1256
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:35,630
bias retraining before they can sit on 
the bench.

1257
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,200
And so you don't think that's political 
reeducation is because you're not paying

1258
01:08:39,201 --> 01:08:42,980
attention and there's zero evidence that
it does what it's supposed to.

1259
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:44,570
And I would also recommend to all of 
you,

1260
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:45,733
if you happen to be in a workplace that 
introduces diversity training or 

1261
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:53,000
unconscious bias training as a mandatory
requirement,

1262
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,310
you tell them and knows it,
no uncertain terms,

1263
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,144
that you are not participating in a 
process that deems you bigoted and 

1264
01:08:59,361 --> 01:09:02,240
misogynistic without evidence of that 
being the case.

1265
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,253
And if you trot off to the training,
then you've just agreed that that's who 

1266
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:07,310
you are.
And believe me,

1267
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:08,144
once you've agreed to that man,
you'll be agreeing to take a bunch of 

1268
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:11,840
things you don't want to agree soon 
afterwards.

1269
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,320
So it's time just to put a stop to that.
Enough of that,

1270
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:19,820
none of that unconscious bias retreading
especially not the mandatory type.

1271
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:29,883
People should be paid so that they are 
able and willing to perform socially 

1272
01:09:32,531 --> 01:09:35,110
useful and desirable duties.
Okay,

1273
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,220
so the radical leftists,
they react to me this way.

1274
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,121
They say,
well,

1275
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:44,830
you hold a position of privilege and 
power and I think first you don't know a

1276
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,664
goddamn thing about me and you have no 
idea how I got to my position of 

1277
01:09:48,221 --> 01:09:50,310
privilege and power and it was no 
birthright.

1278
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,213
I can tell you that I was a small,
like thick glassed intellectual 

1279
01:09:57,020 --> 01:10:00,220
[inaudible].
What do you call that Athletic Child?

1280
01:10:00,221 --> 01:10:01,810
You'd always a year younger than my 
peers.

1281
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:05,320
I suffered plenty of,
what would you say?

1282
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:09,160
Trouble for my loud mouth and my 
intellect when I was growing up.

1283
01:10:09,161 --> 01:10:10,600
You know,
I had my struggles.

1284
01:10:10,601 --> 01:10:15,460
I'm not complaining about it.
The point is is that you can't attribute

1285
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,310
privileged to a class of people and no 
one,

1286
01:10:18,311 --> 01:10:19,144
you can't attribute power to people who 
happened to occupy a position of 

1287
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:22,960
competence and authority either.

1288
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:23,913
There's some possibility that they 
occupied that because they worked hard 

1289
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:29,500
and were fortunate.
Let's not forget about that and had some

1290
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:32,770
good social support and didn't have some
horrible disease,

1291
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:33,604
thank God.
But you can't just make the case that 

1292
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,553
the position is there as a reward.
It's not there as far as a reward at 

1293
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:42,304
all.
It's there as a consequence of the 

1294
01:10:43,751 --> 01:10:47,530
person offering something valuable to 
those who want to pay for it.

1295
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,110
And the reason you pay for them isn't to
reward them.

1296
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:52,270
It isn't so that you give them a pat on 
the back and say,

1297
01:10:52,271 --> 01:10:53,104
well,
you're a good person and you know you 

1298
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:56,260
deserve this position.
It's because you're saying to them,

1299
01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:00,130
produce.
We find what you're producing a value.

1300
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:01,263
And so we're going to give you what you 
need in order to be motivated to keep 

1301
01:11:03,371 --> 01:11:05,020
doing it.
But it's not because we like cue.

1302
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:07,240
It's not because we re we respect your 
rights.

1303
01:11:07,241 --> 01:11:08,830
It has nothing to do with equity.
It's,

1304
01:11:08,831 --> 01:11:09,664
we're trying to get every God damn thing
we can from you as fast as possible and 

1305
01:11:12,161 --> 01:11:15,360
we're going to pay you to do.
And so people deserve their damn pay.

1306
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,880
And the reason they deserve it isn't 
because it's a reward.

1307
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:18,983
It's because that's how you get 
productive people to do things that are 

1308
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:22,794
difficult and time consuming.
And that perhaps they wouldn't do on 

1309
01:11:25,231 --> 01:11:28,950
their own accord to continue doing them 
so you can benefit from it.

1310
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,620
So the whole notion that,
you know,

1311
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,590
we're awarding positions of privilege,
too,

1312
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:35,543
oppressive patriarchal types,
it's like we just have to get rid of 

1313
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:38,780
that.
Enough of that.

1314
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:40,050
That's,
that's nonsense.

1315
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,210
It's absolute nonsense.
And the other thing too is,

1316
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:44,820
you know,
it's only been 30 40 years,

1317
01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:47,850
50 years since women had reliable birth 
control.

1318
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:49,920
Right?
And we're able to enter the workforce on

1319
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:51,000
Mohs.
I'll tell you,

1320
01:11:51,001 --> 01:11:51,834
man,
we've produced a cultural revolution in 

1321
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:55,650
like 50 years.
Women are everywhere.

1322
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,740
It's like how bloody fast do you expect 
something like that to go?

1323
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,990
And what makes you think that pushing it
really hard,

1324
01:12:00,991 --> 01:12:02,760
he's going to make it go any better.
I mean,

1325
01:12:02,761 --> 01:12:03,594
as far as I can tell,
we manage that transition about as well 

1326
01:12:05,371 --> 01:12:08,340
as we possibly could have.
We're still sorting out the details,

1327
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,330
but the fact that you know this is 
coming very rapidly down the pipes.

1328
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,313
The fact that half of our corporate 
board members are women is not 

1329
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:20,640
indicative of the fact that we live in 
an unconsciously biased,

1330
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:22,920
misogynistic,
patriarchal society.

1331
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,450
Sorry,
wrong,

1332
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,420
not correct and so we shouldn't be 
allowing,

1333
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:28,254
and this is happening very,
very rapidly and you can be sure 

1334
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:30,924
Kathleen Wynne is going to be putting 
this in as policies rapidly as she 

1335
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:33,864
possibly can.

1336
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:34,823
These equity demands to ensure that 
there's proportional representation of 

1337
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,510
every gender,
every sex,

1338
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:40,344
every race,
every ethnicity at every level of every 

1339
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:43,680
organization.
It's like,

1340
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:44,573
really,
we're going to do that by governmental 

1341
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:46,770
Fiat.
It's like,

1342
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:49,650
that's not as society I want to live in.
I tell you and I can,

1343
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:54,770
I can I quite certain that if you lived 
in that society for any length of time,

1344
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:58,170
you'd learn very rapidly that it isn't a
society that you'd want to be part of.

1345
01:12:58,171 --> 01:12:59,004
Either
citizens have the inalienable right to 

1346
01:13:02,521 --> 01:13:05,070
benefit from the results of their own 
owners labor.

1347
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,990
That's a good one.
Yes,

1348
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:10,470
that's a conservative truism.
You know why,

1349
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,980
what isn't because you,
because you're good,

1350
01:13:13,981 --> 01:13:14,814
harder than you want them to have money.
It's because they'll work if you let 

1351
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:19,824
them benefit from the work and you want 
them to work because if they work then 

1352
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:23,190
they do things that you need.

1353
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,233
It's as simple as that.
It's self interest and it's the right 

1354
01:13:26,221 --> 01:13:28,560
kind of self interest.
So if you work hard,

1355
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:30,240
it's like great.
Have your money.

1356
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,450
You know,
and you hear people all the time talking

1357
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,780
about how corrupt our society is and how
the 1% you know,

1358
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:39,090
occupies this pinnacle position.
You know,

1359
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:42,000
the 1% turns over pretty damn fast just 
so you know it.

1360
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:46,920
So you have about a 10% chance of 
spending at least one year in the top 1%

1361
01:13:46,921 --> 01:13:49,140
chance during your life.
I think that's right.

1362
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:51,090
I think it's 10% it might be higher than
that,

1363
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:55,200
but it's fast.
It's the 1% is stable as a phenomenon,

1364
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,063
but it turns over very rapidly in terms 
of who occupies it and it's the same in 

1365
01:13:58,891 --> 01:13:59,724
every society.
The wealth is always distributed 

1366
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,110
inequitably.
It's a natural law.

1367
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,000
You can look it up.
It,

1368
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:05,983
it was discovered by a guy named Wilfred
Prieto back in the late 18 hundreds 

1369
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,280
goods tend to diminish to distribute 
inequitably.

1370
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,233
It can be a problem,
but it doesn't mean that there's 

1371
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:15,394
something fundamentally corrupt about 
the social structure that's driving it 

1372
01:14:17,891 --> 01:14:19,930
in that direction.
Like you,

1373
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:24,760
you don't want some filthy rich geniuses
lying around like maybe you do.

1374
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,950
Let me look at what he learned.
Musk is doing for God's sake.

1375
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:29,350
Maybe he should have 10 times as much 
money as he has.

1376
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:33,430
He's going to launch a rocket every five
days to Mars in the next 10 years,

1377
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,503
right?
He wants to wipe out fossil fuel cars 

1378
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:37,983
and he might do it.
He wants to revolutionize the 

1379
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,800
transportation system and he might do 
it.

1380
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,310
He wants to put us on the damn solar 
grid with his new batteries and he might

1381
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:46,120
do it.
It's like,

1382
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,280
oh no,
he has a couple of billion dollars.

1383
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:50,710
Well God only knows what he's going to 
produce with that.

1384
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:51,813
It's like,
so obviously there's going to be some 

1385
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:54,424
corrupt,
there's to be some corrupt rich 

1386
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:00,310
plutocrats who do nothing but smoke 
cigars and snort cocaine.

1387
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,990
They're not gonna live very long 
anyways.

1388
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:02,973
But there's lots of people out there who
have the money they have because they 

1389
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:08,050
would really like to do interesting and 
creative things with it.

1390
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:10,900
Not because they're interested in 
gathering more,

1391
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,913
you know,
paper money to stuff in their mattress 

1392
01:15:13,661 --> 01:15:16,840
and,
and to like to feel the smooth,

1393
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,890
the smooth delight of gold coins between
their fingers before they go to bed.

1394
01:15:20,891 --> 01:15:21,724
Like what kind of attitude is that 
towards people who've made their 

1395
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:25,780
fortune?
You know,

1396
01:15:25,781 --> 01:15:29,200
you think that about Steve Jobs,
you think that about Bill Gates.

1397
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,191
I mean,
good God,

1398
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:31,840
I don't know how those people may,
lot of money,

1399
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:34,390
but man,
thank God they were around,

1400
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,224
you know,
they've given us some tools that are 

1401
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:38,860
just absolutely unbelievable.
So,

1402
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,200
you know,
maybe we could leave the jealousy of the

1403
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:45,220
successful behind for a while and notice
now and then that some of the people who

1404
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:46,054
got to where they are actually deserve 
to get to where they are and we should 

1405
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:50,170
be thankful that they exist.

1406
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,153
That would be nice.
A little gratitude and that's a good 

1407
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:54,184
conservative value to,
it is more noble to teach young people 

1408
01:15:58,271 --> 01:16:00,700
about responsibilities then about 
rights.

1409
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,940
That's a good conservative message.
It's like you have his son,

1410
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,680
you know,
or you have a daughter and you say,

1411
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:09,514
bloody well grow up.
Stand on your own two feet and make 

1412
01:16:11,201 --> 01:16:14,560
something of yourself right so that I 
can be proud of you when you come over.

1413
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:16,690
And so that may be your useful in a 
crisis.

1414
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:17,823
It's like pick up your damn load and 
Mandy and shoulder it and do something 

1415
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:23,074
useful and,
and forget about your damn rights for 

1416
01:16:25,331 --> 01:16:26,164
awhile.
You can think about what it is that you 

1417
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:28,504
should be doing to benefit yourself and 
your family and society and you'll find 

1418
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:33,340
some purpose in your life because of 
that.

1419
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:34,473
And so well that's a counter position to
the perpetrators of the endless rights 

1420
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:40,090
buffet,
right?

1421
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,040
Well as long as we give you enough 
rights,

1422
01:16:42,041 --> 01:16:43,450
you're going to be what?
Free.

1423
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,950
You're going to be happy.
It's like,

1424
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:45,784
yeah,
sure you'll drown in a sea of chaos and 

1425
01:16:47,651 --> 01:16:49,420
that's what's happening to people now 
too.

1426
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,673
So and that's why young people are so 
hungry to have someone talk to them 

1427
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,260
about responsibilities.
Here's another one.

1428
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,290
Radical change should be viewed with 
suspicion,

1429
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:02,380
particularly in a time of radical 
change.

1430
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,770
Okay.
There's never been a time in the history

1431
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:09,260
of the world where things are changing 
as fast as they are now and not only are

1432
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,094
they changing fast,
the rate at which they're changing is 

1433
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:16,700
increasing.
Like we're moving fast forward at such a

1434
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:19,520
rate that it's unbelievable.
You can't even keep up.

1435
01:17:19,521 --> 01:17:20,354
I don't care what discipline you're in.
It's like it's not so bad to have some 

1436
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:26,660
people putting their feet in the ground 
are digging their heels in and say,

1437
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:29,090
look,
we got a lot to swallow already.

1438
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:29,923
We got a lot to chew on and Digest.
Let's not muck about with everything 

1439
01:17:32,811 --> 01:17:34,790
that's worked so far,
what has worked.

1440
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:40,690
It's not such a bad idea for people to 
have long term families,

1441
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:41,870
right?
We could say,

1442
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:44,480
let's try to support the family.
We can even say,

1443
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:46,670
let's try to support the traditional 
family.

1444
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,020
Why?
Well,

1445
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:51,440
maybe boys and girls need role models of
each sex.

1446
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:54,260
I know that's a terrible thing to say,
but it is possible.

1447
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:55,273
It's certainly the case too,
that intact two parent families have 

1448
01:17:58,971 --> 01:17:59,804
children that thrive more than broken 
families and broken families or a 

1449
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:05,120
catastrophe or for everyone.
Now you might say,

1450
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:05,954
well,
I shouldn't stay with someone that I 

1451
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:08,450
don't get along with,
and it's like,

1452
01:18:08,540 --> 01:18:09,021
yeah,
yeah,

1453
01:18:09,021 --> 01:18:09,854
fair enough.
Except that there's no one that you're 

1454
01:18:11,151 --> 01:18:11,984
ever going to find to stay with it.
You're going to get along with all of 

1455
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:16,430
the time,
especially in your shotty condition,

1456
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,150
and so you're lucky that anybody,
oh,

1457
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,110
you're lucky that anybody will put up 
with you for a week,

1458
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:22,460
much less your whole life.

1459
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:25,160
It's like the,
the point of marriage is to tough it out

1460
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,380
and you don't tough it out for your 
happiness.

1461
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,363
That's not what you're in there for.
Your tough it out so that you have 

1462
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:33,770
someone to tie the rope of your life 
together with them.

1463
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,633
You have a chance to tie the rope of 
your life together with the rope of 

1464
01:18:37,011 --> 01:18:37,844
someone else's life and to make it 
strong and to make a place the children 

1465
01:18:40,731 --> 01:18:41,564
can have some security and some 
encouragement and thereby contribute to 

1466
01:18:45,141 --> 01:18:49,160
the future and pay for the miracle of 
your birth and your own raising.

1467
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:52,640
That's why you get married.
And there's no reason that conservatives

1468
01:18:52,641 --> 01:18:54,020
can't stand up and say,
look,

1469
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,350
we're willing to tolerate alternative 
family arrangements.

1470
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,333
But when you start making the claim that
the traditional family unit is just 

1471
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,080
another construct and that it's not 
something fundamental to our polity,

1472
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,230
it's like that's,
you've taken your damn argument too far.

1473
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,960
First of all,
you have no evidence whatsoever for that

1474
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:14,090
claim and there's plenty of counter 
evidence.

1475
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,073
So you know,
one of the things the postmodernists 

1476
01:19:16,701 --> 01:19:18,020
basically say us,
you know,

1477
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:21,050
every time you stand up for something,
you're also standing against something.

1478
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:22,100
It's like,
yeah,

1479
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,680
that's true.
But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't

1480
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,950
stand up for things.
And I think if we,

1481
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,030
if we,
if there is something that conservatives

1482
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,310
could agree on that we could stand up 
for,

1483
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,640
it's the nuclear family now.
Exactly how that's gonna play out.

1484
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:37,220
I don't exactly know,
but it's nothing too,

1485
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,680
it's not anything to be ashamed of to 
say,

1486
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,693
well it kind of looks like that 
structures work quite well for the 

1487
01:19:42,741 --> 01:19:46,730
entire duration of mankind and so maybe 
we mess with it at our peril.

1488
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:55,650
Here's another one.
The government,

1489
01:19:55,710 --> 01:20:00,330
local and distant should leave people to
their own devices as much as possible.

1490
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,040
Why?
Well,

1491
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:02,933
part of it's just humility.
It's like I'd rather that there was a 

1492
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,720
million of you out there making own 
stupid mistakes so that maybe a thousand

1493
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:14,721
of you can get it right then for one of 
you to impose their view on everyone and

1494
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:19,020
risk getting it catastrophical he wrong 
for everyone at the same time.

1495
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:22,110
And that's really the alternative.
Like if you're a social scientist,

1496
01:20:22,111 --> 01:20:24,930
like I mean an actual scientist,
I don't mean a bloody idiot log.

1497
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,090
One of the things that you learned very 
rapidly.

1498
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:29,160
As you know,
you do a simple experiment.

1499
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:31,230
You think you're going to predict some 
element of human behavior,

1500
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:32,550
you,
so here's my hypothesis.

1501
01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:33,563
I'm going to put people in this 
experimental situation and this is what 

1502
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:38,130
they're going to do,
and then you run the experiment and they

1503
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:38,964
don't do that.

1504
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:39,983
They do something completely different.
You find out that even though what you 

1505
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,344
have them do is really simple,
you don't have a clue what they're up 

1506
01:20:46,051 --> 01:20:48,480
to,
and that's just a tiny little controlled

1507
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:51,810
experiment about one little tiny thing 
and you're wrong.

1508
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,823
It's like
one of the great advantages to 

1509
01:20:57,151 --> 01:21:00,690
conservative philosophy is that it's 
humble.

1510
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,033
It's humble from,
from the perspective of social 

1511
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:04,854
experimentation.
It's like it's not like everything's 

1512
01:21:06,841 --> 01:21:09,120
great and we should just continue going 
the way we're going.

1513
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,740
It's like,
well,

1514
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:11,574
everything isn't as broken as it might 
be and I'm kind of stupid and blind and 

1515
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:20,250
all I have is a bat and probably hitting
it isn't going to make it any better.

1516
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:24,840
All do is shatter it and so the 
conservative says it's working,

1517
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:28,680
be quiet,
sneak away.

1518
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,310
Maybe it will keep working and that's a 
perfectly reasonable perspective.

1519
01:21:32,311 --> 01:21:34,290
Now obviously sometimes things have to 
change,

1520
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:36,270
but the conservative can come up and 
say,

1521
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:40,980
don't be thinking that you have so much 
evidence that what you're doing is right

1522
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:43,590
or that it will have the outcome that 
you expect it.

1523
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,423
I'll tell you a quick story.
This was told to me by a woman named 

1524
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:46,824
Joan Mccord,
who was one of the world's first female 

1525
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,070
criminologist,
by the way,

1526
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,620
a phd from temple,
University of a genius level,

1527
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:56,160
genius level person.
Very tremendous integrity,

1528
01:21:56,190 --> 01:21:57,000
tough,
tough,

1529
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,833
tough person.
She did a study in a place called 

1530
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:03,300
Somerville in the United States in 
Massachusetts in the 1930s famous study,

1531
01:22:03,301 --> 01:22:04,134
and so here is the deal.
They'd identified a bunch of inner city 

1532
01:22:06,001 --> 01:22:07,900
kids in rough neighborhoods and felt,
you know,

1533
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:10,140
that they were more likely to be on a 
criminal track,

1534
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,370
criminal,
antisocial,

1535
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:13,290
undereducated alcohol,
you know,

1536
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:14,670
the whole,
the whole dismal,

1537
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:17,460
wretched,
underclass phenomena thing was going on.

1538
01:22:17,461 --> 01:22:18,300
And so they thought,
well,

1539
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:22,110
let's do an intervention.
Let's set up programs to help these kids

1540
01:22:22,111 --> 01:22:26,250
and see if we can see if we can change 
their developmental pathway.

1541
01:22:26,251 --> 01:22:27,084
So
they designed to find study man and had 

1542
01:22:31,631 --> 01:22:33,720
the kids,
I'll get the details wrong,

1543
01:22:33,721 --> 01:22:35,730
but I got the,
I got the story right.

1544
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,040
Um,
they had the kids,

1545
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:39,143
they made them more literate,
they educated the more they had their 

1546
01:22:40,921 --> 01:22:43,890
parents take training courses,
they did social skills training,

1547
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:48,630
like they did all sorts of things to try
to make the kids' lives turn out better.

1548
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:49,493
And to top it all off because the kids 
were stuck in the inner city and they 

1549
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,260
took them all out to summer camp for a 
couple of weeks a year.

1550
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,530
And so they could get away from the city
and you know,

1551
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,600
enjoy the countryside,
have a little bit of a vacation,

1552
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:02,760
a little taste of a higher quality life.
Yeah.

1553
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:03,833
So great.
Everyone's thrilled with the damn 

1554
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:05,733
program.
The kids are having a great time at 

1555
01:23:06,701 --> 01:23:07,534
camp.
The counselors are thrilled to 

1556
01:23:08,381 --> 01:23:10,420
psychologists.
They think they're doing a wonderful job

1557
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,550
with great.
It's working beautifully,

1558
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:16,690
except then they did the data analysis.
Guess what happened?

1559
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:19,480
The kids in the,
in their treatment group,

1560
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:20,620
there was a control group,
right?

1561
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,110
That didn't get all this special 
treatment randomly assigned.

1562
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:23,944
It was a very nice experiment.
The kids in the treatment group get 

1563
01:23:25,871 --> 01:23:29,840
worse on virtually everything that was 
measured worse.

1564
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:31,543
Why

1565
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:33,893
don't put anti social kids together in 
the same camp for two weeks during the 

1566
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,250
year,
right?

1567
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,113
Right.
Because what happens is that the bad 

1568
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:42,870
kids teach the slightly less bad kids to
be worse.

1569
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:43,973
It's a well documented phenomenon.
That's why what happens in prisons 

1570
01:23:47,401 --> 01:23:48,234
happens in prisons.
What we do with criminals is the worst 

1571
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:53,790
thing you could possibly do to criminals
if you don't want them to continue to be

1572
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:54,624
criminals,
except for the fact that you keep them 

1573
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:58,080
in there until they're old enough,
generally speaking,

1574
01:23:58,081 --> 01:24:00,210
so they're less likely to engage in 
criminal activity.

1575
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:01,223
But what was learned from the Somerville
study was don't be so sure your good 

1576
01:24:03,841 --> 01:24:04,674
intentions are going to produce the 
results that you intend because they 

1577
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:07,644
probably won't and they probably won't 
for reasons that you never even 

1578
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:11,370
imagined.
And the other one was

1579
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:13,673
don't group bad kids with good kids on 
the assumption that the good kids will 

1580
01:24:16,861 --> 01:24:20,100
make the bad kids better because that 
isn't what happens.

1581
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:21,083
What happens is the reverse.
If you put two or three bad kids with a 

1582
01:24:24,151 --> 01:24:26,580
bunch of good kids,
then the good kids get worse.

1583
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:27,443
The bad kids don't get better.
Very well documented social science 

1584
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:30,631
finding,
well,

1585
01:24:30,631 --> 01:24:31,464
the reason I'm telling you the 
Somerville story is because God who 

1586
01:24:33,481 --> 01:24:34,890
could argue with that study,
right?

1587
01:24:34,891 --> 01:24:38,100
It's like these kids were poor,
they were struggling.

1588
01:24:38,101 --> 01:24:40,050
It's like you want to,
you want to lift them up,

1589
01:24:40,051 --> 01:24:42,720
you want to make their life better.
You do this wonderful,

1590
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:43,613
expensive,
well motivated experiment and then you 

1591
01:24:46,351 --> 01:24:47,184
run the damn data analysis and you find 
out that there was one thing wrong with 

1592
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:50,214
your social intervention philosophy that
you didn't understand and you actually 

1593
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:54,270
made it worse.
Well,

1594
01:24:54,271 --> 01:24:55,910
that's a,
and so jo,

1595
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,753
Joan Mccord,
she spent much of the rest of her life 

1596
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,090
going around telling social scientists.

1597
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,180
When you run a social experiment,
politicians,

1598
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:05,430
the same thing.
When you run a social experiment,

1599
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:08,430
especially on a large number of people,
especially without their consent,

1600
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:09,683
then gather the data and do the followup
study because it's highly probable that 

1601
01:25:13,771 --> 01:25:16,230
you'll find that what you did didn't 
work.

1602
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:19,420
Or maybe it even worked backwards and 
you'll never know that unless you do the

1603
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:21,720
study.
And so what people took away from that,

1604
01:25:21,930 --> 01:25:22,763
the social intervention types took away 
from that was whatever you do with your 

1605
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:29,490
social intervention policy,
don't run the study.

1606
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,440
Right?
Right.

1607
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:33,300
That was the wrong lesson,
by the way.

1608
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:35,003
Okay.
And this is what I would close with for 

1609
01:25:36,241 --> 01:25:38,220
the Conservatives.
This is a nice one.

1610
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:39,270
I really like this.

1611
01:25:41,190 --> 01:25:42,023
We hear a lot about the sins of the west
and there are manifold because people 

1612
01:25:45,511 --> 01:25:47,340
are corrupt and our societies are 
corrupt.

1613
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:48,293
But you have to think about it in terms 
of relative corruption rather than 

1614
01:25:50,341 --> 01:25:51,600
absolute corruption.
It's like,

1615
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:52,800
well,
you know,

1616
01:25:54,180 --> 01:25:58,230
your family is not perfect,
but there are worse families compared to

1617
01:25:58,231 --> 01:26:00,510
the perfect family.
Your family isn't looking so good,

1618
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:03,000
but compared to other families,
maybe it's not looking so bad at,

1619
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,480
okay,
so how do we judge our political system?

1620
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:09,560
Well we don't judge it by the dreamlike 
ill informed,

1621
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:10,513
ideologically motivated pathological 
utopias of the radical left or the 

1622
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:15,344
radical right for that matter.
We saw what happened in the 20th 

1623
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:18,740
century.
When you do that,

1624
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,930
that is a very,
very bad idea.

1625
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:22,033
And you know there were tens of millions
of people that died in the 20th century 

1626
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:27,260
demonstrating just how bad an idea was 
that was.

1627
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:29,180
And you'd think we would have learned 
that,

1628
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:30,223
but we didn't.
What you do instead is you take a look 

1629
01:26:32,121 --> 01:26:33,770
at your country and you think,
okay,

1630
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,100
how is it doing compared to other 
countries,

1631
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:38,143
other actual real countries.
And maybe you look at a variety of 

1632
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,830
different indicators because that's what
you do.

1633
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,280
If you're careful and if it happens to 
be hovering up near the top,

1634
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,260
then you think,
well,

1635
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:52,310
it might be just the grace of God might 
be just good fortune,

1636
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:53,323
but it is possible that we've got 
something right and that we shouldn't 

1637
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,044
muck around with it too much and that we
should have some gratitude for it 

1638
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,243
instead of assuming that the proper 
comparison is whatever heaven that you 

1639
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:05,114
happen to be able to dream up,
that you would love to impose on other 

1640
01:27:07,851 --> 01:27:11,060
people without their cooperation and 
without their will,

1641
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:12,313
and that's what the bloody social 
utopians are selling us and they're 

1642
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:15,194
doing everything they can to implement 
and institute that as rapidly as 

1643
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:18,140
possible.

1644
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,260
It's like enough of that.
We've had enough of that like I,

1645
01:27:21,410 --> 01:27:22,243
the reason I got into this to begin with
is because I started studying 

1646
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:25,694
totalitarianism when I was about 13 but 
I really started to study it when I was 

1647
01:27:28,791 --> 01:27:29,624
about 22 and I spent like 15 20,000 
hours reading and writing about 

1648
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:36,920
totalitarianism three hours a day for 15
years.

1649
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:39,860
That was the first book I wrote.
It just about bloody well killed me.

1650
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,750
It's horrible stuff.
And you know,

1651
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:44,360
I was curious about what the hell had 
happened,

1652
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,313
not only not only in Nazi Germany,
but then installing this brush in Mao's 

1653
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:51,320
China and in the Cold War's like,
what the hell were we up to?

1654
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,720
Why were we doing all of that?
I was trying to figure it out.

1655
01:27:53,930 --> 01:27:57,230
It's not a pretty sight.
Well,

1656
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:00,710
a lot of that's driven by this insane 
Utopian vision.

1657
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:02,750
It's not a place we want to go.

1658
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:03,823
We want to accept the flaws in our 
system with some humility and some 

1659
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:08,600
desire to improve things.
But good God.

1660
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:09,434
You know,
the 20th century was a dreadful 

1661
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:12,314
bloodbath.
It was a horrific hundred years and we 

1662
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,164
should have learned,
we should have learned arrogant utopia 

1663
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,460
turns into hell.
That's what we should have learned.

1664
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,220
And yet we have people,
plenty arrogant,

1665
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,740
purveying utopia left and right and 
saying,

1666
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,960
hey look,
the utopia hasn't come yet.

1667
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,420
And the reason for that is you're a 
misogynistic bigot.

1668
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:33,613
And if you don't believe that,
and I can't measure it by asking you or 

1669
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:39,080
even know to any observable behavior on 
your part,

1670
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,063
then I'm going to infer it.
Or I'll give you an unconscious bias 

1671
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:44,510
test that doesn't even measure what it's
supposed to measure.

1672
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:48,020
So you're a damn misogynist and a bigot 
whether you know it or not,

1673
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:48,943
whether you want to be or not and 
whether or not the evidence suggests 

1674
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:53,510
that you are or not.
So no,

1675
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:57,740
we're not going to sell out our society 
to utopians of that sort.

1676
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:01,340
And so I would say to people who want to
be conservative.

1677
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,010
First

1678
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
of all,
you have every right to be conservative 

1679
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:06,150
and there's nothing wrong with you for 
being conservative.

1680
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,193
And second,
it's like it's time to get the hell 

1681
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:13,791
organized and push back and get that 5% 
of hyper educated,

1682
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:14,963
resentful utopian dreamers who would 
like to bring the whole God damn 

1683
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:22,410
civilization to its knees out of the 
systems of power.

1684
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:25,350
It's not the same country it was 10 
years ago.

1685
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,260
It's we need to wake up and we need to 
stop this from happening.

1686
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:31,800
I would say these are more practical 
circumstances.

1687
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,753
The Ontario Human Rights Commission,
that thing has to go the social justice 

1688
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:36,960
tribunals.
I made it

1689
01:29:37,350 --> 01:29:42,350
[inaudible]

1690
01:29:43,550 --> 01:29:45,770
that thing has to go,
that thing has to go,

1691
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:46,633
we need to pay a lot more attention to 
what the faculties of education or 

1692
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:50,234
teaching teachers because they are 
transforming the elementary school and 

1693
01:29:53,961 --> 01:29:54,794
the junior high school and high school 
systems into nothing but propaganda 

1694
01:29:57,741 --> 01:30:00,230
machines for radical postmodernists 
doctrine.

1695
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:01,243
And if you don't believe me,
you just go look it up on the web and 

1696
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:06,470
see what they're,
what they're attempting to impose.

1697
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:08,870
And so that's got to stop,
right or easy.

1698
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:11,090
The Ontario Institute for Studies of 
Education,

1699
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,073
that is not a good place.
They need to be held accountable for 

1700
01:30:14,721 --> 01:30:15,554
what they're doing.
They're supposed to be studying how to 

1701
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:21,380
educate children more effectively and 
faster and cheaper and better.

1702
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:23,780
And that isn't what they're doing.
They're producing.

1703
01:30:23,990 --> 01:30:24,823
People have the most radical and 
resentful sort to get a handle on the 

1704
01:30:29,751 --> 01:30:32,570
minds of children as young as they 
possibly can.

1705
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:34,340
And that's,
that's the doctrine.

1706
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:35,203
I'm not making this up.
It's actually quite intelligent if 

1707
01:30:37,191 --> 01:30:39,980
that's what it is that you're aiming for
and that's got to,

1708
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,170
that's got to come to a stop.
And we've,

1709
01:30:42,440 --> 01:30:44,630
I don't know if there's more that needs 
to be done done to,

1710
01:30:44,631 --> 01:30:48,680
they'll whole bloody human rights 
establishment has to be retooled because

1711
01:30:48,681 --> 01:30:50,930
it's working at counter purposes to 
itself.

1712
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:53,120
It was probably a mistake back in the 
when it,

1713
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:53,954
when was it?
It was probably a mistake to introduce 

1714
01:30:55,401 --> 01:30:57,350
the damn bill writes into Canada to 
begin with.

1715
01:30:57,351 --> 01:31:00,260
It was probably a legislative era that 
we're paying desperately for now.

1716
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:03,230
But anyways,
those are more specific things and those

1717
01:31:03,231 --> 01:31:04,064
are more opinions of mine so you can 
take them or leave them as far as I'm 

1718
01:31:07,191 --> 01:31:09,560
concerned.
But these 12 points that I made,

1719
01:31:09,561 --> 01:31:10,790
as far as I can tell,
you know,

1720
01:31:10,940 --> 01:31:14,840
those are reasons to be conservative and
they're not reasons to be ashamed of it.

1721
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:17,540
And if you're afraid of speaking your 
mind as a conservative,

1722
01:31:17,541 --> 01:31:20,480
well stumble a bit,
make a few mistakes,

1723
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:22,100
man,
you're going to make some mistakes.

1724
01:31:22,101 --> 01:31:23,000
You're probably,
you know,

1725
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:25,040
not as articulate as you might be in.
Believe me,

1726
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:25,874
there's lots of things you need to know.
But if you start saying what you think 

1727
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:29,234
carefully,
people will correct you and you'll get 

1728
01:31:30,621 --> 01:31:31,454
better at it.
And you better start doing it because 

1729
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,830
the situation that we're in,
I think it's worse than it looks.

1730
01:31:36,890 --> 01:31:40,580
That's how it looks to me.
So anyways,

1731
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:44,390
that's all I've got to say about that.
So thank you for the invitation.

1732
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:49,620
[inaudible] you gonna open

1733
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:58,450
up for questions and hopefully some 
answers as well.

1734
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,160
So if anybody has

1735
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,993
anything,
we only have one microphone so you'll 

1736
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:08,200
have to stand up.
I'd like you to speak loudly and clearly

1737
01:32:08,741 --> 01:32:09,574
so we can all hear and uh,
and also state your name and where 

1738
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:13,684
you're from,

1739
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:24,470
separation
of church and state

1740
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,840
churches
of Western society,

1741
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:36,590
religion and Christianity.

1742
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:42,700
Sure.
Yeah,

1743
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,290
sure.
Ask An easy question.

1744
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,543
So the question essentially was what my 
opinion was about the separation of 

1745
01:32:50,381 --> 01:32:53,800
church and state that the nature of the 
separation of church and state,

1746
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:58,801
given the hypothesis that our society is
grounded in a broader structure,

1747
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,900
moral structure,
let's say that has,

1748
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,180
uh,
something like God,

1749
01:33:03,340 --> 01:33:05,740
theologically predicated philosophical 
basis.

1750
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:09,310
It's something like that.
The first thing I would say is if you,

1751
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:10,323
if,
if that is a very hard question to 

1752
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:12,874
answer,
and I'm doing this series in Toronto 

1753
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:16,084
right now on on,
it's called the psychological 

1754
01:33:17,561 --> 01:33:21,340
significance of the biblical stories.
And it's an answer to that question,

1755
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,620
but it's long.
It's like 40 hours,

1756
01:33:23,621 --> 01:33:24,454
you know,
and it's like the maps of meaning 

1757
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:28,660
program that that Mr Hillier was 
referring to before.

1758
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:29,583
It's extraordinarily complicated and I 
mean I think the right approach to that 

1759
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,320
is to say something like that.

1760
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,393
Something like there are things that are
Caesar's and there are things that are 

1761
01:33:39,341 --> 01:33:41,530
God's and you should keep those things 
apart.

1762
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,770
That's worked in the West.
Now the problem without our answer is it

1763
01:33:44,771 --> 01:33:48,220
doesn't precisely describe the proper 
interrelationship between the two,

1764
01:33:48,430 --> 01:33:50,500
but I don't think that's actually a 
political issue.

1765
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,980
I think that the way that that's 
properly bridged is through the ethic of

1766
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:54,814
the individual is like your religious 
belief should be of the sword that 

1767
01:33:58,631 --> 01:34:00,580
guides you to be an honest,
decent,

1768
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:01,414
productive,
respectable person who's aiming at the 

1769
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:06,790
good.
And then if you do that,

1770
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,950
then the political issues,
we'll take care of themselves.

1771
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:09,813
Not magically,
but because we'll organize ourselves 

1772
01:34:12,281 --> 01:34:15,520
politically as that sort of people and 
do the right things.

1773
01:34:15,820 --> 01:34:16,653
And so I think the connection between 
the church and the state is through the 

1774
01:34:19,421 --> 01:34:21,010
individual.
That's how it should work.

1775
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:23,500
And I think that's why it's kind of 
worked in the West,

1776
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:24,334
you know,
getting that church state separation 

1777
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:26,860
thing right.
That's really difficult.

1778
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:27,903
It's not good when they collapsed into 
one another because you instantly get 

1779
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:34,780
the rise of totalitarian theocracy and 
we all know how much fun they are.

1780
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:36,130
So yeah,

1781
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,233
I'll just listen to understand what 
we're going to do just to make this 

1782
01:34:42,781 --> 01:34:44,430
work.
If you do have a question,

1783
01:34:44,431 --> 01:34:48,810
why don't you come up to the front all 
hand over the microphone to you and then

1784
01:34:48,811 --> 01:34:49,470
you can,
uh,

1785
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:52,110
everybody can hear the question clearly.
I,

1786
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:53,850
and then we'll pass the microphone back.

1787
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,193
Okay.

1788
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:03,460
I'm Brian Oil Oil Zalewski still people,
you're going to warn you.

1789
01:35:04,351 --> 01:35:06,360
I took a psychology 100 big deal.

1790
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,590
[inaudible]

1791
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:15,200
conceded my Eczema,
the crowd.

1792
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:22,083
And I have a black Somali Mosley 
director who's had a call with me and 

1793
01:35:27,071 --> 01:35:29,350
our ideals,
beliefs,

1794
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,700
policies,
et cetera.

1795
01:35:30,701 --> 01:35:31,534
And if I'd known,
I would've brought up here is my guest 

1796
01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:38,290
and he's a wonderful guy and many,
many solid talks together.

1797
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:41,140
And that's probably the one thing that's
missing here tonight.

1798
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:44,920
Yeah.
Well look,

1799
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:48,570
there's something else I'd like to 
suggest to conservatives now.

1800
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:49,800
You know,
um,

1801
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:51,273
I've interacted with a very diverse 
range of people partly because I'm a 

1802
01:35:53,891 --> 01:35:54,724
clinical psychologist and I've done a 
lot of different things with different 

1803
01:35:57,161 --> 01:35:58,420
people in my life.
And so,

1804
01:35:58,810 --> 01:35:59,643
um,
I can speak about this particular issue 

1805
01:36:03,281 --> 01:36:04,114
with a modicum of authority.
See in Canada what's happened is that 

1806
01:36:07,241 --> 01:36:09,850
we've left the minority immigrants to 
the liberals.

1807
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,223
How has a bad idea now,
the reason for that is because the 

1808
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:14,014
liberals have a more liberal immigration
policy and a lot of them are like 

1809
01:36:15,881 --> 01:36:16,900
really,
really,

1810
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:18,383
uh,
what would you say grateful to the 

1811
01:36:20,501 --> 01:36:21,334
Liberals often to trudeau personally.
I mean the older trudeau personally 

1812
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:27,060
because he opened the door and let them 
in and,

1813
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:27,933
and it's hard to shake that.
But here's something that's very cool 

1814
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,530
for conservatives to know.
You think you're conservative,

1815
01:36:32,531 --> 01:36:34,600
man,
you should go talk to immigrants.

1816
01:36:34,910 --> 01:36:38,020
There are so conservative they make you 
look like social justice warriors,

1817
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,480
right?
So there's a real conversation.

1818
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,153
There's a real conversation to be had 
with immigrants and minorities in 

1819
01:36:44,951 --> 01:36:46,280
Canada.
I spent it,

1820
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,213
sorry,
especially the immigrant minorities and 

1821
01:36:48,101 --> 01:36:50,020
that is,
look,

1822
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,433
we would have been a little bit more 
restrictive in the past about our 

1823
01:36:55,451 --> 01:37:00,040
immigration policies and I can 
understand why that might marcus out his

1824
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:00,874
enemies to you,
but one of the things you have to 

1825
01:37:02,621 --> 01:37:03,454
understand is that the bedrock values 
that I have are much closer to the 

1826
01:37:08,441 --> 01:37:12,400
bedrock values than you that you have.
Then the people that you're voting for.

1827
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:13,743
And you know the minority immigrants in 
Ontario in particular are starting to 

1828
01:37:16,991 --> 01:37:17,824
figure this out,
especially with regards to Kathleen 

1829
01:37:18,971 --> 01:37:19,804
winds education policies because they 
notice the tilt of those policies and 

1830
01:37:23,531 --> 01:37:25,000
they notice that they're not in keeping 
with,

1831
01:37:25,001 --> 01:37:25,834
they're often extremely conservative 
traditions and so I would say the right 

1832
01:37:29,681 --> 01:37:30,514
thing for conservatives to do is like 
start telling the minority immigrants 

1833
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:35,980
that you're actually their friends.

1834
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:37,023
Now that means to establish an 
intelligent immigration policy and that 

1835
01:37:41,491 --> 01:37:44,590
that's a very difficult thing to do and 
to begin a real dialogue about that with

1836
01:37:44,591 --> 01:37:47,170
immigrant communities,
you know who are often,

1837
01:37:47,171 --> 01:37:48,004
by the way,
very interested in protecting what they 

1838
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:53,860
found here and not having it disrupted 
in any particularly terrible way.

1839
01:37:53,861 --> 01:37:56,310
I mean there's,
there's you rackles everywhere,

1840
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:58,530
but most of the immigrants who come 
here,

1841
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:02,040
if they're pretty damn happy to be here,
so the conservatives should be out there

1842
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:05,430
extending a real hand.
Especially I would say especially to the

1843
01:38:05,431 --> 01:38:08,250
moderate Muslims.
It's a big mistake not to do that.

1844
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:09,084
There's lots of moderate Muslims.
There are people who they're not in 

1845
01:38:11,101 --> 01:38:15,390
chanted by the theocratic totalitarians 
and they're looking for a way to develop

1846
01:38:15,391 --> 01:38:18,330
a bridge between Islam and the West.
That's no easy thing.

1847
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:19,283
I'm not even sure it can be done,
but there are people of goodwill in our 

1848
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:22,704
country who would like to have that 
happened in the conservatives could be 

1849
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:30,000
talking to them and extending a hand.
It's going to help on the,

1850
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,350
on the what?
On the,

1851
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,590
on the voting front as well.
There's no loss in it,

1852
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,990
there's absolutely no loss.
And all you have to do is knock and say,

1853
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:39,360
Hey,
those people that you're supporting,

1854
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:43,080
they don't share any of your values.
Have you noticed that they'll wake up,

1855
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,580
they'll see it,
and then they'll say,

1856
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:45,061
well,
you know,

1857
01:38:45,061 --> 01:38:49,650
maybe we have more in common with the 
traditional conservatives in Canada than

1858
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:50,484
we thought.
It wouldn't be a difficult message to 

1859
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:53,310
get to get out there.
So,

1860
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:54,473
yeah.

1861
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:57,113
Oh,
I'm just going to follow up on that 

1862
01:38:58,331 --> 01:38:59,164
comment from Brian for d for a moment.
And I think it's important to recognize 

1863
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:05,103
the,
the historical change in shift that has 

1864
01:39:08,051 --> 01:39:12,700
happened with immigration in this 
country over a long,

1865
01:39:12,701 --> 01:39:14,530
long period of time.
You know,

1866
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:19,710
this country was built and developed on 
immigrants to rural areas.

1867
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:22,270
That's,
that's our history.

1868
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:25,180
You know,
that's where all our settlement programs

1869
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:30,310
were to bring new immigrants to whirl 
areas.

1870
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:34,360
That's fundamentally shifted in the last
number of decades.

1871
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:39,750
New Immigration to this country is to 
our significant urban centers.

1872
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,760
That's where it's where it's happening.
So I just,

1873
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:46,990
you know,
uh,

1874
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:52,250
so walking through Carlton Place is 
going to be a very different

1875
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:59,710
image than walking through Toronto or 
Ottawa.

1876
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:01,390
Um,
so that's,

1877
01:40:01,391 --> 01:40:02,290
uh,
I'm,

1878
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:05,770
I'm very pleased to see the number of 
people that we have out here,

1879
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:09,460
the diversity of age and the diversity 
of people.

1880
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:10,563
But um,
but we just don't have a lot of 

1881
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:16,810
immigrants in rural Ontario.
So,

1882
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:18,280
um,
anyway,

1883
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:37,760
policies like the actual concrete issues
that people may or may not differ on how

1884
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:38,613
I want it to know what you thought.
Like the root causes strictly from a 

1885
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:42,303
psychological perspective that would 
derive a lot of these predominantly 

1886
01:40:45,641 --> 01:40:47,230
young,
like early to mid twenties,

1887
01:40:47,231 --> 01:40:48,064
what you bars are left people to really 
be so reasonable and antiestablishment 

1888
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:58,090
militarize and their thinking and 
essentially to have such a negative view

1889
01:40:58,091 --> 01:40:58,924
on the world and to see all these 
problems that other people would never 

1890
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:04,330
notice when they have not point almost 
terminal.

1891
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,573
Uh,
just strictly and in men and women's 

1892
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:08,320
specifically.
Um,

1893
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:10,240
strictly from like,
you know,

1894
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:11,133
what,
what would derive someone you think to 

1895
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:13,563
think that way?

1896
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:15,031
Well,
we,

1897
01:41:15,031 --> 01:41:15,864
we,
we kind of know some of the answers to 

1898
01:41:17,151 --> 01:41:17,984
that.
I don't want to make too grandiose a 

1899
01:41:20,631 --> 01:41:21,464
claim,
but I've done some research with my 

1900
01:41:22,671 --> 01:41:24,980
graduate students on political 
correctness per say,

1901
01:41:24,981 --> 01:41:25,814
because we'd been interesting interested
in the personality predictors of 

1902
01:41:28,371 --> 01:41:29,204
political belief.
It really does turn out that you vote 

1903
01:41:31,611 --> 01:41:33,410
your personality far more than you 
think.

1904
01:41:33,411 --> 01:41:34,244
Because like what you think is that you 
look at the world and there's a 

1905
01:41:36,261 --> 01:41:37,094
landscape of facts and you view the fact
subjectively and you derive your 

1906
01:41:39,411 --> 01:41:40,244
conclusions.
And the thing is doesn't really work 

1907
01:41:41,961 --> 01:41:44,030
that way because there's just too damn 
many facts,

1908
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:44,893
right?
And so you can't even really get an 

1909
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:49,100
unbiased sample of them.
What happens is that your,

1910
01:41:49,150 --> 01:41:49,983
your personality works as a filtering 
mechanism so that certain things stand 

1911
01:41:52,911 --> 01:41:53,744
out for you more than other things.
And so some things stand out more for 

1912
01:41:56,301 --> 01:41:57,590
the people on the radical left.

1913
01:41:57,590 --> 01:42:00,650
And some things stand out for people who
are liberal in some things stand out for

1914
01:42:00,651 --> 01:42:02,900
people who are conservative.
And then everyone says,

1915
01:42:02,901 --> 01:42:05,240
well look,
I'm looking at the facts and I'm drawing

1916
01:42:05,241 --> 01:42:06,230
this conclusion.
It's like,

1917
01:42:06,231 --> 01:42:07,064
yeah,
but what you don't understand is you're 

1918
01:42:08,241 --> 01:42:10,640
not looking at the same set of facts and
you can't even,

1919
01:42:10,641 --> 01:42:11,474
and that's why you have to actually 
engage in dialogue with other people 

1920
01:42:13,251 --> 01:42:15,920
because they'll expose you to their set 
of facts.

1921
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,053
And I'm not saying that facts don't 
exist or that they're relativistic or 

1922
01:42:19,341 --> 01:42:22,310
anything like that.
One of the things we found out about the

1923
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:23,144
politically correct types is that 
they're high and a trait called 

1924
01:42:25,101 --> 01:42:25,934
agreeableness.
Now you might think really that isn't 

1925
01:42:27,771 --> 01:42:29,300
what I would've guessed,
but,

1926
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:30,493
but agreeableness is a maternal trait 
and women are higher in agreeableness 

1927
01:42:34,371 --> 01:42:36,110
than Matt.
And that's cross cultural.

1928
01:42:36,111 --> 01:42:36,944
And that difference really seems to 
start manifesting itself primarily a 

1929
01:42:40,051 --> 01:42:40,490
puberty.

1930
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:41,323
And so agreeableness is likely the trait
that stops you from throwing your baby 

1931
01:42:44,131 --> 01:42:46,570
it out the window at three in the 
morning when it's speed,

1932
01:42:46,571 --> 01:42:49,460
when just had colac for three hours and 
you haven't had any sleep and you're not

1933
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:51,290
in very good shape and you just got laid
off.

1934
01:42:51,590 --> 01:42:54,320
It's like it's a very,
very tight bonding mechanism.

1935
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:55,453
And so what happens,
it's primarily driven by what you might 

1936
01:42:57,441 --> 01:42:59,480
describe as compassion.
Now,

1937
01:42:59,660 --> 01:43:03,710
compassion is great for dealing with 
infants and maybe it's great for dealing

1938
01:43:03,711 --> 01:43:06,320
with hurt people and really elderly 
people.

1939
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:07,213
You know,
it's good for taking care of people who 

1940
01:43:08,541 --> 01:43:09,374
can't take care of themselves,
but it's not a great doctrine to be 

1941
01:43:12,441 --> 01:43:13,274
building a political system on.
And so one of the things that happens 

1942
01:43:15,831 --> 01:43:18,450
with the more politically correct types 
by temperament is that they're,

1943
01:43:18,570 --> 01:43:19,403
they,
they suffer from an excess of impulsive 

1944
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:22,334
compassion.

1945
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:25,550
And they assume that if there's 
inequitable distribution of anything,

1946
01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:26,563
that the people who are at the bottom 
are all victims who should be treated 

1947
01:43:29,601 --> 01:43:30,434
like infants.
And that everyone at the top is a 

1948
01:43:31,821 --> 01:43:33,410
vicious snake,
like Predator.

1949
01:43:33,710 --> 01:43:34,390
And,
and,

1950
01:43:34,390 --> 01:43:39,390
and that's hard wired in some sense now 
it's a very popular story.

1951
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,350
Yeah,
of course.

1952
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:43,931
Of course.
It's an,

1953
01:43:43,931 --> 01:43:46,580
and it's an easy story to sell and 
there's some truth in it,

1954
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:49,100
but some truth isn't the same as all of 
the truth.

1955
01:43:49,460 --> 01:43:53,360
And so what you see at least in is 
undifferentiated empathy.

1956
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:55,400
And that is not,
that's not a virtue.

1957
01:43:55,401 --> 01:43:57,260
It's not a virtue.
You have to think.

1958
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,940
You can't just feel,
you have to think,

1959
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:01,040
you know,
even when you're taking care of kids,

1960
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:04,730
part of what you're doing is being 
compassionate.

1961
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:07,610
But if you're too compassionate towards 
your kids,

1962
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:08,870
then you do everything for them.

1963
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,850
And if you do everything,
everything for them,

1964
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:11,773
then they grow up useless and they never
leave and they hate you and they hate 

1965
01:44:15,201 --> 01:44:17,360
everything else too.
It's a bad idea.

1966
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:18,373
And so you use compassion judiciously.
You know there's a rule if you're 

1967
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:24,590
working in a place like a nursing home 
and the rule is to harsh rule,

1968
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:25,843
do not do anything for the people that 
you're taking care of that they can do 

1969
01:44:27,891 --> 01:44:28,724
for themselves.
And so if they have to struggle to feed 

1970
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:31,814
themselves,
you don't buddy while intervene in feed 

1971
01:44:33,331 --> 01:44:34,164
them,
you let them maintain their damn 

1972
01:44:35,571 --> 01:44:38,780
independence and you have to be a hard 
hearted bastard to do that.

1973
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,670
You know,
to watch someone's struggle like that.

1974
01:44:40,671 --> 01:44:41,504
But you're furthering their long,
medium to longterm independence and 

1975
01:44:44,121 --> 01:44:44,954
development.
And you do the same thing with your 

1976
01:44:45,681 --> 01:44:46,514
children.
Treating your children like they're 

1977
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,510
endless.
Permanent victims is a very bad idea.

1978
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:53,660
And I think that's part of what,
that's part of what's also being taught.

1979
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:54,494
We also know that the kids who are more 
likely to be rabidly politically 

1980
01:44:58,041 --> 01:44:58,874
correct,
one of the reasons that they're more 

1981
01:44:59,631 --> 01:45:02,300
likely to be that way is because they 
were taught to be that way.

1982
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:06,590
We found that even exposure to a single 
lecture,

1983
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:11,150
a single lecture that was associated 
with the political correct,

1984
01:45:11,151 --> 01:45:14,690
dogmatic structure was enough to tilt 
people in that direction.

1985
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:19,160
So there's a temperamental proclivity 
and then there's failure of education to

1986
01:45:19,161 --> 01:45:19,994
address that.
And then there's the exacerbation and 

1987
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:22,784
exaggeration by the,
by the people who are trying to produce 

1988
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:28,400
like activists by proxy.
You know,

1989
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:29,234
one of the most appalling things I saw,
for example at mcmaster when I went to 

1990
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:33,280
mcmaster and got,
you know,

1991
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:38,090
yelled down by profanity shouting people
who had the bloody gall to hide behind a

1992
01:45:38,091 --> 01:45:41,000
banner that had a hammer and sickle on 
it for God's sake.

1993
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,133
You know,
if the Nazis would have been out there 

1994
01:45:43,221 --> 01:45:45,110
with their swastika,
there would've been held to pay.

1995
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:46,880
But because it was the hammer and 
sickle,

1996
01:45:46,881 --> 01:45:48,050
it's like,
it's okay.

1997
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:50,360
There's nothing wrong with being a 
communist.

1998
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:51,194
It's like,
sorry about the 200 million dead people 

1999
01:45:53,361 --> 01:45:54,950
folks.
So they're out there,

2000
01:45:54,951 --> 01:45:56,300
you know,
hiding behind this,

2001
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,140
behind this banner.
Um,

2002
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,863
none of the,
none of the people who are teaching 

2003
01:46:01,071 --> 01:46:01,701
them,
we're out there.

2004
01:46:01,701 --> 01:46:03,920
They,
they bailed out of the damn discussion,

2005
01:46:03,921 --> 01:46:04,754
right?
Cause there were four people who were 

2006
01:46:05,121 --> 01:46:07,250
supposed to talk with me there.
They all vanished.

2007
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:10,580
They leave these student proxies to go 
out there and do their dirty work.

2008
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:11,563
It's really,
it's really contemptible so you can lay 

2009
01:46:14,031 --> 01:46:14,864
a fair bit of the blame at the feet of 
the people who are supposed to be 

2010
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:20,570
educating them but that are instead 
indoctrinating them.

2011
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:22,520
So that's what it looks like to me.

2012
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:32,373
Blank.
We often focus on the fact that they 

2013
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,023
tried to restrict our use of language,
but I also see that there's a focus on 

2014
01:46:42,941 --> 01:46:47,941
redefining the terms,
trying to redefine the key of language.

2015
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:53,130
And uh,
by way of example,

2016
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:56,130
I would say genocide,
the term which is,

2017
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:57,180
you know,
fell in love,

2018
01:46:57,181 --> 01:47:00,210
the historical significance.
It's very powerful.

2019
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:05,211
Parts of Alvin brought them
and there were other

2020
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:14,440
following.
Thank you very much.

2021
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:21,570
Restrict.
Sorry I wasn't ignoring you.

2022
01:47:21,571 --> 01:47:22,404
I had just made a whole lexicon and 
politically correct words today in the 

2023
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:28,080
car and I wanted to read it,
but unfortunately I can't find it.

2024
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:31,080
So yeah,
no one only do they redefined,

2025
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:32,490
but they also,
uh,

2026
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:33,683
produce new words neologisms constantly.
And one of the things I want to do is 

2027
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:39,630
I'm going to make a video.
I'm going to collect all these words.

2028
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:40,643
I'm going to do it properly.
I'm going to go through a very large 

2029
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:45,530
corpus of postmodern work.
I'm going to pull out the buzzwords,

2030
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,480
I'm going to rank order them in terms of
their frequency.

2031
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:52,530
And then I'm going to make a video for 
parents and for freshmen and it,

2032
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:53,364
with the checklist,
it says you go through the courses and 

2033
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:58,020
if there's one of these words,
you check them off this list.

2034
01:47:58,021 --> 01:47:59,340
And if there's more than,
you know,

2035
01:47:59,341 --> 01:48:00,174
if you,
if the course scores more than five out 

2036
01:48:02,131 --> 01:48:02,964
of whatever on this list,
and don't take that course unless you 

2037
01:48:05,551 --> 01:48:06,510
want to join the cult.

2038
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:09,030
And so yeah,
really,

2039
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:13,240
because I thought about this,
you know,

2040
01:48:13,241 --> 01:48:16,640
because one of the things I proposed,
it's a kind of a radical solution.

2041
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:19,100
I probably proposed it when I was a 
little more angry than I should've been.

2042
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:19,953
I thought one of the things the 
provincial government should do is cut 

2043
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:24,630
the funding to higher education by 25% 
and let,

2044
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:28,010
let the God damn intellectuals fight 
among themselves until they straightened

2045
01:48:28,011 --> 01:48:28,844
out the university hierarchies and 
decide which disciplines are valid in 

2046
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:33,480
which aren't.
Now there's a problem with that.

2047
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:34,350
Well,
there's a problem,

2048
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,390
a couple of problems with that is that 
first of all,

2049
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:38,450
it would wreak havoc with the 
universities and that's,

2050
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,290
that's not it.
That's not a good idea.

2051
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,543
The second is you got to watch it when 
you're trying to control the free 

2052
01:48:44,401 --> 01:48:47,040
exchange of academic ideas by top down 
Fiat,

2053
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:47,874
right?
Because it's another one of those 

2054
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:49,673
radical social experiments that might go
wrong and probably will cause it might 

2055
01:48:52,951 --> 01:48:55,860
be you that decides what shouldn't be 
taught in universities now,

2056
01:48:55,861 --> 01:48:58,350
but God only knows who it's going to be 
in three or four years.

2057
01:48:58,500 --> 01:48:59,333
Right?
So,

2058
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:00,203
so it's a problem.
But I think one of the things that 

2059
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:02,664
should be done is that people should be 
educated so that they can determine 

2060
01:49:05,881 --> 01:49:06,714
which of these courses are like that in 
which professors and then just stop 

2061
01:49:09,241 --> 01:49:11,610
attending the classes.
Now that's happening anyways,

2062
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:12,444
by the way,
cause the enrollment in the humanities 

2063
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:14,244
has plummeted since the 1960s and the 
reason and the humanities are at the 

2064
01:49:17,131 --> 01:49:19,050
core of the university,
make no mistake about it.

2065
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,030
If the humanities goes,
the universities are done,

2066
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:22,493
but so they're already destroying their 
own market viability even though they 

2067
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:29,640
keep bringing more and more people into 
the universities and colleges.

2068
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,560
But I think that needs to be 
accelerated.

2069
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:34,830
What has to happen is that the,
the,

2070
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:38,280
the postmodernist radical types need to 
be cut off at the source.

2071
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:41,820
Students need to stop going to their 
classes.

2072
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:45,900
And so that means that high school 
students and freshmen and the parents of

2073
01:49:45,901 --> 01:49:49,450
those people need to know what to look 
out for.

2074
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:50,411
And so,
yes,

2075
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:53,590
I'm very cognizant of their use of 
language.

2076
01:49:53,591 --> 01:49:56,680
It's also why I oppose bill [inaudible].
It's like,

2077
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:57,873
I'm not going to say words that other 
people demand that I say I'm not going 

2078
01:50:01,241 --> 01:50:02,074
to do that.
And the reason that I'm not going to do 

2079
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:06,400
that is because there isn't anything 
more important to me.

2080
01:50:06,730 --> 01:50:07,563
Then the,
the fact that I have then the fact that 

2081
01:50:12,341 --> 01:50:13,174
I know I haven't got that right.
There's nothing more important to me 

2082
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:22,320
than the responsibility I have to honor 
the words that I believe to be true.

2083
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:28,020
I'm not using someone else's words and 
bill see 16 by the way,

2084
01:50:28,541 --> 01:50:29,860
which your Senate.
So,

2085
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:30,933
so a delightfully passed today makes 
compelled speech part of the Canadian 

2086
01:50:35,740 --> 01:50:36,573
legal system.
So a threshold has been crossed and you 

2087
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:43,870
know,
it's to help the transgendered people.

2088
01:50:43,871 --> 01:50:45,040
It's like,
no,

2089
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:46,990
it's not.
That's not why it happened.

2090
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:48,123
So you,
you don't see the language game to your 

2091
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:53,044
political enemies.
You do not allow them to force you to 

2092
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:58,120
use their terminology.
As soon as they do that,

2093
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:00,640
you lose.
So,

2094
01:51:00,641 --> 01:51:02,950
and that was what bill [inaudible] 16 
was about for me.

2095
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,080
And there's something cool about that 
too.

2096
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:06,730
It was very surprising,
you know,

2097
01:51:06,731 --> 01:51:10,180
because
what should have,

2098
01:51:10,181 --> 01:51:11,014
what should have happened was that no 
one paid any damn attention to the 

2099
01:51:12,551 --> 01:51:14,410
videos I made at all.
That's what should have happened.

2100
01:51:14,411 --> 01:51:16,240
Or the next thing that should have 
happened is,

2101
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:17,093
you know,
there was 15 minute flurry about it and 

2102
01:51:18,211 --> 01:51:19,780
then everybody went back to their 
business.

2103
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:20,853
That didn't happen either.
What happened was an inordinate amount 

2104
01:51:23,411 --> 01:51:26,860
of attention congregated around this 
issue and I've been trying to figure out

2105
01:51:26,861 --> 01:51:29,200
why ever since it's like,
wow,

2106
01:51:29,201 --> 01:51:31,720
you know,
something's,

2107
01:51:32,140 --> 01:51:34,750
something's rotten in the state of 
Denmark.

2108
01:51:34,751 --> 01:51:36,370
There's something strange going on here.

2109
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:37,653
And it certainly wasn't because what I 
was talking about was about transgender 

2110
01:51:41,171 --> 01:51:45,760
issues because it important or 
unimportant as they may be at best,

2111
01:51:45,761 --> 01:51:46,930
they're a side issue,
right?

2112
01:51:47,150 --> 01:51:47,800
It's,
it's just,

2113
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:48,633
it is,
it isn't something that affects enough 

2114
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:52,630
people to be of any requisite 
seriousness.

2115
01:51:52,631 --> 01:51:54,610
So why all the attention?
Well,

2116
01:51:54,611 --> 01:51:56,770
it's because there's something real 
going on underneath it.

2117
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:59,620
And a lot of that is,
it's a fight over language.

2118
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:01,000
That's why Derrida,
you know,

2119
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:01,834
Jacques Derrida,
he criticized Western culture and he's 

2120
01:52:04,121 --> 01:52:07,720
the head trickster of the postmodernists
fell logo centric.

2121
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:08,583
That's our culture and the logos.
That speech and these people who are 

2122
01:52:11,321 --> 01:52:13,660
passing these bills,
they are no friends of free speech.

2123
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:14,494
There are no friends of free thought.
They want to put restrictions on it 

2124
01:52:16,541 --> 01:52:17,374
cause they already know what's right and
if you disagree it isn't that you 

2125
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:21,694
disagree,
it's that you're wrong and you should 

2126
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:23,950
shut the hell up.

2127
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:26,380
And if you don't want to,
we're going to figure out how to do it.

2128
01:52:26,860 --> 01:52:27,693
And so that's the sort of people who are
obtaining positions of power in our mid 

2129
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:34,270
level bureaucracies and higher.
And it's really not a good thing.

2130
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:36,940
That is not the sort of people that you 
want to be running things.

2131
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:38,043
And some of that's because we've 
abdicated our responsibility to run 

2132
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:43,000
things.
The competent people have bucketed their

2133
01:52:43,001 --> 01:52:45,500
responsibility to run things themselves.
You know,

2134
01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:48,980
they've abandoned politics and they 
don't serve on the school boards.

2135
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:51,350
They don't run their own churches and 
you know,

2136
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:52,184
they leave that to other people.
It's like snot a good idea because it's 

2137
01:52:54,261 --> 01:52:56,270
the wrong sort of people who step in to 
do that.

2138
01:52:57,670 --> 01:52:58,503
Yup.

2139
01:53:07,980 --> 01:53:11,890
Yeah.
Carlton Place,

2140
01:53:12,010 --> 01:53:16,150
it's almost considered a suburb,
the bottom and now you can see the steam

2141
01:53:16,151 --> 01:53:19,760
rising from Ottawa and commonplace over 
the issue of

2142
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:22,803
CRTC is comprised of an idea for some 
French Canadians and that doesn't sit 

2143
01:53:29,051 --> 01:53:32,590
well with the rest of the 76% of the 
population,

2144
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,610
all the others.
Um,

2145
01:53:35,650 --> 01:53:36,483
I wondered if you had some feedback on 
how this can be improved because 

2146
01:53:42,011 --> 01:53:45,490
bilingual is really,
in my opinion,

2147
01:53:45,491 --> 01:53:49,870
is a farce.
It was merely a means getting out

2148
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:54,853
population.
When you get 98% of one particular 

2149
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:03,080
federal government
that is totally French Canadian,

2150
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:08,400
then this is not an equitable situation.
Most of them there,

2151
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:13,750
let's discuss with somebody who was 
getting the hiring.

2152
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:17,590
He was French Canadian,
Ottawa.

2153
01:54:17,690 --> 01:54:20,110
They simply say,
you must fight for your rights,

2154
01:54:20,111 --> 01:54:20,944
but there's nothing to fight about all 
the people doing the hiring or a French 

2155
01:54:24,461 --> 01:54:26,000
Canadian.
And so,

2156
01:54:30,680 --> 01:54:32,780
okay,
well that's also a really hard question.

2157
01:54:32,890 --> 01:54:33,723
So

2158
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,043
yeah,

2159
01:54:36,330 --> 01:54:38,970
see a lot of,
in my way of thinking,

2160
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:43,740
a lot of the entrance of the idea of 
group writes into the Canadian.

2161
01:54:43,741 --> 01:54:44,574
Paula de was a consequence of our 
attempt to serve the country together 

2162
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:50,940
when the separatist movement was at its 
peak.

2163
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:55,920
And we did so the country together 
twice,

2164
01:54:55,921 --> 01:54:56,754
right?
I mean it damn near fell apart and that 

2165
01:54:58,471 --> 01:55:00,240
probably wouldn't have been a good 
thing.

2166
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,033
So what we paid a price for it and the 
price we paid was that we left the 

2167
01:55:04,891 --> 01:55:09,090
specter of group rights,
enter our common law policy essentially.

2168
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:11,030
And a lot of what's happening now is,
uh,

2169
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:16,160
is the price that we're paying for that,
having given that diagnosis,

2170
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:18,683
I don't have any cure to offer.
I don't know what can be done about 

2171
01:55:22,441 --> 01:55:23,274
that.
My suspicions are it's the kind of 

2172
01:55:25,171 --> 01:55:27,480
problem that has to be solved at a micro
level,

2173
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:28,620
you know?
But I,

2174
01:55:28,621 --> 01:55:31,020
I don't know enough about the specific 
issue to,

2175
01:55:31,650 --> 01:55:32,483
to offer anything other than that.
I understand why you would find that 

2176
01:55:35,911 --> 01:55:36,744
frustrating.
I've thought similar things about the 

2177
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:39,900
way the federal government is 
constituted.

2178
01:55:41,220 --> 01:55:42,053
On the other hand,
we've managed to keep the country and 

2179
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:45,510
there was a sacrifice to be made for 
that.

2180
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:50,760
So
apart from saying,

2181
01:55:50,850 --> 01:55:52,170
you know,
I get the problem,

2182
01:55:52,230 --> 01:55:56,150
I don't have anything to offer on that.
So Yup.

2183
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:01,013
So I'm actually only going to take one 
more question because I'm tired enough 

2184
01:56:03,421 --> 01:56:05,490
so that I'm probably going to say 
something stupid.

2185
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:07,830
And since this is taped,
well you know,

2186
01:56:07,831 --> 01:56:08,664
you go to watch that because you don't 
want to say any more stupid things than 

2187
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:12,670
necessary.
So

2188
01:56:15,020 --> 01:56:15,853
I a little uncomfortable talking to you 
because some of what you said really 

2189
01:56:20,090 --> 01:56:23,240
made me a little uncomfortable,
but I think that's what we have to do.

2190
01:56:23,241 --> 01:56:25,310
We have to be uncomfortable some of the 
time.

2191
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:26,803
Uh,
when you talked about don't send your 

2192
01:56:27,951 --> 01:56:30,380
kids to take humanities,
I kind of went,

2193
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:32,990
what are you talking about?
That's crazy.

2194
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:37,730
I think what you're saying is the way 
it's structured now,

2195
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:40,010
it's,
there's dangers.

2196
01:56:40,490 --> 01:56:41,323
So I guess my question is where do we go
if you get the critical thinking skills 

2197
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,083
that we need,

2198
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,140
how do we develop them?

2199
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:53,490
Uh,
you said the,

2200
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:57,120
you want high school students and 
parents to be aware of what the problems

2201
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:57,954
are.
Where are they going to get these 

2202
01:56:58,651 --> 01:56:59,484
critical thinking skills and develop a 
certain resilience to a changing world 

2203
01:57:04,291 --> 01:57:06,480
around them?
So where would you direct us to go?

2204
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:07,180
Yeah,

2205
01:57:07,180 --> 01:57:08,740
well the first thing I should say is 
like,

2206
01:57:08,741 --> 01:57:11,550
I'm a great admirer of the humanities 
psych and of the university.

2207
01:57:11,551 --> 01:57:13,630
So I mean the,
the humanities,

2208
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:16,360
you learn to be a citizen through the 
humanities.

2209
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:19,270
The humanities are at the core of 
western culture.

2210
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:21,100
If they go,
we're in trouble.

2211
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,940
So the problem is,
is that what's manifesting itself as the

2212
01:57:24,941 --> 01:57:27,640
humanities in the universities is no 
longer the humanities.

2213
01:57:27,641 --> 01:57:30,760
It's something almost virtually the 
opposite of that.

2214
01:57:31,090 --> 01:57:31,923
And so,
and so when I tell people not to go to 

2215
01:57:34,871 --> 01:57:37,840
humanities courses in the universities,
it's with a very heavy heart.

2216
01:57:37,841 --> 01:57:39,320
Believe me,
you know,

2217
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:41,830
now the question is,
where do you go instead?

2218
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:44,380
Well,
that's a good question.

2219
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:46,750
You can always read.
You know,

2220
01:57:46,751 --> 01:57:47,584
one of the things that's really cool 
about Amazon is all the great books are 

2221
01:57:49,541 --> 01:57:51,250
free.
They're literally free.

2222
01:57:51,251 --> 01:57:54,160
You can go download them on your kindle 
for nothing.

2223
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:55,203
The copyright has expired and people 
have been putting electronic versions 

2224
01:57:58,091 --> 01:57:58,924
online.
So the great books of the Western world 

2225
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,143
and even many of the great books of the 
20th century are now available 

2226
01:58:03,131 --> 01:58:05,050
completely for free.
Well,

2227
01:58:05,051 --> 01:58:05,884
so you can read them.
There's lots of information to be 

2228
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:11,620
garnered now on youtube and that's 
really going to explode over the next 10

2229
01:58:11,621 --> 01:58:12,580
years.
And I mean,

2230
01:58:12,581 --> 01:58:13,414
one of the things I want to work on 
probably over the next 10 years is to 

2231
01:58:15,731 --> 01:58:19,000
set up a humanities university online.
And what I'm starting to work,

2232
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,073
I already have some programs online,
they're called self authoring programs 

2233
01:58:23,591 --> 01:58:24,520
and they help people,
right?

2234
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:29,500
And partly we designed them to help 
people learn to write as well as to help

2235
01:58:29,501 --> 01:58:30,334
them write about themselves.
So the self authoring programs help 

2236
01:58:32,051 --> 01:58:34,960
people write an autobiography and 
analyze their personality,

2237
01:58:34,961 --> 01:58:37,840
faults and virtues and lay out a future 
for themselves.

2238
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:41,590
And when we've had students do that,
do the future program,

2239
01:58:41,591 --> 01:58:43,300
it's so cool.
What happened was that,

2240
01:58:43,870 --> 01:58:44,703
um,
there the probability that they would 

2241
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:51,220
stay in school went up by about 30% but 
something even cooler happened.

2242
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:53,950
It worked best for the worst performing 
students.

2243
01:58:54,730 --> 01:58:58,600
So we did a lot of it in Holland who at 
a business school called Erasmus.

2244
01:58:58,780 --> 01:58:59,471
Uh,
there's a,

2245
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:01,030
there's a school of management,
Rotterman,

2246
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:04,780
Rotterdam School of management at 
Erasmus University and we ran several,

2247
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:07,750
think it's about 10,000 people through 
the future authoring program now.

2248
01:59:08,110 --> 01:59:11,380
And what happened if you looked at the 
academic performance of the students,

2249
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:12,333
the Dutch women,
the native Dutch women were at the 

2250
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:18,340
pinnacle and then it was the Dutch men 
below them.

2251
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:19,233
Now the women were in a minority and 
they were probably a little more highly 

2252
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:22,031
selected,
right.

2253
01:59:22,031 --> 01:59:24,040
So maybe that accounted for the 
performance gap.

2254
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:26,500
And then underneath that there was 
female,

2255
01:59:26,501 --> 01:59:30,230
non Western ethnic minority immigrants 
and then below that were male,

2256
01:59:30,231 --> 01:59:32,230
non Western ethnic minority immigrants.

2257
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,460
And there was a massive gap between the 
Dutch women and the male,

2258
01:59:35,500 --> 01:59:36,333
non Western minority immigrants.
Like if performance gap of about 80% a 

2259
01:59:39,581 --> 01:59:44,581
massive gap within two years after 
writing the future authoring program.

2260
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:49,120
The male non-ethnic Western minority 
students pass the Dutch students.

2261
01:59:49,450 --> 01:59:50,283
Yeah.
And some of them didn't even remember 

2262
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:53,260
that they had done the future authoring 
exercise.

2263
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:56,100
And we replicated that at Mohawk 
College.

2264
01:59:56,110 --> 01:59:57,850
Just a while back.
Same thing.

2265
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:00,280
The young men who went to Mohawk 
College,

2266
02:00:00,281 --> 02:00:03,340
they did this exercise in the summer 
just before they went to college.

2267
02:00:03,770 --> 02:00:05,950
They only took about an hour to write 
out their future.

2268
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,320
It's not that long to think about your 
whole future.

2269
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:09,513
And what happened was that the young men
who had the worst grades in school who 

2270
02:00:13,901 --> 02:00:18,901
are in non career oriented trajectories 
had a retention improvement of about 40%

2271
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,300
so yeah,
so that was just like,

2272
02:00:22,510 --> 02:00:23,830
we're just thrilled about that.

2273
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:24,663
So,
so the reason I'm telling you all of 

2274
02:00:25,781 --> 02:00:26,614
this story,
apart from the fact that it's vaguely 

2275
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:29,270
interesting is that,
um,

2276
02:00:30,250 --> 02:00:34,090
we are experimenting with technologies 
to teach people how to write.

2277
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:35,403
Now normally the way you're taught how 
to write is by having someone edit your 

2278
02:00:37,481 --> 02:00:39,970
writing.
But that's prohibitively expensive.

2279
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,270
I don't think it,
it,

2280
02:00:41,271 --> 02:00:44,770
it can be transformed in something 
that's available on a mass basis.

2281
02:00:44,771 --> 02:00:45,604
And so what we're trying to do is to 
break down the process of writing into 

2282
02:00:48,641 --> 02:00:49,474
its requisite steps.
That's kind of what behavioral 

2283
02:00:50,741 --> 02:00:51,574
psychologists do.
We've done that already a bit with 

2284
02:00:52,841 --> 02:00:55,030
these,
with this essay writing format,

2285
02:00:55,510 --> 02:00:56,343
and then to,
to sort of teach people what the 

2286
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:58,834
mechanics of writing actually are,
and then maybe to try to figure out how 

2287
02:01:01,361 --> 02:01:02,194
to crowdsource editing so that many,
many people can participate in the 

2288
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:06,004
process.
But we'd like to set up an online 

2289
02:01:07,721 --> 02:01:09,850
humanities university over the next 10 
years.

2290
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:13,720
And since the universities have 
abandoned their intellectual property,

2291
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:16,540
there's no reason not to just move in 
and take it as far as I can tell.

2292
02:01:16,660 --> 02:01:18,460
So that's the plan.

2293
02:01:24,070 --> 02:01:24,870
Well,
thank you.

2294
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:25,850
Thank you very much for,

2295
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:29,830
thank you very much for coming out and 
listening to me.

2296
02:01:29,831 --> 02:01:30,610
And,
uh,

2297
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:31,443
you know,
it was a quite interesting in all of 

2298
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:34,751
that.
And so,

2299
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:38,470
uh,
I was a pleasure to have spoken for you.

2300
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,340
Hey,
my pleasure,

2301
02:01:39,341 --> 02:01:40,174
man.

2302
02:01:41,330 --> 02:01:46,330
[inaudible].
