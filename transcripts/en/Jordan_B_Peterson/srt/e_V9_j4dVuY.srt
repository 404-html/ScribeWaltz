1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,970
Okay.
Looks like everything is in order.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello everyone.
I'm here with,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,960
uh,
Dr. Jordan Peterson and um,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,100
a lot of you probably know of him and 
he's been making quite the bus.

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,270
Uh,
hi Jordan.

6
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:21,780
Thank you so much for,
for joining me on this chat.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm really excited to talk to get,
um,

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,880
to get to the topics at hand.
How are you doing today?

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,480
Good.
Yeah.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,300
Well that's good.
Um,

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,743
I know you told me that there were some 
very specific things that you'd like to 

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,280
kind of talk to,
uh,

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,920
talk with me about today because we 
don't have much time.

14
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:42,810
I just want to kind of jump right into 
it.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,970
So,
um,

16
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,493
you wanted to talk a bit about 
postmodernism and their view on 

17
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:55,820
categories.
Um,

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,240
did you want to just,

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,880
I'd be trying to,
obviously this discussion about pronouns

20
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:03,714
is attracting a tremendous amount of 
attention and it's attracted a 

21
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:07,674
tremendous amount of tension for complex
reasons that it's not an obvious wise 

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,753
boy.
Everyone would focus on it for such a 

23
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,240
long period of time.
It's been about 40 days now,

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,433
but 130 print articles.
And I would say maybe upwards of 3 

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
million people have been watching the 
goings on online.

26
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,693
Um,
and we haven't even counted the number 

27
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,180
of youtube videos and that sort of thing
that would be generated as a consequence

28
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,014
of it.
And the two demonstrations at the 

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,510
University of Toronto and the exchange 
of letters,

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,120
it's,
it's been absurdly,

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,013
absurdly controversial and that means 
that there's something going on that 

32
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,380
people really haven't put their finger 
on.

33
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:47,190
And I'd be thinking about it at multiple
levels of analysis.

34
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,024
And there's one very deep level of 
analysis that I don't think anyone has 

35
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:51,360
addressed.

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,570
And I would think about it as a,
as a cognitive level of analysis.

37
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:57,300
And it has to do with the nature of 
categorization itself.

38
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,063
So I remember a long while back,
I read a paper on why human beings have 

39
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,554
two hemispheres,
right hemisphere and the left 

40
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,710
hemisphere,
roughly speaking,

41
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,530
the left hemisphere.
And this is very roughly speaking,

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,800
the left slash linguistic hemisphere 
attempts to impose predictable structure

43
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:18,480
on the world.
Simplifying it.

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,750
It's not exactly an ideological 
simplification.

45
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:22,584
It's more like a practical 
simplification because the world is so 

46
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,720
complex that unless you chunk it into 
categories,

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,793
it overwhelms you.
And so you have to chunk it into 

48
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,464
categories.
And those categories aren't exactly 

49
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:38,421
descriptions of things or objects.
They're more like tools for operating in

50
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,834
the world.
And then the right hemisphere keeps 

51
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:42,804
track of anomalies and exceptions and 
tries to build those slowly into the 

52
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:50,310
category system so that it doesn't blow 
the category system.

53
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,270
And so there was an example of this that
that researcher named Goldberg offered.

54
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,104
He had trained a neural network to 
recognize images of fish and the same 

55
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,350
neural network to recognize images of 
birds.

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,633
But when he showed it a penguin,
then it blew the category structure so 

57
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,120
that all fish became birds and all birds
became fish.

58
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,033
Now the postmodernists like Derrida 
claimed that category structures were 

59
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:20,320
primarily tools of power and oppression,
which,

60
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,380
which to me is an absurd claim because 
that's not their primary use,

61
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,243
even though that may be one of their 
consequences and one of their own 

62
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,410
occasionally uses.
And he became very,

63
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,244
very concerned about who the category 
systems marginalized and what the 

64
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,380
consequence of that was for them.
And that got tangled in,

65
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,400
in a,
in a sense,

66
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:40,234
into the Marxist identity politics 
routine because the Marxist identity 

67
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,944
politics,
people picked up the idea of the 

68
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,884
excluded and marginalized and sort of 
transform them into the equivalent of 

69
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,710
Marx's oppressed working class and then 
started to agitate for them.

70
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,080
And the Democrats in the United States,
for example,

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,400
transformed their focus from working 
class,

72
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,680
uh,
uh,

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,450
concern say to identity politics 
concerns.

74
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,810
And there's been some notion that that 
was part of the resurgence of Marxism as

75
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,340
a,
as a new ideological doctrine.

76
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,530
Anyways,
it's a really fundamental problem.

77
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,590
The pro,
the pro categories exclude.

78
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,530
But then if you include the excluded in 
the category,

79
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
you blow the category structure.
Now this is partly why the right wing 

80
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,020
Christians,
for example,

81
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:31,990
were so opposed to the idea of 
homosexual marriage.

82
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,930
So what,
what happened?

83
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:39,130
What's happening very rapidly is that 
because of the binary category has been,

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,960
uh,
let's call,

85
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,700
let's say,
violated.

86
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
That's one way of thinking about it.
You get an explosion of chaotic 

87
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,794
identities.
And so it's gone from say two to the 

88
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,150
proposed,
I suppose three,

89
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:52,984
which,
which would have been what the 

90
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,124
formulators of the legislation,
I think we're hoping for to say 31 in 

91
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,440
New York and 70 online.

92
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,800
And then there's this additional 
explosion which is,

93
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,640
which has being promoted by people who,
who aren't really concerned so much with

94
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,474
the categories of gender identity but 
with other categories like human versus 

95
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,214
non human identity.
And so those are the people that have 

96
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:18,070
been come known as other kids or even 
trans abled,

97
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,671
right?
Who are,

98
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,880
who are claiming but on the same logical
gout grounds.

99
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,743
That's the problem.
It's on the same logical grounds is 

100
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:28,570
they're claiming a non categorical 
identity that transcends the human.

101
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,950
And if it's,
if it's only subjective,

102
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
then there's no,
and you already agree with the first 

103
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:35,854
step.
There's no way of logically agreeing 

104
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,330
with the second step.
And so it's a really interesting example

105
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,164
of the,
of how say binary categories maintain 

106
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,304
order.
And then if you violate them to include 

107
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,250
those who are excluded,
what you produce is and up swelling of,

108
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,190
of,
of unmanageable chaos,

109
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,120
which seems to be the state where,
so one of the things I wanted to you is,

110
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,700
I think this is happening,
this is happening on two fronts.

111
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,534
It's happened with the,
with the requests of gay people to be 

112
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,200
included in,
in,

113
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,070
in,
in,

114
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,963
in marriage,
and now now what's happened as a 

115
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,870
consequence of the request of 
transgendered people to be included in,

116
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,903
although flipping the gender category.
So this is especially true with the 

117
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,370
non-gender non so-called nonbinary 
gender types.

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,190
And so I just wondered what you think 
about all that.

119
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,740
Wow.
There's so much.

120
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,900
Um,
so I've been thinking about this a lot.

121
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,740
Maybe not an insider in the same kind of
uses the same words,

122
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,260
but very much along the same lines.
Uh,

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,313
I,
I think it's interesting that you talk 

124
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,384
about categories.
One could look at it also as not just 

125
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,000
that,
the violation or the changing of it,

126
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,120
of it,
um,

127
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,133
the definition of a category,
but the creation of entirely new 

128
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,880
category.
Um,

129
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,530
not just male,
female,

130
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,330
but now in tiny new category.
Um,

131
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,990
which not necessarily,
um,

132
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,103
threatens male and female,
but it threatens the dichotomy as you 

133
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,520
said,
the binary.

134
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,190
Um,
and uh,

135
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,600
I find it interesting because I can't,
personally I don't,

136
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,740
I can't see how there is any third 
agenda because

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,120
okay.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,390
There is nothing more than male and 
female.

139
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,460
I mean,
where,

140
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,840
where does this come from?
There's nothing more than male,

141
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:24,674
female and male.

142
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,650
That's exactly,
that's right.

143
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:29,484
Well that's exactly the problem of the 
category is that once you're outside 

144
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:35,510
that then your anywhere as far as I can 
tell,

145
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,873
and if you can create an identity out of
math thing based out of nothing in 

146
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,314
reality,
then you're basically claiming the 

147
00:07:42,851 --> 00:07:44,890
status of a Danny Guide and

148
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,200
doesn't make sense.
In fact,

149
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:51,100
the other kids are consciously claiming 
the status of Demi gods because they,

150
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,173
they,
they proclaim that they are such 

151
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:57,400
creatures as Alps or ferris or,
or orcs or whatever,

152
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:01,300
whatever their imagination conscious up.
But you know that that's the other thing

153
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,380
too,
is that in the,

154
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,603
in bill see 16,
there's actually an assault on the 

155
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:06,424
concept of reality because identity is 
technically unmoored from its 

156
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:12,400
biological,
some straight.

157
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,293
And so that means it's unmoored from the
objective and as soon as it's on board 

158
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:19,960
from the objective,
then it's subjective.

159
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:23,830
And in principle can be anything.
So I mean in,

160
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,713
here's the problem for,
so with the classically transgendered 

161
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:28,534
people,
and I presume that you would fit into 

162
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,724
that category,
the argument isn't so much about the 

163
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:33,634
category of gender.
The argument is about which category 

164
00:08:36,161 --> 00:08:36,994
you're going to be in.
That what that seems to do is 

165
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:44,230
immediately opened the door or has 
opened the door to,

166
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,540
I would say a philosophical assault on 
the concept of gender itself.

167
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,640
With that culminated,
for example,

168
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,810
in Dr Nicholas maps,
um,

169
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,843
claim on TV Ospi agenda when he was 
debating me that there were no 

170
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,044
biological differences between men and 
women and that that's what the science 

171
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,980
over the last four decades has claimed a
remarkable,

172
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:06,030
remarkable claims.

173
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,103
Basically,
it's not correct that there is such a 

174
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:13,260
thing as biological sex.
And I'm a historian of medicine.

175
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:16,020
I can unpack that for you at great 
length if you want.

176
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:20,670
But in the interest of time I won't.
So that's a very popular misconceptions.

177
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,250
So essentially when in my transgender 
studies classes,

178
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,323
what we're doing is looking at actual 
research and identifying ways that 

179
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,703
current social issues related to trans 
people or things that are associated 

180
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,694
with trans,
such as free speech arguments and 

181
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,130
claims.
Uh,

182
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,540
how that connects to the way that people
are thinking.

183
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:39,840
And the way that research has been 
framed,

184
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,490
the history is there were some of the 
other pronouns

185
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,793
and then the dissolution of identity 
into this unbelievable chaos that that 

186
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:51,320
even appears to transcend that,
that the dimensions of,

187
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,530
of species.
I got an article today from,

188
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,460
from a viewer in England who sent me the
transcripts,

189
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:01,100
I believe it was of the German 
philosophers talk,

190
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,640
who claimed that our recognition of the 
biological sex of animals is nothing but

191
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,130
an artificial imposition of our 
arbitrary ideological construct,

192
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,850
which is exactly what you'd,
you'd claim if you,

193
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,743
if you,
if you decided that the underlying 

194
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:20,714
biology was irrelevant.
This is why I think the evolutionary 

195
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:26,210
biologists are next in the sights of the
social justice warriors.

196
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,273
Absolutely.
I think there is a degree to which even 

197
00:10:30,461 --> 00:10:31,860
a traditional,
uh,

198
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,110
transgender be pulled do still maybe not
assault,

199
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,270
but certainly threatened,
uh,

200
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,110
the,
the,

201
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,660
uh,
the category of male and female.

202
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,830
Suddenly,
I,

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,753
I tried to argue for why I,
why we need to consider a definition of 

204
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:48,970
woman that maybe include someone like 
me.

205
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,280
I don't demand it.
I just argue for it.

206
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,920
Um,
but then there's the other thing that I,

207
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:56,620
the other matter that you seem to talk 
about more,

208
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,603
which is the inclusion of a new 
categories such as non binary and what 

209
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,230
that means to the mat,
the,

210
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,840
the meaning of gender.
But I think including a trans woman into

211
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,730
the category of woman,
uh,

212
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,090
maybe not equally,
but similarly,

213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,250
uh,
threatened,

214
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,213
uh,
um,

215
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,980
the definition of gender.
Um,

216
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,130
in a similar way,
maybe not assault.

217
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,283
Um,

218
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,650
it definitely destabilizes it.
And,

219
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,800
and the question is what exactly should 
be done about that?

220
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:26,634
Because you know there's been a 
claimable say western philosopher since 

221
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,853
I really think since the beginning of 
the philosophical tradition that the 

222
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:39,000
basis of civilization itself,
the structural basis is,

223
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:39,883
is roughly speaking the nuclear family.
And another thing I think that's come 

224
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,660
under assault,
and this is certainly something that was

225
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:48,600
picked up by the cross to Christian 
fundamentalists early,

226
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,840
was that the dissolution of these 
categories,

227
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,360
structures also to destabilize the 
nuclear family.

228
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,583
And the problem with that is we don't 
exactly know what the consequences of 

229
00:11:59,111 --> 00:11:59,944
that will be.
We do know the scientific literature is 

230
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,520
quite clear on this as far as I'm 
concerned,

231
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:04,354
children who are raised in intact 
families with two biological parents do 

232
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:09,274
far better on every,
or pretty much everything that's 

233
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,034
measured.
And so now of course the problem with 

234
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,374
the family,
and you can see this reflected in say 

235
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:20,710
Kathleen wins new legislation on,
I think it's called the old families are

236
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,340
equal.

237
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,173
That's the bill,
is that if any arrangement whatsoever 

238
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,834
between people can be family,
then there's no such thing as family 

239
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,510
anymore.
And if there's no such thing as family,

240
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,100
well then we don't know what will 
happen.

241
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,293
And the problem too is that it seems to 
me that it's in the interest of people 

242
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:42,451
who are non,
who do not fit easily into categories to

243
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,700
not destabilize the main culture too 
badly.

244
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,743
And there's a reason for that is the 
main culture right now is actually 

245
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:50,464
pretty tolerant.
If you'd be stabilized at culture 

246
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,040
enough,
it,

247
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,000
it will become rapidly intolerant.
And then the first thing that happens is

248
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,834
those who are identifiably different are
the first targets of an intolerant 

249
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:05,050
culture.
So it seems to me that it's incumbent on

250
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,420
the lbgt,
et Cetera community.

251
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,283
If they want to request inclusion,
then they also have to figure out how 

252
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:13,174
that can be done in a way that doesn't 
destabilize the entire category 

253
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,580
structure because it it risks doing 
that.

254
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
So now you had some arguments about why 
the category of woman should be expanded

255
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,310
to include people like you.
Now obviously you're doing everything in

256
00:13:27,311 --> 00:13:28,144
your power to present yourself to the 
world in a manner that makes you easily 

257
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,620
categorizable.

258
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,793
Absolutely.
And I guess I don't necessarily even 

259
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:39,660
think of it that way.
You know,

260
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:41,270
I don't think,
uh,

261
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,233
I want to be seen as woman.
So I'm going to do all these things to 

262
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,870
be viewed as woman.
Um,

263
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,330
I do all these things because I am a 
woman.

264
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,403
Um,
I do all these things just because it 

265
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:53,610
comes naturally to me.
And the end product happens to be,

266
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,803
uh,
a subject that in people's minds is 

267
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,090
easily register a ball.

268
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,853
Well that's also,
I would say that's an act of politeness 

269
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,160
on your part,
you know,

270
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,083
so,
so one of the things people concluded 

271
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:14,441
when I first made my videos is that I 
wouldn't use he or she to to,

272
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,010
uh,
refer to,

273
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll say someone like yourself who wants
to be referred to as she.

274
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,330
And my attitude about that was never 
that.

275
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,343
But having thought through it further,
I also realized that my natural 

276
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:31,670
behavioral proclivity,
and I think that most people is to refer

277
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,504
to someone by the protein chro pronoun 
that addresses their appearance because 

278
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:38,560
it's,
it's a,

279
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,480
it's a pronoun use is actually rather 
casual,

280
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,000
right?
You do it unthinkingly in automatically.

281
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,223
And you address a person in keeping with
the manner in which they manifest 

282
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:50,130
themselves.
And,

283
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,770
and you're doing that,
you're saying that that's also a,

284
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:56,810
or maybe even primarily a manifestation 
of an inner drive,

285
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,033
but obviously the,
the manner in which that inner drive is 

286
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,590
manifest itself is also socially,
it's part of a social negotiation.

287
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,660
Of course.
That's probably my argument for choosing

288
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:11,820
a definition of women that includes me,
uh,

289
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,530
because for the sake of communication it
just seems,

290
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,753
makes sense.
Language is what we use to communicate 

291
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:21,650
with one another.
We don't want to corrupt it.

292
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,573
The better we communicate the real world
to on and not that the Beta we use 

293
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,414
language and I think there would 
actually be more confusion if people 

294
00:15:29,331 --> 00:15:30,164
refer to me as he on sa and stuff.
So part of your cases that is actually 

295
00:15:36,981 --> 00:15:40,400
no way of addressing you.
That doesn't produce some confusion.

296
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,790
And so using she is the simplest,
which is less confused.

297
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,380
Okay.
Okay.

298
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,740
That's an interesting argument.
Okay.

299
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,013
So what would you say if I said you 
could make a case that your mere 

300
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,340
existence is a threat to categorical 
order?

301
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,610
And so I could say that your duty as a 
consequence,

302
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,180
despite the potential violation of your 
own sense of self,

303
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,010
would be to what?

304
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,323
To deny your own inner impulses and 
conform because not doing so I 

305
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,490
understand that that comes at a personal
cost.

306
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,930
And I'm not trying to minimize that 
cost.

307
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:17,240
And I'm also not saying that you should 
do this,

308
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,710
but I think you can make a case that 
it's like,

309
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,544
it's like the social obligation of 
someone who doesn't fit into a 

310
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:26,594
fundamental category too tricky one man 
to fit in regardless because it's so 

311
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,480
threatening not to.
No,

312
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,970
I mean you could make the same case 
about artists.

313
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,080
That's the problem,
right?

314
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:36,943
You could make the same case about 
anyone but doesn't fit in and often 

315
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:40,334
people who don't fit in our necessary.
So it's a very tricky thing to think 

316
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,120
through.
Well,

317
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:48,470
I'd like to come back to the argument 
for a usefulness of language,

318
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:49,663
uh,
like how useful is the definition of 

319
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:52,790
women,
you know,

320
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,270
for the most part,
using a definition of lemon,

321
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,640
someone who was on with xx chromosomes 
and,

322
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,920
and you now can give birth.
And you know,

323
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,053
all of those things that's very useful 
because it describes the vast majority 

324
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,320
of cases that you will find in real 
world.

325
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,900
And it facilitates certain kinds of 
interactions.

326
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,753
I mean,
so I don't see that it's necessarily 

327
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:20,720
conflicting.
Two can set it in a given situation.

328
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:21,554
We saw him and he was not born 
biologically female to consider the use 

329
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:30,011
of a different definition of women if 
it's Camina communicatively useful.

330
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,873
And that way we don't have to,
we don't have to threaten categories 

331
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:37,070
because we were still committed to.
Okay.

332
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,210
Um,
okay,

333
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,073
so let,
so let me ask you some questions about 

334
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,084
that.
So let's assume that your point is well 

335
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,694
taken then I might say,
if you're born a man and you wish to be 

336
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:49,364
treated as a woman,
what are the minimal obligations that 

337
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:58,560
you have to undertake in order to be 
granted that,

338
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,870
let's say privilege?
You know,

339
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,190
because the way this is framed,
right,

340
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,113
the way it's been framed and discussions
with me so far is that it's a matter of 

341
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,950
respect to you,
someone's pronouns.

342
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,783
And I think that's nonsense because when
I see people on the street and I 

343
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:14,160
referred to them as he or she,
it has nothing to do with respect.

344
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,323
It's just,
it's just the most casual of 

345
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:20,160
communication in camps.
And so,

346
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,153
so I don't buy the respect thing,
but let's say you're making a case that 

347
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,570
the most straight forward thing is to 
include you or,

348
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,940
or people that are in the same position 
as you.

349
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,550
So what do you think your obligations 
are?

350
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:35,250
Your responsibilities are to the social 
compact,

351
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:39,810
but say in order to be given that I got 
to saint privilege,

352
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,380
it's something like that because it's 
okay.

353
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,070
Privilege is fine with me.
I think that,

354
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,023
um,
considering that my answer to that 

355
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:48,544
question would be
to be regarded as the gender that you 

356
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:57,250
identify eyes common sensically within 
your culture.

357
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,040
Maybe.
Maybe that's your obligation.

358
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,820
Yeah,
I'm okay.

359
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:02,683
Well that seems to be at least 
reasonable because at least then you 

360
00:19:05,391 --> 00:19:06,224
don't make it any more awkward for 
people to interact with you than it has 

361
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:12,650
to be.
I was talking to an artist the other day

362
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,670
named Jonathan Patio and we were talking
about the issue of,

363
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,330
of non categorical identity and he,
he was talking to me about um,

364
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,640
mythological stories of the welcoming of
strangers.

365
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,683
There's a very strong tradition of 
hospitality in most cultures and if a 

366
00:19:26,181 --> 00:19:28,490
stranger shows up here to welcome them 
into your house,

367
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,563
but they're supposed to behave when 
they're in your house so they're not 

368
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:34,130
supposed to steal all your vaccine.
Right.

369
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,130
And rape your women and so forth.
Right,

370
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,980
exactly.
So there's an obligation on both sides.

371
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,630
Right?

372
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:42,463
Like what,
like what Gavin McInnes said about 

373
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,350
trans,
who transitioned from male to female.

374
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,203
You said that you're not,
if you're going to go to Japan and 

375
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,570
you're going to go live in Japan,
do you need to like speak their language

376
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:54,260
to communicate with them,
adopt our costumes,

377
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,094
take your shoes off when you enter the 
enter the house were referred by their 

378
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:59,900
last name,
all these things.

379
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:00,763
That's just what you do.
That's what a stranger does if they 

380
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:05,570
don't want to be considered a stranger 
anymore.

381
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,170
Right,
exactly.

382
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,190
Exactly that.
Yeah.

383
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:09,001
Something.
Well,

384
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,720
so it seems to me that there needs to be
a discussion about responsibilities.

385
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,993
If,
if the excluded other wants to be 

386
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:16,524
included.
The way to be included isn't to blow 

387
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:22,860
apart the category structure.
It's to make faculty behaves nicely when

388
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:25,410
you're welcomed into the house.
It's something like that.

389
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,610
Okay,
so I've got a more,

390
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,110
a more vicious question to ask you.
I would say this is a rough one man.

391
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,090
Like caught like the,
the,

392
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,860
the majority of his live stream of,
because then a transphobic,

393
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,720
transphobic by probably every trend,
the majority of trans people.

394
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,450
I love it.
I think this is

395
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,320
such good comments.
Okay,

396
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,070
so here's,
now here's another problem.

397
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:48,904
One of the things that I've been 
thinking through the last couple of 

398
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,203
weeks is the idea of discrimination 
because discrimination and judgment and 

399
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,474
categorization aren't that easy to tell 
apart and you have to be discriminating 

400
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,210
or you'll do anything all the time.
Do you have to mcallen?

401
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,880
But you have to exclude.
Now,

402
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,733
one of the things that's very 
characteristic about seeing the sexual 

403
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:11,560
behavior among human beings is it's very
exclusionary.

404
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,480
So,
for example,

405
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,820
among chimpanzees,
the females are promiscuous meters.

406
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,730
Now the dominant males have more 
offspring,

407
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,564
but that's because they chase the 
subordinate males away from the females 

408
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:26,650
when they're in estrous,
when they're in heat,

409
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,500
the females that are in heat,
they'll meet with any male.

410
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,990
The dominant males chase away the 
subordinate males,

411
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,930
so they get more offspring.
But it has nothing to do with female,

412
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,070
let's say preference.

413
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,830
Human beings are very strange in this 
regard,

414
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,410
and this is maybe why we're so different
from chimpanzees,

415
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:42,244
even though we share a common ancestor.
And one of the big differences is that 

416
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,160
human females are very,
very choosy sexually.

417
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,500
And so this is why,
for example,

418
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,330
you have twice as many female ancestors 
as mail APP ancestors.

419
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,030
And it's a hard thing to think about 
conceptually,

420
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:01,540
but basically it means that on average,
every,

421
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,970
you'd get that outcome.
If on average,

422
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:07,330
every female produced two offspring and 
every male only produced one.

423
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:08,943
Now that would mean some males produce 
far more than one and some produced 

424
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:12,314
zero.
So there's differential sexual success 

425
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,813
in males and females in human beings.
It's because of female sexual 

426
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:19,684
selectivities.
So this is what females choose before 

427
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,610
they choose men who are across or above 
them.

428
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,790
In dominance hierarchies,
they tend to choose for health.

429
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,163
They tend to choose for appearance.
They tend to choose for productivity 

430
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,310
that's manifested often in status and so
forth.

431
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:37,144
And so what that means is that a 
minority of males are found very 

432
00:22:39,371 --> 00:22:42,460
sexually attractive and the majority of 
males not.

433
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,323
So my point is is that one of the most 
fundamental rights that say feminists 

434
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,390
want to retain is the right to absolute 
sexual choice in their partners.

435
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,613
But they don't understand that that's 
based on exactly the forms of 

436
00:22:55,931 --> 00:22:58,120
discrimination that they're always 
arguing against.

437
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:58,983
So because you generally,
people sleep with someone up their own 

438
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:02,044
race,
they sleep with someone of their own 

439
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:07,120
religion roughly the same age.
They generally go after healthy people.

440
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,580
They generally go after attractive 
people.

441
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,923
And so every single dimension of 
discrimination that you can possibly 

442
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:14,344
imagine governs sexual choice.
If you completely eradicate the 

443
00:23:18,101 --> 00:23:18,934
justification for discrimination,
which I would also say is the same 

444
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,310
justification for freedom of 
association,

445
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,680
you also blow out the element of sexual 
choice.

446
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,260
No.
The question I wanted to ask you is,

447
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,243
considering you as a potential sexual 
partner is going to be distressing to 

448
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:37,250
the majority of people.
Is that acceptable?

449
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,470
Yes.
Why?

450
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,490
Because,
um,

451
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,413
I'm an anomaly.
It's just not something people 

452
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,943
comfortable with.

453
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,200
Uh,
the fact that I was born a different way

454
00:23:48,201 --> 00:23:50,600
than I am now,
even if they are attracted to me,

455
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,823
it makes my dating life a bit harder.
But I mean I'm a huge proponent of 

456
00:23:57,051 --> 00:23:57,884
discrimination.
I think that's 100% within people's 

457
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:01,850
rights.
Uh,

458
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:02,684
I would never call us on transphobic 
because they don't want to seek with me 

459
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,890
because I was born one way and that's 
their preference as their prerogative.

460
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,160
It's 100% people's right to 
discriminate.

461
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,810
So do you think that there's any ways,
obviously you saw to this through a lot,

462
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:17,644
like the part of the problem here is 
that distinguishing that from forbidden 

463
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:24,280
forms of discrimination is very,
very difficult conceptually.

464
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,270
Like it's not obvious why it's okay to 
discriminate against someone sexually.

465
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,433
This happened in brave new world in 
Huxley's novel where any form of sexual 

466
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:35,230
discrimination was regarded as socially 
inappropriate,

467
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,320
such that if someone asks you to have 
sex with them,

468
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,570
it was your moral obligation,
not only to do it,

469
00:24:40,571 --> 00:24:43,780
but to be happy about the basic 
hypothesis was,

470
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,140
or the basic slogan was everyone belongs
to everyone else.

471
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,230
That's the final limit of the absence of
discrimination.

472
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:52,630
So,
but why do you think that discrimination

473
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,280
of that sword is okay?

474
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,240
I believe in equality and lack of 
discrimination,

475
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,930
equal treatment under the law.
That is kind of where it ends for me.

476
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,600
Very much free market.
And my thinking,

477
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,840
um,

478
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,673
well the free market example's an 
interesting one because maybe the 

479
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,464
reasons and that it's okay for other 
people to discriminate is because we 

480
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:14,910
want to retain the right for ourselves 
to discriminate because mate,

481
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,820
maybe it's something like you're willing
to have people reject you as a potential

482
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:19,654
sexual partner as long as you're also 
allowed the privilege to reject other 

483
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:25,730
people as opposed to it.

484
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,310
I'll take that type things on both,
uh,

485
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,613
the,
the whole transgender people in 

486
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:34,430
Washington's thing.
I believed when that was going on.

487
00:25:34,431 --> 00:25:35,264
It's kind of died down now.
But I believe when that was going on 

488
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,710
that's the state shouldn't be saying,
uh,

489
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,000
trans people aren't allowed in,
in,

490
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,130
in the washroom of their choosing or 
shouldn't I,

491
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:48,770
I was like,
that's up to the business owners to make

492
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,470
that decision.
Is this a,

493
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,830
a business down the road of restaurant 
that wouldn't let me,

494
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,480
you know,
use the washroom,

495
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,430
the female washroom,
so be it.

496
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,220
I'll just go to a different restaurant 
and that's why I'm so,

497
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm very free market thinking and I,
I,

498
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,620
I think discrimination is something that
needs to,

499
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,800
the right to discriminate is something 
that needs to be protected at all costs.

500
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,830
It certainly seems to have to be 
protected to some degree.

501
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:13,763
I think the sexual choice conundrum,
I mean there were horrors on both sides 

502
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:17,900
of it,
right?

503
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,580
The first horror is,
well,

504
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:23,090
if you obliterate sexual discrimination,
then you have to allow yourself to,

505
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:23,983
to be the sexual target of whoever when 
ever that seems like pretty bad 

506
00:26:27,261 --> 00:26:28,094
solution.
And it's certainly not one that I think 

507
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,703
particularly women would rapidly accept.
And that's such an assault individuals 

508
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,800
agency,
right?

509
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:37,634
Right.
It's the ultimate assault on an 

510
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,074
individual's agency,
but the problem is is to maintain that 

511
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:42,584
right to choice is to also maintain the 
right to discriminate and then putting 

512
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:50,850
the boundaries on what you're allowed to
discriminate against is very,

513
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:51,684
very tricky.
Like I think we've gone far too far in 

514
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,970
in the,
in the antidiscrimination direction.

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,833
It's very difficult for people on 
campuses now to aggregate themselves in 

516
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:04,440
gender uniform groups.
And I'm not sure that's a good idea.

517
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:05,274
I like,
it seems to me that men should be 

518
00:27:06,061 --> 00:27:08,940
allowed to hang around with men if they 
want to and that women should be allowed

519
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,440
to hang around with women when they want
to and that actually that right might be

520
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:17,100
necessary for the proper development of 
masculinity and femininity.

521
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:18,803
What one final thing,
this is another horrible thing that no 

522
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,170
one ever talks about.

523
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,343
The data suggests that men who are 
homosexual have a very large number of 

524
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,203
sexual partners,
and that makes sense to me because men 

525
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,690
tend not to say no to sexual 
opportunities.

526
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:40,410
And so my man with man,
it's like no one says no.

527
00:27:40,411 --> 00:27:43,590
So there's lots of sexual activity.
Well,

528
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:44,424
so one of the things I'm curious about 
is if marriage is expanded on any other 

529
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,444
grounds merely than the legal grounds,
which I think aren't sufficient to even 

530
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,070
maintain marriage as an,
as an institution,

531
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,340
if marriage is expanded to include same 
sex couples,

532
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,363
say what are the obligations of the same
sex couples once they're actually 

533
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:08,880
married?
So does that mean that that,

534
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,493
and I know the literature on this,
that the suggestion is that most male 

535
00:28:13,171 --> 00:28:15,360
homosexuals who get married don't give 
up.

536
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,760
They're promiscuous ways.
Well,

537
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,430
it seems to me that if you don't give up
your permissionless ways,

538
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,280
then you're actually not playing the 
game of marriage.

539
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,383
And that's why it's one of the 
discussions about responsibility that I 

540
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,820
don't think has been had in public land.
If you want to be part of the game,

541
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,030
then in principle you also have to 
follow the rules.

542
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,550
So that doesn't mean everyone who's 
heterosexual who's managed.

543
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,920
You absolutely obliterate the very 
fundamental building blocks of a society

544
00:28:44,921 --> 00:28:47,530
and a culture.
That's what happens when,

545
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,490
uh,
when you,

546
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,170
when you violent,
very important categories like marriage,

547
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,111
right?
That's right.

548
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,330
You know,
we don't know what the fundamentals,

549
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,610
we don't really understand the 
fundamentals.

550
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,580
I mean people,
people have need philosophical claims.

551
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:03,950
I would say gender identity is a 
fundamental.

552
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,053
Children learn that very early and 
marriage is a fundamental and the 

553
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,310
nuclear family is a fundamental and you 
know,

554
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,144
we,
we have no idea how many of those 

555
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:12,974
fundamentals can be challenged before 
the whole bloody thing shakes and falls 

556
00:29:15,741 --> 00:29:16,574
down and it,
unless you wanted to shake and fall 

557
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,120
down.
All right,

558
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:21,200
so good.
Well that was good.

559
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,390
So maybe we're going to do this again

560
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,623
everyone,
everyone please check the link below to 

561
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:28,720
register for the right to offend 
conference.

562
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,480
Uh,
on November 19th.

563
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,070
Um,
it's going to be Greg,

564
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:32,904
we'll be talking about some of the 
topics surrounding a political 

565
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,760
correctness,
free speech and so on.

566
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,653
And uh,
I wanted to have this live stream 

567
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:41,484
because a Dr. Peterson wasn't able to,
wouldn't be able to make it in person 

568
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:46,014
for that conference.
So I just wanted to use this time to 

569
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:49,770
promote it.
Thank you so much,

570
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:50,910
Dr. Peterson.
All right.

571
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,230
All right.
Okay.

572
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,243
Bye.
Bye.

573
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,953
Bye Bye.
