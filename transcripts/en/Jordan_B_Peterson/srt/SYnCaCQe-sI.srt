1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
Uh,
are you shocked at the amount of people 

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:06,880
that live in western societies here in 
Norway,

3
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,980
especially when we were in Sweden a 
couple of days ago,

4
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:09,814
but all the countries that we've been in
that live in free societies yet are 

5
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,700
completely afraid to say what they 
think.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,300
Is it absolutely shocking to you?

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,433
I think the most.
I think what I've been most shocked 

8
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,614
about in all of that is what's happened 
in the UK with the police starting to 

9
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:32,870
prosecute people for crimes of 
offensiveness.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,033
That's just.
And I think that's probably partly 

11
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:37,094
because I'm an,
I mean I see that as broadly reflective 

12
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:40,034
of,
of something that's happening in the 

13
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:41,564
West in general,
but it's particularly shocking and 

14
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,460
appalling to me as a,
as a western Canadian,

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,370
you know,
because obviously Canada was part of the

16
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:50,204
British empire and when I grew up,
like there was a pretty tight affinity 

17
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:56,240
still in western Canada with the British
empire.

18
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,390
I mean our,
our maps where the dominion of Canada,

19
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,920
it was still pink,
you know,

20
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:02,390
it was still a part of the British 
empire.

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,260
We saying God save the Queen Constantly 
at public gatherings.

22
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:10,850
That's gone by the wayside and so,
and you know,

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,823
I've always regarded British common law 
and the British parliamentary tradition 

24
00:01:17,331 --> 00:01:19,070
as well.

25
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,270
One of it perhaps the highest 
achievement of western civilization.

26
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,000
I mean you could argue about that,
but it's,

27
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,990
it's in the top 10,
let's say,

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,270
and then to see the Brits who also have 
this phenomenal sense of humor,

29
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:33,104
this ability to say anything,
no matter how outrageous about anyone 

30
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:39,620
and to include themselves in the joke,
right?

31
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,454
Which is such an elegant way of 
expressing comedic freedom to see them 

32
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,890
going down this road is just,
it just,

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,210
it's,
it's,

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,300
it's what is it exactly?
Well,

35
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:55,940
it's deeply saddening.
That's for sure.

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,953
And,
and what's horrifying and it's not 

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,113
exactly the right wording.
I don't know what the word for it is 

38
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,034
there.
Certainly sorrow that's associated with 

39
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,670
a disbelief.
It's also that at,

40
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,010
at,
at,

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,080
at watching that happen in what I still 
think is the central core of the idea of

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,700
individual sovereignty and freedom as 
expressed across the western world.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,983
And so,
and then there's similar manifestations 

44
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:24,344
of that everywhere else,
but the police per prosecuting people 

45
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:28,180
for,
you know,

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,510
asking people to turn in their neighbors
if they say something offensive.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,150
And that's happening in the UK.
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:35,600
Litter.
Well,

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,433
we saw that,
that,

50
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,320
you know,
somebody sent me posters,

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,280
pictures of posters in the Scottish 
subway,

52
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,270
in the,
in the metro,

53
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,530
in the tube,
you know,

54
00:02:45,531 --> 00:02:50,531
saying inviting people to inform on 
their neighbors for being offensive.

55
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,610
It's like,
what the hell,

56
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,190
what,
what?

57
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,620
So I knew this was coming because.
Because I knew

58
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,250
we brought our first speech laws in 
Canada back in the 19 eighties.

59
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,920
We were after this character named Ernst
Zandel,

60
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,470
who is particularly despicable piece of 
work,

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,333
hard hat wearing,
right wing antisemitism Holocaust 

62
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,690
denier.
You know,

63
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:18,691
he had it all that guy
and it was his

64
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,853
shenanigans,
careless malevolent shenanigans that 

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,630
entice Canadians into producing hate 
speech legislation.

66
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:31,800
I thought,
no,

67
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,990
that's,
that's not good.

68
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,140
It's not good.
You're making a big mistake.

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,960
We're going to pay for this.
It's going to unfold over a long time.

70
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,820
Who defines hate

71
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,660
the crucial issue.
It's not like it's a scientific category

72
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,943
to judgment and the answer is those whom
you least want to have the power to 

73
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:57,530
define it because they're the ones that 
will take that power to themselves.

74
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,260
And if you think that isn't gonna Affect
what you get to say,

75
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:04,400
well you've got another thing coming.
So I think it's,

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,653
I think it's,
we're going to pay for it and hopefully 

77
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,093
hopefully we'll wake up and push back 
before we have to pay too high a price 

78
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,830
to pay for it.
So.

79
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,980
Yeah.
And we're going to deserve to pay for it

80
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:26,000
too.
He's talking to you

81
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,610
last night.
Last night that

82
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,320
was on this British show called question
time,

83
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,080
which is very famous British show.
And there was a,

84
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,420
um,
a woman parliamentarian.

85
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,250
They're from Ireland who,
who is pretty bright.

86
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,473
I like listening to her,
but I'm the host asked me about this 

87
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,560
character named count.
Dang,

88
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,403
Kyla,
I don't know if you know about him and 

89
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,103
his girlfriend.
He's a comedian while he thinks he's a 

90
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,030
comedian and.
Well,

91
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,893
but you know,
there are lots of Comedians who think 

92
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:05,374
they're comedians that aren't funny.
And I'm not saying he's not funny 

93
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,030
because other people think that he's a 
comedian too,

94
00:05:10,031 --> 00:05:12,430
but he presents himself as a comedian.
Count.

95
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,340
Dang killer.
I mean that's actually a joke,

96
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:20,341
that name and his girlfriend had a pug 
and I liked count Dan Kennedy because he

97
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,940
hated that Pug and I'm not very fond of 
pugs.

98
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,490
I think they're hideous little creatures
and,

99
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,690
and,
and,

100
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:30,243
and you know,
I don't really hate them if a pug comes 

101
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,950
along then all pet it and everything,
but it's just sort of like the,

102
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,260
the,
this little dog with these bugs,

103
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,340
you know,
if you hit it on the back of the head,

104
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,630
the eyes will pop out.

105
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,910
And so because they've been so 
genetically mishandled and so,

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,171
I don't know,
man,

107
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,004
it's just,
you realize we're putting this on 

108
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,780
youtube and you're just done.
You're unleashing a whole new world.

109
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,360
People.
I know,

110
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,353
I know.
I know.

111
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,430
Whatever,
whatever.

112
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,080
So you can have your and you can love 
it.

113
00:06:02,081 --> 00:06:02,914
My Dad had this dog that was so damn 
hideous and useless that it was just a 

114
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:08,230
miracle and he loved it to death.
And so,

115
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,670
and you know,
that's fine,

116
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,533
that's fine,
but there's kind of an ironic attitude 

117
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:17,480
in the dismissal of pugs and Denckla 
didn't like his girlfriend's punk.

118
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,960
And so he thought he'd play a mean trick
and,

119
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,250
or amine slash funny trick and teach it 
to do a hail Hitler salute.

120
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,370
Which I actually thought was quite 
funny.

121
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,990
It's like I don't,
look,

122
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:32,910
I don't see that as glorifying Hitler 
hits up Pug for God's sake.

123
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,223
It wasn't,
uh,

124
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,140
it wasn't a,
what do you call those Doberman,

125
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,890
you know,
it was a pug that's like teaching a wrap

126
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,770
to do hail Hitler.
Salute.

127
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,530
I love how this has come down to the 
breed of dogs with you.

128
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,900
These things matter in terms of their,
the way they're represented,

129
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,763
you know,
and then,

130
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,020
you know,
he,

131
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:58,050
he taught it to so horrible.
He and I'm gonna be so killed for this.

132
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,580
He taught him to do it's little salute 
when he said gas the Jews,

133
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:08,450
which is not funny.
It except it's horribly funny,

134
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,330
you know,
that's the thing.

135
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,070
Well look,
and so yeah,

136
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,330
you laugh.
That's right.

137
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,250
Because you're all horrible and you 
know,

138
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,800
and you know perfectly well that it's 
horribly funny

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,273
and you know,
we need,

140
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
we need to be able to be horribly funny 
because life is horrible and we and we 

141
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,383
need to be able to find.
We need to be able to allow people the 

142
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,304
freedom to find the ability to transcend
that horror with comedy and a mark of a 

143
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:47,750
free society is that comedians can be 
just exactly what the is,

144
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,780
which there people who push the edge of 
what's acceptable.

145
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,780
If you're a brilliant comedian,
you get right to the edge,

146
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:54,614
right?
And you dance there and the audience is 

147
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,360
thinking,
Sarah Silvermans a good example of that.

148
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,720
You know,
because you can just see her.

149
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,610
She's gone all politically correct 
recently.

150
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,070
But when she was in her heyday,
you could just see Sarah,

151
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,490
she's so smart.
You'd see you're sitting there and she'd

152
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:10,940
think of something just spectacularly 
evil and horrible.

153
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,370
And she think,
oh,

154
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,010
and then she say it,
you know,

155
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,853
and everyone would just crack up because
like the darkest part of their soul had 

156
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:22,430
once thought something like that and she
dared to outer red 10.

157
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,760
And by honoring it she also 
simultaneously transcended it,

158
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,990
you know?
And that's the beauty of comedy and,

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,880
and,
and well.

160
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:31,680
So anyways,
they went after Dane,

161
00:08:31,681 --> 00:08:34,530
Kyla and nailed him legally.
And I thought that's an,

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,720
that's in Great Britain as well last 
night.

163
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:40,690
So they brought this up on,
on question time and you know,

164
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,733
the Irish woman who said she went off on
a talk about how terrible Kristallnacht 

165
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:48,654
wasn't,
what an awful thing Auschwitz Holocaust 

166
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,560
was.
It's like,

167
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,543
well,

168
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,660
you're not that morally virtuous to 
notice that.

169
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,933
You know what I mean?
It's like it didn't have anything to do 

170
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,360
with the topic at hand.
It's like,

171
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,050
yet you wouldn't say that.
You notice that unless you were implying

172
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,810
that where there are people around you,
including this count,

173
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,510
dank killer,
who didn't notice that.

174
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,213
Okay.
It had nothing to do with whether he 

175
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,820
should have been prosecuted for his 
stupid joke.

176
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,860
And you can say,
well,

177
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,290
you could say I was a stupid joke,
which it certainly was.

178
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,900
You could say that it was a hateful 
joke,

179
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,734
which I don't agree with by the way,
but you could say that and I think you 

180
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:36,780
could,
you could make a credible case for that.

181
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,620
But then to say that because you think 
that the holocaust was bad,

182
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,900
he should be criminally prosecuted.
It's like,

183
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,190
no,
sorry man,

184
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,580
you've crossed the line and there's no 
excuse for it.

185
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:53,090
And so that's part of what's worrisome 
about the state of discourse in the free

186
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,940
West.
That same thing,

187
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,070
comedians won't go to university 
campuses,

188
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,530
same thing.
You don't get to be funny.

189
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,100
So if you can't be funny then you're not
free.

190
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,540
You know,
the gesture and the king's courts,

191
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,350
the only person who gets to tell the 
truth.

192
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,170
And if the king is such a tyrant that he
kills his gesture,

193
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:15,870
then you know that the evil king is in 
charge.

194
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,390
And so when we can't tolerate our 
comedians,

195
00:10:18,391 --> 00:10:18,991
it's like,
well,

196
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:21,030
there you go.
They're the canaries in the coal mine as

197
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:21,960
far as I'm concerned.

198
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,060
Thank you.
Thank you.

199
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,743
My wife that I wouldn't hit any hornets 
with any Hornet's nest with sticks for 

200
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,090
like a day and now I just hit a big 
hornet's nest with the stick.

201
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,070
So sorry Tammy.
She's here somewhere.

202
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,720
Yeah.
Give it up for Jordan's wife,

203
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:51,560
by the way.
She's been.

204
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Thank you.
Thank you.
