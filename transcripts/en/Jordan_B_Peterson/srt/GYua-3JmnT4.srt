1
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,793
I've thought a long time about what 
motivates behavior like that manifested 

2
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,600
at Columbine and at Sandy Hook.
And then of course,

3
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,590
most recently at Parkland and because of
the Parkland event,

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,460
I thought that I would read a chapter 
from my book to everyone.

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,713
It's chapter six rules six set your 
house in perfect order before you 

6
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,814
criticize the world,
and it's an extended meditation on the 

7
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,690
kind of motivations that drive the 
people who wished to slaughter innocence

8
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,524
as a form of revenge against God.
So I'm going to read it to you and you 

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,500
can let me know what you think.
Rule six,

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,270
set your house in perfect order before 
you criticize the world.

11
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,663
A religious problem.
It does not seem reasonable to describe 

12
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,834
the young man who shot 20 children and 
six staff members at Sandy Hook 

13
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,893
Elementary School in Newton,
Connecticut in 2012 as a religious 

14
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:16,274
person.
This is equally true for the Colorado 

15
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,630
theater gunman and the columbine high 
school shooters,

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,113
but these murderous individuals how to 
problem with reality that existed at a 

17
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:31,454
religious depth
as one of the members of the columbine 

18
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,684
dual wrote,
the human race isn't worth fighting for 

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,790
only worth killing.
Give the earth back to the animals.

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,390
They deserve it infinitely more than we 
do.

21
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,583
Nothing means anything anymore.
People who think such things view being 

22
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,474
itself as inequitable and harsh to the 
point of corruption and human being in 

23
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:03,504
particular as contemptible.
They appoint themselves supreme 

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,730
adjudicators of reality and find it 
wanting.

25
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,670
They are the ultimate critics.
The deeply cynical writer continues.

26
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,893
If you recall your history,
the Nazis came up with a final solution 

27
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:28,550
to the Jewish problem.
Kill the mall.

28
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,300
Well,
in case you haven't figured it out,

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,840
I say kill mankind.
No one should survive.

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,900
For such individuals the world have 
experienced is insufficient and evil,

31
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,540
so to hell with everything,

32
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,820
what is happening when someone comes to 
think in this manner.

33
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:59,020
A great German play Faust,
a tragedy written by Johann,

34
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,040
both gang from Gerta addresses that 
issue.

35
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,803
The play's main character.
A scholar named Heinrich Faust trades 

36
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,381
his immortal soul to the devil.
Mephistopheles in return,

37
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
he receives whatever he desires.
We'll still alive on earth in girth.

38
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:24,371
This play Mephistopheles is the eternal 
adversary of being.

39
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,990
He has a central defining credo.
I am the spirit who negates,

40
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,903
and rightly so for all that comes to be 
deserves to parish wretchedly it were 

41
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,070
better.
Nothing would begin.

42
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,610
Thus everything that your term,
sin,

43
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,590
destruction,
evil,

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,160
represent,
that is my proper element.

45
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,590
Girtha considered this hateful 
sentiment.

46
00:03:55,591 --> 00:03:56,424
So important,
so key to the central element of 

47
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:00,264
vengeful human destructiveness that he 
had mephistopheles say it a second time 

48
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,980
phrased somewhat differently in part two
of the play written many years later.

49
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,970
People often think in the meth festo and
manner,

50
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,223
although they sell them,
act upon their thoughts as brutally as 

51
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,380
the mass murderers of school college in 
theater,

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,410
whenever we experience injustice real or
imagined,

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,570
whenever we encounter tragedy or fall 
prey to the machinations of others,

54
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,560
whenever we experienced the horror and 
pain of our own,

55
00:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,394
apparently arbitrary limitations,
the temptation to question being and 

56
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:45,350
then to curse,
it rises folly from the darkness.

57
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,810
Why must innocent people suffer so 
terribly?

58
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,680
What kind of bloody horrible planet is 
this?

59
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,980
Anyway?
Life is in truth,

60
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,450
very hard.
Everyone is destined for pain and slated

61
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,284
for destruction.
Sometimes suffering is clearly the 

62
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:10,430
result of personal fault such as willful
blindness,

63
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,130
poor decision making or malevolence.

64
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,630
Yeah.

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,720
In such cases when it appears to be self
inflicted,

66
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,190
it may even seem just people get what 
they deserve.

67
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,120
You might contend that's cold comfort.
However,

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,073
even when true,
sometimes if those who are suffering 

69
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:31,784
changed their behavior,
then their lives would unfold less 

70
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:35,054
tragically,
but human control is limited 

71
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,750
susceptibility to despair,
disease,

72
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,550
aging and death is universal,
and the final analysis,

73
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:49,610
we do not appear to be the architects of
our own fragility.

74
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,150
Whose fault is it?
Then?

75
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,193
People who are very ill or worse,
who have a sick child will inevitably 

76
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,854
find themselves asking this question 
whether they are religious believers or 

77
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,874
not.

78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Okay.

79
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,703
The same is true of someone who finds 
his shirt sleeve caught in the gears of 

80
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:11,634
a giant bureaucracy who is suffering 
through a tax audit or fighting an 

81
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:17,790
interminable lawsuit or divorce.

82
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:19,710
Yeah,

83
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,543
and it's not only the obviously 
suffering who are tormented by the need 

84
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:27,750
to blame someone or something for the 
intolerable state of their being

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,620
at the height of his fame,
influence and creative power.

86
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:34,603
For example,
the towering Leo tolstoy himself began 

87
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:40,580
to question the value of human 
existence.

88
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,360
He reasoned in this way.
My position was terrible.

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,753
I knew that I could find nothing in the 
way of rational knowledge except the 

90
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,240
denial of life and in faith I could find
nothing excepted.

91
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,130
Denial of reason,
and this was even more impossible than a

92
00:07:00,131 --> 00:07:05,131
denial of life.
According to rational knowledge,

93
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,290
it followed that life is evil and people
know it.

94
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,130
They do not have to live yet they have 
lived and they do live.

95
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,323
Just as I myself had lived,
even though I had known for a long time 

96
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:25,350
that life is meaningless and evil.
Try as he might,

97
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:30,080
tall story could only identify for means
of escaping from such thoughts.

98
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,790
One was retreating into childlike 
ignorance of the problem.

99
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,590
Okay.

100
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,423
Another was pursuing mindless pleasure.
The third was continuing to drag out a 

101
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:48,920
life that is evil and meaningless.
Knowing beforehand that nothing can come

102
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:49,754
of it.

103
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,410
Yeah.

104
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,830
He identified that particular form of 
escape with weakness.

105
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,700
The people in this category know that 
death is better than life,

106
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,133
but they do not have the strength to act
rationally and quickly put it into the 

107
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,990
delusion by killing themselves
only.

108
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:12,100
The fourth and final motive,
escape involved strength and energy.

109
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,113
It consists of destroying life.
Once one has realized that life is evil 

110
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:17,734
and meaningless,
tolstoy relentlessly followed his 

111
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:22,614
thoughts,
only unusually strong in logically 

112
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:29,271
consistent people act in this manner.
Having realized all the stupidity of the

113
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,114
joke that is being played on us and 
seeing that the blessings of the dead 

114
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,960
are greater than those of the living and
that it is better not to exist.

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,080
They act and put an end to this stupid 
joke and they use any means of doing it.

116
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,910
A rope around the neck,
water,

117
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,880
a knife in the heart,
a train.

118
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,133
Tolstoy wasn't pessimistic enough.
The stupidity of the joke being played 

119
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,140
on us does not merely motivate suicide.
It motivates murder.

120
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Mass murder often followed by suicide.
That is a far more effective existential

121
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:13,581
protest.
By June of 2016 unbelievable.

122
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:14,904
As it may seem,
there had been 1000 mass killings 

123
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
defined as four or more people shot in a
single incident excluding the shooter in

124
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,444
the u s in 1,260 days.
That's one such event on five of every 

125
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,610
six days for more than three years.

126
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,830
Everyone says,
we don't understand.

127
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,420
How can we still pretend that tolstoy,
I understood more than a century ago,

128
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,373
the ancient authors of the Biblical 
story of Cain and Abel understood as 

129
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,110
well.
More than 20 centuries ago,

130
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,303
they described murder as the first act 
of post edenic history and not just 

131
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,590
murder,
but fratricidal murder,

132
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,710
murder,
not only of someone innocent,

133
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,460
but if someone ideal and good and 
murdered,

134
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:13,660
done consciously to spite the creator of
the universe.

135
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,780
Okay?

136
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,400
Today's killers tell us the same thing 
in their own words.

137
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,160
Who would dare say that this is not the 
worm at the core of the apple.

138
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,050
Okay,

139
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,860
but we will not listen because the truth
cuts too close to the bone.

140
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,170
Even for a mind as profound as that of 
the celebrated Russian author,

141
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,940
there was no way out.
How can the rest of us manage?

142
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,510
When a man of tolstoy's stature admits 
defeat for years,

143
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:49,384
he hit his guns from himself and would 
not walk with a rope in hand and Casey 

144
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:54,964
hanged himself.
How can a person who is awake avoid 

145
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,150
outrage at the world,
vengeance or transformation?

146
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,153
A religious man might shake his fist in 
desperation at the apparent injustice 

147
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,433
and blindness of God,
even Christ himself felt abandoned 

148
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:23,971
before the cross or so.
The story goes more agnostic or atheist.

149
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,384
Stick individual might blame fate or 
meditate bitterly on the brutality of 

150
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,750
chance.
Another might tear himself apart,

151
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,823
searching for the character flaws 
underlying his suffering and 

152
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:40,891
deterioration.
These are all variations on a theme.

153
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,913
The name of the target changes,
but the underlying psychology remains 

154
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,960
constant.
Why?

155
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,580
Why is there so much suffering and 
cruelty?

156
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,383
Well,
perhaps it really is God's doing or the 

157
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,104
fault of blind,
pointless fate if you're inclined to 

158
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:06,370
think that way and there appears to be 
every reason to think that way.

159
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,553
Okay,

160
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,813
but what happens if you do
mass murderers believe that the 

161
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,334
suffering attendant upon existence 
justifies judgment and revenge as the 

162
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,394
columbine boys so clearly indicated,
I will sooner die than betray my own 

163
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,800
thoughts.
Before I leave this worthless place,

164
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,930
I will kill whoever I deemed unfit for 
anything specially life.

165
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,470
If you pissed me off in the past,
you will die.

166
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:43,030
If I see you,
you might be able to piss off others and

167
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:46,720
have it eventually all blow over,
but not me.

168
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:48,663
I don't forget people who wrong me.
One of the most vengeful murderers of 

169
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,490
the 20th century,
the terrible Carl Pans.

170
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,010
Ram was raped,
brutalized,

171
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,844
and betrayed in the Minnesota 
institution responsible for his 

172
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,320
rehabilitation.
When he was a delinquent juvenile,

173
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,110
he emerged enraged,
beyond measure as a burglar,

174
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,230
arsonist,
rapists and serial killer.

175
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,130
He aimed consciously and consistently at
destruction,

176
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,360
even keeping track of the dollar value 
of the property he burned.

177
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,230
He started by hating the individuals who
had heard him.

178
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,280
His resentment grew until his hatred 
encompassed all of mankind and he didn't

179
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:36,694
stop there.
His destructiveness was aimed in some 

180
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:45,220
fundamental manner at God himself.
There's no other way of phrasing it.

181
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,840
Pans,
rem raped,

182
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,793
murdered,
and burned to express his outrage at 

183
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:56,131
being.
He acted as if someone was responsible.

184
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,890
The same thing happens in the story of 
Cain and Abel.

185
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,350
Cain sacrifices are rejected.
He exists in suffering.

186
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,300
He calls out God and challenges the 
being he created.

187
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,453
God refuses his plea.
He tells Kane that is trouble is self 

188
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:17,284
induced cane in his rage,
kills Abel God's favorite and truth be 

189
00:14:24,161 --> 00:14:29,161
known canes.
Idle Cain is jealous of course,

190
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,393
of a successful brother,
but he destroys able primarily to spite 

191
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,163
God.
This is the truest version of what 

192
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:41,980
happens when people take their vengeance
to the ultimate extreme,

193
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,720
okay.

194
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,700
Pans,
rams response was,

195
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,140
and this is what is so terrible,
perfectly understandable.

196
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,153
The details of his autobiography reveal 
that he was one of tolstoy's strong and 

197
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,210
logically consistent people.
He was a powerful,

198
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,580
consistent,
fearless actor.

199
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,010
He had the courage of his convictions,
how good someone like him be expected to

200
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:09,770
forgive and forget given what had 
happened to him.

201
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,613
Truly terrible things happen to people.
It's no wonder they're out for revenge 

202
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,860
under such conditions.
Vengeance seems a moral necessity.

203
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,450
How can it be distinguished from the 
demand for justice after all,

204
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,260
after the experience of terrible 
atrocity?

205
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,430
Isn't forgiveness just cowardice or lack
of willpower?

206
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,960
Such questions torment me,
but people emerge from terrible pasts to

207
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:46,430
do good and not evil.
Although such an accomplishment can seem

208
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,540
superhuman.
I have met people who managed to do it.

209
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,410
I knew a man,
great artists who emerged from just such

210
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,500
a school as the one described by pans 
around only.

211
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,360
This man was thrown into it as an 
innocent five-year-old,

212
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:04,670
fresh from a long stretch in the 
hospital where he had suffered measles,

213
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,620
mumps,
and chicken pox.

214
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Simultaneously in capable of speaking 
the language of the school,

215
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,500
deliberately isolated from his family,
abused,

216
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,080
starved,
and otherwise tormented.

217
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,080
He emerged an angry,
broken young man.

218
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,303
He hurt himself badly in the aftermath 
with drugs and alcohol and other forms 

219
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,760
of self destructive behavior.
He detested everyone,

220
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,540
God himself,
and blind fate included.

221
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,880
Okay,

222
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,690
but he put it into all of that.
He stopped drinking.

223
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,950
He stopped hating.
Although it's still emerges in flashes.

224
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,023
He revitalized the artistic culture of 
his native tradition and trained young 

225
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:48,794
men to continue in his footsteps.
He produced a 50 foot totem pole 

226
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,190
memorializing the events of his life and
the canoe 40 feet long from a single log

227
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,070
of a kind,
rarely if ever produced.

228
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,933
Now he brought his family together and 
held a great potlatch with 16 hours of 

229
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:11,561
dancing and hundreds of people in 
attendance to express his grief and make

230
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:12,434
peace with the past.
He decided to be a good person and then 

231
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:21,050
he did the impossible things required to
live that way.

232
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,030
I had a client who did not have good 
parents.

233
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:26,923
Her mother died when she was very young.
Her grandmother who raised her was a 

234
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:34,250
Harridan bitter and over concerned with 
appearances.

235
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,190
She mistreated her granddaughter,
punishing her for her virtues,

236
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,290
creativity,
sensitivity,

237
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,213
intelligence,
unable to resist acting out her 

238
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:49,740
resentment for an admittedly hard life 
on her granddaughter.

239
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,680
She had a better relationship with her 
father,

240
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,460
but he was an addict who died badly 
while she cared for him,

241
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,360
my client had his son.

242
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:03,483
She perpetuated none of this with him.
He grew up truthful and independent and 

243
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:09,514
hardworking and smart.
Instead of widening the terror and the 

244
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:15,370
cultural fabric she inherited and 
transmitting it,

245
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,323
she sewed it up.
She rejected the sins of her 

246
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:20,290
forefathers.

247
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:21,500
Okay.

248
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Such things can be done.
Neat.

249
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,810
You wrote these words,
distress,

250
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,110
whether psychic,
physical or intellectual need not at all

251
00:18:37,271 --> 00:18:41,530
produced nihilism.
That is the radical rejection of value,

252
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,453
meaning and desirability.
Such distress always permits a variety 

253
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:53,361
of interpretations.
What Nietzsche meant was this,

254
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,150
people who experienced evil may 
certainly desire to perpetuate it,

255
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,480
to pay it forward,
but it is also possible to learn good by

256
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:09,821
experiencing evil.
A bullied boy can mimic his tormentors,

257
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,173
but it can also learn from his own abuse
that it is wrong to push people around 

258
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,793
and make their lives miserable.
Someone tormented by her mother can 

259
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:25,651
learn from her terrible experiences,
how important it is to be a good parent.

260
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,763
Many,
perhaps even most of the adults who 

261
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,410
abused children were abused themselves 
as children.

262
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:36,763
However,
the majority of people who were abused 

263
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:41,960
as children do not abuse their own 
children,

264
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,013
and this is a well established fact,
which can be demonstrated simply 

265
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:47,743
arithmetically in this way.
If one parent abused three children and 

266
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:55,310
each of those children had three 
children and so on,

267
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,700
then there would be three abusers in the
first generation,

268
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,730
nine the second 27 the third 81 the 
fourth and so on,

269
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,460
exponentially after 20 generations,
more than 10 billion would have suffered

270
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,200
childhood abuse.

271
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,220
Okay.

272
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,770
More people than currently inhabit the 
planet,

273
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,640
but instead abuse disappears across 
generations.

274
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,683
People constrain its spread.
That's a testament to the genuine 

275
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:29,290
dominance of good over evil in the human
heart.

276
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,403
The desire for vengeance,
however justified also bars the way to 

277
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:36,934
other productive thoughts.
The American English poet ts Elliot 

278
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:46,030
explained why in his play,
the cocktail party,

279
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
one of his is not having a good time of 
it.

280
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,260
She speaks of her profound unhappiness 
to a psychiatrist.

281
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,830
She says she hopes all her suffering is 
her own fault.

282
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,960
The psychiatrist is taken aback.
He asks why

283
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,970
she has thought long and hard about 
this.

284
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:06,804
She says,
and has come to the following 

285
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:10,590
conclusion.
If it's her fault,

286
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,510
she might be able to do something about 
it if it's God's fault.

287
00:21:15,511 --> 00:21:19,920
However,
if reality itself is flawed hell bent on

288
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:20,754
ensuring her misery and she is doomed,
she couldn't change the structure of 

289
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:32,040
reality itself.
Maybe she could change her own life.

290
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:35,983
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn,
the great Russian documenter of the 

291
00:21:41,481 --> 00:21:46,481
abuses of Stalinism had every reason to 
question the structure of existence when

292
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:48,284
he was imprisoned in a Soviet labor camp
in the middle of the terrible 20th 

293
00:21:52,491 --> 00:21:55,160
century.
He had served as a soldier on the ill,

294
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:59,600
prepared Russian front lines in the face
of a Nazi invasion.

295
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,970
He'd been arrested,
beaten,

296
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,700
and thrown into prison by his own 
people.

297
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,100
Then he was struck by cancer.

298
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,270
He could have become resentful and 
bitter.

299
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,280
His life had been rendered miserable by 
both Stalin and Hitler,

300
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,110
two of the worst tyrants in history.
He lived in brutal conditions,

301
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:26,230
vast stretches of his precious time were
stolen from him and squandered.

302
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,630
He witnessed the pointless and 
degrading,

303
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,810
suffering and death of his friends and 
acquaintances.

304
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:36,920
Then he contracted and extremely serious
disease.

305
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,890
Soldier Knutsen had cause to curse God.
Job himself.

306
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,040
Barely had it as hard,
but the great writer,

307
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,153
the profound spirited defender of truth,
did not allow his mind to turn towards 

308
00:22:54,411 --> 00:22:58,130
vengeance and destruction.
He opened his eyes instead.

309
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,353
During his many trials,
Solzhenitsyn encountered people who 

310
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:05,900
comported themselves notably under 
horrific circumstances.

311
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,590
He contemplated their behavior deeply.
Then he asked himself the most difficult

312
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,124
of questions
and he personally contributed to the 

313
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:20,790
catastrophe of his life.
If so,

314
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,863
how?

315
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,613
He remembered his unquestioning support 
of the communist party in his early 

316
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,680
years.
He reconsidered his whole life.

317
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,143
He had plenty of time in the camps.
How would he missed the mark in the 

318
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,874
past?
How many times had he acted against his 

319
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:42,024
own conscience,
engaging in actions that he knew to be 

320
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,643
wrong?
How many times had he betrayed himself 

321
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,303
and lied?
Was there any way that the sins of his 

322
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,264
past could be rectified?
Atone for in the muddy hell of a Soviet 

323
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:58,754
ghoulag

324
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,813
soldier knits and poured over the 
details of his life with a fine tooth 

325
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:08,460
comb.
He asked himself a second question and a

326
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:12,180
third,
can I stop making such mistakes now?

327
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,600
Can I repair the damage done by my past 
failures?

328
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,860
No,
he learned to watch and to listen.

329
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,730
He found people he admired who were 
honest.

330
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,110
Despite everything.
He took himself apart piece by piece,

331
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:33,290
let what was unnecessary and harmful,
die and resurrected himself.

332
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:34,463
Then he wrote the Gulag archipelago,
a history of the Soviet prison camp 

333
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,710
system.
It's a forceful,

334
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,753
terrible book written with the 
overwhelming moral force of unvarnished 

335
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,390
truth.
It's sheer outrage.

336
00:24:48,391 --> 00:24:51,960
Screamed unbearably across hundreds of 
pages,

337
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,470
band and for good reason in the USSR.
It was smuggled to the West in the 1970s

338
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,653
and burst upon the world soldier Nixon's
writing utterly and finally demolished 

339
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:11,931
the intellectual credibility of 
communism as ideology or society.

340
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,110
He took an ax to the trunk of the tree 
who's bitter.

341
00:25:16,111 --> 00:25:19,920
Fruits had nourished him so poorly and 
who's planting.

342
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:25,070
He had witnessed and supported
one man's decision to change his life.

343
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,190
Instead of cursing.
Fate shook the whole pathological system

344
00:25:32,191 --> 00:25:37,191
of communist tyranny to its core.
It crumbled entirely,

345
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,543
not so many years later,
and soldier Nixon's courage was not the 

346
00:25:42,361 --> 00:25:44,130
least of the reasons why

347
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,170
he was not the only such person to 
perform such a miracle.

348
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,213
Vaclav Havel the persecuted writer,
who later impossibly became the 

349
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:55,434
president of Czechoslovakia.
Then of the new Czech Republic comes to 

350
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:04,491
mind as does Mahatma Gandhi.
Things fall apart.

351
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,673
Yeah.

352
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,653
Hello.
Peoples have adamantly refused to judge 

353
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:12,834
reality to criticize being to blame God.
It's interesting to consider the Old 

354
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,723
Testament Hebrews in this regard.
Their travails followed a consistent 

355
00:26:23,191 --> 00:26:26,160
pattern.
The stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and

356
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:29,910
Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel are
truly ancient.

357
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,270
Their origins vanish into the mysteries 
of time.

358
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,153
It's not until after the flood story in 
genesis that something like history as 

359
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:42,480
we understand it truly starts.
It starts with Abraham.

360
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,070
Abraham's descendants become the Hebrew 
people of the Old Testament,

361
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:52,290
also known as the Hebrew Bible.
They enter a covenant with Yahweh,

362
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,933
with God and begin their recognizably 
historical adventures under the 

363
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,124
leadership of a great man.
The Hebrews organize themselves into a 

364
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:06,450
society and then an empire as their 
fortunes rise.

365
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,510
Success breeds pride and arrogance.
Corruption raises its ugly head.

366
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,523
The increasingly hubristic state becomes
obsessed with power begins to forget 

367
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:22,560
it's duty to the widows and the orphans 
and deviates from its age.

368
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,340
Old Agreement with God.
A prophet arises,

369
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
he brazenly and publicly reviles the 
authoritarian king and faithless country

370
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,630
for their failures before God,
an act of blind courage,

371
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,940
telling them of the terrible judgment to
come

372
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,860
when his wise words are not completely 
ignored,

373
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:48,780
they are heated too late.
God smites is wayward.

374
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:53,781
People dooming them to abject defeat in 
battle and generations of subjugation.

375
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,493
The Hebrews repent at length,
blaming their misfortune on their own 

376
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:00,474
failure to adhere to God's word.
They insist to themselves that they 

377
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,514
could have done better.
They rebuild their state and the cycle 

378
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,820
begins again.
This is life

379
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,423
we build structures to live in.
We build families and states and 

380
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,114
countries.
We abstract the principles upon which 

381
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:24,570
those structures are founded and 
formulate systems of belief.

382
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:30,380
At first we inhabit those structures and
beliefs like Adam and eve in paradise,

383
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,160
but success makes us complacent.
We forget to pay attention.

384
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,360
We take what we have for granted.
We turn a blind eye.

385
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,313
We fail to notice that things are 
changing or that corruption is taking 

386
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,244
root and everything falls apart.
Is that the fault of reality or God or 

387
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,554
to things fall apart?
Because we have not paid sufficient 

388
00:28:55,471 --> 00:28:56,304
attention.
When the hurricane hit New Orleans and 

389
00:28:59,551 --> 00:29:04,230
the town's sank under the waves,
was that a natural disaster?

390
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,670
The Dutch prepare their dykes for the 
worst storm in 10,000 years.

391
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,440
Have New Orleans followed that example?
No tragedy would have occurred.

392
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,083
It's not that no one knew the flood 
control act of 1965 mandated 

393
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:27,600
improvements in the levee system that 
held back lake pontchartrain.

394
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,250
The system was to be completed by 1978 
40 years later,

395
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,333
only 60% of the work had been done.
Willful blindness and corruption took 

396
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:47,440
the city down.
A hurricane is an act of God,

397
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,453
but failure to prepare when the 
necessity for preparation as well known 

398
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,433
that's sin,
that's failure to hit the mark and the 

399
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,274
wages of sin is death.
Romans six 23 the ancient Jews always 

400
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,500
blamed themselves when things fell 
apart.

401
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,483
They are as if God's goodness,
the goodness of reality was axiomatic 

402
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,100
and took responsibility for their own 
failure.

403
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,653
That's insanely responsible,
but the alternative is to judge reality 

404
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:20,844
as insufficient to criticize being 
itself and to sink into resentment and 

405
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:30,330
the desire for revenge.
If you are suffering well,

406
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,610
that's the norm.
People are limited and life is tragic.

407
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,450
If you're suffering is unbearable,
however,

408
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,730
and you were starting to become 
corrupted,

409
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,750
here's something to think about.
Clean up your life.

410
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,740
Consider your circumstances.
Start small.

411
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,870
Have you taken full advantage of the 
opportunities offered to you?

412
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,580
Are you working harder on your career or
even your job?

413
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,820
Or are you letting bitterness and 
resentment hold you back?

414
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,910
Drag you down?
Have you made peace with your brother?

415
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:18,300
Are you treating your spouse and your 
children with dignity and respect?

416
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,230
Do you have habits that are destroying 
your health and wellbeing?

417
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,540
Are you truly shouldering your 
responsibilities?

418
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:32,860
Have you said what you need to say to 
your friends and family members?

419
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,203
Are there things that you could do that 
you know you could do that would make 

420
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,220
things around you better?
Have you cleaned up your life?

421
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,040
If the answer is no,

422
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,470
okay,

423
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,303
here's something to try.
Start to stop doing what you know to be 

424
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:56,860
wrong.
Start stopping today.

425
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,120
Don't waste time questioning how you 
know that what you're doing is wrong.

426
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,073
If you're certain that it is in 
opportune questioning can confuse 

427
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,530
without enlightening as well as 
deflecting you from action.

428
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,293
You can know that something is wrong or 
right without knowing why you're entire 

429
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:17,710
being can tell you something that you 
can neither explain nor articulate.

430
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,900
Every person is too complex to know 
themselves completely and we all contain

431
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,120
wisdom that we cannot comprehend.

432
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,540
So simply stop when you apprehend 
however dimly that you should stop.

433
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,790
Stop acting in that particular 
despicable manner.

434
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,450
Stop saying things that make you weak 
and ashamed.

435
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,300
Say only those things that make you 
strong.

436
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,740
Do only those things that you could 
speak of with honor.

437
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,220
You can use your own standards of 
judgment.

438
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,143
You can rely on yourself for guidance.
You don't have to adhere to some 

439
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:56,834
external arbitrary code of behavior.
Although you should not overlook the 

440
00:33:00,981 --> 00:33:05,330
guidance of your culture.
Life is short and you don't have time to

441
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:06,164
figure out everything on your own.
The wisdom of the past was hard earned 

442
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,993
and you're dead.
Ancestors may have something useful to 

443
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:17,960
tell you.
Don't blame capitalism.

444
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:22,100
The radical left or the inequity of your
enemies.

445
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,350
Don't reorganize the state until you 
have ordered your own experience.

446
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,393
Have some humility.
If you cannot bring peace to your 

447
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:35,980
household,
how dare you try to rule a city.

448
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,153
Let your own soul guide you.
Watch what happens over the days and 

449
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,640
weeks
when you were at work,

450
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,670
you will begin to say what you really 
think.

451
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,800
You will start to tell your wife or your
husband or your children or your parents

452
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,813
what you really want and need.
When you know that you have left 

453
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:02,590
something undone,
you will act to correct the omission.

454
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,820
Your head will start to clear up.
As you stop filling it with lies,

455
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,953
your experience will improve.
As you stopped distorting it within a 

456
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,820
authentic actions,

457
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,523
you will then begin to discover new,
more subtle things that you are doing 

458
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:22,490
wrong.
Stop doing those too.

459
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,930
After some months and years of diligent 
effort,

460
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,780
your life will become simpler and less 
complicated.

461
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,790
Your judgment will improve.
You will untangle your past.

462
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,220
You will become stronger and less 
bitter.

463
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,210
You will move more confidently into the 
future.

464
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,440
You will stop making your life 
unnecessarily difficult.

465
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,340
You will then be left with the 
inevitable bear tragedies of life,

466
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,530
but they will no longer be compounded 
with bitterness and deceit.

467
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,370
Perhaps you will discover that you're 
now less corrupted soul,

468
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,070
much stronger than it might otherwise 
have been,

469
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,083
is now able to bear those remaining 
necessary minimal in escapable 

470
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:16,030
tragedies.
Perhaps you will even learn to encounter

471
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:16,864
them so that they stay tragic,
merely tragic instead of degenerating 

472
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:22,714
into outright hellishness.
Maybe your anxiety and hopelessness and 

473
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:32,611
resentment and anger,
however murderous initially will recede.

474
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,030
Perhaps your uncorrupted soul will then 
see its existence,

475
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,063
a genuine good as something to celebrate
even in the face of your own 

476
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,584
vulnerability.
Perhaps you will become an ever more 

477
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:52,050
powerful force for peace and whatever is
good.

478
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,870
Perhaps you will then see that if all 
people did this in their own lives,

479
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,840
the world might stop being an evil 
place.

480
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,320
Okay.

481
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,450
After that,
with continued effort,

482
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,020
perhaps it could even stop being a 
tragic place.

483
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,773
Who knows what existence might be like 
if we all decided to strive for the 

484
00:36:15,251 --> 00:36:18,460
best?
Who knows what eternal heaven's might be

485
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:22,000
established by our spirits,
purified by truth,

486
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,260
aiming skyward right here on the fallen 
earth.

487
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:32,370
Set your house in perfect order before 
you criticize the world.

488
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,203
Okay.
