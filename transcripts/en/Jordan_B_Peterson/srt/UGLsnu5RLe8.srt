1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,930
Well after all that.
So welcome to psychology to 30

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,930
nice to see you all here.
So what I'm gonna do today,

3
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,093
oh I'm going to start is I'm going to 
give you an overview of the content of 

4
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,144
the course and then I'll give you an 
overview of the plas requirements rate 

5
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:28,150
at the end of,
I think we might as well jump right into

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,020
the content to begin with.
So

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,820
there's a website,
I don't really like blackboard,

8
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,580
so I have my own website.
You can go to Jordan Peterson,

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,930
Jordan B.
Peterson,

10
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:44,340
dark palm,
and underneath there there's a menu that

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,900
lists all the courses and the full 
syllabus is listed there.

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,763
So all the information that you're going
to need about the course can be found 

13
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:54,720
there,
including most of the readings,

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,573
although there was also a textbook,
which I presume a majority of you who 

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,323
have already purchased.
So it also lists the other things that 

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,930
you need to know,
like what days the tests are going to be

17
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:11,640
and what the assignments are.
And I'll go over that anyways at the end

18
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,010
of the class.
So,

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,200
but to begin with,
I'm going to tell you what the course is

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,170
about so you can decide whether you're 
in the right class or not.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,813
So

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,313
okay.

23
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,620
Personality is a somewhat peculiar field
of study in psychology because

24
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,563
it spans a number of sub disciplines 
that aren't particularly well suited to 

25
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:46,040
one another.
So for example,

26
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:46,874
it spans
clinical psychology and experimental 

27
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:54,080
psychology
and it also spans

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,833
and approach that is associated 
fundamentally with single individuals 

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,493
with an approach that analyzes 
individual characteristics in large 

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,313
groups,
which is generally what you have to do 

31
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:11,714
in experimental psychology.
It's also a relatively strange ad 

32
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,014
mixture of philosophy and I would say 
engineering and medicine as well as 

33
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,194
science,
and you might think of medicine as a 

34
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,310
science,
but it's not.

35
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,683
And the reason that it's not as,
because it's concerned with the 

36
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,270
promotion of health and health is not a 
scientific category.

37
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,583
It's a category that can't help but be 
value laden because you have to decide 

38
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,143
what constitutes health health and what 
constitutes illness or what constitutes 

39
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:49,700
wellness and what constitutes pathology.

40
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,863
And there's no way you can do that 
without bringing value judgments into 

41
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:53,894
the equation.
It's particularly true in psychology 

42
00:02:55,761 --> 00:03:00,580
because when you're thinking about what 
a healthy might be,

43
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,510
you generally don't merely think in 
terms of the absence of pathology.

44
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,540
You think in terms of the presence of 
positive traits,

45
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,970
right?
And someone who's fully healthy mentally

46
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,010
and physically.
While the psychologists,

47
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:12,844
especially the humanistic psychologists 
from the 60s might consider someone 

48
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,180
who's truly psychologically healthy,
self actualized,

49
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,014
which would mean in some sense that 
they've been able to develop the 

50
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,170
entirety of their positive potential,
whatever that is.

51
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:32,130
So because of these peculiarities,
personality psychology,

52
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,364
the course of course in personality 
psychology has to be pretty wide 

53
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:36,964
ranging.
And so this course is in fact wide 

54
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,630
ranging.
It,

55
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,320
it,
it uh,

56
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,390
brings in elements of cultural history,
um,

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,493
elements of moral philosophy and then 
elements that I would consider almost 

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,950
completely biological.

59
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,653
And it does that in order to provide you
with a multidimensional view of what it 

60
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,354
means to be a human being.
I have some other principles that I 

61
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:06,790
abide by while I'm teaching this course 
as well.

62
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,624
And one of those is that I don't really 
want to tell you about anything that I 

63
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,530
don't think you will find useful and 
useful.

64
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,980
Like there's a difference between a fact
and a useful fact,

65
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:19,330
right?
There's lots of facts.

66
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,920
You can go on Google and you can drown 
yourself in facts.

67
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:22,754
I'm sure you do that every day.
But a useful fact to me is one that 

68
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,663
transforms the way that you look at the 
world or the way that you act in the 

69
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:34,720
world in some manner that you find 
beneficial.

70
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,633
And so another way of of describing 
useful from that perspective is 

71
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:41,194
relevant.
And so one of the principles I abide by 

72
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,300
is that I don't really want to teach you
anything that isn't relevant.

73
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,913
And my criteria for relevant is first,
is it going to make a difference to you 

74
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,014
personally?
So are the things that you learn 

75
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,370
immediately meaningful to how you 
interact with the world?

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,833
And then the second is,
is there some evidence that the facts 

77
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:02,464
that you're going to be,
that you're going to be presented with 

78
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:05,254
actually have some social utility or 
some political utility or it's an 

79
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,554
economic utility so that the fact that 
you know them makes a difference to the 

80
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:15,460
way that you act in a way that also 
affects the people around you.

81
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,523
And so
it's for those multiple reasons that I 

82
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:26,700
brought together the material that I 
have brought together.

83
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:31,701
Now that means that there's some factors
that you have to take into account

84
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,243
before you take this course.
And there's another personality course 

85
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,430
being given at exactly the same time.
Well,

86
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:42,264
I don't this semester anyways.
And so it may be that that one's more 

87
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:46,860
suitable for you than this one.
I don't know.

88
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,110
But I can tell you what this one's going
to be like.

89
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,560
And so if that isn't what you want or if
that's not what you're interested in,

90
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,510
then you probably shouldn't take this 
course.

91
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,200
So the first issue is that there's a lot
of reading.

92
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,860
There isn't as much reading as there 
used to be in this course.

93
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,330
By the way.
Um,

94
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,790
but there's still a lot of reading and a
lot of that

95
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,363
original source material,
both from the personality theorists 

96
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:15,080
themselves and then also original source
material from empirical papers.

97
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,200
So I would say that not only is there a 
lot of reading,

98
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,910
but the readings actually quite 
difficult.

99
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,483
Um,
I think it's useful given the way I 

100
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,674
already defined utility to you.
And so I believe that reading what I 

101
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,470
present to you is going to be good for 
you,

102
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,860
but if you don't have time to do a lot 
of reading,

103
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,140
then you're going to find this course 
frustrating.

104
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,370
So there's also because of the emphasis 
on clinical theoreticians,

105
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,910
which is a major part of it's 
personality theory,

106
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,420
especially the more classical 
personality theory,

107
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:53,540
which by the way is generally the 
elements of personality theory that most

108
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,300
students are most interested in.
Um,

109
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,900
there's a lot of what I would consider a
philosophical material.

110
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:04,400
And the reason it's philosophical is 
because it's concerned with how a person

111
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,234
should live.
And that's a much different question 

112
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:08,714
than what a person is.
So it's how a person should live or 

113
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:11,834
perhaps how a person might transform 
themselves or act in order to transform 

114
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,990
themselves so that their personality is,
well,

115
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,824
for lack of a better word,
better now you can substitute healthier 

116
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,474
for better,
but in a context like the one we're 

117
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:28,220
discussing,
the difference is trivial really.

118
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,013
So then the last thing that I would 
caution you against is that I don't 

119
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:39,371
lecture from the reading material so 
often.

120
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm not exactly sure even what I'm going
to tell you when I come to class,

121
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,923
I know the material,
but I don't want to stick to a 

122
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,023
prescribed outline.
I want to talk to you about the things 

123
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,580
that I think are important and so with 
luck,

124
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:58,820
that'll make the lectures worth 
attending and worth listening to.

125
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,330
But if you were more inclined from a 
temperamental perspective,

126
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,440
do you want it?
Of course,

127
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,274
where things are laid out in a very 
orderly fashion and they progress in a 

128
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:10,724
linear fashion and it's predictable,
and the lectures reflect the reading 

129
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,250
material,
then this is not a good course for you.

130
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,370
And so I would presume that would be the
case.

131
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,830
If you're orderly.
And by the way,

132
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:25,970
that's one of the subdivisions of the 
big five personality trait model.

133
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,970
And orderly people tend to be 
conscientious,

134
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,270
but they like things cut and dried and 
laid out in a linear fashion.

135
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,400
Um,
I'm not that orderly.

136
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm higher in openness and openness is a
creative,

137
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,113
uh,
dementia.

138
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,553
Um,
and open people tend to use relatively 

139
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,514
loose,
loose associations when they speak and 

140
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,991
to cover a wide amount of territory.
And so some people will like that.

141
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,533
Um,
if you like reading literature for 

142
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:55,310
example,
you probably liked this course.

143
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,630
If you don't,
then you probably won't.

144
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,063
So

145
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,553
anyways,
that's pretty much enough for the 

146
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,320
warnings.
So,

147
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,154
uh,
now I will tell you what we're going to 

148
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,044
talk about it.
One of the things that makes human 

149
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,310
beings unique

150
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,080
has,
is the fact that were self conscious.

151
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,143
Now you'll see ethologists are people 
who study animal behavior do relatively 

152
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:29,950
elementary tests of self consciousness 
on animals.

153
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,590
So one of the most famous demonstrations
of such self consciousness is the mirror

154
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:37,870
test.
And so in the mirror test,

155
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:39,850
what you essentially do is you take an 
animal,

156
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,120
maybe a chimp or maybe a three year old 
child,

157
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,633
um,
and you put a lipstick mark on their 

158
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,074
forehead or on their nose,
and then you show them a reflection of 

159
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,720
themselves in the mirror.
And if they wipe off,

160
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,700
or Jeff,
you're towards the lipstick mark,

161
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,534
then you can make the presumption that 
they understand that it's them that's 

162
00:09:58,841 --> 00:09:59,674
being reflected in the mirror.
Or at least they understand that well 

163
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:07,771
enough so that they can use the mirror 
as a guide to action with their,

164
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,510
with their hand or,
or whatever it is that they happen to be

165
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,580
pointing with.
And the reflection.

166
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,593
Now,
dolphins seemed to be able to manage 

167
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:18,280
that there some members of the core of 
family.

168
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,323
So those are basically crows and ravens.
Those things are really smart and they 

169
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:25,390
seem to possess rudimentary self 
consciousness.

170
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,090
I said dolphins,
Cetaceans and general.

171
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,043
So whales,
although I don't know if all whales are 

172
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,010
self conscious because it's,
for example,

173
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,650
difficult to get a mirror and big enough
to show a blue whale,

174
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,053
um,

175
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,190
human beings,
that's about it.

176
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,923
No,
I don't think that's a very good 

177
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:47,034
definition of self consciousness really 
because the mere fact that you can 

178
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:52,770
recognize yourself and it's also not 
fair to some animals like dogs,

179
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:53,604
right?
Because dog would need a smell and 

180
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,480
mirror really because and most animals 
are very,

181
00:10:57,481 --> 00:11:00,320
very smell predicated.
Most of the brain is,

182
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,773
is structured with the olfactory system 
has its core and like us really because 

183
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,660
our brains are structured with the 
visual system at the core and that makes

184
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:13,710
us rather peculiar but so it's a little 
unfair to animals like dogs are ready to

185
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:17,310
rats that relied primarily on olfaction 
to orient themselves and world.

186
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,144
But the thing is I don't think that's 
really a very good definition of self 

187
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,770
consciousness.
It's very rudimentary.

188
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:23,604
You might say,
well that's the first sort of step to 

189
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:29,370
being self conscious because if you're 
fully self conscious,

190
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,230
I think you need two more things.

191
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,093
You need the capacity to imitate,
which is a much more important capacity 

192
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:38,700
than people generally realize it.
In fact,

193
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:42,630
I would say it's a equivalent 
importance.

194
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,940
It's of equivalent importance to 
language.

195
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,953
In fact,
I'm not even sure that you could use 

196
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:49,380
language if you can't imitate,
first of all,

197
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,260
obviously all the words you used are 
also the words that other people use.

198
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,260
Otherwise you're not going to be very 
comprehensible.

199
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,094
So even the mere fact that you do speak 
means that you're relying on invitation 

200
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,520
to get your point across.
So you need imitation.

201
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,450
And the reason you need the invitation 
is because once you can imitate,

202
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,183
you can use your body as a 
representational structure to represent 

203
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,874
the world and other people.
You can even use your body as a 

204
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:17,770
representational structure to represent 
yourself,

205
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,390
which you might do.
For example,

206
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,000
if you're telling a joke at a dinner 
party and then you,

207
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,183
you know,
act out of self parody and everyone 

208
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,360
laughs.

209
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,780
So,
and then with regards to language,

210
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:29,614
while language obviously enables you to 
build sophisticated models of the world 

211
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:33,604
that are well articulated,
to exchange those with other people and 

212
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,330
to think,
okay,

213
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,164
so in order to be self conscious,
you have to be able to recognize that 

214
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:45,760
you exist in this physical envelope,
at least here and now.

215
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,020
You need to be able to imitate because 
that's partly how you come to understand

216
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,033
yourself and other creatures like you,
which is a very important part of being 

217
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,390
self conscious,
right?

218
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,224
I mean everything I learned about any of
you is also going to help me understand 

219
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:03,100
the sort of creature that I am,
whether that's for good or for evil.

220
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,863
And then with language,
well not only can we articulate our 

221
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:10,300
representations about each other in the 
world,

222
00:13:10,301 --> 00:13:14,530
but we can also store those articulated 
representations over very,

223
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,161
very,
very,

224
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,630
very long spans of time.

225
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,423
And we do that partly in ritual,
which is the acting out of a 

226
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:21,874
representation.
And we do that partly with regards to 

227
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:25,054
stories which are in some sense an 
articulated representation of an acting 

228
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,640
out,
right?

229
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,310
Because you can think of a story as a 
drama.

230
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,970
So drama is behavior representing 
behavior.

231
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,660
And then a story is an articulated 
representation of a drama.

232
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,430
Now we have very old rituals and we have
very,

233
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:50,431
very old stories.
And so part of what we do in this course

234
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,524
is we go back to as close to the 
beginning as we can possibly manage to 

235
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:55,024
start to understand how people have 
understood themselves and represented 

236
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:01,840
themselves across the span of human 
history.

237
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,423
And we're doing that because we want to 
be able to put our current knowledge in 

238
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:10,330
some kind of historical context.
And part of the reason for that is,

239
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,750
well,
one of the things that characterizes the

240
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:17,470
human personality is that it's a 
historical phenomenon.

241
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,023
You know,
I'm sure you've heard in many classes 

242
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,820
that much of what makes up your 
personality is a cultural construct.

243
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,013
Well,
whether or not much of it is or not 

244
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:29,440
isn't really the issue.
Certainly some of it is.

245
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:31,450
And an important part,
you're a cultural creature.

246
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,883
And that means that you have emerged 
within a tradition that's been shaped 

247
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,454
and in any number of ways by an 
extraordinarily lengthy historical past 

248
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,143
or historical and biological.
And so what that means in part is that 

249
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,143
if you don't understand
your history and that's your history as 

250
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,330
it matters,
not necessarily some collection of fats,

251
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,750
then you don't understand yourself.
So,

252
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,050
you know,
human beings in their self conscious for

253
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,200
we don't really know how old we are.
Um,

254
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,373
more or less biologically or genetically
identical creatures to us existed at 

255
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,084
least 150,000 years ago.
But we seem to have discovered fire and 

256
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,100
were able to master it maybe 2 million 
years ago,

257
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,993
you know,
and that required a fair bit of 

258
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:21,530
intelligence.

259
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:24,830
Um,
and there are,

260
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,950
there are artifacts that indicate a 
fairly high level of,

261
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,340
of cultural capacity that are at least 
50,000 years old.

262
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,334
So we can't really say when,
when we got fully self conscious and 

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,873
perhaps we might also say that we're not
even fully self conscious yet because 

264
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,643
you know,
really what the hell do you know about 

265
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:43,370
yourself?
You know,

266
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,420
you're really,
really,

267
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:45,830
really,
really complicated.

268
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,390
And at best you have a partial model of 
who you are and that thing fails all the

269
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,830
time,
which as you can tell,

270
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:52,664
because you're always doing things that 
surprise you and often not in a 

271
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:58,490
particularly positive way.
So there's no end of mystery.

272
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:00,763
Anyways,
the upshot of all of this is that we're 

273
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:04,964
going to establish the context first.
That's a historical context and I want 

274
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:11,144
to do that two ways that the first thing
I want to do is to talk to you about 

275
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,940
mythological representations of 
personality.

276
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,510
And that's more important than you might
think.

277
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,940
In fact,
it's probably more important than you do

278
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,350
think.
Um,

279
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,633
by myth what I mean is the 
representations of human beings in 

280
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,050
extremely long lasting and persistent 
stories.

281
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,723
And so some of those are the stories 
that are found in various religious 

282
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,144
traditions,
but there's oral traditions that 

283
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,900
surround those religious traditions.
You know,

284
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:45,734
it's assuming that their religious 
traditions are written down and there's 

285
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:51,410
fairy tales and that sort of thing and 
standard narratives that,

286
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,370
that people use to guide themselves as 
they move through the world.

287
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,830
And most of the clinical theories that 
we're going to discuss,

288
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,664
so Freud's theory and young's theory and
the theory of the existentialists and 

289
00:17:04,911 --> 00:17:05,744
the phenomenologists in the humanists 
and so forth are variants of those 

290
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:11,600
mythological stories.
Now,

291
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,270
part of the reason for that is that 
neat.

292
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,104
You said once that a philosopher was 
seldom anything other than the 

293
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,120
unconscious advocate of their cultural 
worldview.

294
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,043
So what he meant by that was you already
come to the scene with a set of 

295
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:30,380
presuppositions.
Now,

296
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,210
some of those are embedded in your 
behavior.

297
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,620
So for example,
when you walk,

298
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,020
when you attend a funeral and you know 
how to behave,

299
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,640
he generally,
you're quiet and solemn.

300
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,013
You might not be able to explicate the 
rules that a person should follow at a 

301
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:43,730
funeral,
but you can do it.

302
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,803
Now.
You could perhaps articulate them if 

303
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,770
pressed,
but it's not like you're following those

304
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,310
rules.
When you go to a funeral,

305
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,950
you just know what to do.
If someone pressed you,

306
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:53,784
you could turn it into a list of rules,
but it's really more encoded in your 

307
00:17:57,151 --> 00:18:00,900
actual behavior.
You just automatically know what to do.

308
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:01,950
You can tell,
you know,

309
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,783
when you ever,
you interact with someone who's really 

310
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:04,734
socially fluent,
you can tell that they're not 

311
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:10,560
consciously processing the way that 
they're acting,

312
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,483
otherwise,
they're,

313
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,930
they're self conscious and awkward.

314
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,973
They're just very fluid.
It's automatize behavior and it's coded 

315
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:19,440
right into them.
So if you're a great philosopher,

316
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,274
then according to Nietzsche,
at least what you do is you take a look 

317
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:25,350
at how you act and what you think,
and then you say,

318
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,273
well this is what it's like.
It's not so much that you're inventing 

319
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:32,550
new ideas,
it's that you're articulating the nature

320
00:18:32,551 --> 00:18:35,310
of structures that are already there.
So you can imagine,

321
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:36,144
for example,
imagine that you're particularly 

322
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:41,110
interested in wolves.
And so you wrote,

323
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,060
you studied some wolves and one of the 
things you see is that the wolves have a

324
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,380
dominance hierarchy.
So there's,

325
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,363
there's a leader and then there is 
struggle in the pack to see who's going 

326
00:18:51,211 --> 00:18:52,044
to be the dominant leader.
Now there's a couple of problems with 

327
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,190
that,
which is that,

328
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,773
you know,
if we'll stay and wolf be fight and 

329
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:02,160
they're pretty evenly matched and they 
tear each other to shreds,

330
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,620
then we'll see is going to come in and 
pound both of them.

331
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,760
And that's not a particularly useful 
strategy for welfare,

332
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,873
for Wolf B.
Plus then the pack loses the power of 

333
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:14,550
Wolf and wolf be in.
So that's hardly useful at all.

334
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,683
So what's happened is that wolves have 
evolved dominance and submission 

335
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:19,494
strategies so that they can figure out 
who is going to leave and who is going 

336
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:27,420
to follow without having to engage in 
the kind of physical combat that's going

337
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,254
to result in damage.
And so usually what happens is that the 

338
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:31,974
two wolves face off,
you've probably seen cats do this when 

339
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,850
they encounter each other,
you know,

340
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,713
out on the street,
the first thing they do is sort of 

341
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:41,160
turned sideways and they puff themselves
up and they dance back and forth.

342
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,280
It's quite comical.
But what the is trying to do is look bay

343
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,820
and exposed to try and make the other 
cat nervous enough to leave.

344
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,630
And so what wolves do is roughly the 
same thing they puff out.

345
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:52,464
So they look big and they make all sorts
of ferocious noises and they threaten 

346
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:55,644
each other.
And usually what happens is one wolf 

347
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,570
will lose his nerve,
flopped down,

348
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,860
roll over,
show his throat.

349
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,830
And that basically means something like 
I'm useless and,

350
00:20:04,831 --> 00:20:05,790
and,
and you know,

351
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:09,240
and pathetic and you can tear out my 
throat if you want because of that.

352
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,110
And the other wolf.
Thanks.

353
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,450
Yeah,
you are a pretty useful and pathetic,

354
00:20:12,451 --> 00:20:13,284
but you know,
we're gonna need you to morrow to hunt 

355
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,264
down a deer so you know you can get up 
and protect your miserable self and 

356
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:21,600
that'll be okay.
Now if you were watching that,

357
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:23,530
you might say,
well,

358
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,980
just follow rules,
but of course they don't.

359
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,873
That's just how we'll Zack,
when you describe what the wills are 

360
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,290
doing,
then you turn it into a rule.

361
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,930
But it wasn't a rule to begin with.
It was just a pattern of behavior.

362
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,140
Now human beings are like that were 
chalked full of patterns of behavior and

363
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,020
they're there.
They're the consequences of our biology,

364
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,230
which is something we'll talk about in 
depth in the last half of the course.

365
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,273
And there are a consequence of our 
culture and they're built into our 

366
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:50,650
boardings.
Like every,

367
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,810
every time you interact with another 
person,

368
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,240
they're telling you how to behave right.
Don't be too obtuse.

369
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,660
Try to be a little bit witty,
have something interesting to say.

370
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,510
Don't be too annoying.
If you're going to say something funny,

371
00:21:04,511 --> 00:21:07,600
make sure it's funny.
Take turns while you talk.

372
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,760
Play nicely,
take your turn,

373
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,830
don't eat all the bread,
et Cetera,

374
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:13,210
et cetera.
You know?

375
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:16,840
And so if you don't abide by those 
rules,

376
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,033
then people lift their eyebrow at you or
they don't smile at your jokes are they 

377
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,400
don't look at you or they roll their 
eyes when you come in,

378
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,470
which is really not a good sign by the 
way.

379
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,383
And you get punished severely for it.
And then if you do act like they would 

380
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:33,280
like you to act,
you know,

381
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,610
then people smile at you and there they 
invite you to their place for dinner.

382
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,444
And you know,
maybe you have an intimate relationship 

383
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:39,724
and some people that like you.
And so we're exchanging information 

384
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:43,264
about how we should manifest ourselves 
in our bodies with every possible 

385
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:48,094
interaction.
And what that means is that shapes the 

386
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,330
way that we are.
Now.

387
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,353
The problem is,
or partly is that you don't really 

388
00:21:53,891 --> 00:21:57,220
understand the consequences of that.
Like you,

389
00:21:57,221 --> 00:22:00,150
you can act it out more or less 
depending on your social skill and,

390
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,320
and the degree to which you've been 
exposed to other people.

391
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,333
But that doesn't mean you're a conscious
that you have that you can consciously 

392
00:22:06,461 --> 00:22:08,800
articulate all the rules that underlie 
that.

393
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,260
And if you think that maybe you can,
well fine.

394
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,040
You know,
imagine a well behaved four year old,

395
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,353
you know by four you've got a lot of the
social rules down because by four you 

396
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,260
can play with others if you're ever 
going to be able to,

397
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,930
you can already do it by the time you're
four.

398
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:26,883
If you can't,
by the time you're four you are in 

399
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:29,644
serious trouble because other kids won't
play with you and then they won't teach 

400
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:32,914
you how to act.
And then you stay immature and isolated 

401
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,764
and you know,
off in your little corner dejected and 

402
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,660
bitter for the rest of your life.
Now you know,

403
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,690
you might think that's a little rough,
but it's not.

404
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:45,670
That's what the,
that's what the data indicate.

405
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,800
So,
so anyways,

406
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,593
what this means in part is,
well we've been shaping how all of us 

407
00:22:55,211 --> 00:23:00,211
behave as long as we've been social.
Now you might say,

408
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,170
well,
how long have we been social?

409
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,340
Well,
crustaceans are social.

410
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,863
So lobsters for example,
organize themselves into dominance 

411
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:14,920
hierarchies and they modify each other's
behavior.

412
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,563
And that's 400 million years.
So we've been social and living in 

413
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:21,334
groups since our ancestors
departed on the evolutionary timescale 

414
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,840
from the ancestors of lobsters.
So that's very,

415
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:33,010
very,
very long time.

416
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,920
There weren't any trees around back 
then.

417
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,863
So social life is older than trees,
so you can be sure that you're adapted 

418
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:46,100
to it in a major way.
So it's built into your biology.

419
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,860
But then there's the historical element 
of it too.

420
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,270
And it's quite,

421
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,150
we're quite flexible from a cultural 
perspective.

422
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:55,440
So there,
there's an example,

423
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,800
this guy named Robert Sapolsky who,
who I really like,

424
00:23:58,801 --> 00:24:02,760
he's a great scientist.
He went off to Africa to study baboons.

425
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,900
Baboons are not pleasant.
Generally speaking,

426
00:24:06,901 --> 00:24:08,910
there may fight a lot.
They're bullies.

427
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,010
They bite,
they can really bite at bamboo and like,

428
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,140
uh,
uh,

429
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,210
a predatory cat will think twice about 
taking on I baboons.

430
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,283
They've got major teeth and their,
their temperament is not particularly 

431
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,424
positive.
So polsky went and studied a group of 

432
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,500
baboons and they were engaged in typical
baboon,

433
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,600
gang behavior,
harassing each other.

434
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:28,434
All the time and bullying each other.
And they're all stressed out because 

435
00:24:30,181 --> 00:24:33,150
it's the Polsky knew that because he 
measured their levels of stress and,

436
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:33,984
and testosterone and so forth.
And so it was pretty miserable baboons 

437
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,820
existence.
But then what happened was that

438
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,620
the baboons went to feed somewhere that 
I don't remember,

439
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:44,454
and they,
a lot of them contracted tuberculosis 

440
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,010
and it turned out that almost all the 
hyper aggressive male,

441
00:24:50,011 --> 00:24:54,270
it's got tuberculosis and died and all 
that was left was the Beta males roughly

442
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:55,104
speaking.
And then the whole book bundle and 

443
00:24:56,181 --> 00:24:57,014
culture transformed so that it became 
much more agreeable in much more 

444
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:00,234
cooperative.
And then when aggressive baboons would 

445
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:03,960
move into that territory,
you know,

446
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,950
singly or their own,
then they'd get all placid and calm too.

447
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,473
So it's interesting gate because 
obviously baboons aren't social to the 

448
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:13,224
degree that we are,
but it does indicate that even at the 

449
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,060
advanced primate level,
you know,

450
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:20,100
their brains are pretty big,
but not as big as ours.

451
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:24,840
That cultural transmission of behavior 
expectation can be quite powerful and it

452
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:28,800
can transform quite rapidly.
So anyways,

453
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:31,110
we've been shaping each other's behavior
for a very,

454
00:25:31,111 --> 00:25:31,801
very,
very,

455
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:36,060
very long time and a lot of that in 
encoded deeply in biology,

456
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,610
Andean culture.

457
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,370
Now biologically,
when we'll talk about this a lot,

458
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:42,204
when we get to the biological section,
one of the ways that you can know how 

459
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:46,194
social you are is by noting how hurt and
ashamed you get if you make a serious 

460
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:52,250
social error.
You know?

461
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,510
So if you're at a party and you make a 
fool of yourself,

462
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,700
you know,
depending on your level of neuroticism,

463
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:57,534
which is also a big five trade,
that index is how sensitive you are to 

464
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:03,150
negative emotion.
You might obsess about what an idiot you

465
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:06,420
are for the next three or four months or
maybe even for the next five years.

466
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,470
You know,
people do not like social exclusion.

467
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,233
You know when you have a little counter 
that's more or less built into the back 

468
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:18,810
of your brain that roughly first of all 
estimates how successful you are.

469
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,050
There's an estimation that actually 
seems to occur right at birth,

470
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,020
where when part of your neuroticism 
levels are set,

471
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,410
and then that can be modified to some 
degree by learning.

472
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,273
You know,
and if you're a talk baboons while 

473
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:32,934
you're going to experience less negative
emotion and more satisfaction than you 

474
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,910
are if you're a bottom baboons.
And it's exactly the same with people.

475
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,463
So you know,
we liked to be climbing up dominance 

476
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:43,584
hierarchies,
we like to be near the top of dominance 

477
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:45,764
hierarchies.
And if the little counter out the back 

478
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:47,724
of your brain notices that you know 
you're doing a good job of climbing 

479
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:52,590
towards the top of irrelevant dominance 
hierarchy,

480
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,663
then it's going to produce more 
serotonin and you're not going to be as 

481
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,200
in as much pain,
you're not going to be as depressed,

482
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,034
you're not going to be as anxious,
you're not going to be stressed and so 

483
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,010
forth.
So,

484
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,503
so there's a biological basis for our 
social being and it's extraordinarily 

485
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:09,780
important to us how we fit into social 
groups.

486
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:10,853
Okay.
So we've also been trying to figure out 

487
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,233
what the hell we are,
who we are for thousands and thousands 

488
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:19,440
of years.

489
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,770
Partly as a consequence of imitation,
you know,

490
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,370
cause I can act you out and that'll sort
of help me understand what you're like.

491
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,870
And partly as a consequence of 
articulated communication,

492
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:30,704
Lord of that storytelling.
Now people have been telling stories 

493
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:35,580
for,
we have no idea how long.

494
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,760
I mean if you go and visit peoples that 
have no written language and who've been

495
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:42,594
isolated from the rest of human society 
for say tens of thousands of years and 

496
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,960
such people still exist,
you find that they tell stories,

497
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,760
they dance,
they act each other out,

498
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:54,600
you know?
So we know certainly that the propensity

499
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:55,434
to tell stories and to engage in ritual 
behavior is far older than our ability 

500
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,754
to write.
I suspect you could push it back at 

501
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,310
least 50,000 years.
Although I suspect it's a lot older than

502
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:06,144
that.
And so what's happened is that across 

503
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:09,744
those sorts of timescales,
we've started to tell stories about one 

504
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,500
another that represent how we act.

505
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,030
And then you might think,
well,

506
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,940
some of those stories are interesting 
and memorable and some of them aren't.

507
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:21,774
And then we tend to remember the 
interesting and memorable ones and pass 

508
00:28:24,571 --> 00:28:28,440
them on.
And so you can also imagine human beings

509
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,333
aggregating together in groups of 
thousands and thousands of people over 

510
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:34,883
thousands and thousands of years telling
their stories to one another and 

511
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,644
hammering those stories into some sort 
of mutually acceptable and 

512
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:44,070
comprehensible for.
And so for example,

513
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,460
one example of that is that if you look 
at the creation stories,

514
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,760
the creation story that say occurs in 
Genesis in the Old Testament,

515
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,863
it's a member of a class of creation 
stories that characterized Middle 

516
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:56,783
Eastern mythology.
And it seems to have arisen out of the 

517
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,483
Organization of separate Middle Eastern 
tribes thousands and thousands of years 

518
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,453
ago,
each with their own traditions into a 

519
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:11,541
relatively homogenous story that 
characterized a large group of people,

520
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:12,804
central beliefs.
So we have information about how we act 

521
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:23,340
from the representations that we've made
of those actions that we passed forward.

522
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,240
And a lot of those take the form of 
myths,

523
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,720
religious stories.
And so part of what we're going to do is

524
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:35,721
we're going to begin the course with two
foundation establishing themes.

525
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,370
One has to do with the structure of 
mythological representations,

526
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:43,983
and the second has to do with a set of 
rituals and processes and beliefs that 

527
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,834
have been identified more or less 
worldwide that have to do with shamonic 

528
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:55,960
transformation.
Now,

529
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,200
the title of this course is personality 
and its transformations.

530
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:03,100
And the reason it's titled that way is 
because you aren't just who you are.

531
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay?

532
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,830
You're also something that changes all 
the time.

533
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:08,810
You're more like a river then like a 
rock,

534
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,850
you're constantly transforming.

535
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,640
Yeah.

536
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,730
Physicist Erwin Schrodinger thought that
people were dissipative structures.

537
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,803
It's a very interesting idea.
So a dissipative structure is a 

538
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:26,790
structure that maintains its structural 
integrity while its elements transformed

539
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:28,900
completely.
So you know,

540
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:31,960
when you let the water out of the sake,
you get a whirlpool,

541
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,063
right?
And the whirlpool is a fairly stable 

542
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,890
entity,
but the water that the whirlpool is made

543
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:37,180
of,
it's constantly changing.

544
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,190
That's a dissipative structure.
Well,

545
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,950
that's what you're like.
You maintain your form across time,

546
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:44,170
but your elements are constantly 
transforming.

547
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,500
And people are very,
very transformative creatures.

548
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,760
You know,
we can,

549
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,003
okay.

550
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,730
Unlike animals really because animals 
are sort of what they are and that's it.

551
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:57,190
I mean they have some capacity learned 
but not very much.

552
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,490
Your typical beaver is acting more like 
more or less today.

553
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:01,840
Like you know,
his great,

554
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:02,471
great,
great,

555
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:05,020
great grandfather was acting 5,000 years
ago.

556
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,410
There's no real accretion of culture.
Whereas with human beings we transformed

557
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:12,514
like Mac.
I mean we do that culturally things 

558
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:17,260
aren't much.
There's so many things for example,

559
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:20,080
that are different now than there were 
20 years ago that it's almost impossible

560
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:20,914
to manage it.
And then so we transform on a cultural 

561
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:25,270
scale quite rapidly.
But we also do that individually.

562
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,210
I mean you guys have all just made the 
transition to university.

563
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,940
Just roughly speaking,
you know,

564
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:34,690
I'm sure that your,
like you were in some ways when you were

565
00:31:34,691 --> 00:31:35,524
in high school,
but well hopefully you're better than 

566
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:39,460
you were in high school a whole bunch of
ways as well.

567
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:40,623
You shouldn't be more mature,
but your personality may have 

568
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:44,230
transformed substantially.
You know?

569
00:31:44,231 --> 00:31:45,064
And with any luck,
you're not done with your sequences of 

570
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:48,574
transformations,
you know that's going to be something 

571
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:51,634
that characterizes you for the rest of 
your life in so far as you're a dynamic 

572
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:56,230
person,
your eyes are open,

573
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,720
you pay attention,
you and you can learn.

574
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,063
And so one of the things you might say 
is that the most stable thing there is 

575
00:32:03,311 --> 00:32:06,070
about the human personality is its 
capacity to transform.

576
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,590
And that's really something that's worth
knowing.

577
00:32:08,591 --> 00:32:10,930
You know,
because one of the things I can tell you

578
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:11,764
about the great myths of mankind,
there's lots of them and they have 

579
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:15,304
different themes.
But one of the most powerful themes is 

580
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,960
the way you get yourself out of trouble 
is to transform your personality.

581
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,680
Now you think you kind of do that every 
time you learn something,

582
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,010
right?

583
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,700
Because you learn something in your 
little different than you were before,

584
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,563
hopefully different in a significant way
and hopefully different in a way that 

585
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:36,970
helps you solve some problems that you 
couldn't solve before.

586
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,600
So you could say one of the late motifs 
of being human is,

587
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,880
well,
if I were encountering an obstacle I can

588
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:47,270
just transform it and I can figure out 
some way of getting around it and that's

589
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,100
something that makes us quite 
remarkable.

590
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,493
No one,
one of the things that I could suggest 

591
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,144
to you,
and I think this is one of the largest 

592
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,134
ideas that exist,
especially communicable in this short a 

593
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:02,084
time,
is that it's much better to identify 

594
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:05,174
with your capacity to transform then it 
is to identify with who you are now and 

595
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:12,290
that can get you out of an awful lot of 
trouble.

596
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,230
I mean one of the things that 
characterizes the logs for example,

597
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,064
or people who are trapped in fixed 
belief systems is that they worship who 

598
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:23,540
they are now and that'd be all fine if 
everything was going 100% for them,

599
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:24,740
but it's seldom the case.

600
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,460
And so unless your life is perfect and 
that seems highly improbable,

601
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,940
maybe if you were someone else it would 
be better.

602
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:33,883
And you know that's all you've got.
And some sense because changing the 

603
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,770
world in some way that's going to make 
you feel better about it.

604
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:40,761
Well,
you know,

605
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,470
you might be able to do that in some 
small way,

606
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:43,304
but the probability that you could or 
should try to do that on large scale is 

607
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,480
it's pretty low.
So,

608
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,780
so in the mythological representation 
section,

609
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,680
I'm going to talk to you about the 
fundamental elements of narrative.

610
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,650
And the reason that I think that that's 
necessary is because there's,

611
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,513
there's sort of two things that you have
to consider when you're talking about 

612
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:07,844
people.
And one is objectively what is a person 

613
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,364
light?
They'll same way you might think about 

614
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:16,760
what Iraq is like or maybe even what a 
rock is like.

615
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,523
So that's a,
so that's a scientific question in some 

616
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,224
sense.
But then there's another question which 

617
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,370
is,
or maybe two questions,

618
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,760
how do people act and how should they 
act?

619
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,060
And maybe the first one is a scientific 
question,

620
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:32,894
but the second one certainly isn't.
And the way that we explore how people 

621
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:38,354
do act and how they should act has a lot
more with to do with narrative then it 

622
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,010
has to do with science.
And you know,

623
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:45,260
you know this,
oh you have to do is think about it.

624
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,940
You know,
you think about where do you get most of

625
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:47,774
your information about what people are 
like when you're not actually just the 

626
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:51,704
interacting with some people.
And the answer to that is quite 

627
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:55,850
straightforward.
You read novels,

628
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,160
he read literature,
you go see movies,

629
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,000
you watch a game of thrones,
you binge on game of thrones,

630
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:03,980
you know,
you go watch star wars.

631
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,293
You know,
maybe you line up for three days if 

632
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:08,750
you're completely insane to go see star 
wars,

633
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,310
you know?
And you might ask,

634
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:13,130
well what in the world are you doing?
Well,

635
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,383
people are hungry for information about 
how people do act and how they should 

636
00:35:17,871 --> 00:35:18,704
act.
And we're absolutely compelled by 

637
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:22,964
narratives and there's reason for that.
Well and you kind of know what a 

638
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,970
narrative is and one isn't right,
go to a movie and you think,

639
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,543
ah,
the character development is pretty 

640
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,460
good.
But um,

641
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,940
you know,
as a story it was terrible.

642
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,770
And then maybe you talk with your 
friends about why it a terrible story.

643
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,320
But the funny thing is you kind of know,
right?

644
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,110
It's like some things are stories and 
some things aren't.

645
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,153
And laying out what actually makes 
something a story that's very difficult 

646
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,800
but you still know it and you can come 
to some consensus even,

647
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,070
you know,
if you look on I mdb or rotten tomatoes,

648
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,203
you know,
people form large group consensus about 

649
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,793
what constitutes an acceptable narrative
pretty damn quickly and there seems to 

650
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,540
be at least a certain amount of 
agreement,

651
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,910
you know,
barring individual differences.

652
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,283
So
the mythological and the shamonic 

653
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:20,330
discussions that were going to undertake
have a couple of purposes.

654
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,263
One is to provide you with the 
foundations of a language that you can 

655
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:30,180
use to understand narrative.
And that's going to prove very,

656
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:31,014
very useful because most of the clinical
theories that we're going to talk about 

657
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,293
are really narrative based and once you 
understand their mythological 

658
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:40,824
substructure so to speak,
it gives you a framework within which 

659
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:45,810
you can slot the theories.
You know,

660
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:46,644
because one of the things that's 
complicated about personality theory is 

661
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:52,470
that there are a lot of personality 
theories and you might think,

662
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:55,590
well how the hell can that be?
Because if it's a theory,

663
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,543
theoretically there could only be one.
Like there's only one theory of 

664
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,830
relativity rough,
roughly speaking,

665
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:05,280
it's a little fuzzy around the edges,
but people agree on the core elements.

666
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,030
Well with personality theory there's,
there's many,

667
00:37:09,031 --> 00:37:13,350
many different personality theories and 
so then you might think,

668
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,720
well how are you supposed to make any 
sense out of that?

669
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,733
Well there's two ways.
One is to put all of them into a more 

670
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:20,124
fundamental underlying structure and 
that's something that I'm really going 

671
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,860
to strive to have you guys do while 
you're taking this course.

672
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,843
And the other is to actually adopt a 
slightly different set of 

673
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,560
presuppositions about personality 
theories.

674
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,330
And so you could say,
well,

675
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,110
there's only one theory of relativity.
But then you might say,

676
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,000
well yeah,
there's only one theory of relativity,

677
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,834
but then consider a toolbox.
So maybe some of you are relatively 

678
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:45,144
handy and you have a toolbox.
What's in the toolbox hammers or a 

679
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:52,020
hammer saws,
ranches,

680
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,730
pliers,
vice grips,

681
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,530
et cetera.
You know,

682
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,780
when you might say,
well,

683
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,270
there tools,
why do you need all those tools?

684
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,740
And the answer is,
well,

685
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,574
you can hammer a nail in with a ranch,
but it'd be a lot better if you could 

686
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,860
use a hammer and you can probably bang a
bolt off with a hammer.

687
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,780
But it would be a lot better if you had 
a ranch.

688
00:38:12,781 --> 00:38:14,190
And so then you might think,
well,

689
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,390
if you're trying to do something 
complicated and sophisticated,

690
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,673
why not have a bunch of tools?
Now we don't generally think of 

691
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:27,030
scientific theories as tools,
although that is what they are.

692
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:29,130
Above all else,
there are tools.

693
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,773
And then when we're dealing with 
something as complicated as a human 

694
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,301
being,
while you know,

695
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:36,130
we may need more than one tool to get to
the bottom of it.

696
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,173
And it's also the case,
you know that to say understand a human 

697
00:38:40,481 --> 00:38:42,610
being.
Well that's a complicated thing.

698
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,444
It's cause he might say,
well I understand to what end you don't 

699
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,600
mean comprehensive universal on 
omniscient and understanding.

700
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:54,760
Obviously you mean I want to know x 
about someone because I have some desire

701
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,010
in relationship to my interactions with 
them.

702
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,670
And so there's all sorts of tools that 
can facilitate that.

703
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,713
So what I would say is that you know,
Freud to microscope and human is a 

704
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,530
telescope.
That's one way of thinking about it.

705
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:09,364
I mean there's no particular reason I 
associated either of those with those 

706
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,774
two tools.
But the point is is that if you pay 

707
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:18,010
careful attention to personality 
theories,

708
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,383
they can expand your capacity to 
represent yourself in ways that's 

709
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,374
extremely useful because you know,
you should understand who you are and 

710
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:28,204
why and what implications that has for 
you because you're a transformable 

711
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:34,024
creature,
but you also have a fairly stable 

712
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,880
underlying substructure,
right?

713
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:41,881
Otherwise you just melt like an octopus.
So you're this weird dynamic combination

714
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:47,140
of relatively permanent structure and 
then embedded capacity to transform.

715
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:48,123
You have a nature.
And so understanding your nature is 

716
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,224
extraordinarily youth worthwhile.
And so hopefully what we're going to do 

717
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,883
during this course is give you a whole 
bunch of tools to understand yourself 

718
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:02,370
and other people with tools that will 
really be useful,

719
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:03,204
things you can use day to day to 
understand yourselves and your families 

720
00:40:06,091 --> 00:40:06,924
and so on,
and to improve your future with any 

721
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:11,550
luck.
And then also cover

722
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,813
the elements of you that are stable,
most of which I would say have been 

723
00:40:17,011 --> 00:40:17,844
discovered,
at least in the more objective sense by 

724
00:40:20,581 --> 00:40:21,414
biological psychologists.
So mostly animal research is peculiarly 

725
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,100
enough.
Okay,

726
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:26,934
so mythological representations,
we're going to take a trip back through 

727
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:31,014
time.
We're going to look at archaic and 

728
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,180
ancient stories of mankind told by 
members of our species to each other.

729
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,540
And I'm going to concentrate on stories 
that have lasted.

730
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,643
We don't know how long,
you know we have stories that in the 

731
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:51,000
written form or 4,000 years old,
but all the evidence suggests that those

732
00:40:51,001 --> 00:40:54,660
stories are based on traditions that go 
back far,

733
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,494
far beyond that,
at least 50,000 years and maybe way 

734
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:01,104
before that.
So it will take a look at those and 

735
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:05,810
that'll give us a foundation that we can
use to build on.

736
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,653
And then we're going to look at shamonic
rituals and descriptions to get some 

737
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:13,350
sense of the archetype of 
transformation,

738
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:14,940
which sort of means,
well,

739
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,953
what is it that you have to undergo when
you're changing and what are you likely 

740
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:23,430
to experience when that happens?
Now I can give you a bit of a preview.

741
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,673
It's not always the case.
Maybe it's seldom the case that if 

742
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:32,720
you'll learn something important that 
it's,

743
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,190
you know,
this happens to people all the time.

744
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,050
So maybe,
I dunno,

745
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,380
maybe you had a recent relationship that
went seriously sour and you know,

746
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:45,380
maybe it was because you were going out 
with a jerk or maybe it's because you're

747
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:46,214
just not very sophisticated and no doubt
you're trying to figure out which of 

748
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,080
those happens to be true.
Well,

749
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:51,740
you're,
you know,

750
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:52,573
considering the relationship.
But generally what happens to people 

751
00:41:55,731 --> 00:41:56,564
when they're moving towards something 
and the bottom falls out because 

752
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:04,520
something occurs that they didn't 
understand and couldn't predict maybe in

753
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:05,354
their own behavior.
Maybe you had an affair while you were 

754
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,680
in your relationship and you didn't 
expect that.

755
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:10,723
Well,
what happens is that your current model 

756
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,720
of yourself and perhaps even of the 
world is demonstrated as insufficient,

757
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,940
not rattles you up badly.

758
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,110
And then you're rattled up for some good
length of time,

759
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,240
not very motivated,
somewhat depressed,

760
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:28,580
fairly anxious.
You sort of fell apart.

761
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,360
You don't know which way is up.
And then maybe if you're lucky you think

762
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:35,270
about it and talk about it and put 
yourself back together.

763
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,313
And when you come out the other side,
you're a little smarter and a little 

764
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:40,130
more together,
then you work to begin with.

765
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,040
Now if you're unlucky,
you just stay in the little pit for

766
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,460
people can stay in the little pit for a 
very,

767
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:49,280
very long time.
And that's not so good.

768
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:49,941
And so,
you know,

769
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:50,774
the process of transformation is 
actually quite dangerous because it 

770
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:57,620
doesn't necessarily have to be completed
in a successful manner,

771
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,490
but it does have a pattern.
And the pattern usually is you think you

772
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:02,324
know what you're doing and then 
something happens to demonstrate that 

773
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,490
you actually don't know what you're 
doing.

774
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,713
And that puts you in a spin.
And then through careful analysis and 

775
00:43:12,441 --> 00:43:13,274
support and discussion and other 
processes that we don't really 

776
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:16,934
understand very well,
you come to incorporate the anomalous 

777
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:20,834
knowledge that knocked you on your back.
You reconstruct your personality and 

778
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:30,170
your representations of the world,
and then you move ahead,

779
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,350
hopefully more than you were before.
But it's an interesting thing to know.

780
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:36,944
You know,
one of the things nick just said again 

781
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,074
was that you could,
you could tell the character of a human 

782
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:43,580
being by how much truth there willing to
tolerate.

783
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,013
Now that's an interesting phrase because
you generally think of people because 

784
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:49,334
they're optimistic.
They generally think of truth as 

785
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:53,240
something positive.
Obviously it's better to know the truth.

786
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:57,260
It's like no if you pulled the wool over
your eyes as a general rule,

787
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,810
learning the truth is not a pleasant 
experience.

788
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:03,320
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's 
not something you should do.

789
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,700
But the idea that the path to 
enlightenment is blissful,

790
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,720
uh,
that's not a very smart idea.

791
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,730
In fact,
it's quite the opposite.

792
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,660
So the Shamana rituals basically 
manifest that's in an architectural way.

793
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:23,240
So one of the things you see happening 
with the typical,

794
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:24,470
the Sharman,
by the way,

795
00:44:24,471 --> 00:44:25,304
shamanism is a worldwide phenomenon.
It seems to be associated with a 

796
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,820
primordial or archaic psychology of 
transformation.

797
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:33,654
It's often drug Aden and generally what 
happens is that a shamonic 

798
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:39,144
transformation is accompanied by a 
descent into something approximating 

799
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,753
psychological death and then a 
rebuilding and a rebirth that puts the 

800
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:49,014
person out on the other side.
It's like an initiation ritual and 

801
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:52,824
that's another way of thinking about it.
Or you might think about it as the 

802
00:44:55,201 --> 00:44:56,034
depression that possessed you have 
during your first semester of 

803
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:59,850
university,
which either

804
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:02,400
okay,

805
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,233
do you out of the university altogether 
because that happens to a lot of people 

806
00:45:05,841 --> 00:45:09,150
are which you recovered from and finally
became a university student.

807
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:12,000
Although perhaps that wasn't a 
particularly pleasant transition.

808
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,313
You know,
we've done some testing with u of t 

809
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:15,684
students and it's interesting to note 
that about a third of you meet criteria 

810
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,270
for clinical depression your first year 
here.

811
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,793
Now,
what that indicates to me is that the 

812
00:45:23,701 --> 00:45:26,970
criteria for clinical depression are a 
little on the sensitive side,

813
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:29,130
but,
but regardless,

814
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,260
because if a third of people meet the 
criteria,

815
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:33,060
thank yeah,
well that's a little sensitive,

816
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,070
but by the same token,
you know,

817
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,840
it's not an easy adjustment and the old 
you has to die.

818
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,350
And generally that's not very pleasant.
So,

819
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:44,923
and it's a good way to think about the 
impediments to learn it because you'll 

820
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:50,130
hardly ever learned something without 
having part of you dies first.

821
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,503
And that's part of the reason that 
people are rather resistant to learning 

822
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:55,410
anything new.
That's important.

823
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,691
Okay,
well,

824
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:59,280
so you've got that.
Now after that we're going to talk about

825
00:45:59,281 --> 00:46:03,930
piaget and piaget isn't necessarily 
known as a personality psychologist,

826
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:10,000
but that's okay.
Piaget published a v,

827
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,893
he was a developmental psychologist,
maybe the greatest developmental 

828
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:13,684
psychologist.

829
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,270
He published a very large number of,
of books,

830
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,490
many of which haven't even been 
translated yet,

831
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,350
some of which haven't even been 
published yet.

832
00:46:22,351 --> 00:46:25,290
So Piaget thought a lot of things about 
a lot of things.

833
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,770
And he's generally known for his stage 
theory of development.

834
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:31,020
But he really wasn't all that into that 
stage theory.

835
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,660
It just seemed to be the part of his 
theory that

836
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,053
I would say rather dimwitted western 
intellectuals could grasp onto most 

837
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:39,744
easily.
And so that's generally what you hear 

838
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:42,720
about.
But Piaget was a very,

839
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:46,590
very sophisticated thinker and one of 
the things he was interested in was,

840
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,380
well he was interested in how the child 
in some sense boots itself up.

841
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,230
That's a reasonable way of thinking 
about it.

842
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,710
Cause you know when you turn on a 
computer,

843
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,920
what happens is a certain number of 
primitive functions,

844
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,250
primitive fundamental functions come 
online first.

845
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:06,540
And then those functions enable more 
complex functions to emerge.

846
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,374
And then Noah's functions may enable 
more complex functions to emerge and 

847
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,600
soon they're,
your computer is waiting for you.

848
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,333
And human beings are kind of like that.
So when we're first born were very 

849
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:22,770
primitive when we're first born were 
very immature.

850
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,910
That's a better way of thinking about 
it.

851
00:47:23,911 --> 00:47:24,744
We're not precisely primitive.
We still have very large brains and 

852
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,620
they're more connections in those brains
at birth.

853
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:31,870
And there are any that there will be for
the rest of your life,

854
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,183
which is quite interesting.
You actually dye into your personality 

855
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,550
because what happens isn't so much that 
you make new connections,

856
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:40,384
it's that a whole bunch of the ones you 
already have that you don't use 

857
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:45,790
disappeared.
So that's pretty peculiar anyways.

858
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,433
When you first born,
there's not a lot to you in terms of 

859
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,060
capacity to engage with the world.

860
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,060
Your mouth is pretty wired up,
your lips and your tongue,

861
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,953
which is a good thing because you have 
to breastfeed and that's actually not 

862
00:47:58,331 --> 00:47:59,164
very simple.
You have to have a clue to do that and 

863
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:04,900
it's the first complex social 
interaction you're likely to engage in.

864
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:05,943
So you,
you're born with a fair bit of a 

865
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:11,740
priority,
sophisticated wiring already in place,

866
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,690
but the rest of you,
man,

867
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,840
it's not there much at all.
You can't control your arms.

868
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:18,670
You know,
if you watch a baby in a crib,

869
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,220
a young baby and it's not swaddled up,
you know,

870
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,054
their arm sort of float around in space 
and so to their legs and now and then 

871
00:48:24,761 --> 00:48:25,594
they might hit themselves and January,
that seems to come as quite a shock to 

872
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:32,020
the baby.
It's not it's peripheral nervous system.

873
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,990
The peripheral elements of its central 
nervous system are not well developed at

874
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:38,650
birth.

875
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,340
And so it's almost as if the baby has to
discover its limbs.

876
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,760
It sort of expands from the middle 
outwards.

877
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:45,603
It has to discover its limbs and then 
start to figure out what to do with 

878
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:50,374
them.
And so what piaget attempted to do was 

879
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:57,601
to lay out the processes by which a 
child unfolded into the world.

880
00:48:58,750 --> 00:48:59,583
Now some,
there's a biological basis to that 

881
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:05,971
because you come into the world at birth
with a set of reflexes at hand,

882
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:10,120
and those reflexes are enough to get you
started.

883
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,973
And so piaget it,
here's one way of trying to understand 

884
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:16,900
piaget.
I like it quite a bit.

885
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,120
It's a bit of an oversimplification,
but it'll do,

886
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,973
there's lots of different ways of 
thinking about what the world is made 

887
00:49:22,871 --> 00:49:24,010
up.
Now.

888
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,330
You know,
if you're a classically,

889
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,480
if you're a classical scientist,
you tend to think that the world is made

890
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:29,710
out of matter,
you know,

891
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:30,544
and then matter is made out of atoms and
atoms are made out of God only knows 

892
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,530
what atoms are made out of,
right?

893
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:36,363
Because by the time you get under Adams,
you just have no idea what's going on 

894
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:41,020
down there.
But you know,

895
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:41,913
we generally don't think about that too 
much and we sort of assume newtonian 

896
00:49:45,401 --> 00:49:48,790
reality and that everything is made out 
of hard little particles like dust.

897
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:52,330
And that's the scientific model.
But there's other ways of looking at the

898
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,164
world that are not only equally valid,
but equally necessary and equally 

899
00:49:58,811 --> 00:49:59,644
powerful.
And one of them is that you can look at 

900
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:04,510
the world as a matrix of information,
you know?

901
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:08,140
And so information generally has 
significance and meaning,

902
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:11,530
or at least in so far as information is 
conceptualized by human beings.

903
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:12,364
And so for example,
if you're two years old and you're 

904
00:50:15,371 --> 00:50:16,204
crawling around on the floor and the dog
has a bone and you grab it and the dog 

905
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:21,040
nips you,
that's informative.

906
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,523
And so what piaget claims is that 
children come into the world with an 

907
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:32,981
information seeking structure and then 
as they interact with the world,

908
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,240
phenomena emerge that they can model 
with their bodies.

909
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,890
So for example,
if I'm going to drink this,

910
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,670
then I'd have to model it with my hand 
before I can do so.

911
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,470
And so it turns out,
for example,

912
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:50,180
that wouldn't,
if this thing sitting here,

913
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,660
especially if I'm thirsty and I look at 
it,

914
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,110
my eyes tell my hands to get ready to 
grab it.

915
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,960
And so when you say you understand 
something,

916
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,563
what you mean is that at least part of 
what you mean is that when you perceive 

917
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,540
it,
it maps itself onto your body.

918
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,140
And so this happens at pretty low levels
of your nervous system.

919
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:14,510
So for example,
there are people who are blind.

920
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,500
They say they're blind,
they can't see anything.

921
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,593
But if you move your hands up like this 
and you asked them to guess which hand 

922
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:24,373
you're lifting,
they can do it with almost a hundred 

923
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,750
percent accuracy and you think,
well how the hell can that possibly be?

924
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,583
They were blind.
Well the reason that happens is because 

925
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,920
your eyes are detecting patterns in the 
world.

926
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,930
Some of those patterns you perceive as 
conscious reality,

927
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,333
but other patterns you just mapped right
onto your spine or or onto your 

928
00:51:46,071 --> 00:51:46,904
emotional system doesn't,
you don't need the perception of the 

929
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:52,010
object in order to have that activated.
Cause you know,

930
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:53,840
you probably think there's the world,
you see it,

931
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:55,940
you think about it,
you evaluate it and then you act.

932
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:56,803
It's like that isn't how it works.
It's very seldomly how it works part 

933
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,220
because it's just too damn slow.
You know?

934
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,190
If you had to think about everything,
you'd be running over pedestrians,

935
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,430
no Onstar,
right.

936
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,200
You have to be able to react very,
very quickly.

937
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:10,034
And part of the way you do that is by 
having your sensory systems map right 

938
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:16,850
onto your motor output systems.
So,

939
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,090
so piaget,
well

940
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:26,763
for Pha,
part of the way that the personality 

941
00:52:28,451 --> 00:52:29,284
emerges out of the,
out of the doldrums of infancy is that 

942
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:32,254
the child encounters the world and 
incorporates the information that they 

943
00:52:36,851 --> 00:52:39,460
gather as a consequence of bumping up 
against it.

944
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,230
And then they build themselves in some 
sense from their bodies and the ability,

945
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,720
the abilities that they're practicing 
with their bodies,

946
00:52:46,721 --> 00:52:47,554
like the gripping mechanism and the 
pointing mechanism and does scratching 

947
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:51,970
mechanism and all those things that they
can build.

948
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,230
They build those up to the point where 
they can start to use abstractions.

949
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:00,910
And so the baby sort of spirals out of 
nowhere using it's exploratory capacity,

950
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:04,750
absorbing information from the world and
creates its personality that way.

951
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,540
It's a lovely marvel and we'll cover 
that in some detail.

952
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,390
The depths,
psychologists,

953
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,990
I concentrate primarily on young and 
Freud.

954
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:16,420
And you know,
if you take a personality course,

955
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:17,433
generally you'll,
you'll be introduced to Freud first and 

956
00:53:20,291 --> 00:53:21,490
then you'll be introduced to young.

957
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,323
And maybe I've learned some of the Neil 
Friday ideas more or less as after 

958
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:26,830
thoughts to Freud,
but I,

959
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,660
I don't really think that's appropriate.
First of all,

960
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,540
I think you can make a strong case that 
ewm was,

961
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:38,933
that the utility of [inaudible] theory 
is particularly evident when you're 

962
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:47,370
talking about radical similarities 
between people.

963
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,650
So young was very biologically oriented 
in some ways.

964
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:53,543
He was way ahead of biological 
psychiatrists and psychologists because 

965
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,760
when young was beginning to formulate 
his theories in the west,

966
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,350
in,
in North America anyways,

967
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:05,203
in the United States,
most of the people who were studying 

968
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:09,444
human beings where behaviorists and 
behavior is basically presumed that you 

969
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:12,594
are a blank slate at birth and that you 
learned how to do everything that you 

970
00:54:16,501 --> 00:54:18,330
know how to do.
Well,

971
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,560
that's not true at all.
Um,

972
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:26,100
first of all,
you can't learn everything that you know

973
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:26,934
how to do because you have to know 
something to start the whole process 

974
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:29,370
off.

975
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,390
And second,
you know,

976
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,250
you don't have to learn really to 
understand what a dog's grown means.

977
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,503
You know,
it's kind of wired into you and you 

978
00:54:37,861 --> 00:54:40,080
already don't have to learn to be afraid
of the dark man.

979
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,630
You've got that down by the time you 
were about three,

980
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:44,970
you know?
So there's lots of things that are built

981
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:48,120
right into people and and what exactly 
that means we are not sure about,

982
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,780
I mean it does look,
for example like snake phobia is,

983
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,093
is innate.
And even if the actual phobia isn't an 

984
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,960
eight and it probably is,
you can learn to be phobic of snakes and

985
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,794
no time flat.
Whereas like trying to become phobic of 

986
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,250
pistols is very,
very difficult.

987
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,620
Now young was very interested in the,
I think what the best way to think about

988
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,880
it is the substrata of human cognition.
You know,

989
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,440
because human beings are a particular 
type of thing.

990
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,273
It's not like our,
our souls are disconnected from our 

991
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:22,761
bodies and that our knowledge is somehow
appropriate or,

992
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,560
or universal in some way that would make
sense if we didn't have bodies.

993
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,790
We're not like that at all.
We're in our bodies,

994
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,730
our brains are adapted to our bodies,
our minds are adapted to our bodies.

995
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:37,564
It's so as our knowledge.
And that means that our cognitive 

996
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:41,994
abilities are theories of the world have
biological substructures and those are 

997
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,850
presuppositions in some sense for our 
dollars that we don't have to learn.

998
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:52,381
So,
for example,

999
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:54,570
you don't really have to learn that 
being punched hers.

1000
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,800
You just discover that you don't really 
have to learn what a smile means.

1001
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,930
You don't really have to learn what 
anger means,

1002
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,400
you know,
you'll experience it.

1003
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,530
So it's right in you.
It's you,

1004
00:56:04,531 --> 00:56:06,300
aren't you like little kids,
little babies.

1005
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:08,550
When they're crying,
they're often angry.

1006
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,413
So for example,
by nine months of age or baby can more 

1007
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:14,640
or less
identify its mother.

1008
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,190
So someone walks into the baby's room 
and it takes a look at the baby and it's

1009
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,024
not the baby's mother.
And the baby starts crying and you 

1010
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:23,500
think,
oh baby.

1011
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,400
It's like,
fair enough.

1012
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,000
That baby is not sad.
That baby is angry.

1013
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,240
And you can tell if you look at the baby
because it's turning all red.

1014
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,850
And that's what people do when they cry,
when they're angry.

1015
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:37,120
And so it's a good thing to know when 
you're arguing with someone and they get

1016
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:38,830
upset,
maybe they start to cry.

1017
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,120
You think,
Whoa,

1018
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,130
the poor person.
But then if you look,

1019
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,310
you'll see that they're all red and that
means they'd like to strangle you,

1020
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,390
but they're,
you know,

1021
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:49,120
they're social niceties is hopefully 
preventing them.

1022
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,343
So that can certainly change your 
attitude towards whether or not you 

1023
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:54,580
should be feeling sorry for them when 
you hurt their feelings.

1024
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,843
So,
so there's all sorts of things that are 

1025
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:01,210
universal about human beings and what 
human was very,

1026
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:02,044
very interested in what those universals
are and how they played out in patterns 

1027
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:08,350
of behavior.
So you can imagine,

1028
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,450
you can imagine that you have an 
instinct,

1029
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,920
say like anger and thinking about that 
way,

1030
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,140
it's like a cross section that person's 
angry,

1031
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,333
you know?
And you can imagine the facial 

1032
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:20,280
configuration that would go along with 
that.

1033
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,710
But in a more sophisticated way,
if you want it to represent anger,

1034
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:27,950
maybe you've represented like a drama,
like a story you know began.

1035
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,160
That's actually what you want to know.
If someone gets angry,

1036
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:33,580
what happened?
Well,

1037
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:35,283
imagine that you took a thousand stories
about angry people and you boiled them 

1038
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:43,150
all into one story.
So that everything that was common about

1039
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:46,660
all the stories about anger when it 
capsulated in a single story,

1040
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,273
well that would be the architectural 
story of anger and everyone would 

1041
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:51,874
recognize it because it's like anger 
represented like a movie in some sense 

1042
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,110
in its purest form.

1043
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:57,423
Well that's an archetype and that's the 
sort of thing that human was 

1044
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:02,260
extraordinarily interested in 
understanding and document.

1045
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,453
And it's a tremendous amount of fun.
So one of the things we'll do is I'm 

1046
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:08,230
going to show you some movies,
probably the lion king,

1047
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,064
at least parts of it.
And I'm going to show you how the 

1048
00:58:11,051 --> 00:58:14,650
archetypal structure manifest itself.
And that's really worth knowing.

1049
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,753
It's kind of a pain because then from 
now on you go to movies and you'll 

1050
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,490
think,
oh well no,

1051
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,970
that's that architectural structure and 
that's what that symbol means and you'll

1052
00:58:21,971 --> 00:58:26,680
really be annoying to your friends.
But it's very entertaining and it's very

1053
00:58:26,681 --> 00:58:27,514
illuminating.
And partly because what's really cool 

1054
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:33,070
about these archetypal story structures 
is that not only they do,

1055
00:58:33,071 --> 00:58:33,904
they tell you who you are,
but they tell you in some sense who you 

1056
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:36,814
should be.
Now that's cool because one of the 

1057
00:58:38,651 --> 00:58:39,484
things that modern people have a real 
problem with is trying to understand 

1058
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,110
whether or not life has any meaning.

1059
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:46,630
You know,
we look at the world from the scientific

1060
00:58:46,631 --> 00:58:48,070
perspective and we say,
well,

1061
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:49,960
it appears that all of this is,
you know,

1062
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,033
without meaning,
it doesn't mean anything in any cosmic 

1063
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:53,530
sense.
It's,

1064
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,190
it's a pretty dope,
dopey conclusion as far as I'm concerned

1065
00:58:57,191 --> 00:58:58,024
because the originators of the 
scientific method excluded subjective 

1066
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:05,290
meaning from the doctrine and at the 
outset.

1067
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,401
So,
you know,

1068
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:08,320
if you look at the world scientifically 
and you say,

1069
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:09,850
well,
it's without subjective meaning,

1070
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:10,331
it's like,
well,

1071
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:11,164
yeah,
obviously because science was set up so 

1072
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:16,660
that all of the subjected meeting would 
be stripped away from the phenomenon.

1073
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,741
So,
you know,

1074
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:20,080
it's not something to be really shocked 
about afterwards.

1075
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:23,120
And it also doesn't mean that there's no
such thing as subjective.

1076
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:23,954
Meaning it just means that it's very 
difficult to get a grip on it from a 

1077
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:27,374
purely scientific perspective.
And one of the lovely things about 

1078
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,524
architectural stories is they tell you 
in a way that's universally believable 

1079
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,453
who you are.

1080
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,100
And,
and that's very cool.

1081
00:59:40,101 --> 00:59:40,934
And you know,
because you think you could learn this 

1082
00:59:42,021 --> 00:59:44,330
in university too,
and it just tears me up.

1083
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,164
You know,
you learn implicitly or explicitly and 

1084
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:50,990
almost all of the fields of study that 
you're going to undertake,

1085
00:59:50,991 --> 00:59:51,824
especially on the humanities.
And that moral gravity is relative and 

1086
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:56,234
that there's no ultimate meaning,
which is a really rotten thing to be 

1087
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,100
teaching people of your age,
you know,

1088
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:04,060
because you're,
you're too damn young to be nihilistic.

1089
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:04,903
You know,
you can be nihilistic when you're 85 

1090
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,770
you're all done by them.
But to be nihilistic now that's a bloody

1091
01:00:09,771 --> 01:00:11,360
catastrophe.
You know?

1092
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:16,100
And it's completely pointless because 
the notion of the notion that things are

1093
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:20,090
meaningless in some ultimate sense,
it's a,

1094
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,050
it's an extraordinarily primitive 
philosophical theory.

1095
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:28,400
And it does not serve people well.
It makes them sick.

1096
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:29,803
And so one of the things that you might 
consider that is that if you're stupid 

1097
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:35,510
theory makes you sick,
maybe there's something wrong with it.

1098
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,720
It might be a criteria for the utility 
or perhaps even the truth of the theory,

1099
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:42,853
you know,
it depends on how you think about these 

1100
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:45,861
things.
You know,

1101
01:00:45,861 --> 01:00:46,880
you might say,
well,

1102
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,760
if a truth makes you sick,
that doesn't mean it's any less than the

1103
01:00:49,761 --> 01:00:50,990
truth.
Well maybe,

1104
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,480
maybe it really does mean that it's 
much,

1105
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:54,314
much less of a truth.
It depends to some degree on what you 

1106
01:00:56,811 --> 01:00:59,330
mean by truth.
So anyways,

1107
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:00,320
Young's very,
very,

1108
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:02,180
very,
very useful for that.

1109
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,120
He's a terrifying thinker really.
Like

1110
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:07,663
I read when I was about 23 or 24 I spent
two years and I read pretty much 

1111
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:12,254
everything.
You wrote about 23 volumes and it just 

1112
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:18,440
blew me into bits.
I had no idea what the hell was going on

1113
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:21,110
in my dreams changed really.
It was really,

1114
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:22,423
really rough.
I was reading each at the same time and 

1115
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:24,944
he's just about as bad,
like Nicha Sedi philosophize with a 

1116
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:29,150
hammer,
you know?

1117
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,983
And that's great.
Unless he's taking a hammer to your 

1118
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:34,250
skull and that's not nearly so pleasant.
So you know,

1119
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:35,084
young,
he's,

1120
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,280
he's a completely different sort of 
creature.

1121
01:01:37,281 --> 01:01:38,114
And I think that's part of the reason 
you never really learned about them in 

1122
01:01:39,681 --> 01:01:41,360
university.
You know,

1123
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,313
if you don't understand and he looks 
weird and if you do understand them a 

1124
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:45,224
little bit,
he's terrifying and you're bloody well 

1125
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:47,930
going to stop.
You'll thank God.

1126
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:49,131
No,
that's okay.

1127
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:50,870
I don't,
I don't really need to know that.

1128
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,560
So
Freud,

1129
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:58,190
Freud tonight,
nice whipping boy for a psychologist's,

1130
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,733
um,
which I also think is pretty pathetic 

1131
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:03,380
because it's in gray,
ungrateful could begin with,

1132
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:04,214
you know,
Freud was really the person who 

1133
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:08,000
formalized the idea of the unconscious,
you know,

1134
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:11,360
now everyone takes that for granted that
there's a cognitive unconscious.

1135
01:02:11,361 --> 01:02:14,000
That's what the psychologist discovered 
in what the 1980s.

1136
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,280
There's a cognitive unconscious.
It's like,

1137
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,480
yeah,
good work guys.

1138
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:20,670
They'd figured that out back in 1910.
You know,

1139
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:25,020
but you don't see credit being given to 
Freud for making that sort of discovery.

1140
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:27,330
If you look at experimental psychology,
which I think,

1141
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,190
like I said,
I think that's really ungrateful.

1142
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:31,323
Freud's a strange guy and you know,
you can take issue with especially the 

1143
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:39,000
details of his theory.
And I don't like the eatable complex for

1144
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:40,260
example,
or penis envy,

1145
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,094
those sorts of things.
It's like it all in some ways they seem 

1146
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:48,360
laughably anachronistic,
but you know,

1147
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,573
sometimes someone can be wrong in the 
details and right in the overall 

1148
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:54,690
conception,
you know,

1149
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:56,460
because theories are multilayered 
things,

1150
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:58,650
right?
So sometimes I read a student essay,

1151
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,910
you know,
and uh,

1152
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,890
the pear,
the sentences are just awful.

1153
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:02,724
This person like on God only knows where
they learn to write probably in a high 

1154
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:08,530
school somewhere and you know,
it's,

1155
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:12,000
it's incomprehensible.
But if you read the whole thing,

1156
01:03:12,010 --> 01:03:12,570
you think,
man,

1157
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,110
there's an idea in here,
you know,

1158
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,410
the person is smarter than their ability
to write.

1159
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,270
And so then you can write,
you can say,

1160
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,800
look,
you can't write worth a damn.

1161
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:20,634
But you know,
you're pretty smart and you've got some 

1162
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,424
ideas here that if you could articulate,
might be a really high quality so you 

1163
01:03:27,091 --> 01:03:29,430
can be wrong in the details and right in
the overall picture.

1164
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:33,510
And Freud was like that all the time.
And Freud is also unbeatable.

1165
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,723
Wow.

1166
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:42,510
In relationship to familial pathology.
So from Freud's perspective,

1167
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,393
okay,

1168
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,063
a fundamental task of the emerging human
being was to extricate themselves from 

1169
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:55,590
their family.
Now you might think,

1170
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,030
well,
why is that such a problem?

1171
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,560
Well,
here's a couple of reasons.

1172
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,710
First,
your parents take care of you.

1173
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:04,140
So it was like maybe you don't want to 
dispense with that too early,

1174
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:07,230
especially if they really,
really take care of you.

1175
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,620
And that's the double situation from the
Friday of perspective.

1176
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:11,454
It's like the atypical situation arises 
when you have a parent or two parents 

1177
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:20,610
who do so much for you that you're no 
longer able to do anything for yourself.

1178
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,170
And that is not a good situation.
It's extraordinarily pathological.

1179
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:29,610
And there is nobody like Freud who lays 
out the details of that pathology.

1180
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:31,770
And we're going to watch your movie 
crumb.

1181
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,320
It's called,
which is very disturbing movie,

1182
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:35,154
which I suppose is a trigger warning for
those of you who think you need trigger 

1183
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:38,240
warnings.

1184
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,360
Um,
it's a very,

1185
01:04:39,361 --> 01:04:40,194
very distressing documentary,
but it will show you freddy and 

1186
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:43,344
psychopathology that like,
you've never seen it unless you happen 

1187
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:49,590
to live in a thoroughly eatable family.
All right,

1188
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:53,310
so look,
I didn't get through the whole outline.

1189
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:54,383
I'll tell you very briefly what you're 
going to be required to do and then 

1190
01:04:56,461 --> 01:04:58,950
we'll continue this,
that in the next lecture.

1191
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,000
So there's three exams,
two midterms and a final.

1192
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,310
They're multiple choice.
Okay.

1193
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:06,144
I'll post some of the questions before 
the exam so that you know what you're 

1194
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:09,174
getting into.
I don't think they're particularly 

1195
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,930
difficult.
Some of you will beg to differ.

1196
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,153
Um,
there's pressure on us this year to 

1197
01:05:15,301 --> 01:05:16,940
curve the grade,
so beware.

1198
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,430
I may have to do that.
Okay.

1199
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:19,780
Just in,
you need to know that,

1200
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,880
um,
you have to write an essay,

1201
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,030
750 words.
That's not a very long essay,

1202
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:26,710
but that makes it actually more 
difficult.

1203
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,550
The signup for the topics,
for the essay or on the website,

1204
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,393
you can just go there and sign up.
There's 20 different topics and there's 

1205
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:36,184
15 slots for each topic.
So I would recommend that you do that 

1206
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,140
quite quickly.
You have to do a personality,

1207
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:44,440
self analysis,
7.5% of your grade.

1208
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:48,400
The link to that is online too.
You can get started on that whenever you

1209
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:49,780
want.
Um,

1210
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,320
your ta,
one of them,

1211
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:55,650
that's Christine brophy.
She's over there in the corner

1212
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,320
patiently waiting for me to introduce 
her.

1213
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:03,250
She has office hours there.
They're posted online.

1214
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:05,520
You can sign up for her office hours all
in line.

1215
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:08,350
You can also sign up for my office hours
online.

1216
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:10,060
So,
well,

1217
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,630
that's halfway through what the course 
is going to be about.

1218
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,520
So we'll see you on Thursday.
