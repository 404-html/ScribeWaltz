00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,193
Earlier today,
Conrad Black wrote an article in 

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,420
Canada's National Post and the article 
was called Jordan Peterson speaks,

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:17,040
for those of us who refused to follow 
the great liberal deathwish.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,983
Now,
for those of you who don't know who 

5
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:20,964
conrad black is,
I'll read you a little bit from his 

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,540
wikipedia profile.
Conrad Moffat.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,550
Black Baron black of cross harbor was 
born on the 25th of August,

8
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,530
1944.
He's a Canadian born British,

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,590
former newspaper publisher and author.
He's a non affiliated life peer,

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,423
black controlled Holland,
your international once the world's 

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,860
third largest English language newspaper
Empire,

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,590
which published the Daily Telegraph in 
the UK,

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,723
the Chicago Sun Times in the US and the 
Jerusalem Post Israel as well as in the 

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,473
National Post,
the newspaper that he published this 

15
00:00:58,261 --> 00:01:02,160
article in in Canada and hundreds of 
community newspapers in North America.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,510
I'd like to start this by thinking
lord black for his support.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,270
But I would also like to point out that 
despite his supportive stance,

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,040
um,
there are things that are important that

19
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,940
he didn't get right.

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,760
And I think it's reasonable to draw 
people's attention to them.

21
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,594
So the first thing I'm going to do is 
just read what he wrote and then I'm 

22
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:24,984
going to comment on it a little bit
and I'm going to do so in a manner that 

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,323
I hope does indicate that I do 
appreciate his support and I'm not 

24
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,990
trying to be,
um,

25
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
pr frivolously critical in any sense.
And then I want to read a response that 

26
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,263
a lawyer has prepared as well,
just so that you understand all of you 

27
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,220
who are listening understand this a 
little bit more clearly.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,583
Conrad Black Rights.
I have just endured the sobering 

29
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:56,280
experience of watching the always very 
intelligent and professional Steve Pakan

30
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,353
chair a panel about the transgender 
controversy that centers on University 

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,950
of Toronto.
Professor Dr Jordan Peterson.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,900
That was the.
I had an appearance on TV,

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,960
was the agenda with Steve Pakan a couple
of weeks ago where the Pronoun issue was

34
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,573
discussed.

35
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,453
Lack states.
I had vaguely followed the story as it 

36
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:16,074
percolated up in the press,
much of the fraud things in which must 

37
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,303
usually be taken lightly.
It was I fear a piercing glimpse into 

38
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:25,710
what great and venerable statesmen of my
youth,

39
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:28,500
such as Winston Churchill,
Dwight Eisenhower,

40
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,490
Harry Truman and Louis St Laurent called
days that I shall not see.

41
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,803
I did not until now grasp the fine 
balance between gratitude and 

42
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:38,970
wistfulness in their invocation of that 
phrase,

43
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:41,640
as a young person,
I thought at the license of the great to

44
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,474
engage in Histrionics and I now claim it
as the right of lesser yet aging people 

45
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,524
such as myself,
black states for those who have sagely 

46
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:53,430
duct or otherwise being spared exposure 
to this controversy.

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,653
Dr Peterson rejects the right of his 
students to require him to address them 

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,493
if they are trans people,
I eat in some state of flux between the 

49
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,520
male and female polls of gender 
identification,

50
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,310
not their orientation,
whether they are homosexual,

51
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,750
heterosexual,
bisexual,

52
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:09,250
or asexual,
has nothing to do with it.

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,863
Otherwise then in a way that concerns 
them to the cluster confines of being 

54
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,520
male or female.
No.

55
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,473
See,
this is one of the things that's 

56
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,840
interesting about,
about Mr. blocks

57
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,563
call them.

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,970
He obviously considers this issue of 
sufficient importance to address it,

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,300
but there's an that he can't eliminate 
completely from his mind the supposition

60
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,160
that this is absurd,
but it is observed in many ways,

61
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:41,140
but here's the mistake.
Just because something is absurd,

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,153
it doesn't mean it was trivial and I 
think this is where Mr Black makes an 

63
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:46,430
error in his column.
Yes,

64
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:47,264
it's absurd.
That's why he says that people have 

65
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:50,804
sagely ducted or otherwise being spared 
exposure to it because it's been a 

66
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:57,560
ridiculous controversy and I think.
I think there's no question about that.

67
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,770
It's surreal.
I found the whole thing was surreal,

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,233
but you know,
back in the 19 thirties when the Nazis 

69
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,540
first made their appearance on the 
scene,

70
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:06,374
everyone thought they were observed to 
and and concluded that that meant that 

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,920
they were trivial and they were not 
trivial despite their absurdity,

72
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,380
and this is not trivial despite its 
absurdity.

73
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,243
In fact its absurdity.
I think in some sense points precisely 

74
00:04:19,011 --> 00:04:24,011
to the fact that it is anything but 
trivial because something that is on the

75
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:29,600
surface of it so absurd is being made so
much is being made of it.

76
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,570
It's been classified if refuse,
we'll use pronouns,

77
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,404
for example,
is being classified as a hate crime 

78
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,440
that's not trivial,
although it is observed

79
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,243
now

80
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,413
z for he and or she and Zack are in 
place of his or him are the sticking 

81
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:46,094
points,
but what is accumulating behind these 

82
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:49,910
imbecilic distinctions is quite 
sinister.

83
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,943
The tape,
Steve Pake and ran up Dr Peterson being 

84
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:56,480
reviled and shouted down and physically 
intimidated at the University of Toronto

85
00:04:56,481 --> 00:04:57,314
was distressing and we may be on the 
edge of a defining moment in our jolie 

86
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,214
and progressive Canadian civilization.
Dr Peterson sees it as a matter of 

87
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,544
freedom of expression and believes that 
others do not have the authority to 

88
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:11,600
require him to address them in a newly 
hatched vocabulary devise to oppress the

89
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,793
gender binary conventional practice.
While his opponents profess to believe 

90
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,670
that in refusing to do so,
he is committing a hate crime punishable

91
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:21,710
by human rights commissions or 
tribunals.

92
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,650
These hurry headed monsters and black is
referring to the human rights tribunals,

93
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,693
who's agregious tryst trespasses on 
freedom of expression in the name of 

94
00:05:31,251 --> 00:05:31,760
despotic.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,690
Political correctness has been heroic.
They didn't successfully contested by my

96
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,524
friends Mark Stein and as relevant and 
others does not prescribe imprisonment 

97
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,460
under the articles invoked by Dr. 
Peterson says assailant,

98
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,510
but if fine is possible,
yes,

99
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,344
and we might also point out that it's a 
very large fine that is possible in New 

100
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:50,930
York state,
for example,

101
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:51,764
failure to use the requisite pronouns 
brings with it a maximum fine of 

102
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:59,261
$250,000 in case Conrad goes on to say 
as if to assure the least possibility of

103
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,564
a quiet end to this preposterous issue,
Dr Peterson has declared that he will 

104
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,284
not pay a fine and if in prison for not 
paying it would embark on a hunger 

105
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:09,860
strike.
Now,

106
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
this is another place where black 
confuses absurdity with triviality.

107
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,824
He believes that my response to this is 
an overreaction and that's part of my 

108
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,930
refusal to bring this preposterous issue
to a quiet end.

109
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,690
He's suggesting that I'm exaggerating 
and that as a consequence,

110
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:34,634
he's implying that I'm at least in part,
responsible for blowing up something 

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,273
that's merely observed into something.
I'm blowing up the importance of 

112
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,700
something that's merely observed
anyways.

113
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:47,301
He says,
well,

114
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,134
my sympathies are with Dr Peterson.
This is an unjustified hypothetical 

115
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,254
escalation.
So remember that he says this is an 

116
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:55,910
unjustified hypothetical escalation if 
it came to that,

117
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,343
the authorities would attach his bank 
account or his income in to collect the 

118
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,224
fine and Batman or rather than 
imprisoning him and provoking a hunger 

119
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,410
strike.
Yes.

120
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:05,180
Well,
we'll see about that.

121
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,014
Okay.
So the first thing that I want to tell 

122
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,960
you,
listeners is,

123
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,363
here's,
here's the powers of the social justice 

124
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:12,554
tribunals.
I pulled this from their own statement 

125
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:16,880
about their power.
So this is one point six.

126
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,380
This is section one,
point six,

127
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,890
powers of the social justice tribunals 
in irrelevant,

128
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,133
um,
Ontario legislative document one point 

129
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:26,864
six.

130
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,520
You have to listen to this very 
carefully.

131
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,810
The tribunal will determine how a matter
will be dealt with.

132
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,033
That's a matter brought before them,
say a matter of discrimination or 

133
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:36,554
harassment defined by their policies,
their appalling policies and may use 

134
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:46,070
procedures other than traditional 
adjudicative or adversarial procedures.

135
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,900
Okay,
so I'm going to repeat that.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,273
The tribunal will determine how a matter
will be dealt with and may use 

137
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,060
procedures other than traditional 
adjudicative or adversarial procedures.

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
Okay,
that's one point.

139
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,760
Six,
one point seven.

140
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,780
In order to provide for the fair just 
and expeditious resolution of any matter

141
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:07,040
before it.
The tribunal may a limit the evidence or

142
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:07,874
submissions on any issue so you can 
consider that for a while and I'm going 

143
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:16,190
to skip to w take any other action that 
the tribunal determines is appropriate.

144
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,390
Now you,
you've got that they've actually written

145
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,224
a clause into the policy documents that 
describe their powers that states that 

146
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,760
they can take any other action they 
determine as appropriate.

147
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,280
Well then I would say that's gone beyond
absurd.

148
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,490
Um,
or I would say that's still observed,

149
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:35,324
but it's by no means trivial and my 
sense that this is extraordinarily 

150
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,344
dangerous legislation is correct.
Whereas dark Mr Block's insistence that 

151
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:44,354
I'm exaggerating,
the seriousness of the situation is 

152
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,810
incorrect.
Here's three point one,

153
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,663
three from the same document where a 
party has been notified of a fair 

154
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,493
hearing and fails to attend.
Tribunal may take any other action it 

155
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,664
considers appropriate.
So that's a duplication of the previous 

156
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,200
statement,
roughly speaking with,

157
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,570
um,
where the human rights tribunal takes to

158
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,910
itself the power to do whatever it wants
fundamentally.

159
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,070
Now,
here's some other things to consider.

160
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,083
Notice that these tribunals,
including the Ontario human rights 

161
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,540
tribunals,
there's eight different tribunals.

162
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,030
They're called social justice tribunals.
Now,

163
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,240
that's not an accident.
Consider what that means.

164
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,883
The term social justice is a code for 
political correctness and equity 

165
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,660
oriented political philosophy.

166
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,703
People know that this is why the radical
left activists are parodied as social 

167
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:36,414
justice warriors.
Now the social justice tribunals 

168
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:39,894
operating in Ontario or quasi judicial 
instantiations of the politically 

169
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,704
correct authoritarian creed,
and they're designed by their designers 

170
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,290
to operate outside of the normal 
parameters of the law.

171
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,760
This is why they attribute to themselves
the powers to use quote procedures other

172
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,490
than traditional adjudicative or 
adversarial procedures.

173
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,443
Think about that.
It means that the standard British 

174
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,174
common law approach to the issues 
brought before the tribunal can be 

175
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,300
suspended.
Now,

176
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,980
why would they do that?
Well,

177
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,293
it's rooted in politically correct,
the underlying politically correct 

178
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:12,960
Marxist and postmodernist philosophy.
You can consider it this way.

179
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,670
If the fundamental presupposition is 
that the,

180
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,653
uh,
that,

181
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,513
that,
that Canadian civilization as well as 

182
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,630
Western civilization in general is a 
corrupt patriarchy.

183
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,703
Then what's the problem with suspending 
it's rules of procedure when you're 

184
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:29,394
pursuing a justice the tire than 
anything that's a represented inside 

185
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,474
that tradition?

186
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,460
Well,
that's exactly what they've written into

187
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:36,294
the,
into the laws attributing to themselves 

188
00:10:38,911 --> 00:10:39,744
power so you can see,
you can think for yourself and decide 

189
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,820
just exactly how dangerous that is.
Now,

190
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,433
back to black Dr Peterson's approach is 
so inflexible and so entirely righteous 

191
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,450
without much using the powerful weapon 
of ridicule that is available to him.

192
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,940
He may not have tracked the full range 
of support.

193
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:00,774
The virtue of his arguments and his 
personal courage deserve so funny 

194
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:03,894
sentence because I can't tell exactly
the terminology that my approach is so 

195
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:13,320
inflexible that I may not attract the 
full range of support.

196
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:15,690
The virtue of my arguments,
my personal courage deserve.

197
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,913
Um,
I don't really think that I'm being 

198
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,834
reflected in flexible.
I'm merely refusing to use the language 

199
00:11:23,611 --> 00:11:28,320
that's made up by politically correct 
radical left wing authoritarians.

200
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,870
And that's not inflexible.
It's reasonable.

201
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,520
Why would I use that language?

202
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,353
I don't agree with the philosophy.
I think the principles upon which it's 

203
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,970
predicated are not only factually 
incorrect,

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,833
scientifically incorrect,
but malevolently motivated and 

205
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:46,110
extraordinarily dangerous.
That doesn't make me inflexible,

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,953
and so the terminology there is wrong.
It makes me committed to not using that 

207
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:57,250
language,
but on the substance of the issue.

208
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,290
Lack continues.
He is of course correct.

209
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,600
We must always be wary of the majority 
Darien tyranny,

210
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,700
which has preoccupied mini civil 
libertarians,

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
including the principal authors of the 
constitution of the United States,

212
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,430
especially James Madison and Alexander 
Hamilton,

213
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,593
who agreed on little else about the 
transgender community is less than one 

214
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:14,614
percent of the population,
as I've written many times in many 

215
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,010
contexts,
over many tiers rights do not exist only

216
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,844
for the numerous and a litmus test of 
legitimacy of a society is it's 

217
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:27,610
observance of the rights of minorities,
including especially minorities.

218
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,444
Have one.
The jurisprudence of all great 

219
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,340
democratic nations is replete with 
famous cases to this effect.

220
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,680
Captain Dreyfus,
Dr Samuel Mudd,

221
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
who was prosecuted for treating the 
assassin of Abraham Lincoln.

222
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,663
Though there was no evidence that he was
involved in the plot and even the 

223
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,830
British Archer Shia fair made famous in 
the drama,

224
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,783
the winslow boy,
the Peterson affairs threatening to 

225
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:48,754
cross the double white line.
All people must be treated with respect 

226
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,360
equally,
but there are only two genders to sexist

227
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,880
are species and all other mammals are 
gender binary.

228
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,410
While I would like to point out to Mr 
Block that that's now illegal under bill

229
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,273
[inaudible] and its associated sister 
legislation and that might be observed 

230
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,560
as I mentioned before,
but it's not trivial idiocy written into

231
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:15,880
the law unfolds into the idiocy of 
enforcement and obedience and that's not

232
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,720
trivial and as we will soon find out,
lot continues.

233
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,613
All people may state their sex and if 
that is contrary to physical 

234
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:24,670
appearances,
that remains the right,

235
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,893
but no individual or group has the right
to invent a new vocabulary and a new 

236
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:29,983
cool co equal gender because of a state 
of ambivalence or confusion about which 

237
00:13:33,341 --> 00:13:34,174
sex they are.

238
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,320
Yes,
Mr Black,

239
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:37,990
they do have that right and that's 
precisely what bill see.

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,500
16 instantiates and it's already written
into the human rights codes,

241
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,760
human rights codes of the majority of 
Canadian provinces.

242
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,840
It's also,
uh,

243
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,300
it's also an act of hate speech to 
dispute it.

244
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,030
So individuals and groups have precisely
the right to invent new vocabularies and

245
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,040
not one but many co equal genders up to 
70 in New York state for example,

246
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,790
black continues,
every legally competent individual has a

247
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,550
perfect and absolute right to declare 
their sex,

248
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,893
but not to create a new legal status and
legally require the use of a new 

249
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:11,104
vocabulary for those influx between the 
only two sexes we have mercilessly 

250
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:19,381
binary throw their finite number may be 
well the same argument applies there.

251
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,553
They do have the right to create a new 
legal status or many new legal statuses 

252
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,623
and to legally require the use of a new 
vocabulary that's already written into 

253
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,050
the law that they have that right.

254
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,120
And I would say as well that,
uh,

255
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,470
Conrad blocks comments on that are also 
now illegal.

256
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,263
The individuals in that condition may 
change the registered sex each day if 

257
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,504
they wish,
but not treat anyone who declines to 

258
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,990
address them in terms that debunked the 
gender.

259
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:48,390
Binary world has guilty of a hate crime 
punishable by imposable fines.

260
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,380
How about six months ago,
I wrote a column in this space about the

261
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,214
acceptance by the Supreme Court of 
Canada to hear an appeal of judgments 

262
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,694
from well-reasoned local courts or 
request from a British Columbia band of 

263
00:14:59,031 --> 00:14:59,864
native people,
numbering 900 who claimed that 25 years 

264
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:06,410
of consultation was constitutionally 
inadequate over a proposed ski area that

265
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,244
an elder of their band was super 
naturally advised and after a lapse of 

266
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,054
some years told his people would drive 
off the spirit of the grizzly bear that 

267
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:15,410
was central to the religion of that 
band.

268
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,813
I concluded the column with the shabby 
polemical device that I only rarely 

269
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:22,100
employed a rhetorical question in this 
case.

270
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,023
Are we all mad?
Of course we are not and we still live 

271
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:27,620
in a country where people can self 
identify as they wish,

272
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,870
even if it diverges from apparent 
realities,

273
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,620
but we're almost at the point where 
people who declined to be legally forced

274
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:36,890
to acknowledge the warning,
plausible applications of this right are

275
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:37,724
subject to persecution by social justice
warriors and quite conceivably the 

276
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,500
government.
We're not almost at that point,

277
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,570
Mr Black,
it's already written into law.

278
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,830
We're terribly finally reluctant to 
impose normal rules,

279
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,703
free discourse over the agitation of 
people who are using an imagined 

280
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,580
unlimited latitude on sexual self 
description to gag,

281
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,533
dictate to and prosecute reasonable 
people exercising their rights to free 

282
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,030
expression.
It is another manifestation

283
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,603
parentheses of which the hyper 
hypocritically respectful limitations 

284
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:08,264
about the Stalinists desk bought Fidel 
Castro or another and parentheses of 

285
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:16,400
what my late friend Malcolm muggeridge 
called the great liberal death wish.

286
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,250
The great majority do not want to go 
along for that ride.

287
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,100
And this time the great majority must be
heard and obeyed.

288
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,863
All right,
so I told you what I thought about Mr 

289
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,293
Black's comments and uh,
and now I'm going to read a legal 

290
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,700
opinion about them.
Uh,

291
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,023
Mr. Block,
I regularly read your articles with 

292
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,054
interest.
I have interest in many of the subjects 

293
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,914
that you seem to devote attention to 
including US history in presidential 

294
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,334
politics and behavior.
I have further enjoyed your recent 

295
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,980
appearances on CNN with respect,
respect to the trump phenomenon.

296
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,520
I was motivated to write to you in this 
instance with respect to your article in

297
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,460
the National Post today mentioned in the
subject line of this email,

298
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,453
a right not to detract from your main 
thesis regarding Mr Peterson and those 

299
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,164
aligned against him,
but rather to identify potentially ms 

300
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,160
dot point of importance.
In your article,

301
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,010
you call into question the volume of Mr 
Peterson's rhetoric.

302
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,023
My words not yours as being 
disproportionate by identifying that 

303
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,134
imprisonment is not the punishment that 
he faces by disregarding the gender 

304
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,800
neutral ideology and any resultant 
orders from a human rights tribunal.

305
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,070
While you may be and hopefully are 
correct that in prison,

306
00:17:22,071 --> 00:17:26,870
it meant is not a Mr Peterson's future.
The path to prison remains clear.

307
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,623
The key point being that the human 
rights tribunals can and regularly do 

308
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,213
order nonmonetary remedies in addition 
to the typical and well known monetary 

309
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:38,414
awards well,
failure to pay a financial penalty can 

310
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:44,420
result in imprisonment.
It is admittedly a long and winding road

311
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,480
not entirely related to the unpaid 
penalty itself.

312
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,553
That being said,
if a tribunal war to issue its standard 

313
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:51,594
order,
it wouldn't necessarily include some 

314
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:54,720
variation of the following.
Number one,

315
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,823
a declaratory order requiring Mr 
Peterson not to misgender someone again 

316
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,530
or use the wrong pronouns.
Number two,

317
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,543
a gag order requiring him to refrain 
from discussing the subject in public 

318
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,510
possible given his academic status.
Number three,

319
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,493
a publication ban requiring him to 
refrain from publishing on these 

320
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,310
subjects possible given his media 
presence and number four,

321
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,743
to take mandatory sensitivity or anti 
bias training if Mr Peterson were to 

322
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,150
breach these orders.
For example,

323
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:27,750
by refusing to participate in the 
training and guess what I would do?

324
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,573
The typical recourse of the tribunal is 
to pursue a contempt of court which 

325
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:33,294
inevitably results in prison.
Section 19 of the Statutory Powers 

326
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,304
Procedures Act,
Ontario states that an order of the 

327
00:18:40,081 --> 00:18:42,570
tribunal is an order of the superior 
court.

328
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,123
Section 13 of the statutory powers 
Procedures Act says the tribunal can 

329
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:48,984
pursue a breach of its own order by 
bringing an application to the 

330
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,840
divisional court superior court on that 
application.

331
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,420
The divisional court employees rule 60 
point one,

332
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,254
one of the rules of civil procedure 
which states that when faced with 

333
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,070
contempt of a nonmonetary order of the 
Superior Court,

334
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,053
the court can order imprisonment for an 
indefinite period and finds the civil 

335
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:14,820
courts send people to prison for 
breaches of nonmonetary injunctions,

336
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,400
non defamation orders with some 
regularity.

337
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,850
Furthermore,
human rights tribunals have a history of

338
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:25,140
imprisoning persons for breaches of non 
monetary and monetary tribunal orders.

339
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,350
This happened most notoriously under the
recently repealed section 13 hate speech

340
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,490
provisions of the Canadian Human Rights 
Code,

341
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,223
of which Mr Lavato and Mr Stein quietly 
performed Yulman service for all 

342
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:40,290
Canadian citizens and having repealed.

343
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,340
While the likelihood of prison remains 
highly contingent and remote,

344
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,243
it doesn't depend to a great extent on 
the benevolence of the public servants 

345
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,303
that staff,
the tribunal and the courts keep up the

351

Well,
so there you have it.

352
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,820
That's the pathway to imprisonment for 
failure to use the proper pronouns.

353
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:12,983
And so let's not be confusing absurdity 
with triviality and I appreciate your 

354
00:20:16,711 --> 00:20:17,730
support,
Mr Black,

355
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,593
but I'm,
I'm afraid that you're treating the 

356
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,123
issue in some regard as if it's.
If it as as at least elements of it are 

357
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:28,914
beneath contempt and then it's being 
blowing blown out of proportion and I'd 

358
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:33,780
like to say as clearly as I possibly 
can,

359
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,240
this is not being blown out of 
proportion.

360
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,000
This is the state of current state of 
Canadian law.
