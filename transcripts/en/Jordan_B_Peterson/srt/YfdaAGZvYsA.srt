1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,170
Well,
good evening,

2
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:29,171
London,
two weeks ago,

3
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson met in 
person for the first time on stage in 

4
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:43,721
Vancouver two nights ago.
The three of us got together for the 

5
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:48,821
first time in Dublin and it's a huge 
thrill for all of us to now be here with

6
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:55,481
you in the o two,
as I said to travis when these events 

7
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:10,521
were planned,
I'm not moderate enough to be a 

8
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:10,521
moderator,

9
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:16,240
but I'm going to do a little bit of 
fielding to begin with,

10
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,260
so let me start by saying a little of 
some of the ground we are going to be 

11
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,020
trying to cover here tonight.
We're going to be dealing with the 

12
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,870
conflict between science and reason.
We're going to be addressing the 

13
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,730
legitimacy.
Did I say science and reason science and

14
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:40,080
reason?
Yes.

15
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,390
Occasionally there is.
We're not addressing that.

16
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,630
We're going to be looking at the 
legitimacy of holding onto religion in 

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,760
any form and we are also going to be 
addressing the fact that we need to hide

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,110
in a sports stadium to address serious 
issues.

19
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,370
But I think to begin with,
I'm going to hand over to Sam and he's 

20
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:09,530
going to kick us off.

21
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,630
Well,
thank you.

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
First,
thank you all for coming out.

23
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,500
I really can't imagine how humble

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,450
to be here with you.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
You really should just take a moment to 
appreciate this from our side because 

26
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,700
Justin Bieber is not coming out to sing 
in the middle of this as a museum is 

27
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,750
that would be a.
and you know,

28
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,190
though we put the date like this on the 
calendar with apparent confidence,

29
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,490
there's really no guarantee that you 
guys are going to show up and we will 

30
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,401
never take this for granted.
So it is really an immense privilege to 

31
00:02:49,401 --> 00:02:49,401
be here with you.

32
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,140
So

33
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,330
I thought I could start by first how fun
this has been to,

34
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,760
to have this,
these series of dialogues,

35
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,260
uh,
with Jordan.

36
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:10,261
Now this is the fourth event we've done.
And the second with Douglas and we 

37
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,470
clearly share a common project mean we 
are,

38
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,530
we are trying to figure out how to live 
the best lives possible both 

39
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:25,231
individually and collectively and we're 
trying to figure out how to build 

40
00:03:25,231 --> 00:03:29,851
societies that safeguard that 
opportunity for as many people as 

41
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:34,621
possible.
And I think we each have a sense that 

42
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:39,090
ideas are really the prime movers here,
that it's not that the world is filled 

43
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,490
with bad people doing bad things because
that's what bad people do though there,

44
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:48,010
there is some of that.
It is mostly that so much of humanity is

45
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:53,011
living under the sway of bad ideas and 
it's bad ideas that can cause good 

46
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:57,811
people or at least totally normal people
like ourselves to do bad things all the 

47
00:03:57,811 --> 00:04:01,270
while trying to,
to live the best possible lives.

48
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
And that really is the tragedy of our 
circumstance that we can be that 

49
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:06,510
confused.
Uh,

50
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,370
so this is where the difference between 
Jordan and and me in particular opens 

51
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:18,571
up,
which is how do you view religion in 

52
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:22,861
this,
in this contest between good ideas and 

53
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:22,861
bad ideas.
And for me,

54
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:26,611
religion emphatically gets placed on the
side of bad and old and a worth retiring

55
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,920
ideas or ideas worth retiring.
And I guess by analogy I would,

56
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,250
I would,
uh,

57
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,270
ask you to consider astrology and I had.
Maybe I can just get a sense of what I'm

58
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:47,290
talking to.
What percentage of you I want to know,

59
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,040
believe in astrology,
which is to say who among you.

60
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,840
And you can signal this by,
by applause or a house of enthusiasm.

61
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,050
What,
what percentage of your let,

62
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,090
let me just spell it out.
So you know what you're committing to a 

63
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,390
and a new neural,
how crazy your neighbor is.

64
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:09,391
In fact,
what percentage of you believe that 

65
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:13,570
human personalities and human events and
the difference between good and bad luck

66
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:18,571
in a human life is the result of what 
the planets are doing against the 

67
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:23,260
background of stars or it somebody out 
there.

68
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,340
Okay.
So now you should know that something 

69
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,780
like 25 percent of your neighbors 
believe that.

70
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,530
Uh,
oh,

71
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,660
there you go.
So I'm,

72
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,210
I'm,
I'm,

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,610
I'm here.
Wait,

74
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,020
wait,
wait.

75
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm hearing,
I'm hearing a heckler among the 

76
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,401
astrologers.
Is that for the first astrological 

77
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:48,610
heckler?
I've heard you must be an areas or

78
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,110
so it,
it

79
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,380
won't surprise you.
I have a related question,

80
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,770
which is what?
What percentage of you I want to know 

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,810
are religious,
which is say,

82
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,300
well,
who among you believe in God,

83
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,940
a personal God,
a God that can hear prayers,

84
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,330
a god that can take an interest in the 
lives of human beings and occasionally 

85
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,760
law enforce good outcomes versus bad 
outcomes.

86
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,590
What?
Who among you?

87
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,540
And now again,
I want to hear applause or,

88
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,000
or silence believing that sort of God.

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,870
Okay.
So this is my concern is my concern with

90
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,430
what Jordan has been saying and writing 
Lo these many months.

91
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,770
I feel that you are in danger of 
misleading these,

92
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,800
the second group of people that,
that the way you talk about God has 

93
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,031
convinced and will continue to convince 
some percentage of humanity that it's 

94
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,760
fine to hold on to this old sort of God,
this God that can hear prayers and they 

95
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,680
can intervene or not in the lives of 
human beings.

96
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,570
Uh,
and you know,

97
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,840
as we've begun to explore that,
I think there are a lot of problems with

98
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:11,660
that kind of belief.
Uh,

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,780
if nothing else,
there are many such God's on offer and 

100
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,530
their devotion to them becomes 
irreconcilable among the true believers.

101
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,320
And my concern is that you could do 
exactly what you do with religion,

102
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,910
with astrology,
right?

103
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:28,460
It would be,
it would be no more legitimate to,

104
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,710
to,
uh,

105
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,810
obfuscate the boundary between clear 
thinking and superstition there because 

106
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,550
the,
this traditional God and the and the 

107
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,211
doctrines that support him are,
are no firmer ground than astrology is 

108
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,900
now today.

109
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,900
And astrology,
almost everything you say about 

110
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,171
religion.
It's the fact that his organized human 

111
00:07:56,171 --> 00:08:00,461
thinking for thousands of years,
that it's a cultural universal that 

112
00:08:00,461 --> 00:08:01,460
every,
every group of people has,

113
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:06,200
has given rise to some form of it.
That it has archetypal significance that

114
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:11,201
has powerful stories.
All of that can be said about astrology 

115
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:11,201
and,
and,

116
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:11,630
and,
and in fact,

117
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,550
some additional things can be said about
astrology that or are would argue in its

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,280
favor.
For instance,

119
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:20,000
astrology is profoundly egalitarian.
You know,

120
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,820
there's,
there's no bad Zodiac sign every whoever

121
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:27,821
you are.
Everyone's got a great Zodiac sign and 

122
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:28,120
uh,
you know,

123
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,180
it's,
it's just a inconvenient fact of the 

124
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:33,710
discipline that if I read you Charles 
Manson's Horoscope,

125
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,230
you'd have 95 percent of the audience 
would find it relevant and,

126
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,570
and that's just,
that's how easily falsifiable astrology 

127
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,481
is.
But that my concern is that we could 

128
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,130
live in a world where societies are 
shattered over things like,

129
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,380
you know,
different Zodiac interpretations and we 

130
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,881
don't live in that world for good reason
because we have beaten astrology into 

131
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:02,001
submission.
And I would say that religion in terms 

132
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:05,001
of revealed religion and belief in a 
personal God is over the centuries 

133
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,730
getting the same treatment by science 
and rationality and should be.

134
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:13,731
And it is a,
a perverse circumstance that we live in 

135
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:13,731
a world that is that a shattered by 
religion.

136
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,240
So I think what I'll do first is adopt 
the exceptionally difficult and likely 

137
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,510
counterproductive position of saying 
something not so much in defensive 

138
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,360
religion,
but in defense of astrology,

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,080
knowing,
knowing full well that that's 

140
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,321
fundamentally a fool's errand.
But there's something I want to point 

141
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:49,100
out is that first of all,

142
00:09:55,310 --> 00:10:00,310
astrology was astronomy in it's nascent 
form and astrology was also science in 

143
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,840
its nascent form,
just like alchemy was chemistry and it's

144
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:10,841
nascent form,
and so sometimes you have to dream a 

145
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:16,061
crazy dream with all of the error that 
that crazy dream entails because you 

146
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:22,541
have an intuition that there's something
there to motivate you to develop the 

147
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,420
intuition to the point where it actually
becomes a genuine practical utility.

148
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,980
Now,
when we look back on the astrologers and

149
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:35,981
we value their contributions to the 
history of the world with contempt,

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,700
we should also remember that the people 
who built Stonehenge,

151
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:45,701
for example,
and the first people who decided 

152
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:48,140
determined that our fates were in part 
written in the stars,

153
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,440
were people whose astrological beliefs 
were indistinguishable from their 

154
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,790
astronomical beliefs.
And you might think,

155
00:10:55,791 --> 00:11:00,791
well,
in what sense is your fate written in 

156
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:04,721
the stars?
And I would say it's certainly the case 

157
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,550
in so far as there are such things as 
cosmic regularities.

158
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,210
So it was the dream of astrology that 
there was some relationship between the 

159
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,630
movement of the planetary bodies.
And the fixed stars and human destiny,

160
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:22,631
and that's what drove us to build the 
first astronomical observatories and to 

161
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:28,241
also determine that there was a proper 
time for planting and a proper time for 

162
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:30,530
harvesting and a way of orienting 
yourself in the world.

163
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:32,660
For example,
by using the north star,

164
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,050
it's also the poetic grounded enabled us
to identify the notion that you could 

165
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:43,751
look up and Orient Yourself towards the 
heavens and that there was a 

166
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:46,721
metaphorical relationship between that 
and positioning yourself properly in 

167
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:49,320
life and at a deeper level.
The,

168
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,760
the,
the cosmos was the place that the human,

169
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,120
that the drama was externalized and 
draped itself out into the world as 

170
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,510
something that was essentially 
observable so that we could derive great

171
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,260
orienting fictions from the observation 
of our imagination.

172
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,550
And so,
and part of the problem that that Sam is

173
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:14,551
pointing to is the difficulty of 
distinguishing valid poetic impulse from

174
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,910
invalid political impulse.
And that really is a tremendous problem.

175
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:23,911
You,
you see that arise also in people who 

176
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:26,580
have religious delusions attendant upon 
manic depressive disorder or 

177
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,950
schizophrenia.
But so much of what eventually manifests

178
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:34,951
itself as hardcore pragmatic,
scientific belief has its origin in wild

179
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:39,070
flights of poetic fantasy,
and it's also the case by the way,

180
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:43,360
that that's actually how your brain is 
organized as far as I can tell that when

181
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:44,800
you,
and it isn't just me,

182
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,580
I actually,
it's,

183
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,180
it's there.
There's a very large,

184
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,880
what would you call it?
Research Literature,

185
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,240
outlining the relative functions of the 
right and left hemisphere,

186
00:12:55,241 --> 00:13:00,241
and it certainly appears to be the case 
that when we encounter something 

187
00:13:00,241 --> 00:13:03,750
absolutely unknowable or unknown,
what we do is drape that unknown thing 

188
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:09,121
in fantasy as a first pass approximation
to the truth and then refine that 

189
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,970
fantasy as a consequence of,
of iterative,

190
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:17,971
critical analysis.
And so sam believes that what should 

191
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:22,051
happen is that the poetic and fictional 
domain should be planted by the rational

192
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:24,010
domain.

193
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,030
Let me just close the loop.
They're not quite.

194
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,050
I think we need poetry and fiction and 
then there's more to engage in with 

195
00:13:32,691 --> 00:13:36,080
reality than than being a scientist in a
white lab coat.

196
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
But we need to be able to clearly 
distinguish back from fantasy or fact 

197
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:46,661
from mirror.
Merely fertile flights of imagination 

198
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:49,760
and we want to be rigorous there and 
rational there,

199
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:54,820
and it's not that.
It's not that there's no place for mere 

200
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,770
creativity that's not well,
I guess in the rails of rationality.

201
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Fair enough then,
but then then partly what we are 

202
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,170
disputing is the,
the,

203
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,080
the,
the what,

204
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:09,190
the relative import and have those two 
domains,

205
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,660
let's say the poetic and the fictional 
and

206
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,210
status of religion.
Now in that.

207
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,340
Well,
I have a hard time reconciling that to 

208
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:19,340
some degree.
With your,

209
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,970
with your more,
what would you say?

210
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,110
Formal statements about the problem 
because your mechanism,

211
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:30,111
the mechanism that you put forth above 
all outside of truth is rationality and 

212
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,690
it isn't clear to me if you're willing 
to allow the utility of spiritual 

213
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,581
experience,
which you do and if you're willing to 

214
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:40,860
make,
what would you say?

215
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:44,040
Allowances for the necessity of the 
poetic imagination.

216
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Exactly how it is that that is also 
encapsulated under the rubric of pure 

217
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:51,390
rationality.

218
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,250
See,
let's see.

219
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,690
Here's something you can tell me what 
you think about this and I've been 

220
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:58,760
thinking a lot about what salmon I've 
been talking about.

221
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,120
By the way,
you know,

222
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,220
so I'm making the case in my writing 
that democratic institutions not only 

223
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,520
grew out of the Judeo Christian 
substrate,

224
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,480
but that they're,
that they're properly ensconced within 

225
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,231
that substrate,
but I'm also perfectly aware that not 

226
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:21,431
every religious or political system 
gives rise to democratic institutions 

227
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:25,630
first and also that there are Christian 
substructures,

228
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,780
maybe the most obviously in the case of 
the Russian Orthodox Church were the 

229
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:36,131
same metaphysical principles apply,
but out of which a democracy did not 

230
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:41,351
emerge.
And so it does seem to me that what we 

231
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:44,861
have in the West is the consequence of 
the interplay between the fantasy 

232
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,211
predicated poetic,
Judeo Christian tradition and the 

233
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:51,860
rational critique that was aimed at that
by the enlightenment figures.

234
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,160
And that seems to me to mirror something
like the proper balance between the 

235
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,701
right hemisphere and it's poetic 
imagination and the left hemisphere and 

236
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:04,271
it's critical capacity.
And then I would say that part of the 

237
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:07,781
way.
So one of the questions you brought up 

238
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:10,121
was how do we decide which,
let's say religious intuitions are 

239
00:16:10,821 --> 00:16:15,821
valid.
And I think we do that in part through 

240
00:16:15,821 --> 00:16:16,120
negotiated agreement.
You know,

241
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,790
because people have look,
even even among the Catholics,

242
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:23,110
say in the medieval time there was an 
absolute horror of heresy,

243
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,860
so if you were some mendicant monks and 
you had a profound religious vision,

244
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,430
the probability that you were going to 
be tried as a heretic and burnt at the 

245
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,581
stake was extremely high because even 
the gatekeepers of the religious 

246
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:40,121
tradition realized that religious 
revelation untrammeled by something like

247
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:45,731
community dialogue,
something like that was something 

248
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:45,731
extraordinary,
extraordinary danger,

249
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,890
and so I would agree with you that the 
poetic imagination and the grounds of 

250
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,600
religious revelation is something that 
can lead people dangerously astray,

251
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,900
but I would say at the same time that it
constitutes the grounds of our initial 

252
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,280
exploration and that it's actually 
ineradicable necessary.

253
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,690
Okay.
We'll briefly address that and I don't 

254
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:06,690
want to ask a question that brings 
Douglas directly in here.

255
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,320
I think this is an instance that have 
what's called the genetic fallacy.

256
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:16,321
The idea that because something emerged 
the way it did historically as a matter 

257
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:19,120
of historical contingency,
it is the,

258
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,270
the,
the,

259
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,300
the origin is in fact good and worth 
maintaining a or that it was in fact 

260
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,200
necessary that we couldn't get these 
good things like democracy any other way

261
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:30,850
or unlikely to.
And I would say that,

262
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,240
that there's no abrahamic religion that 
is the best conceivable womb of 

263
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,580
democracy or anything else.
We like science.

264
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,010
That's a great place to get done.

265
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,100
Yeah.
So,

266
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,760
but,
but I,

267
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,570
I would just add one other category of,
of uh,

268
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,850
thinking here we have what we think is 
factual methods by which we derived 

269
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,511
facts.
I would put a rationality there and an 

270
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:56,880
empirical engagement with,
with reality.

271
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Then we have other good things in life 
like fiction and flights of fancy that 

272
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:08,610
are pleasing for one reason or another 
and could be generative toward the first

273
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:12,400
category.
But then we also have A.

274
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,030
I would acknowledge we've spoken about 
this before,

275
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,830
useful fictions and cases.
I would,

276
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,960
you know,
hope rare cases where were fiction is 

277
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,680
more adaptive or more useful than the 
truth.

278
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,460
Right?
That there,

279
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,500
there's sometimes the truth can,
can be not worth knowing and I would 

280
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:32,250
argue that they,
you know,

281
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,520
there are those cases where they're not,
but they're few and far between,

282
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,800
but we should focus on that.
But to some degree.

283
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,810
So I want to just point to Douglas here 
and focus on that because I think your 

284
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:42,810
fear,
Douglas,

285
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,581
is that my style or you know,
Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens,

286
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:49,710
his style of antitheism,
you know,

287
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,550
just,
let's,

288
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,610
let's just throw the vickers from the 
rooftops now because it is time to end 

289
00:18:55,621 --> 00:18:59,430
this thing literally get off twitter 
now.

290
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,080
That's a Hashtag

291
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,880
your concern has been that,
uh,

292
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,190
and I think Jordan shares this,
that,

293
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,220
that so much of what is good in our 
Western developed societies is at the 

294
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:22,961
very least maintained by maintain,
maintaining so-called Judeo Christian 

295
00:19:24,051 --> 00:19:28,760
values or the or the remnants of our 
past religiosity.

296
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:33,761
And that either there is a baby in the 
bathwater that can be difficult to 

297
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,660
discern.
And we can't empty the tub all at once.

298
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:40,661
Because,
and this is very much a because there's 

299
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,581
a zero sum contest with the religious 
enthusiasm we see coming from the Muslim

300
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:47,861
world,
and of course the Muslim world is all 

301
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:50,510
over the world at the moment.
So in that contest between a very,

302
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:54,890
an older style of religiosity and be a 
theocracy really,

303
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,150
and maternity,
you are not as eager as I have been to,

304
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,230
to pull up western religiosity by the 
roots.

305
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,230
Well,
chuck [inaudible] the vickers.

306
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,690
Yes.
Yes.

307
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:08,950
I think that's fair.
I mean,

308
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,180
I think I sit metaphorically as well as 
literally between the two of you.

309
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Um,
I realized from our conversation in 

310
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,961
Dublin,
some of your concerns are about what 

311
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:22,690
Jordan has been saying and what he's 
saying.

312
00:20:22,691 --> 00:20:27,691
And I share some of the concern I said 
to you then that I use the analogy of 

313
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:34,320
what our friend Eric Weinstein recently 
described to me as Jesus smuggling,

314
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,430
that it was a consequence of a 
discussion about biologists.

315
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,870
What do you do if you're discussing 
design intelligent design?

316
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,990
You can be okay as as your own bandwidth
on the of the issue,

317
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,220
as long as your in depth of knowledge on
the issue is very considerable.

318
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:58,330
You can be okay discussing that biology 
with somebody,

319
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
even a fundamentalist Christian,
so long as you can follow every step of 

320
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,341
the way.
The fear will always be that the moment 

321
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:10,510
you're not looking,
they're going to smuggle Jesus in.

322
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh,
they'll wait until the moment that 

323
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:18,760
you're not comfortable anymore with the 
argument,

324
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,630
the bit when you're at the very end of 
your cognitive ability and then they'll 

325
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:23,140
trust me.
There's Jesus.

326
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,900
Yes,
Jesus.

327
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,980
Right,

328
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,460
and one of the things I realized from 
Dublin was,

329
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,840
although I think you may not think that 
Jordan himself is going to try Jesus 

330
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:40,270
smuggling on you,
you fear that somewhere down the line 

331
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:43,010
from what he's saying,
somebody else will do that trick.

332
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,310
Yeah.
It's worse than that.

333
00:21:44,311 --> 00:21:49,311
I actually know the people,
the people who were clapping are doing 

334
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:54,081
that.
I hear from those people on a daily 

335
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:54,081
basis.
Right?

336
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:54,210
So that the segment of Jordan's 
audience,

337
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,590
that is.
That is very happy to be told they can 

338
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,661
stay on the riverbank of their 
traditional Christianity for the most 

339
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:06,471
part,
and they don't have to get into the 

340
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:07,320
stream of totally modern,
rigorous,

341
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:10,320
rational thinking about everything from 
first principles,

342
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,900
right?
That there's something that,

343
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,440
that the Iron Age scribes got right and 
it's right for all time.

344
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,290
Those are the.
Those are the applause.

345
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:20,350
I'm hearing.
And,

346
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,260
and,
and I,

347
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,110
I,
however,

348
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:27,111
consciously or not,
Jordan is telling them it's okay to 

349
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:27,840
stay.
Stick right there with a,

350
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,370
with a Shard of the cross.

351
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,050
Okay,
well,

352
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,570
I actually tried a little conscious 
Jesus smuggling on Sam to see how that 

353
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:40,060
would go into discussion we had about 
the central archetype of superheroes.

354
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:41,890
But I'm going to try something a little 
different tonight.

355
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,050
I'm going to try a little direct God 
smuggling.

356
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,170
We won't bother with Jesus.
Let's go right to God.

357
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,330
Why not?
So,

358
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:54,430
I'm.
One of the things I've really tried to 

359
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,461
do when I've been analyzing religious 
texts is to take them as to take them 

360
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,850
seriously in the sense that I don't 
presume that I understand them and I 

361
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:07,360
presume that they're a mystery of sorts 
and at least the Bible,

362
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:12,361
for example,
is a mystery because we don't really 

363
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:15,031
understand the processes by which it was
constructed and we don't understand the 

364
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:18,460
processes by which we all agreed 
collectively over several thousand years

365
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:23,461
to organize the book the way it is 
organized or to edit it the way that 

366
00:23:23,461 --> 00:23:28,351
it's edited or end to keep what's in it 
and to end to discard what's not in it 

367
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,720
and why it's lasted and why it's had 
such a huge impact.

368
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,000
I don't want to derail you,
but we do understand that the first part

369
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:39,270
of the process all too well.
We know that the.

370
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,510
There was a political and all too human 
process of voting certain texts in for 

371
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,620
and some were in for centuries and then 
got jettisoned and revelation came in 

372
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,451
far later than.
I mean the whole generations of 

373
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:58,031
Christians who lived and died under the 
banner of the Bible and it was a 

374
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:59,360
different Bible at the time.
I had the wrong Bible.

375
00:23:59,361 --> 00:23:59,600
So,

376
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,790
but it's the same.
It's the same issue that,

377
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,470
that we really don't.
We really don't understand.

378
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,430
Fair enough.
Salmon,

379
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm not saying that political etc.
Considerations didn't enter into it.

380
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,460
I'm sure all human Considerations 
entered into it,

381
00:24:11,461 --> 00:24:16,461
but there was some collective process of
winnowing and you can attempt to reduce 

382
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:21,771
that to economic or political causes,
which is generally what secular 

383
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:25,250
assessors like freud and marx both did 
and with a fair degree of success side,

384
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,770
my dad.
But there's still some mysterious,

385
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,900
uh,
assessment of what it is that will be 

386
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,131
remembered that entered into it.
But It's a separate point to some 

387
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:38,550
degree.
But I'm just saying that my point,

388
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,290
my,
my,

389
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,350
my point of departure when looking at 
these texts,

390
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:44,850
who's one of an essential radical 
ignorance,

391
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:49,851
I don't assume that I understand the 
mechanisms by which they were generated 

392
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:54,561
or edited or collected or kept or 
remembered or why they had the impact 

393
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:55,410
they had.

394
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,210
now I've been thinking a lot about the 
idea of let's say god the father,

395
00:25:00,211 --> 00:25:03,480
because that's a very common 
architectural representation of god,

396
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,780
god the father.
So I'm going to tell you an experience 

397
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,720
that I had that I've never really told 
any audience about.

398
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I had a vision at one point that and the
vision had to do with a dialogue that I 

399
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:18,900
was having with my father.
And you know you have a father,

400
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,970
right?
And when you're a little kid,

401
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,560
you act out your father.
When you pretend to be a father and what

402
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:30,561
you're doing when you're acting out,
your father isn't imitating your father 

403
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:34,431
because you don't duplicate precisely 
the actions that your father ever took 

404
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,220
in his life.
what you do is you watch your father 

405
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,341
across multiple contexts and you 
abstract out something like a spirit of 

406
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:48,231
the father and then when you're a child,
you implement that spirit of the father 

407
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:51,150
in your pretend play and you come to 
embody that deeply.

408
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:56,150
So the notion is that people can 
abstract out something like a spirit of 

409
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,520
the father and that that's part of our 
[inaudible] mimetic tendency,

410
00:25:59,521 --> 00:26:01,830
which is a very powerful human cognitive
tendency.

411
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:06,210
And in this vision I first started to 
talk with my father and I would say more

412
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:10,560
with the spirit of my father because he 
wasn't actually there and I would say it

413
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:13,680
was the wisest part of him.
And then that sort of transformed into a

414
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:16,650
discussion that I had with a series of 
ancestral spirits.

415
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:21,651
And then that transformed itself into a 
vision of god himself with whom I have a

416
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:25,020
conversation and this was a visionary 
experience.

417
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,500
And then that all went away and I spent 
months and months thinking about it and 

418
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,390
I thought so you guys can tell me what 
you think about this.

419
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,490
And this sort of stretches my cognitive 
ability to,

420
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,330
to its utmost limit to contemplate such 
things.

421
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:44,010
But here's a biological argument.
I already made the that a child

422
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,470
can extract out the spirit of the father
and embody it.

423
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:52,471
Didn't that's necessary in so far as 
you're going to be a father and a wise 

424
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:55,670
one.
But we can also extract out the spirit 

425
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,401
of the father over much longer periods 
of time because my father was a father 

426
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:01,320
because he imitated his father who 
imitated his father,

427
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:04,680
who imitated his father as far back in 
time as you can go,

428
00:27:04,681 --> 00:27:09,090
and there's a cumulative development of 
the spirit of the farther across time.

429
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Now then the question might be,
does this spirit of the father have any 

430
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,120
reality other than the metaphorical?
And I would say,

431
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
damn right,
it has a reality and I can describe a 

432
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:20,390
biological reality.
And and,

433
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,920
and I don't know what this says about 
any background metaphysics,

434
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:27,921
but here's a hypothesis.
We know that human beings separated from

435
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,610
chimpanzees over the course of the last 
7 million years,

436
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,450
at least in large part because of human 
female sexual activity.

437
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,870
So it was the spirit of femininity 
collectively that helped elevate us to 

438
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,750
the degree that we have been elevated 
above our chimpanzee co ancestor.

439
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,300
But here's something interesting to 
contemplate.

440
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,010
What is it precisely that makes men what
makes men desirable to women?

441
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,620
And so I have a bit of a hypothesis 
about that.

442
00:27:55,621 --> 00:28:00,621
So here's what men do.
They get together in productive groups 

443
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,080
and the orient themselves toward a 
certain task and they produce a 

444
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,490
hierarchy around that task because 
whenever you implement a task,

445
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:13,410
you produce a hierarchy and they vote up
the most competent men to the top of the

446
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:18,411
hierarchy and then the women's select 
the competent men from the top of the 

447
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:21,801
hierarchy,
but the vote that determines who the 

448
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,591
competent men are that are more likely 
to reproduce as a consequence of male 

449
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:27,540
evaluation of men.
And that's occurred over millennia.

450
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:32,750
And so there's a spirit of the father 
that's embedded in the patriarchal 

451
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,711
hierarchy that acts as the primary 
selection mechanism that offers men up 

452
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:37,030
to women and plays us.

453
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,790
Our cardinal role in human evolution.
And it looks like we've.

454
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,950
We've personiFied that spirit of the 
father in our religious imagery and and 

455
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,980
that's,
that's how it looks to Me.

456
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:51,981
But then there's something that's even 
more mysterious and deep about that 

457
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,251
that's worth considering,
is that apparently the entire course of 

458
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:57,330
evolutionary history has conspired to 
produce human beings.

459
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,580
And we could argue that it could have 
been different,

460
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:04,581
but it certainly hasn't been different.
And that means that that selective 

461
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:08,271
spirit of the father has been part of 
the process that's generated our very 

462
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:13,131
being,
and it's certainly possible that that 

463
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:15,141
collective spirit of the father reflects
something metaphysically fundamental 

464
00:29:15,141 --> 00:29:17,940
about the structure of reality itself a 
way

465
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,450
yes

466
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,910
into insofar as I agree with,
with virtually all of that,

467
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I should say that none of that should 
give comfort to people who want to hold 

468
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,141
onto this notion that certain of our 
books might've been revealed by the 

469
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:39,141
creator of the universe.

470
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,280
Well,
it depends what you by the creator.

471
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:42,420
Yeah.

472
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,150
Like I'm just saying that,
that,

473
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
that the world we're living in now is 
one in which we have whole societies 

474
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,900
shattered over this notion that some 
books weren't written by human beings.

475
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,630
Right?
There's a different class of book,

476
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,490
right?
There's a different shelf in the library

477
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:04,491
where the products of almost certainly 
merely human brains are venerated for 

478
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:11,661
all time and,
and considered uneditable and 

479
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:13,410
uninsurable five by the majority of 
human beings.

480
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,010
Yep.
Well,

481
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,100
it's clear,
clear that revelation can devolve into 

482
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,160
fundamentalism,
but I'm real,

483
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,170
but any.
But there is a risk,

484
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,480
and alyssa whizzes isn't often made 
critique,

485
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,530
but when you're talking about religion,
you're talking about the inquisition,

486
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:33,531
you're talking about the jihadists.
You're not talking about somebody who 

487
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,950
wants to go to their local anglican 
church once a year,

488
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:40,430
maybe get the children to school and 
maybe when they at some desolate moment 

489
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,990
of their lives returns to this as a 
place that stores meaning.

490
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,240
I mean the thing that I think Jordan and
I are in agreement on them this is,

491
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,700
is that thing,
a quote from shop in the heart and the 

492
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:52,930
dialogue on religion when he says,
you know,

493
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,490
the truth may be like water.
It needs vessels to carry it.

494
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:02,030
And we,
when we were talking about this the 

495
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,030
other night,
you know,

496
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,300
you admitted that one of the 
consequences perhaps of the,

497
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,600
you know,
the parents sort of going through the 

498
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:08,600
belief structures,
they may not believe in any more,

499
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,840
but they keep doing it as a 
demonstration of what you said was the,

500
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,210
the,
the non embarrassing options that 

501
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,210
atheists have come up with.

502
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,040
But it may also be that the,
since we don't have very many vessels 

503
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:28,260
that cracked and damaged and sometimes 
transparent as they are,

504
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,440
what vessels you have might be worth 
holding onto?

505
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,870
Well,
no,

506
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:37,871
I think.
I think the challenge here is mean it 

507
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:37,900
feels that.
Well,

508
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,180
first of all we should first notice that
these comments very often take the form 

509
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:48,191
of you and I don't need this stuff,
but most other people do.

510
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,940
Right.
And that is,

511
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,110
it can do that.
Yeah.

512
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,260
I mean that's inevitably.
And if it's sort of took that form at 

513
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,920
one moment the other night,
whereas where you acknowledged that,

514
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:04,950
that people have low intelligence are 
our best placed in a conservative 

515
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,960
paradigm,
a traditionally conservative paradigm 

516
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,420
paradigm.
Because there's less to think through 

517
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,420
right now.
Obviously you don't want your,

518
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,760
your view on religion summarized by it's
good for stupid people.

519
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Well I do.
I do want to summarize to some degree 

520
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,521
that way because one of the things that 
we do have the opportunity again to put 

521
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:26,330
his foot in your mouth.
But I would say not,

522
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,870
not only.
I mean,

523
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,950
the thing is is that we're all stupid 
and some of us are far stupider than 

524
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:32,950
others,
but we're not,

525
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,250
but we're not that stupid.
I mean,

526
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,560
there is another problem,
sam.

527
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,930
I think,
and this is obviously contentious one,

528
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,250
one of the things I don't go to church,
but there is one thing I admire about 

529
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:50,080
the church and that is that it's managed
to serve as a repository for these 

530
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:56,650
fundamental underlying fictions for two 
millennia and that's really something 

531
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,760
bloody unbelievable.
I mean the great,

532
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,320
what would you say?

533
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,730
Bloody unbelievable.

534
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
Well,
look sam there.

535
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,400
Everything's,
everything's.

536
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:08,060
Everything's soaked in blood.
We have no disagreement about that,

537
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:13,061
but the second or alternatives that we 
produced in the 20th century were 

538
00:33:13,061 --> 00:33:15,330
certainly no less blood sodom and they'd
produced nothing of any productivity.

539
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:20,910
We did not do it now,
but we have to put to bed that secular 

540
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,450
canard.
It's just not so that stalin ism was the

541
00:33:25,811 --> 00:33:29,140
product of secularism or atheism and 
norwood.

542
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,680
It wasn't an inevitable product or 
products.

543
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,240
It wasn't bay.
And please anyone who has this meme in 

544
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,270
your head,
please just allow.

545
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:45,271
The next sentence is I speak to just 
push it out because I'm so sick of 

546
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:45,460
hearing this,
uh,

547
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:51,530
this,
this idea that the greatest crimes of 

548
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:51,530
the 20th century where somehow the 
product of atheism,

549
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:56,900
right?
When you look at what actually 

550
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,131
engineered these atrocities,
it was something that looked very much 

551
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:04,351
like a religion.
It was a religion in every way apart 

552
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:05,590
from an explicit commitment to other 
worldliness.

553
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,820
It was based on different dogmatism 
through and through.

554
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,390
It was based on a personality cults 
that,

555
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,590
that grew up around figures like stalin 
and hitler and mao.

556
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,120
It's,
these were the,

557
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:23,180
it was not the ideas of bertrand russell
and david hume that brought us to the 

558
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,450
gulag or to auschwitz.

559
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,730
But then you say it's the thought of 
jesus christ.

560
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,460
either we know it's true.
No,

561
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,150
I can say that I,
I can say it

562
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,450
thought of st augustine and I can say it
was the thought of st thomas aquinas 

563
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,400
explicitly that gave us the inquisition.
The fact.

564
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,530
Can I make a suggestion?
Yeah.

565
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,230
I mean this is a general one as well as 
one for tonight,

566
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,450
but the whole discussion.
I mean,

567
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,150
I said the other night in dublin that to
a great extent,

568
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,520
when the history books are written about
the period we're living in,

569
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:55,050
they'll probably be described as the 
post holocaust period in history,

570
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,850
the post world war two era in europe.
It'll.

571
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,610
It's still going on,
so we're still.

572
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,670
We're still going through this,
trying to work out what happened,

573
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,420
and I have to say one thing that I at 
any rate and equally tired of is the 

574
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,891
claim that this has got to Be a tennis 
game between the religious and 

575
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:16,460
nonreligious,
but people say that the 20th century's 

576
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,170
crimes were committed by atheists,
sometimes true,

577
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,420
often wrong,
or that the 20th century,

578
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,460
his crimes were committed by people who 
were religious,

579
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,290
sometimes true,
often wrong.

580
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:31,370
Nobody.
You're not observing a crucial 

581
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,251
distinction here because I would never 
be tempted to hold religion accountable 

582
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:38,470
for the band.
Things that religious people do that 

583
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,570
have no connection to religion.
Right?

584
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:44,571
So if a muslim robs the liquor store,
I'm not going to blame islam for that.

585
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,790
Or there's no dogs.
There's no doctrine that there's no 

586
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:52,230
doctrine that makes sense of that 
behavior.

587
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:55,080
What I blame religion for and,
and likewise,

588
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:57,960
there is no doctrine in the mirror loss 
of religion.

589
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:02,961
They,
I atheism that gets you the gulag of 

590
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:05,240
there is that there's not,
there's not,

591
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:06,140
but,
but let me just,

592
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,520
let me just flush out this point for one
more second.

593
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,910
The only thing I blame religion for are 
the things that it becomes rational to 

594
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,300
do by the light of these beliefs.
If you accept these doctrines,

595
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,460
a rational and good person can be 
tempted to join isis.

596
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,760
That's my concern.
A rational and good person can be 

597
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:28,760
tempted to support the inquisition,

598
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,090
but of the many things they had in 
common.

599
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Um,
this is the point that david berlinski 

600
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,791
made in his book.
What did the end kvd having common with 

601
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:45,030
everyone who oversaw the gulag bss,
people who guarded the camps,

602
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:48,670
that people who put people on trains.
What did they all have in common?

603
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:52,150
What do they have in common with mao,
among other things they had in common?

604
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,450
The fact that none of them thought that 
god was watching them,

605
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,990
none of them thought that they were 
being observed.

606
00:36:58,991 --> 00:36:59,180
And what

607
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,150
held accountable?
it doesn't help when you think god is on

608
00:37:02,151 --> 00:37:07,151
your side,
but we have just as many examples where 

609
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:07,151
people do it because I think,
god,

610
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:08,070
god is on their side.
Right?

611
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,100
Watching and clapping.

612
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:13,790
I'm not denying that.
I'm saying that the attempt to make this

613
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:17,350
at a tennis match over the 20th century 
was a mistake.

614
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:19,480
We were still trying to work out what 
caused it.

615
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:21,550
Religion had a role.
Atheism had a role,

616
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,900
but the perpetual tennis match of it,
I think,

617
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:25,170
well,

618
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,070
there is something to be said at a more 
sophisticated level,

619
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:35,071
I would say for the idea that you have 
an obligation to a transcendent ethic.

620
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:38,920
Now you make that claim in the moral 
landscape.

621
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,680
You you lay out a transcendent ethic in 
my estimation.

622
00:37:41,681 --> 00:37:46,681
That's one that puts the onus of 
responsibility on the individual to act 

623
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:53,671
in a way that at at minimum minimizes 
suffering and so and you think of that 

624
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:58,570
as a statement of fact that that's the 
proper way of being.

625
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:02,200
And I think aBout it as an axiomatic 
statement of faith and that's one of our

626
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:07,201
differences,
but I have been very careful in my 

627
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,821
analysis of the relationship between the
idea of sovereignty and the idea of 

628
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,490
religious belief,
and one of the things that I have worked

629
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:20,491
out,
I think partly from reading such people 

630
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:21,370
as eliana and young,
was that the.

631
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,400
There is an emergent idea of sovereignty
that does involve being accountable to a

632
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:30,570
god and neighbor here,
here's how I would justify that and I,

633
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:35,571
I would think about this essentially 
from a practical and biological 

634
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:38,761
perspective,
independent of any metaphysical reality 

635
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:38,761
that it might have.

636
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:40,810
So the ancient mesopotamians,
for example,

637
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:46,130
believed that their emperor was the 
incarnation or the representative of a 

638
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,031
god named martin,
and that actually bestowed certain 

639
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:55,000
ethical responsibilities on the ruler.
And so the ruler had to Be a good marduk

640
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:58,480
in order to be a sovereIgn,
to be regarded as sovereign.

641
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:02,080
He had to be the embodiment of these 
divine principles.

642
00:39:02,081 --> 00:39:06,040
And it took the mesopotamians a very,
very long period of time,

643
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,500
perhaps several tens of thousands of 
years.

644
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,660
They weren't mesopotamian during that 
whole time.

645
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:15,661
Obviously to work out what those 
principles of sovereignty should be and 

646
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:19,330
the mesopotamians encoded this in their 
fictions and their religious fictions,

647
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,660
making essentially the proposition that 
the proper ruler had to have eyes all 

648
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,670
the way around his head because that was
one of the attributes of martech.

649
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,760
So he was someone who was genuinely 
paying attention,

650
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,400
who is capable of coming into voluntary 
contact with,

651
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:40,690
with the great chaotic substructure of 
being and cutting it into pieces and 

652
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,391
making the habitable world and also 
speaking words that were truthful,

653
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,880
that had the power,
the magic power of truth,

654
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,210
and the the ruler had to act that out.

655
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,010
If he was going to be the sort of ruler 
that his people weren't entitled to slay

656
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:02,011
and sacrifice.
And then once a year at the new year's 

657
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:02,350
festival,
he would go outside the city,

658
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:07,351
the walled city,
and he would act out his role of marduk 

659
00:40:07,351 --> 00:40:11,010
and the priest would humiliate them and 
ask him to confess all the ways that he 

660
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,211
hadn't been a good martech so that he 
could remember that he had a 

661
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,960
responsibility to undertake this.
This to embody this relationship with 

662
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:24,061
these divine principles,
and the thing that's so important about 

663
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:26,761
this so absolutely crucially important 
is that it established the principle 

664
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,420
that even if you were at the top of a 
hierarchy,

665
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,690
you weren't absolute.
There was something above you that you 

666
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,621
were subordinate to,
and one of the extraordinarily useful 

667
00:40:37,621 --> 00:40:39,730
ideas about the abstraction of,
of even god as a personified spirit,

668
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:44,731
let's say,
is that it allows every leader to be 

669
00:40:44,731 --> 00:40:46,120
subordinate to something that's beyond 
him.

670
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,190
Now,
that doesn't mean it can't be misused,

671
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:49,330
but it's a very,
very,

672
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:50,800
very important idea.
Yeah,

673
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:51,280
except

674
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,930
you can also.
You can get there.

675
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,060
The other way around.
You can realize that you,

676
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,130
even if you're at the top of the 
hierarchy,

677
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:01,450
you are radically dependent on everyone 
else.

678
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:07,040
That the tip of the pyramid at the tip 
of a hierarchy doesn't believe that 

679
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,650
sometimes they believe they can do 
whatever the hell they want.

680
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:14,250
But I'm saying if,
if you're going to believe something 

681
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:17,460
that's compatible with,
with rationality globally and has the 

682
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,390
least conceivable downside,
I would put in that place,

683
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:24,391
not a superstitious attachment to a 
notion of an invisible friend,

684
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,750
uh,
or punisher who's,

685
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,810
who's above you.
I would put in its place they totally 

686
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,080
defensible and palpably true fact that 
we,

687
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,630
that you can be the king of the,
of the,

688
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,630
of the world,
and you are dependent on everyone around

689
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,660
you to eat,
to not be murdered by them.

690
00:41:44,661 --> 00:41:46,130
I mean like you are,
you are,

691
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,660
you are.

692
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,980
I mean,
it's amazing.

693
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:53,981
It's amazing how precarious even a 
totalitarian regime is.

694
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:57,800
I mean,
the amazing thing is that,

695
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,690
that these,
the last at all,

696
00:41:59,691 --> 00:42:04,691
because in many cases it would just take
a 50 people to act in unison to kill the

697
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:05,840
tyrant,
right?

698
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,350
But it never happens because we either 
have a first mover problem.

699
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,480
Everyone is afraid to be the first 
person shot.

700
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,900
But it is,
it is a genuine mystery that these 

701
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,270
systems even perpetuate themselves.
And when they unravel,

702
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,220
when you see,
you know,

703
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:23,000
kadafi being murdered in a crowd,
you realize,

704
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:28,001
wow,
it really is just a matter of the 

705
00:42:28,001 --> 00:42:30,491
restraint and fear of human beings 
keeping any of these things together.

706
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,920
A benign,
if you,

707
00:42:31,921 --> 00:42:36,921
if you wanted a hierarchy where you had 
a kind of benign philosopher king 

708
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,890
pulling the reigns of a society,
I'm not saying we do,

709
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,160
but even there you could have an ethical
one.

710
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:48,161
You could have one where and,
and a non superstitious one was the one 

711
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:48,380
where someone recognize,
hey,

712
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:50,000
this is,
this is how we're doing it,

713
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,060
but we are radically.
I at the top of this hierarchy,

714
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:58,061
am radically dependent on having,
being surrounded by as many happy people

715
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:00,930
as possible.
Well

716
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,520
look,
I mean I don't,

717
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,780
I don't in some profound sense

718
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,480
we're actually,
you know,

719
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,640
we're living in this sounds like a 
fiction,

720
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,490
but we're living with this problem and 
we encounter this more and more when you

721
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:13,700
talk,
you know,

722
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,520
in,
in silicon valley as,

723
00:43:15,521 --> 00:43:18,130
as you and I occasionally do and I'm 
sure you do as well,

724
00:43:18,131 --> 00:43:21,880
where you meet people who are 
fantastically wealthy,

725
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,360
who seem uncannily detached at the,
by the detached,

726
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:34,650
at the fact that the,
there's this growing chasm between them 

727
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,361
and those they know and the rest of 
humanity and one begins to wonder what 

728
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,650
level of wealth inequality will everyone
find alarming.

729
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:49,950
And some people are acting as though 
there is no level that is alarming that 

730
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,791
the,
that there's kind of a law of nature 

731
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,561
that this thing can grow.
Just impossibly to the point where we 

732
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:58,180
have trillionaires walking around.
Uh,

733
00:43:58,181 --> 00:44:01,870
and you know,
you drive into their motorcades and it's

734
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:06,871
kind of a,
I mean it's sort of the libertarian 

735
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:08,551
religion one occasionally runs into a 
and clearly there's some level of 

736
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:12,010
inequality that's untenable or at least 
would be undesirable.

737
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:18,110
It's a funny thing because that's a 
place where our thought loops and then 

738
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,471
agrees to some degree again,
because I do believe that you can in 

739
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:26,541
some sense,
rationally derive an an ethic.

740
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,290
So,
so let's,

741
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:33,350
let's,
let's take the argument that you put 

742
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:33,350
forward.
Say that,

743
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,490
well,
you're,

744
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,440
and this is an extension of your 
wellbeing argument to some degree,

745
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,390
which with which I've thought about a 
fair bit.

746
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:40,080
It's like,
well,

747
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:43,440
okay,
what's the optimal solution for you?

748
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,090
Well,
okay,

749
00:44:45,091 --> 00:44:50,070
well first of all,
there isn't just you now there's you now

750
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:54,150
and you tomorrow and you next week and 
you and a year you in five years.

751
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,330
So there's you and the you that 
propagates across time.

752
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:01,860
So one of the implications of that is 
that you can't do anything that's really

753
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,160
good for the eu now that isn't very good
for you a week from now.

754
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,060
Right?

755
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,270
So that means you have to imagine 
yourself as multiple individuals across 

756
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:15,501
multiple timeframes,
and then you have to figure out what's 

757
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:16,080
good for all those individuals across 
all those timeframes.

758
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,310
Although you discount the future to some
degree because of its unpredictability.

759
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,520
But then so,
so that's a very tIght set of 

760
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:25,520
constraints and you might say,
well,

761
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,080
a rational person would calculate the 
optimal across all those,

762
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:33,170
all those multiple timeframes.
Then you do the same thing with other 

763
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,230
people,
which is the point you just made.

764
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,360
Well it isn't just you because who's 
you.

765
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:41,361
There's you and your family.
Most people are in a situation where 

766
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:45,830
they would regard damage to theIr family
as perhaps even worse than damage to 

767
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,911
them.
So whatever they are obviously 

768
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:52,491
encapsulates their family and then to 
some degree that flows off into the 

769
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:55,701
community and so there is no isolated 
you and that sort of point with regards 

770
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:55,920
to the ethic.

771
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,230
But then so,
so I agree with all that.

772
00:45:58,231 --> 00:46:03,231
But then one of the things that I would 
suggest is that because that's an 

773
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:07,761
incredibly difficult rational 
calculation and perhaps an impossible 

774
00:46:07,761 --> 00:46:09,630
one technically speaking,
but certainly very difficult.

775
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,170
That's what that what has happened in 
part as our,

776
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:16,710
as our great narratives have heavy 
merged across time,

777
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:21,711
is that we have observed ourself 
attempting to solve that multiple 

778
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,510
identity,
multiple timeframe problem.

779
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:29,010
And we've told stories about people who 
do that exceptionally well,

780
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:34,160
and then we've winnowed out those 
stories and we've produced these 

781
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,460
powerful narratives that encapsulate the
ethic,

782
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:39,150
that does in fact reflect that wisdom 
and so,

783
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:44,180
so,
and I think you actually accept some of 

784
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:44,460
that in your,
in your moral propositions,

785
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:46,350
which is something that we've talked 
about before.

786
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:48,450
So for example,
they'll never really agreed on.

787
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,790
You certainly believe,
for example,

788
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:55,791
that the embodiment of truth is one of 
the means whereby you solve the problem 

789
00:46:56,611 --> 00:47:01,611
of ethics.
And I would say that that's a deeply 

790
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:02,440
rooted,
judeo christian concept that that well

791
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,730
rooted that it proceeds any notion of 
religious provincialism.

792
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,430
I mean it's,
it's,

793
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:14,431
it's deeper than judeo christian.
It's deeper than our humanity on some 

794
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,061
level.
At one point we talked about the golden 

795
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:18,061
rule and I said that,
that the,

796
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:20,950
the precursor to the golden rule can be 
found even among monkeys.

797
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:26,010
right?
It's the golden rule is the rule for 

798
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,010
monkeys.
Yes,

799
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,010
exactly,
exactly.

800
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,660
Let me just add to the picture you 
sketched out.

801
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:29,800
I,
I agree with.

802
00:47:29,801 --> 00:47:34,801
We have a,
we have an ethical obligation even to 

803
00:47:34,801 --> 00:47:34,990
our future selves,
right?

804
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:36,610
I mean we are in relationship to who we 
will,

805
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,670
who's going to be the person who is 
drinking his fourth scotch tonight will 

806
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:46,081
be had some ethical relationship to the 
person who's going to wake up with a 

807
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:49,681
hangover tomorrow morning and and one 
thing we know for sure in which we have 

808
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:55,060
begun to deeply understand that 
described scientifically as w we are bad

809
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,910
at all of these calculations,
right?

810
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,930
Like the,
the hyperbolic discounting,

811
00:47:58,931 --> 00:47:59,890
a future rewards.

812
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:03,860
That's also why I think we have these 
stringent limitations on rationality.

813
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:08,861
Sap,
is that we can't solve the problem 

814
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:08,861
through calculation.

815
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:08,861
Well,
I don't know,

816
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:12,781
but we we increasingly can and and even 
where it's best summarized not by 

817
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:18,481
capital.
ONe thing I'll grant you is that it's 

818
00:48:18,481 --> 00:48:20,851
not always best conveyed or rendered 
Indelible and actionable by being being 

819
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,300
given a nature paper or an abstract 
from,

820
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,690
from a paper in the literature and being
told,

821
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:31,450
this is the way you want to behave,
to maximize your wellbeing.

822
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,780
It may best be conveyed by certain 
stories or certain books that are that 

823
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,080
are in the philosophy section of the 
bookstore,

824
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,830
not the science section and but you 
aren't.

825
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:45,840
You and I were at the book signing the 
other night and someone came up with 

826
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,650
with a copy of the meditations of marcus
aurelius.

827
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,760
Write a fantastic book.
There's so much wisdom in that book,

828
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,850
right?
And there's nothing about stoning a girl

829
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:56,860
to death if she's not a virgin on her 
wedding day.

830
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,400
Now we all recognize that marcus 
aurelius was a human being who wrote 

831
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:08,701
this book and that that provenance is no
barrier to take in the book deadly 

832
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,100
seriously.
It's an incredibly useful book.

833
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:20,101
And stoicism,
stoicism could be the quote religion or 

834
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:22,600
the guiding philosophy of the west.
It could,

835
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:27,601
it would be a much better one than 
judaism or christianity and and as have 

836
00:49:27,601 --> 00:49:29,620
none,
virtually none of the downside.

837
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,550
and so that's my point,
that we're,

838
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:36,551
we're in this perverse circumstance of 
being held hostage by certain products 

839
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:40,030
of,
of literature,

840
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,780
and we need to break the spell and if,
if,

841
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:49,080
if we're finding it this hard to break,
what do we think is gonna happen in the 

842
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,170
middle east or in subsaharan africa?
I mean we,

843
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,760
we,
the,

844
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:57,330
the moral progress we need to engineer 
is a common humanity coming together.

845
00:49:57,611 --> 00:49:57,790
Okay.

846
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:01,620
Shared values are.
Those are perfectly credible arguments.

847
00:50:01,621 --> 00:50:05,370
But the weakness in the argument I think
is the one that we started to talk about

848
00:50:05,371 --> 00:50:10,371
earlier,
which is that when you talked with dave 

849
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:11,850
rubin and while back and michael shermer
said the same thing recently,

850
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:14,710
he,
he basically said that atheism is a,

851
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,770
is a doctrine of negation.
That's what you said with ruben is that 

852
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,330
there isn't that positive ethos in 
atheism.

853
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,900
All it says is that there's no,
there's nothinG persona,

854
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,600
there's nothing transcendent.
It's something like that.

855
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:34,601
There is no god.
And so and so the problem with the 

856
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:34,601
atheist,

857
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:36,400
it's not even the assertion that there 
is no god,

858
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:41,260
it's just that it's a failure to be 
convinced by any of the gods on offer.

859
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,380
It's just like not believing in zoos,

860
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,090
fine.
And it's not like it's a week.

861
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:50,091
It's not like it's a weak argument.
I mean I'm perfectly aware of that 

862
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:53,390
making a day istick case or a case for 
religion in the face of the claims of 

863
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,890
the rationalist atheist is perhaps while
it's a very,

864
00:50:55,891 --> 00:51:00,450
very difficult thing to manage.
but it is also the case that.

865
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:05,510
And this is where I think we differ with
regards to what happened say in the 

866
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,410
soviet union and perhaps to to also in 
nazi Germany,

867
00:51:07,411 --> 00:51:09,420
is that when,
when,

868
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,440
when,
when,

869
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:15,950
when your doctrine demolishes the,
that's called it the literary or 

870
00:51:16,651 --> 00:51:21,651
fictional substructure and leaves,
nothing behind an esco.

871
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:26,070
An ethos needs to be provided because 
something will rush in to fill the void.

872
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,130
And it certainly the case,
and this is what niche you warned about,

873
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:34,131
even though he was a strident 
antichristian and it's also what 

874
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:34,131
dostoevsky first saw.

875
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:38,060
He said,
if we knock out the logos from the 

876
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:41,630
substructure of western society and we 
need you to believe that it was 

877
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,060
christianity's emphasis on truth that 
destroyed christianity,

878
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,670
which was an extremely interesting 
criticism.

879
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,700
You know,
christianity had been elevated to truth 

880
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,671
to such a degree that it would.
It actually resulted in the demolition 

881
00:51:55,671 --> 00:51:59,451
of its own dogmatic substructure,
but be that as it made niches 

882
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:03,320
prognostication was that if we allowed 
god to die and perhaps there are reasons

883
00:52:03,661 --> 00:52:06,200
for that,
that the consequence would be that would

884
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:11,270
be we would be awash in both nihilism 
and totalitarian bloodshed and that is 

885
00:52:11,281 --> 00:52:13,110
what happened in the 20th century and

886
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:18,750
so and there's another.
There's another aspect to that which is 

887
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,690
what you made you made trying to knock 
out the whole thing.

888
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,090
Take out some of the substructure but 
not the whole thinG.

889
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,670
That's what nature also showed that his 
prediction,

890
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:30,671
and I think it's blindinGly obviously 
true that you might end this post 

891
00:52:30,671 --> 00:52:33,950
christian era,
have a reminisce of christianity such as

892
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,660
guilt,
overbearing,

893
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:40,250
guilt and no means of alleviation or 
redemption,

894
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:44,040
which is actually part of the problem of
protestantism by the way because it's,

895
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:45,010
you know,
and,

896
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,020
and,
and there are other things too that it 

897
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,831
seemed to be,
seemed to be fundamental religious 

898
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:52,260
issues that,
that secular,

899
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,600
I think have a difficult time accounting
for it.

900
00:52:54,601 --> 00:52:59,601
It'S like,
so you actually have to grapple 

901
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:02,751
serIously with the problem that a 
doctrine that's essentially one of 

902
00:53:02,751 --> 00:53:04,260
negation doesn't offer a positive ethos 
and now,

903
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:06,720
and you are doing now to be perfectly 
fair,

904
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:11,721
you said that reading a nature paper 
about the necessity of calculating your 

905
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:16,350
ethic across multiple,
multiple timeframes and multiple persons

906
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:21,470
doesn't have the motive force that's 
going to drive you to act ethically and 

907
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,110
life.
And I do believe that's true,

908
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:26,190
but I think the fact that the ethos

909
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:31,020
doesn't have motivational push is 
actually a fatal flaw.

910
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,050
They don't meet every week to read 
marcus aurelius music.

911
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,820
There's no music that goes along with 
it,

912
00:53:38,821 --> 00:53:43,821
there's no art that goes along with it.
There's no architecture that goes along 

913
00:53:43,821 --> 00:53:43,821
with it like,

914
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:50,220
but to be fair to the present,
most music and mozart and most 

915
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,731
architecture is no longer religious that
is flown the perch provided by religion 

916
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,970
traditionally and most of what we care 
about in increasingly cosmopolitan and 

917
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,800
secular societies is not tied to 
religion in any direct way and there's 

918
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:14,310
even whole religions like judaism where 
you have to look long and hard to find 

919
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,420
anyone who believes much of anything 
that is religious,

920
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:21,590
right?
I have literally sat on stage debating 

921
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,350
what I thought was a religious rabbi who
was a conservative rabbi and when I,

922
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,690
when I said something that assume that 
he believed in a god who could hear our 

923
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:30,070
prayers,
he threw up his hands and he said,

924
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:35,071
what makes you think?
I believe in a god who can hear prayers 

925
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:35,071
and I was just,
you know,

926
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,180
I practically lost the debate.
Just be in,

927
00:54:37,181 --> 00:54:39,070
in my astonishment,
you know,

928
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,840
what does it mean to be a conservative 
rabbi in this case?

929
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,260
There are religions that have made that 
transition to a,

930
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:54,360
an increasingly attenuated commitment to
the truth of the doctrine and there are 

931
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:59,200
religions who haven't moved an inch 
right?

932
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,120
And,
and,

933
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:03,290
and,
but I think we have to acknowledge that,

934
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,940
that this,
this movement in this direction is 

935
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,151
progress because what it,
what it actually is at bottom is 

936
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,400
increasing sensitivity to the difference
between having good reasons and bad 

937
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,020
reasons for what you believe.
Right?

938
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:21,580
And,
and the fact that the,

939
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,340
that this book has been around forever 
is not a good reason.

940
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:26,300
The fact that mommy told me so

941
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,660
well it is.
It's actually,

942
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,920
it's not a terrible reason though 
because the fact that something has 

943
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,591
lasted for that length of time at least 
makes the fact that it's lasted a 

944
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:40,881
mystery and you can't just attribute 
that to casual politicking or economic 

945
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:41,630
circumstances.
There's,

946
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:46,670
there's something at look you can say 
about many of the biblical stories is 

947
00:55:47,611 --> 00:55:52,611
that they're incredibly memorable and 
that means that in some sense they're 

948
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:53,960
adapted to the memory structures.

949
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,930
So is the,
the mythology of ancient Greece.

950
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,250
It's incredibly memorable,
but,

951
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,440
but I don't.
I don't all those gods or did the 

952
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,400
stories still can be useful,
but the god fear bibs on,

953
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:09,020
let's say it lives on in a way that is 
benign.

954
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,790
It lives on in a way where you learn 
about them in mythology class,

955
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,260
in school,
right?

956
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:20,280
You don't have it.
You don't have a fear of hades drummed 

957
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,230
into you as a child by your parents.

958
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:24,130
The other thing that is,
as far as I can

959
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,550
tell in the rationalist doctrine,
and this is something that I've observed

960
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:31,300
in my clinical practice,
and so one of the things that's happened

961
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,210
over the last years that I've had many 
people,

962
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:39,211
especially ex soldiers,
come to my lecturers who have 

963
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:42,130
posttraumatic stress disorder and they 
say that listening to my lectures,

964
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:44,500
especially the ones on good evil and 
tragedy.

965
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,500
There's a partIcular lecture that I 
suppose you might be.

966
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,800
You might think about as devoted to 
people who have posttraumatIc stress 

967
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,651
disorder and that the language of good 
and evil that I lay out in those 

968
00:56:55,651 --> 00:57:00,121
lectures is actually what allows them to
recover from the posttraumatic stress 

969
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:02,350
disorder and dealing with people like 
that in my clinical practice.

970
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:07,530
The same thing as being the case.
If we can't transcend the language of 

971
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:11,860
the merely rational and move into an 
intense conversation about good and evil

972
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,990
in some senses,
metaphysical realities.

973
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,040
We can't enter a realm of seriousness,
conceptual seriousness,

974
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:23,310
that's of sufficient depth to help heal 
someone who's been touched by 

975
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:27,601
malevolence because that actually is 
what happens to people with 

976
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:29,770
posttraumatic stress disorder,
is that inevitably the reason that there

977
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:33,550
are so shattered isn't because something
tragic has happened to them.

978
00:57:33,551 --> 00:57:37,840
Although that does happen upon occasion.
It's because someone malevolent has made

979
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:42,280
contact with them and sometimes that 
malevolent being let's say,

980
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:45,400
or blunt force or spirit,
for lack of a better word,

981
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,640
is something that resides within them.
And so there we have these lImits on 

982
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,261
rational did.
And the reason I'm making this cases 

983
00:57:55,261 --> 00:57:55,261
because we've already identified another
limit of rational discourse.

984
00:57:55,261 --> 00:58:00,241
It's like it doesn't have the motivating
power of great fiction and great 

985
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:05,281
literature and great poetry,
but it also doesn't have the healing 

986
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,491
power of language that that takes the 
ethical realm to it's extreme in some 

987
00:58:09,221 --> 00:58:11,880
sense and and then the next problem 
without,

988
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,930
and this is something that douglass has 
been,

989
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:17,050
has been contemplating,
I would say,

990
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:22,530
is that what?
What evidence do we have that a merely 

991
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:27,571
secular representation,
irrational representation of our ethic 

992
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:30,340
is going to provide us with a motive 
force that would be sufficient for us to

993
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:35,341
do such things as identify what's 
valuable about our culture and be 

994
00:58:35,341 --> 00:58:40,051
motivated to sufficiently protected 
assuming that there's something worthy 

995
00:58:40,051 --> 00:58:40,450
of protection,

996
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,260
but we know what a few of those things 
are and they have.

997
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,380
They have nothing to do with what's on 
the inside of a church or a synagogue or

998
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:53,381
a mosque.
They have to do with things like free 

999
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:53,381
speech,
right?

1000
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:56,740
Like the trench we are all fighting in 
is at least one of them is defense of 

1001
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,560
the free exchange of ideas and that has 
put in peril by many kinds of 

1002
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,851
orthodoxies.
But some are the old orthodoxy Is the 

1003
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,971
blasphemy laws and the people who want 
states to be killed relieving in this 

1004
00:59:13,431 --> 00:59:15,070
case islam.
So it's,

1005
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,380
it's a that,
it,

1006
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,750
those are some of the sacred.
I would,

1007
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:25,730
if were going to list the,
the sacred artifacts of that that keeps,

1008
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,090
that keeps our society worth living in 
there.

1009
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:36,010
I think the list is going to be very 
long before we start getting to the 

1010
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,310
actual sacred objects.
So anyone faith,

1011
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,640
but we,
it will be things like freedom of speech

1012
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:44,960
and freedom of assembly and,
and the,

1013
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:50,020
uh,
the free exchange of ideas across 

1014
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,500
boundaries.
the fact that we are no longer,

1015
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,760
uh,
religiously,

1016
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:53,250
uh,
or,

1017
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:53,910
or,
or,

1018
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,440
or linguistically or geographically 
partitioned in the ideas.

1019
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,390
We cAn entertain it.

1020
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,670
Well,
it seems to me though,

1021
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,270
and this may be my own,
my own idiosyncratic reading of the,

1022
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,150
of the,
of the domain.

1023
01:00:06,151 --> 01:00:10,890
But when I look at something like,
like I've often considered the cathedral

1024
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:11,670
dome,
let's say,

1025
01:00:11,671 --> 01:00:16,671
and there are very old cathedral domes 
that have an image of christ put up 

1026
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:16,920
against the dome,
right?

1027
01:00:16,921 --> 01:00:19,800
So as,
as creator of the cosmos,

1028
01:00:19,801 --> 01:00:20,240
okay,
Canada,

1029
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:25,490
I'm trying to look at that from a 
psychological and even a biological 

1030
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:28,491
perspective and what I see is the 
elevation of a particular image that 

1031
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:30,840
represents an ideal and so the,
the,

1032
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,630
the christ that's represented on the,
on the,

1033
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:38,690
on the dome of the cathedral is 
something that's projected up into 

1034
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,140
celestial space.
So it's an ideal to which you were 

1035
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,410
supposed to be subordinate or that 
you're supposed to embody.

1036
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,850
And now ideal is the ideal of the logos.
Technically speaking,

1037
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,680
the logos,
the word made flesh,

1038
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:53,670
which is not only the word free speech 
for lack of a better term,

1039
01:00:53,671 --> 01:00:57,360
but also the embodiment of that elevated
to the highest principle.

1040
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:02,770
and that is given status as the creator 
of the universe.

1041
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:07,791
and the reason for that in part,
and this is written into the judeo 

1042
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:10,971
christian doctrine right from line one,
is the idea that it's through the 

1043
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:14,580
discourse that you value so much that we
actually engender the world as such,

1044
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:18,420
and that is a divine principle and it's 
also in my reading,

1045
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,410
the divine image of god that men and 
women are made in.

1046
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:27,530
And so what I see in the underlying 
metaphysic were where you see 

1047
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:29,310
superstition and,
and fundamentalism and look fair enough.

1048
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,560
And it's not like.
I would never argue that that's not a 

1049
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,170
danger.
I see the images stick and,

1050
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,670
and,
and dramatized representation of exactly

1051
01:01:38,671 --> 01:01:41,670
the idea that you hold to be paramount 
above all else.

1052
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:45,000
Which is your commitment to truth 
expressed in speech.

1053
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,530
Okay.
What's my concern,

1054
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,560
and this is where I started with you,
is that you could give the same 

1055
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,971
charitable reading of astrology and 
you'd even be tempted to do it a,

1056
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,860
as we,
as we talk about astrology as you showed

1057
01:01:58,861 --> 01:02:01,560
at the outset now,
but I don't.

1058
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,970
Why is it a charitable reading,
sam?

1059
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:08,590
Like how else would you explAin the 
existence of something like a cathedral?

1060
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:11,240
I don't.
what the hell are people doing when they

1061
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:16,241
built them saying we could.
It's by dent of mirror historical 

1062
01:02:16,241 --> 01:02:20,441
contingency and questionable look that 
we're not living in a world where the 

1063
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:25,800
cathedrals have stained glass windows 
with signs of the zodiac on them.

1064
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,600
Right?
We could be in that world.

1065
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,340
Well,
we are.

1066
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:33,370
We are.
We were very close to being in that 

1067
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,020
world to some degree because the 
astrological endeavor in the judaeo 

1068
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:40,431
christian landscape expanded to 
incorporate christianity and there's an 

1069
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:42,280
entire astrology of christianity 
including representation.

1070
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:42,670
Christ

1071
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,620
fruit.
Yeah.

1072
01:02:45,621 --> 01:02:46,130
Yes.
So,

1073
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:51,180
but my point is that we recognize that 
the literal claims of astrology,

1074
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,400
the mechanism by which astrologers think
it works is intellectually bankrupt.

1075
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:01,610
Right?
And if any significant mayhem were being

1076
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,830
caused by people's commitment to 
astrology,

1077
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,950
if we had presidents of the United 
States who couldn't get elected unless,

1078
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:11,180
unless they paid lip service to a 
literal believer in astrology,

1079
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,370
if we had presidents who were consulting
there,

1080
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:16,490
astrologers to figure out when to meet 
with other world leaders,

1081
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,860
right?
This,

1082
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,460
this will be a problem that that 
rational people would recognize me.

1083
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:25,760
Astrology can be disproven in a single 
hour.

1084
01:03:25,761 --> 01:03:30,500
You just simply have to go to one 
hospital in one city sometime and find,

1085
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,560
find two unrelated children born in the 
save within 20 feet of each other and 

1086
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:40,811
follow their lives and if they have 
different lives than than than then the 

1087
01:03:40,811 --> 01:03:42,050
signs of the zodiac mean nothing.

1088
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:47,100
Part of your argument is an invalidly,
so is hoW in the world do we determine 

1089
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,990
which revelatory axioms are worthy of 
respect and of maintenance and fair 

1090
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:52,930
enough,

1091
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:55,140
maybe none,
maybe not,

1092
01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:00,270
but maybe it is just a matter of 
conscious agents like ourselves having 

1093
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,020
better and better conversation.

1094
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,540
Well that while it is certainly partly 
that,

1095
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:05,280
it is certainly partly that,
but let me,

1096
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:10,550
because again,
revelation in my book is nothing other 

1097
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,601
than a record of past conversations.
So you've either got iron age 

1098
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:17,250
conversations shaping your worldview or 
you have conversations like these

1099
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:20,870
when you're worried you have both.
You can have both.

1100
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:24,390
You have a dialogue with the past which 
brings

1101
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,000
made a marcus aurelius.
I read him with great pleasure and great

1102
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:28,690
and,
and,

1103
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,430
and astonishment,
frankly,

1104
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:35,431
I mean it is such a modern and edifying 
take on ethics and,

1105
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,050
and one's own personal wellbeing and 
just not getting,

1106
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:42,430
just not being encumbered by the,
by thoughts and,

1107
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:44,360
and,
and vanities that,

1108
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,380
that are,
that are so easy to cut through once you

1109
01:04:47,381 --> 01:04:50,470
notice them,
but so captivating and deranging of your

1110
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:52,060
life when you don't.
And he,

1111
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,310
I mean the wisdom in that book than,
than,

1112
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:59,311
than almost any book I can name.
And you don't have to believe any 

1113
01:04:59,311 --> 01:04:59,311
bullshit to

1114
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:01,800
let me offer you a continued explication
here.

1115
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:06,801
So,
and you didn't answer my question about 

1116
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:06,801
what all these crazy medieval people 
were doing,

1117
01:05:06,801 --> 01:05:08,730
spending almost all of their excess 
capital,

1118
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:11,760
building a representation of the sky and
putting an image on that.

1119
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:13,020
So just hang on a sec.
So,

1120
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,500
so let's talk about what it would mean 
to embody the truth.

1121
01:05:17,770 --> 01:05:21,130
So there's a deep idea and christianity 
that this is what it would mean.

1122
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:26,080
It would mean to confront the suffering 
of life voluntarily to its fullest,

1123
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:31,081
which would mean to accept the necessity
of death and betrayal of the hands of 

1124
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:36,061
your fellow men without undue bitterness
to accept that voluntarily and 

1125
01:05:36,151 --> 01:05:38,560
antisocial.
Understand that your fundamental ethical

1126
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:43,561
task is to work towards the redemption 
of the world and that's associated with 

1127
01:05:43,561 --> 01:05:47,701
that image that's cast upon the heavenly
dome and I and that isn't a charitable 

1128
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:48,580
reading,
sam.

1129
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:53,860
That's a.
That's an essential analysis of the 

1130
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:53,860
fundamental doctrines of christianity.

1131
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:58,030
Yes,
but I could do the same thing with 

1132
01:05:58,030 --> 01:05:58,030
buddhism and give you a slightly 
different story,

1133
01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:01,320
but nonetheless inspiring and edifying 
and I could do the same thing with you,

1134
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,690
but you can't do it with rationality,
but I can do it.

1135
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:05,840
I can do it with green.
No,

1136
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:06,100
no,
no.

1137
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:09,350
That's not true.
I can do it with greek mythology.

1138
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:14,530
I can do it with any of these domains,
but the crucial bit for me is that in 

1139
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:19,331
order to make use of those stories,
I don't have to believe in revelation.

1140
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:22,580
I don't have to,
but I don't have to believe that you get

1141
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:26,570
everything you want to after you die,
suggesting that you know no,

1142
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:31,580
but I'm talking about the applause of 
conventionally religious people who 

1143
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:36,431
think that their conventional religion 
is in some way cashed out or redeemed or

1144
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:42,791
supported by the reading your given now 
of the of christ in the starry heavens.

1145
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,120
It's not unless you're adding this other
piece,

1146
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:51,170
which is some probabilistic claim that 
yes,

1147
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,200
this book probably was dictated by an 
omniscient being unlike any other book 

1148
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,910
or maybe the muslims are right there.
Archangel gabriel did show up to 

1149
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,941
muhammad and his cave and give him the 
one final revelation never to be 

1150
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:07,220
superseded and just on the merits of the
text.

1151
01:07:07,221 --> 01:07:11,450
We know that's not true.
We know for all it gets wrong and all it

1152
01:07:11,451 --> 01:07:14,000
fails to get right about the nature of 
our circumstance.

1153
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:18,110
We know that book is not the best book 
ever written on any topic,

1154
01:07:18,111 --> 01:07:19,870
and here I'm speaking of the koran,
but it's true.

1155
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:24,890
The bible is true.
It's true of the meditations of marcus 

1156
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:24,890
aurelius,
but the book,

1157
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:29,700
but no one's claiming that about the 
meditations and that's a crucial 

1158
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,900
difference.
It's a difference that that explained so

1159
01:07:32,901 --> 01:07:36,800
much unnecessary suffering in our world 
and again,

1160
01:07:36,801 --> 01:07:41,801
what I fear about the way you talk about
religion is that it'd be a at the end of

1161
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:49,750
all of these conversations,
I'm still not sure what you believe on 

1162
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:49,750
that point,
frankly,

1163
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,800
and if I'm not sure no one out there as 
well,

1164
01:07:53,841 --> 01:07:55,540
why don't know why.
I don't know why.

1165
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:59,050
Expect to be sure about what someone 
believes.

1166
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:04,051
How do you think that any one of you are
capable of fully articulating what you 

1167
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:04,051
believe you sir,

1168
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:09,500
you aren't completely ridiculous.
You're not transparent to yourself by 

1169
01:08:09,911 --> 01:08:13,360
any stretch of the imagination.
you act out all sorts of things that you

1170
01:08:13,361 --> 01:08:15,300
can't articulate what but how you.

1171
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:17,670
How about at best gets.
Yeah,

1172
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,050
no.
If you look,

1173
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:22,780
let's go on cognitive neuroscience on 
this,

1174
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:27,781
shall we?
Ninety nine percent of your processing 

1175
01:08:27,781 --> 01:08:30,451
is unconscious.
You're not capable of articulating 

1176
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:30,451
yourselves.
If you were,

1177
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:32,830
you'd be omniscient.
Give me any nonsense about that,

1178
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:34,690
but that is a.

1179
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:43,540
I've never heard so many people applaud 
and of a of a simple question.

1180
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:45,740
It was a good one,

1181
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,450
honestly.
Yes.

1182
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,510
Everything you just said about not being
fully transparent to yourself is true 

1183
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,860
and you are ruled by committee in there 
all the time.

1184
01:08:57,861 --> 01:08:59,740
No doubt,
but I'm at.

1185
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,900
I'm asking what you actually believe.
I mean,

1186
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:05,450
there's several things I can ask a 
asset.

1187
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:08,170
I mean almost any one of these threads 
can,

1188
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:12,620
can pull the whole tapestry,
but to take christianity as an example,

1189
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:18,340
what do you believe about this,
the origin of this sacred book,

1190
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:20,690
the bible,
old and new testament.

1191
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:25,691
Do you believe that just maybe it has a 
status unlike any other book or is it 

1192
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:32,420
simply old Writing of human beings just 
like ourselves?

1193
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:33,690
I think it's both.

1194
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:34,880
Okay.
So,

1195
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:35,420
but,
but,

1196
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:36,530
but.
So what does that mean?

1197
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,560
That you're.
So you're saying you're saying that 

1198
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,860
there's somebody who's taking dictation 
that is unlike any other dictation.

1199
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:44,330
So,
so homer

1200
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:46,280
though creative or shakespeare they'll 
create.

1201
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:49,110
It was sources of inspiration.
Okay.

1202
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,820
But everyone's been inspired.
If you talk to creative people basically

1203
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:58,930
often described themselves as something 
approximating a conduit through which 

1204
01:09:58,930 --> 01:09:59,290
higher wisdom is pouring.

1205
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:04,430
Again,
you're dodging shakes that shakespeare 

1206
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,770
could say that and any writer can say 
that really ultimately,

1207
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:09,110
and it's also the case that we would or 
we would rank organize.

1208
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:14,140
We would rank order those writers,
which is why you pointed to shakespeare 

1209
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,970
in terms of the generalizable validity 
of the revelations.

1210
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,290
Sure.
So well look,

1211
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:19,820
so,
so you run into the same issue.

1212
01:10:19,821 --> 01:10:22,190
You know you criticize the bible and 
look fair enough.

1213
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,080
You know the man,
but you're,

1214
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:27,020
you're also evading a very important 
issue which is how do you,

1215
01:10:27,230 --> 01:10:32,230
how do you quantitatively rank the 
contributions of literature without 

1216
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:33,170
assuming that there's a hierarchy of 
revelation?

1217
01:10:33,710 --> 01:10:35,590
Well though,
there's a hierarchy of wisdom.

1218
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:38,200
Sure,
there's a hierarchy of human wisdom.

1219
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:40,000
I will grant you that everyday of the 
week,

1220
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,440
but this is what we're talking about.
primates like ourselves having 

1221
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,460
conversations and this is the most 
important game.

1222
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:51,640
We can play this.
This is the best game in town and it has

1223
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:55,440
always been so.
But people are imagining and,

1224
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:57,730
and it includes,
as you said at the outset,

1225
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:01,570
what I would call spiritual experience 
and spiritual experience,

1226
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,600
is it mit's have a fact based discussion
about the nature of human consciousness 

1227
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:07,150
and

1228
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:10,510
why do you allow that as an exception?
Like it because

1229
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,600
is part of the dataset.
So it's

1230
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:18,660
possible.
So this is spiritual experience without 

1231
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,260
the possible of possibility of 
concretized revelation.

1232
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:23,500
So it's a formless spirituality that 
you're advocating.

1233
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:23,870
No,
no,

1234
01:11:23,871 --> 01:11:24,400
it,
it,

1235
01:11:24,401 --> 01:11:25,580
you,
you can have.

1236
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:29,240
I'm not even,
I'm not even discounting the possibility

1237
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,600
that there are invisible entities out 
there in the universe far smarter than 

1238
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,220
ourselves who we could possibly be in 
dialogue with.

1239
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:42,460
I mean there are many strange ideas that
we could defend to one or another degree

1240
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:46,250
that there are people walking around 
speculating that we might be living in a

1241
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:51,251
computer simulation,
that all of this is being run on some 

1242
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:51,860
hard drive of the future or,
or some,

1243
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:56,861
you know,
alien supercomputer now that you can 

1244
01:11:56,861 --> 01:11:56,861
actually.
I mean,

1245
01:11:56,861 --> 01:12:00,641
nick bostrom and oxford gives a very 
cogent argument in defense of that 

1246
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:01,700
thesis right now.
You can,

1247
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:06,760
you can deal with that on its merits.
I'm not saying the university isn't 

1248
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:06,830
stranger than we suppose or even kenzo 
pose,

1249
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:11,480
but one thing we know is that when you 
read the bible,

1250
01:12:11,481 --> 01:12:16,481
you can turn every page of that book and
you will not find evidence of 

1251
01:12:16,761 --> 01:12:17,830
omniscience.
You.

1252
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:22,831
You will not find anything in there that
someone as smart as shakespeare or 

1253
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:26,270
actually a little bit dumber could have 
written.

1254
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:27,940
No,
I don't think that's true.

1255
01:12:27,941 --> 01:12:29,030
Sam.
There are incredibly.

1256
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:34,700
There's whatever else they might say 
about the biblical writings are 

1257
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:37,861
incredibly potent nearby,
but so it's impossible to write 

1258
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:42,061
something.
It's virtually impossible to write 

1259
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:42,061
something like cain and abel was a 
paragraph saying shit.

1260
01:12:42,061 --> 01:12:42,061
You understand?
That

1261
01:12:42,350 --> 01:12:47,350
spirit of the shakespeare of of two,
3000 years ago couldn't have written 

1262
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:47,350
genesis.

1263
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,080
He couldn't have written to cain and 
abel not in 10 sentences,

1264
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:54,700
so then enable is 10 sentences long.
So then it contains more wisdom than you

1265
01:12:54,701 --> 01:12:55,930
can.
Then you can dig out.

1266
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:56,210
Okay,

1267
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:02,130
but now we're getting to the nub of it.
Then you think that it was not the 

1268
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:02,130
product of a human mind.

1269
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:07,880
I think it was the product of a vast 
collection of human minds working over 

1270
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:07,880
millennia.
Okay,

1271
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:12,550
so one of shakespeare's so,
but still we still,

1272
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:13,500
we've just got people,

1273
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,350
and this is,
but this concession,

1274
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,690
if indeed you're making it,
and I'm still not sure,

1275
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,600
is the eradication of traditional 
christianity.

1276
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:26,520
If something is deeply wise,
it's reflective of a deeper reality.

1277
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,240
otherwise it wouldn't be wise.
I'm in love with deeper reality,

1278
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:35,420
deeper reality that something is wise is
the story of cain and abel reflect 

1279
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,090
reality.

1280
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,720
The landscape of mind that we are that 
either takes great training,

1281
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:48,720
great luck or pharmacological 
bombardment of the human brain to 

1282
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,170
explore right there.
There is a way,

1283
01:13:50,171 --> 01:13:55,171
there are ways to get there.
There are ways to have the vision right 

1284
01:13:55,171 --> 01:13:59,100
and and if we will,
we understand this to some degree,

1285
01:14:00,251 --> 01:14:04,270
but experientially and we can understand
it to some degree by,

1286
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:09,630
by third per person,
methods of science and it's not.

1287
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:14,820
It's not like I don't,
I mean I've had many experiences that if

1288
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:20,341
I had them in a religious context would 
have counted for me as evidence of the 

1289
01:14:20,341 --> 01:14:21,430
truth of my religion.
Right?

1290
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:26,431
But because I was not brought up in a 
religious context and because I spend a 

1291
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:31,840
lot of time seeing the downside of that 
form of credulity,

1292
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,510
I have never been tempted to interpret 
these experiences that

1293
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,730
try a higher dose.
I prepped,

1294
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,700
believe me,
I'll,

1295
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:41,500
I'll,
I'll go.

1296
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,560
I'll play that game of poker with you 
all day long.

1297
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:49,030
Be surprised as well.
Maybe.

1298
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,480
Maybe.
Maybe there's our next podcast.

1299
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,890
Did you see a car that.
Okay,

1300
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:03,390
a question now.
So we're an hour and 15 minutes into 

1301
01:15:03,661 --> 01:15:08,590
this discussion and hypothetically what 
we will do is stop and,

1302
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:14,120
and go to q and a.
But our experience So far has been when 

1303
01:15:14,371 --> 01:15:17,130
we asked the audience,
because we have done that each time,

1304
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:22,700
whether we asked the audience whether we
should continue or whether we should go 

1305
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,570
to q and a.
So the first thing I'm going to do,

1306
01:15:24,571 --> 01:15:29,571
and you can vote on this by making a 
certain amount of noise if you're 

1307
01:15:29,571 --> 01:15:33,471
inclined to do so,
how many of you would like us to stop 

1308
01:15:33,471 --> 01:15:34,020
talking and go to q and a?

1309
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:42,870
How many of you would like us to 
continue this discussion for 45 more 

1310
01:15:42,870 --> 01:15:42,870
minutes?

1311
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,780
No,

1312
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:57,500
it seems to me that it's an objective 
fact is the ladder people have the 

1313
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:57,500
floor.

1314
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:03,240
It really is going to be a rude 
awakening when those applause or 

1315
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,240
reversed,
however.

1316
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:03,380
Yeah,
we know.

1317
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:09,170
Yeah.
So let,

1318
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:11,920
let,
let me yet what douglas say something.

1319
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:16,340
What was that last summer?
I was going to ask something.

1320
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:16,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1321
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:22,640
Um,
I forgot what I was going to ask you 

1322
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:22,640
something.
Let's go back.

1323
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:22,810
Let's go back

1324
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,350
to v two.
One of the core problems that we've been

1325
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:27,660
trying to address,
which is the,

1326
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:33,350
the apparent failure perhaps of the 
rationalist atheist types to develop a,

1327
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:44,290
an active ethos that has sufficient 
beauty and motivational power to serve 

1328
01:16:46,741 --> 01:16:49,890
as a credible replacement for the 
religious rituals.

1329
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:55,700
So there seems to,
there must be a reason why that's that 

1330
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:56,490
failure has occurred.

1331
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,020
Yeah.
Right.

1332
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:00,380
So,
or

1333
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:04,790
list of reasons.
One is that traditionally the impulse to

1334
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:08,120
do that in a religious context has been 
fatal.

1335
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:13,980
Right?
So to declare your apostasy has been 

1336
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:17,770
almost as reliable way of committing 
suicide as jumping off a building in 

1337
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:22,541
most cultures and most societies for the
longest time and still is in many places

1338
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:23,990
as you know,
in the muslim world.

1339
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:29,470
So there has been a barrier to entry to 
thinking creatively about alternatives 

1340
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:35,260
to religion and so much of atheism and 
secularism is just a,

1341
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,440
a,
a,

1342
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:40,370
a,
a pitched battle against the,

1343
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:45,730
the eroding power of religion.
And when religion really has its power,

1344
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,260
right?
We know what it's like.

1345
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,240
I mean,
again,

1346
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,890
I think what we spoke about this at one 
point,

1347
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:56,891
you know,
just that the moment that it makes this 

1348
01:17:56,891 --> 01:17:56,891
most salient is,
you know,

1349
01:17:56,891 --> 01:18:00,650
galileo being shown the instruments of 
torture by men who wouldn't look through

1350
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:01,550
his telescope.

1351
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:01,910
Right?
I mean,

1352
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:06,911
that's,
that was the point of contact between 

1353
01:18:06,911 --> 01:18:09,620
untrammeled human rationality and the,
the womb that bore it,

1354
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:13,550
right?
Your real religious are at,

1355
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:15,170
at the beauty of the heavens.
Right?

1356
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:20,410
So the moment a person like galileo 
stepped a little too far and to connect 

1357
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:22,310
us to astrology again,
galileo was a court astrologer,

1358
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,470
right?
and they were,

1359
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:28,540
there was a car,
there was a point of contact between 

1360
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:30,311
astronomy and astrology at that point.
So we're still under the shadow of that 

1361
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:35,180
kind of dogmatism and oppression in much
of the world.

1362
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,280
I mean,
for the longest time,

1363
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:42,540
I mean it's still in the United States.
You cannot run for the presidency 

1364
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,900
without pretending to believe in god.
It's amazing.

1365
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,670
It's amazing fact,
right?

1366
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:49,520
When will that change it?
Some day it will,

1367
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:54,820
but we have.
We have just had almost no time to 

1368
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:55,340
experiment in this space and innovation

1369
01:18:55,450 --> 01:19:00,450
sometimes have been some decades.
I suppose the thing that unites unites 

1370
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:05,510
Jordan and me on this is if,
if we face some of the problems,

1371
01:19:06,661 --> 01:19:09,840
some of the enemies you might even say 
that you identify as well,

1372
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:15,690
and the question is whether you should 
face them in the midst of an experiment 

1373
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:20,391
that may or may not work.
I leap into pure rationality or whether 

1374
01:19:20,551 --> 01:19:23,010
you might decide it's worth among other 
things.

1375
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,040
Taking some of the versions of things 
that you've had that have been worth in 

1376
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,000
your past and using them where they're 
useful.

1377
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,360
Well,
but what are you picturing there because

1378
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,460
there really is no leap.
There's no global leap too pure 

1379
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:37,460
rationality.
There's just.

1380
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:42,580
There's this incremental or erosion of 
religious answers to terrestrial 

1381
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,480
questions.
So there's again,

1382
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:51,860
the moment you,
you have a science of neurology,

1383
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:56,570
you begin to look at epilepsy not as 
demonic possession,

1384
01:19:56,571 --> 01:20:00,110
but as a neurological problem before 
there's a science of neurology.

1385
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,580
You don't know what the hell's 
happening.

1386
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:02,270
Right?
So,

1387
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,580
so into that safe.

1388
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:08,400
Something obviously drove douglas.
I would say in some sense,

1389
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:13,720
I'm surprisingly to make the assumption 
that one of the things that we need to 

1390
01:20:14,821 --> 01:20:19,260
do to defend whatever it is that we have
a value in the west,

1391
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:24,261
assuming that we have anything of value,
was something like the reincorporation 

1392
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:27,420
of this religious substructure 
structure.

1393
01:20:27,421 --> 01:20:31,500
So it's not something that I would have 
expected you to conclude,

1394
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,690
but what did you conclude it?

1395
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:39,250
Well,
partly for the reason I just suggested 

1396
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:43,650
the leap into pure rationality.
There's no evidence yet that it's going 

1397
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:47,411
to work or there's going to be enough or
enough people are going to be able to 

1398
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:47,411
partake in it.

1399
01:20:47,411 --> 01:20:51,120
Give me the place where you're worried 
that it's going to fail and what can 

1400
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,430
you.
What are you imagining now?

1401
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,850
Yeah.
Let me give you one example,

1402
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:58,980
and we may be in the midst of the 
discovery that the only thing worse than

1403
01:20:58,981 --> 01:21:00,570
religion is its absence

1404
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,900
and where.
Where are we discovering that?

1405
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:07,060
Look at the religions that people are 
making up as we speak.

1406
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:12,630
I mean everyday there's a new dogma and 
you and I and Jordan have repeatedly 

1407
01:21:12,630 --> 01:21:16,240
trips over those documents.
Some usually survived.

1408
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:21,241
It has to be said,
but there the stampeding create new 

1409
01:21:21,341 --> 01:21:22,600
religion all the time.
At the moment,

1410
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,960
every,
every new heresy that's invented and 

1411
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:28,840
they're not as well thought through as 
past heresies.

1412
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,990
They don't always have the bloody 
repercussions yet,

1413
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,380
but you can easily foresee a situation 
in which they do represent a new 

1414
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:41,131
religion is being created as we speak,
by a new generation of people who think 

1415
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:42,760
they are non ideological,
who think they are very rational,

1416
01:21:42,761 --> 01:21:45,640
who think they're past the myth.
You think that past story,

1417
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:50,820
who think they're better than any of 
their ancestors and have never bothered 

1418
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:50,820
to even study their ancestors,

1419
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:50,820
right?

1420
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:00,540
Can't you say that dogmatism is the 
problem,

1421
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,970
but the generic problem here is 
dogmatism.

1422
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:07,650
A firm believer in the absence of good 
argument and good evidence,

1423
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:14,450
absolutely we can agree that dogmatism 
of any kind has that danger or we'll 

1424
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:17,850
always have that danger,
but the void also has a danger.

1425
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:23,270
The void that you can create if you 
throw out all the stories that helped 

1426
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:26,550
get you to where you are also has this 
danger because people come up with these

1427
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:30,510
new stories and every day's news now is 
about this.

1428
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:33,990
Every our politics is now basically 
about this.

1429
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,430
I mean,
well,

1430
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:40,750
yeah,
and what and what's flowing in to fill 

1431
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:40,750
the gap seems to be something like a new
tribalism,

1432
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,280
which is exactly what you'd expect in 
some sense,

1433
01:22:43,281 --> 01:22:43,820
right?
If you,

1434
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,490
if you demolish the superordinate 
system,

1435
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,950
you know religion divides people no 
doubt,

1436
01:22:48,951 --> 01:22:53,951
but it also unites people and so one of 
the things that arguably unites people 

1437
01:22:54,561 --> 01:22:59,561
above their mirror tribalism is there a 
union and an abstract religious 

1438
01:22:59,561 --> 01:23:01,550
superstructure,
and then if you demolish that,

1439
01:23:01,820 --> 01:23:06,820
well then one of the things that does 
seem to happen is the of a reflexive 

1440
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:11,430
tribalism because people need,
they need a group identity of sorts and 

1441
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:16,081
the easiest thing to do seems to be to 
revert to ethnicity and race and gender 

1442
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:16,590
and sex,
et cetera,

1443
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:21,591
et cetera.
And then we do end up and have ended up 

1444
01:23:21,591 --> 01:23:22,980
in this situation that douglas outlines.
And you know,

1445
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:26,230
one of the things I think that 
distinguishes us temperamentally,

1446
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:31,440
possibly maybe because you're a little 
more on the liberal side and I'm a 

1447
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:31,440
little more on the conservative side.

1448
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:36,240
Even temperamentally speaking,
is that your fundamental terror is that 

1449
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:41,551
a fundamentalism.
Although you also state in the moral 

1450
01:23:41,551 --> 01:23:43,030
landscape that you understand the perils
of nihilism.

1451
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,660
And I would say my fundamental terror is
that of nihilism.

1452
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,470
Even though I'm susceptible sensitive to
the catastrophes of fundamentalism.

1453
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,660
But I don't think you do address the 
problem of the void sufficiently because

1454
01:23:55,661 --> 01:24:00,661
I don't think that you have anything to 
offer except an and I'm not trying to 

1455
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:05,581
minimize your offering.
You make a case that people should work 

1456
01:24:05,581 --> 01:24:06,550
to alleviate suffering and that we 
should live in truth.

1457
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:07,450
But jesus,
sam,

1458
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:12,250
you can summarize that in two sentences.
It doesn't have the potency of,

1459
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:15,160
of the,
of the fictional literary,

1460
01:24:15,161 --> 01:24:20,161
artistic substructure that seems 
necessary to make that into something 

1461
01:24:20,161 --> 01:24:20,590
that's,
that's a compelling story.

1462
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:24,280
So this is where we might disagree with.
This could be a fundamental disagreement

1463
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
because I actually don't see the problem
of nihilism the way you do or the way 

1464
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:35,461
it's advertised.
Like once you rip out the fall 

1465
01:24:35,461 --> 01:24:38,260
certainties and the bad evidence in the 
bad arguments and they and they,

1466
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:41,950
the mere dog was imposed on us by prior 
generations.

1467
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,820
That whole never closes safely with 
anything else.

1468
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:51,040
You have to put something in its place 
that's shaped just like that.

1469
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,500
Some other false certainty or some other
story.

1470
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:59,180
I simply don't think that's the case.
I think there's so many things we 

1471
01:24:59,180 --> 01:24:59,260
outgrow both individually.
A,

1472
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:04,261
you know,
in our own childhoods and culturally 

1473
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:07,000
that where there is no,
there is no void left.

1474
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:10,500
There's no santa claus shaped void that 
we have to fill with the

1475
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:13,570
exact same thing,
but people certainly experience.

1476
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:18,700
Some people are good people.
I'm not discounting the fact that it is 

1477
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,580
hard to be happy in this world.
I mean we are living in a world that 

1478
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:26,321
seems designed perfectly designed to 
frustrate our efforts to find permanent 

1479
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:27,050
happiness.

1480
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:29,290
So you asked me,
you put me on the spot.

1481
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,450
Let,
let me just add to my answer to this.

1482
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:37,451
I just think that there's the recipe for
a good life or at least a minimal recipe

1483
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:44,740
for a good life.
It's not that this is all that's 

1484
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:44,740
entailed,
but this is,

1485
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,740
this is,
this is certainly necessary if not 

1486
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:47,740
sufficient,
is to live alive.

1487
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:53,200
That is increasingly motivated by love 
and guided by reason,

1488
01:25:55,580 --> 01:26:00,580
right?
You can't go very far wrong if you are 

1489
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:01,080
motivated by love and guided by reason.
Right?

1490
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,130
And,
and the problem is,

1491
01:26:02,131 --> 01:26:02,450
is that

1492
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:07,760
the first thing I would say about that 
is,

1493
01:26:07,761 --> 01:26:08,420
to me that's

1494
01:26:08,790 --> 01:26:11,790
a recapitulation of the judeo christian 
ethic,

1495
01:26:11,791 --> 01:26:12,150
which is

1496
01:26:12,730 --> 01:26:16,420
guided by love and use logos to serve 
that.

1497
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:19,050
Then you to read the fine print on 
reason,

1498
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,230
say reason.
I said logos because that's the.

1499
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:25,090
That's something that's deeper there.
Is jesus smuggling?

1500
01:26:25,820 --> 01:26:26,410
Well,
yes,

1501
01:26:26,411 --> 01:26:27,350
yes,
definitely.

1502
01:26:27,351 --> 01:26:28,170
It would have.
Okay.

1503
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,730
So,
but so I've been,

1504
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,050
I've been trying to.

1505
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:36,640
Part of the reason that I'm doing what 
I'm doing is to try to address the void.

1506
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:42,030
Let's say,
and I suspect that many of you are 

1507
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,300
actually here because you would like to 
have the void addressed.

1508
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:46,480
And so the way it looks to me as 
something like this,

1509
01:26:46,481 --> 01:26:50,560
and this is what I've derived in part 
from my studies of religious tradition.

1510
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:54,220
So I could say that at the beginning of 
genesis for example,

1511
01:26:54,221 --> 01:26:59,221
there's a proposition that it's truthful
speech that generates habitable order 

1512
01:26:59,710 --> 01:27:04,710
from chaotic potential.
That seems to me to be the fundamental 

1513
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,070
narrative.
And I do believe there's something dead,

1514
01:27:06,071 --> 01:27:11,071
accurate and real about that because we 
do generate the world as a consequence 

1515
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:16,140
of our communicative effort.
And then there's a second proposition 

1516
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:21,211
which is that the world that we generate
from the chaos of potential is habitable

1517
01:27:22,961 --> 01:27:27,760
to the degree that the communication 
that we engage in is truthful and that's

1518
01:27:27,761 --> 01:27:32,761
why god who uses the logo set at the 
beginning of time to generate the world 

1519
01:27:32,761 --> 01:27:34,210
is able to say that his creation is 
good.

1520
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:39,480
The proposition is the world you bring 
into being through truthful speech is 

1521
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,841
good,
and that's the image of god that's 

1522
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:45,451
implanted in man and woman and there's a
grandeur about that idea and you think,

1523
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:51,181
well,
you don't need the grand jury because 

1524
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:51,181
it's just a fiction.
It's like,

1525
01:27:51,181 --> 01:27:53,200
just wait a second here.
It's not just a fiction unless you don't

1526
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:58,201
believe that in some manner you partake 
in the creation of the world and that 

1527
01:27:58,201 --> 01:28:01,680
you have an ultimate responsibility that
might well be described as divine to 

1528
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:05,971
participate in that process properly,
truthfully and with love.

1529
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:10,060
And there's every reason to think that 
that's an elevated ideal.

1530
01:28:10,061 --> 01:28:15,061
So high that it's worthy of 
conceptualizing as divine and also to 

1531
01:28:15,061 --> 01:28:19,231
presume that it represents some 
fundamental metaphysical reality and 

1532
01:28:19,781 --> 01:28:22,420
that's a lot more powerful than you need
to be.

1533
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:22,930
Good.

1534
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:23,350
Yes.

1535
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,160
Problem here.
Jordan,

1536
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,140
is it I,
I could do exactly

1537
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:34,170
plea what you just did with buddhism or 
hinduism and it is just as grand and 

1538
01:28:37,721 --> 01:28:42,721
just as deep and just as anchored to the
the first person experience of 

1539
01:28:43,210 --> 01:28:45,940
contemplative who have taken that as far
as they could take it,

1540
01:28:45,941 --> 01:28:46,140
you know?

1541
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:51,170
Well sam,
you should do that and see how people 

1542
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:51,170
respond to it.
Well,

1543
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:51,170
no,
no,

1544
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:52,400
no,
because I don't know.

1545
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:52,840
No,
because I

1546
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:58,010
at the end of the end of the game,
that doesn't arrive where I want to get 

1547
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,700
to where we need to get to because it 
is.

1548
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:04,530
It's.
It would be two different effect.

1549
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:09,570
It's there.
There are different claims ultimately 

1550
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:12,381
about the status of truth and good and 
evil and if at the beginning of the 

1551
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,220
world and the fate of human 
consciousness after death,

1552
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,760
it is completely,
completely irreconcilable worldviews.

1553
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:19,310
Yeah.

1554
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:25,080
There are hindus in the audience.
They believe something that is totally 

1555
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:26,680
irreconcilable to what christians,

1556
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:28,630
I believe,
I don't think that you can offer,

1557
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:34,260
pardon me,
a watered down version of buddhism as a 

1558
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:34,410
consequence of psychedelic experience as
a,

1559
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:38,560
as a,
as a acceptable and credible alternative

1560
01:29:38,561 --> 01:29:42,550
to the power of the fundamental founding
myths of the western culture.

1561
01:29:42,650 --> 01:29:44,980
And if you think you can try it.

1562
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:45,350
Well,
no,

1563
01:29:45,351 --> 01:29:46,070
no,
I'm trying.

1564
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:47,690
I'm not trying that,
but that's,

1565
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,670
that's not,
uh,

1566
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,540
that's not what I.
Well,

1567
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:51,350
first of all,
just to,

1568
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:56,460
just to get my biography straight,
it's not just the psychedelic 

1569
01:29:56,460 --> 01:29:56,460
experience.

1570
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:00,390
I'm not making light of the psychedelic 
experience.

1571
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:03,470
Listen,
to take this.

1572
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:08,340
We were having most of this conversation
on the side of where,

1573
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:12,110
wherein it seems reasonable to worry 
about the fate of civilization,

1574
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:17,170
right?
We could have started at a very 

1575
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:17,780
different point with just the nature of 
consciousness,

1576
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,050
right?
Just the,

1577
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:22,730
just the for our first person encounter 
with being itself,

1578
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:23,440
right.
You wake,

1579
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,730
we,
all of us wake up each morning.

1580
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:26,560
We,
we,

1581
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:31,040
we are thrust from a condition of deep 
sleep,

1582
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:36,070
which we seem to know nothing about and 
we're just to push through a veil of 

1583
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:41,051
dreams into this apparently solid 
reality that we call the world and we're

1584
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:47,021
engaging one another in this space of,
of just consciousness and its contents 

1585
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:52,330
and we're trying to make sense of it and
science is the best language game we 

1586
01:30:52,330 --> 01:30:56,891
play.
I would argue in trying to make truly 

1587
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:56,891
rigorous sense of it,
but it's not.

1588
01:30:56,891 --> 01:30:58,610
It doesn't exhaust all the language 
games we play,

1589
01:30:58,611 --> 01:31:01,880
we play others that are,
are also fact based.

1590
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:05,330
We talk about what happened historically
before we arrived here.

1591
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:10,510
We talk about a facts as we can 
understand them that we just didn't 

1592
01:31:10,611 --> 01:31:13,250
witness but others did and we call that 
journalism,

1593
01:31:13,251 --> 01:31:14,360
right?
So we were trying to have a.

1594
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:19,630
It's hard,
it's getting harder and harder.

1595
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:22,560
Discern what's actually going on now,
but we are,

1596
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:27,930
we are thrust into this condition of 
being our apparent selves moment by 

1597
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:34,831
moment.
And we notice the difference between 

1598
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:35,310
happiness and suffering.
Right?

1599
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:39,130
And this is not merely sensory is not 
merely that you know,

1600
01:31:39,131 --> 01:31:44,131
I don't,
I don't like the feeling of a hot stove 

1601
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:46,501
and I do like a a warm bath.
It's ideas,

1602
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:52,470
ways of thinking about ourselves and the
world can can open the door or close the

1603
01:31:52,901 --> 01:31:57,901
door to various states of happiness and 
suffering and religion comes into 

1604
01:31:57,901 --> 01:32:02,280
religion.
Leverage is people that the difference 

1605
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:06,540
between believing that your dead child 
is in heaven with jesus and not being 

1606
01:32:07,631 --> 01:32:10,580
able to believe that is enormous.
Right.

1607
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:13,260
I wanted to ask you some specific 
though.

1608
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:19,460
You've expended it's seven amount of 
reputational energy and much more on the

1609
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:24,670
jihadists in your battles.
So we say that.

1610
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:30,140
How much allyship to use a term have you
found from fellow secular,

1611
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,670
rational people who want to love and 
reason like you?

1612
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:39,330
Well that is a leading question,
isn't it?

1613
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,310
I've got fingers if you need more.

1614
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:42,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1615
01:32:44,870 --> 01:32:45,830
I know you.
Your,

1616
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,450
your fingers are safe.
No,

1617
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:50,480
unfortunately,
but it's.

1618
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:55,100
But this is a problem of.
I wouldn't describe this to.

1619
01:32:55,740 --> 01:33:00,740
Well,
the allies you can easily find among 

1620
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:05,210
deeply religious christians say,
are there for the wrong reasons,

1621
01:33:05,390 --> 01:33:05,750
right?
I mean,

1622
01:33:05,751 --> 01:33:06,920
I.
So I can find,

1623
01:33:06,921 --> 01:33:07,270
you know,
I,

1624
01:33:07,271 --> 01:33:12,070
I know that the reason they're there for
the wrong the world,

1625
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:16,190
they see the problem clearly for the 
wrong reasons.

1626
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:20,690
So for instance,
so I meet secular scientists types,

1627
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:25,780
you know,
anthropologists say who are so far from 

1628
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:30,521
knowing what it's like to believe in 
revelation that they don't believe 

1629
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,220
anyone else does,
right?

1630
01:33:31,221 --> 01:33:36,221
So when you tell them that members of 
isis really believe that if you die in 

1631
01:33:36,221 --> 01:33:40,580
the right circumstances,
you get 72 virgins and you're surrounded

1632
01:33:40,581 --> 01:33:42,440
by rivers of milk and honey and all the 
rest.

1633
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:46,140
If you go into the ivory tower,
you meet people who,

1634
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:48,560
who don't believe that anyone believes 
that stuff,

1635
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:53,561
but if you go into a mega church,
they know people believe that stuff 

1636
01:33:53,561 --> 01:33:53,690
because they believe their own dogmas,
right?

1637
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:56,210
That's,
that's what it's like to be,

1638
01:33:56,390 --> 01:34:00,560
to be effortlessly right for not 
especially good reasons.

1639
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:05,620
The fact that you believe a book,
the fact that you believe a book was 

1640
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:09,251
written by god and therefore it's 
trivially easy for you to understand 

1641
01:34:09,251 --> 01:34:11,060
that someone else believes that,
but they just have the wrong book.

1642
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:16,390
That's not the rational basis for 
understanding our circumstance that 

1643
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,390
we're looking at.

1644
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,370
I'm not saying whether one is advice and
one is wrong,

1645
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:22,371
but one seems to have more commitment in
that and in one battle you're fighting 

1646
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:27,741
commitment and may be important,
and indeed it may be many reasons why 

1647
01:34:27,741 --> 01:34:30,300
the people who deeply wants to love and 
be rational,

1648
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:35,690
I absolutely no damn use in that fight 
because they want to preserve their 

1649
01:34:36,601 --> 01:34:39,750
happiness a bit longer,
preserve their comfort a bit longer,

1650
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:44,130
cannot understand people who genuinely 
come from a fundamental standpoint.

1651
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:44,610
Yeah,

1652
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:49,250
and then there's also other steel man 
their case for a moment.

1653
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:54,850
It is understandable to be sensitive to 
and guilty about the history of 

1654
01:34:56,121 --> 01:35:01,121
colonialism and the reality of racism 
and to be so committed to tolerance as 

1655
01:35:03,561 --> 01:35:06,830
your master virtue.
That's your attempted.

1656
01:35:06,831 --> 01:35:11,210
To tolerate intolerance and not 
recognize it to be cowardice,

1657
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:12,200
which in fact,
yeah,

1658
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:17,380
making tolerance.
Your core value is much different than 

1659
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:17,380
making truth,
your core value,

1660
01:35:17,380 --> 01:35:22,170
which is an interesting thing because,
and perhaps this is one of the places 

1661
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:25,660
where you and the fundamentalist radical
leftists sled say differ,

1662
01:35:25,661 --> 01:35:29,620
is that the core value that's emerging 
there is definitely one of tolerance.

1663
01:35:29,621 --> 01:35:34,621
Whereas the core value that you espouse 
is one of truth and truth and tolerance 

1664
01:35:34,621 --> 01:35:34,990
are not the same thing.

1665
01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:42,480
No.
Is the pursuit of truth and the belief 

1666
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:42,480
that as a result,
truth can be found,

1667
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:45,270
that he's not a single thing on its own.
You just pursue it as a hobby.

1668
01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:50,890
It's just something you do,
but that you believe that at the end of 

1669
01:35:50,890 --> 01:35:50,890
it there is a truth to be found.

1670
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:52,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

1671
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:53,940
So,
but doug was what?

1672
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:58,040
What do you fear is the case here?
If,

1673
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:01,950
if there were more people like me in the
west,

1674
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:02,760
right?
Well,

1675
01:36:02,761 --> 01:36:03,630
maybe I'm.
Maybe I'm the,

1676
01:36:03,720 --> 01:36:08,720
I'm the outlier here.
I'm somehow infected by this 

1677
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:12,240
overwhelming commitment to truth and 
rationality and science,

1678
01:36:12,241 --> 01:36:15,210
and yet I'm still motivated to worry 
about jihad.

1679
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:16,800
Uh,
you're,

1680
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:18,620
you're worried that there are many 
people like me who are,

1681
01:36:18,860 --> 01:36:23,860
are oblivious to the problem.
Are you worried about it when so many 

1682
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:23,860
other people who are.
Hypothetically,

1683
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:28,301
this is the question you asked,
why are you so worried about when 

1684
01:36:28,301 --> 01:36:30,860
there's so many people who are 
hypothetically like you that don't seem 

1685
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:30,860
to be worried about it?
I mean,

1686
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:34,760
maybe you shouldn't be worried about it,
is obviously worried

1687
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:40,590
my worry at any rate that we may be 
living in an era when we are discovering

1688
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:46,120
that the enlightenment and the 
enlightenment values never went very 

1689
01:36:46,141 --> 01:36:51,141
wide and didn't go terribly deep and 
this is a very painful realization to 

1690
01:36:52,561 --> 01:36:57,561
make.
Not only do we go all around the world 

1691
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:00,531
and discover that we find that at home 
it turned out not to have gone very deep

1692
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,330
in this society and that's the problem.

1693
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:06,680
It is a problem,
but,

1694
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:10,880
but hence my,
my commitment to making them deeper

1695
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:15,030
and to reiterate the point I'm,
I'd be very happy if it was entirely.

1696
01:37:15,031 --> 01:37:19,920
Sam harris is all the way down.
I'd have no problem with that.

1697
01:37:20,190 --> 01:37:23,730
It's just the underneath sam harris.
It's hell.

1698
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:32,240
I'm also curious to know me too well,
I'm curious about something that has to 

1699
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:32,670
be very carefully edited

1700
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:41,060
physically.
You outlined rationality in the service 

1701
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,700
of love,
like this is an interesting like I'm not

1702
01:37:42,701 --> 01:37:47,701
sure you get to get away with that 
because like is it rationality or is it 

1703
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:51,890
love because I don't understand the 
place in your conceptual system for love

1704
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:56,260
given your emphasis on rationality as 
the ethic of as the,

1705
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:01,280
as the mechanism of ethics.
So I would say to the degree that I 

1706
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,971
smuggled in jesus,
which by the way isn't accidental in 

1707
01:38:04,971 --> 01:38:05,490
some sense and I am fully conscious when
I'm doing it.

1708
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:09,030
You smuggled in love and it essentially 
plays the same role.

1709
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:09,420
Well,
no,

1710
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:10,360
no,
the love,

1711
01:38:10,361 --> 01:38:13,210
but love is a,
an experienced reality.

1712
01:38:13,211 --> 01:38:17,190
I mean love is a state of consciousness.
It's a state of and I wouldn't

1713
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:22,200
ultimately.
It's a fact that one can experience it 

1714
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:24,210
or not.
Yeah,

1715
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:26,020
but that's not the same thing.
No,

1716
01:38:26,021 --> 01:38:26,440
it is.
No,

1717
01:38:26,441 --> 01:38:26,690
it is.

1718
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:29,170
There are artifacts that you can 
experience something,

1719
01:38:29,171 --> 01:38:34,171
but their favorite you're experiencing 
is there's also the thing that you're 

1720
01:38:34,171 --> 01:38:34,330
experiencing as a fat.

1721
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,620
What do that,
there are facts about the,

1722
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:37,860
the,
the,

1723
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,790
the range of human experiences,
I,

1724
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,740
I think,
and not even just human,

1725
01:38:41,741 --> 01:38:45,070
just conscious experiences.
If we can build computers,

1726
01:38:45,071 --> 01:38:48,850
they can feel love and that's not 
inconceivable and will either succeed in

1727
01:38:48,851 --> 01:38:53,851
doing that or not,
but consciousness admits of a range of 

1728
01:38:53,851 --> 01:38:58,351
experiences and love is one of the best 
on offer.

1729
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:05,600
It's not the only one we care about,
but it's the one that anchors us to a 

1730
01:39:05,611 --> 01:39:10,590
positive commitment to the wellbeing of 
other conscious systems and,

1731
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,460
but the,
but the crucial thing I agree with it is

1732
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:16,530
it is a fact that,
okay,

1733
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:21,590
loving someone entails a really their,
their love and his counterfeits right 

1734
01:39:23,341 --> 01:39:24,720
there.
People can confuse,

1735
01:39:24,721 --> 01:39:28,830
you know,
romantic attachment or lust with love.

1736
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:29,630
Right?
So I've been,

1737
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:34,640
and the buddhists are especially good at
differentiating these various states of 

1738
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,350
consciousness and,
and uh,

1739
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:36,510
it's a,

1740
01:39:38,990 --> 01:39:39,920
a,

1741
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:46,150
this is true pleasure,
mental pleasure in the company of 

1742
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:49,880
another that is colored by a commitment 
to their wellbeing.

1743
01:39:49,881 --> 01:39:51,920
I wanted them to be happy and wanting 
them,

1744
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:56,980
wanting to have their hopes realize a 
non zero sum commitment,

1745
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,590
a or sense of,
of,

1746
01:39:59,591 --> 01:40:04,591
of your entanglement with them.
And you can see your failures to love 

1747
01:40:04,591 --> 01:40:04,610
me.
You can be with people who you think you

1748
01:40:04,611 --> 01:40:05,250
love,
you know I'm,

1749
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:10,300
I'm with my best friend say and I just 
find out something fantastic has 

1750
01:40:10,300 --> 01:40:13,550
happened for him and let's say in his 
career and I feel a moment of envy.

1751
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,600
Say,
well then you see,

1752
01:40:14,601 --> 01:40:14,990
well,
okay,

1753
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:20,030
well how much do you love this person?
If your first reaction to something good

1754
01:40:20,451 --> 01:40:23,330
happening to them is you feel poorer for
it,

1755
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:25,340
right?
That's the cain and abel story.

1756
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:26,140
Exactly.
So,

1757
01:40:26,290 --> 01:40:31,290
so this is,
these are all kinds of different facts 

1758
01:40:31,290 --> 01:40:31,660
you can witness in your own mind and 
yes,

1759
01:40:31,680 --> 01:40:34,670
you pay enough attention to the nature 
to what it's like to be you.

1760
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:37,670
The full horror show of,
of yeah.

1761
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:42,290
And almost biblical unwinding of all 
possibility is available,

1762
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:43,130
you know,
and it's.

1763
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:46,190
And you add psychedelics to that 
cocktail and it,

1764
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:47,390
it gets even more vivid.

1765
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,390
So,
so are you saying,

1766
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:54,040
but the frame that that's like these are
about the human

1767
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:59,040
mind and it is also factual to say that 
it is possible to navigate in this 

1768
01:40:59,801 --> 01:41:04,801
space.
It is possible to design institutions 

1769
01:41:04,801 --> 01:41:09,271
and s and social systems and ethical 
commitments that help us navigate in 

1770
01:41:09,271 --> 01:41:14,251
this space.
It's not that we all have to get up 

1771
01:41:14,251 --> 01:41:16,141
every morning naked and try to rebuild 
civilization and all of human wisdom for

1772
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:21,280
ourselves.
Each day you we inherit.

1773
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:23,710
We inherit the most useful tool,
the tools.

1774
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:28,711
You don't have to figure this all out 
for yourself and my my appeal to you is 

1775
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:33,631
that what we should want to use all the 
best tools available without 

1776
01:41:36,911 --> 01:41:41,911
hamstringing ourselves by this notion 
that certain tools are must be the best 

1777
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:48,331
for all time or certain books must be 
read it on every page with equals 

1778
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,920
diligence because it.
This book came from the creator of the 

1779
01:41:54,920 --> 01:41:56,170
universe.
When we're reading marcus aurelius,

1780
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,950
if he gets something catastrophic,
lee wrong on page 17,

1781
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:00,940
we say,
well,

1782
01:42:00,941 --> 01:42:03,220
what the hell?
He he lived 2000 years ago.

1783
01:42:03,221 --> 01:42:06,160
There's no way he knew everything right?
And we turn the page

1784
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:11,370
so we can't do that with the bible and 
the mythological representation of that.

1785
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:16,660
So there's an ancient idea,
a very ancient,

1786
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:16,770
okay

1787
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:21,790
idea that when you face the void,
what you do is confronted and leap into 

1788
01:42:21,911 --> 01:42:24,580
it,
and what you discover at the bottom is a

1789
01:42:24,581 --> 01:42:29,581
beast.
And inside that beast you discover your 

1790
01:42:29,581 --> 01:42:29,581
father die,
lying dead,

1791
01:42:29,581 --> 01:42:32,200
and then you re animate your father and 
you bring them back to the surface.

1792
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:35,020
And that's the means of dealing with the
void,

1793
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:36,830
right?
And so in,

1794
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,470
in essence,
in some sense,

1795
01:42:38,471 --> 01:42:41,200
that's just what you said.
You said that

1796
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:43,410
if we accept that,
again,

1797
01:42:43,411 --> 01:42:48,340
this is something confabulatory about 
that because you can do.

1798
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:54,080
I could change the valence of virtually 
every word you use there and it would 

1799
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:57,180
also sound profound and true.
I could,

1800
01:42:57,390 --> 01:43:01,750
I could swap father for mother and I got
swapped void from mountain top and I and

1801
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:06,751
I could.
It could be the same seemingly 

1802
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:06,751
archetypal journey

1803
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:08,370
and it makes sense of.
It's not that easy,

1804
01:43:08,371 --> 01:43:10,200
sam.
Like that's the same fast,

1805
01:43:10,201 --> 01:43:11,550
easy.
I've done it with a cookbook,

1806
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,920
but look,
if it's that easy,

1807
01:43:13,921 --> 01:43:18,770
then you can write great novels,
no story there other either it's not the

1808
01:43:18,771 --> 01:43:23,760
ability to write a great story so these 
things can be swapped out with these and

1809
01:43:23,761 --> 01:43:28,761
there is a reason that it's your father 
that you rescue from the belly of the 

1810
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:29,710
beast and not your mother in those sorts
of situations it,

1811
01:43:29,740 --> 01:43:29,910
but

1812
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:36,740
give you a buddhism and hinduism that ha
that have completely different 

1813
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:38,100
iconography is and mythologies.

1814
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:39,860
Well,
they're different levels,

1815
01:43:39,861 --> 01:43:43,150
but not at all.
It's like languages levels or not.

1816
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:43,700
They're

1817
01:43:43,710 --> 01:43:46,440
crucially opposite in many of these 
cases.

1818
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:51,441
I'm just saying that this kind of of of 
reading meaning into story is there's a 

1819
01:43:53,451 --> 01:43:58,451
reason why it's not science because it's
because it is in some basic sense 

1820
01:43:58,451 --> 01:44:02,981
unfalsifiable there's nothing you and I 
can do for the rest of our lives to be 

1821
01:44:02,981 --> 01:44:05,920
sure that the mother isn't at the bottom
of that void and it's really the problem

1822
01:44:05,970 --> 01:44:09,150
to develop a factual approach to the 
analysis of literature.

1823
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,060
Well,
yes,

1824
01:44:11,061 --> 01:44:12,620
on its own terms you can say,
well,

1825
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:17,910
but that that extends to things like it 
is a fact that hamlet was the prince of 

1826
01:44:17,991 --> 01:44:18,710
Denmark

1827
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:21,190
and not for me in terms of the meaning 
of literature.

1828
01:44:21,280 --> 01:44:21,590
Well,
yeah,

1829
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:27,280
you can make true and false claims or 
more and less plausible claims about 

1830
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,490
literature trying to do more defects on 
you,

1831
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:35,930
but again,
but this is a very different game than 

1832
01:44:35,930 --> 01:44:35,930
what most religious people think is on 
offer.

1833
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:36,830
Well,
look,

1834
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:40,250
if you look at the domain of science,
most scientists aren't very good at what

1835
01:44:40,251 --> 01:44:43,040
they do and if you look at the domain of
religious thinking,

1836
01:44:43,041 --> 01:44:45,500
most religious thinking people aren't 
very good at what they do,

1837
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:48,620
but that doesn't mean that the whole 
damn thing should be thrown out.

1838
01:44:48,650 --> 01:44:51,890
There's tons of religious revelation and
and,

1839
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:53,060
and,
and wisdom,

1840
01:44:53,370 --> 01:44:58,370
but there's that word revelation.
Revelation is something that we can all 

1841
01:44:58,781 --> 01:45:00,490
do.
You,

1842
01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:02,950
me and marcus aurelius,
right?

1843
01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:08,490
That is a very different world than the 
world that muslims think they're living 

1844
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:08,490
in.

1845
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:09,600
But you just said,
sam,

1846
01:45:09,601 --> 01:45:14,601
that we have to go,
and this is why I used the going down 

1847
01:45:14,601 --> 01:45:14,940
into the void to rescue your father 
metaphor.

1848
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:20,120
You just said that we have to and you've
said this before and I know you believe 

1849
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:23,421
it as well,
that we have to go back into the past 

1850
01:45:23,421 --> 01:45:26,990
and find the wisdom that can help guide 
us because we don't have to do this as 

1851
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:31,821
if we're encountering everything for the
first time and that's exactly the idea 

1852
01:45:31,821 --> 01:45:32,970
of going into the void to rescue your 
father.

1853
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:36,000
That's how that in that is the eternal 
age.

1854
01:45:36,001 --> 01:45:40,650
Old medication for the confrontation of 
the void and you said it yourself and so

1855
01:45:40,651 --> 01:45:41,910
I don't know which it is.
It's like,

1856
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:46,650
do we have to go into the past to rescue
what's best given the understanding that

1857
01:45:46,651 --> 01:45:49,770
there is something there worth rescuing 
or not?

1858
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,800
Is it pure rationality and nothing else 
moving forward?

1859
01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:55,080
They are unconstrained by convention.

1860
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:57,560
It is.
It's just again,

1861
01:45:57,561 --> 01:46:02,561
it's,
it's I want our certainties and I think 

1862
01:46:02,561 --> 01:46:06,530
we all in every other area of our lives,
we agree about this effortlessly,

1863
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:07,100
right?
If I,

1864
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:11,270
if I'm pretending to be certain of 
something that you can sense,

1865
01:46:11,271 --> 01:46:14,820
I have no good reason to be certain 
about you begin to miss,

1866
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,840
trust me in every area if it's in 
business or if it's in sports or if I 

1867
01:46:20,811 --> 01:46:25,811
told you I knew that France was going to
win the world cup and I was absolutely 

1868
01:46:25,811 --> 01:46:25,811
sure.
And,

1869
01:46:25,811 --> 01:46:28,370
and,
and yet I magically didn't bet any money

1870
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:29,310
on it.
Uh,

1871
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,440
the,
these are,

1872
01:46:30,441 --> 01:46:32,900
these are conversations we can have that
everything else.

1873
01:46:33,110 --> 01:46:37,130
And yet on this topic of religion,
people change the rules,

1874
01:46:37,310 --> 01:46:37,930
right?
And I'm,

1875
01:46:37,931 --> 01:46:40,330
I'm just arguing that the rules should 
never.

1876
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:45,340
The rules of by which we dole out our,
our credence shouldn't change.

1877
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:49,740
And,
and if they don't change,

1878
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:51,320
and again,
it's,

1879
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:54,930
it's we,
we couldn't be misled by the,

1880
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,110
the duration of the past.
Maybe this is what's,

1881
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:00,330
this is the,
the,

1882
01:47:01,050 --> 01:47:06,050
the comparison of something like 
scientology to christianity is so 

1883
01:47:06,050 --> 01:47:10,170
invidious because we can practically 
meet l ron hubbard,

1884
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,760
right?
We've got film of him.

1885
01:47:11,890 --> 01:47:15,870
It confabulating about galaxies that 
rule ruled by,

1886
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,630
by overlords,
whose names he magically knew,

1887
01:47:18,690 --> 01:47:19,480
right?
We,

1888
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:21,960
we see,
we see the man behind the curtain,

1889
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:25,930
we don't see that with the apostle paul 
or,

1890
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:28,000
or anyone else who brought us the,
the,

1891
01:47:28,090 --> 01:47:29,940
the,
the quote real religions,

1892
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:34,440
and yet it's always just been human 
beings doing this.

1893
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:35,160
Right,
and,

1894
01:47:35,161 --> 01:47:37,110
and,
and if you go back far enough,

1895
01:47:37,111 --> 01:47:42,111
they were doing it in a,
in a situation that was completely 

1896
01:47:42,111 --> 01:47:45,621
uncontaminated by the kinds of concerns 
we have as scientists and secular 

1897
01:47:45,991 --> 01:47:50,991
rational people for evidence and 
consistency and a knowledge of the past.

1898
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:54,420
I mean they had nothing.
They had no mechanism by which to record

1899
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,800
their observations.
No,

1900
01:47:56,300 --> 01:47:58,140
and I'm going to interrupt you.
Yes,

1901
01:47:58,490 --> 01:48:02,210
because festival.
I was signed saying five minutes and I'm

1902
01:48:02,211 --> 01:48:07,211
very conscious of a number of things 
apart from my own silence and we had a 

1903
01:48:12,021 --> 01:48:17,021
long a session on love just then and I 
refuse to finish this evening on such a 

1904
01:48:18,741 --> 01:48:23,741
positive note and I'd like to turn that 
around.

1905
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:29,050
We're all in agreement on certain 
aspects if we speech civilized discourse

1906
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,150
on the most important matters and much 
more,

1907
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,900
but there's also,
I'm sure a lot we have in common of what

1908
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:43,901
we just can't bear and I just wanted to 
hand over to both of you at some point 

1909
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:48,920
to give an idea not of your loves of 
your present hates.

1910
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:49,700
Hmm.

1911
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:52,140
That's Jordan.

1912
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:05,960
Hate.

1913
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:13,220
Well,
I would say did.

1914
01:49:13,221 --> 01:49:18,221
I spent a lot of time over the last 30 
years trying to understand the part of 

1915
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:27,521
me that can be deeply satisfied as an 
auschwitz prison guard and I would say 

1916
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:34,960
that that part is something that's 
worthy of hate and I think the best way 

1917
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:44,721
to overcome it is to recognize it in 
yourself and to do everything possible

1918
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:54,360
to constrain it.
And that's what's given me an 

1919
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:59,130
overwhelming horror.
Both of the nihilistic void and the 

1920
01:50:01,451 --> 01:50:06,451
catastrophes of totalitarianism and the 
reason that I've turned to the degree 

1921
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:10,960
that I have to the analysis of religious
traditions,

1922
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:17,040
not losing my scientific perspective in 
the meantime is because I've done 

1923
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:22,171
everything I could to,
to extract out the wisdom necessary to 

1924
01:50:26,601 --> 01:50:31,601
understand how to deal with that bit of 
unredeemed evil that every bit of us 

1925
01:50:31,601 --> 01:50:31,601
possess

1926
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:43,240
you.

1927
01:50:44,290 --> 01:50:49,290
Well,
I would say that I hate unnecessary 

1928
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:52,840
suffering,
especially my capacity for it.

1929
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:57,970
And I see so much of my time conscious 
time,

1930
01:50:57,971 --> 01:51:02,971
moment to moment devoted to this 
experience that should be familiar to 

1931
01:51:03,671 --> 01:51:08,671
all of you,
which has to be captured by thoughts of 

1932
01:51:08,671 --> 01:51:10,690
the past or the future,
which are,

1933
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:16,480
uh,
which almost by definition have a 

1934
01:51:17,680 --> 01:51:22,680
mediocrity so transcendent that it's 
just a,

1935
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:24,000
it,
it,

1936
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:29,920
it is what makes human life just a,
just pure monotony and pettiness and,

1937
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:38,220
and everything that religion advertises 
itself as a corrective to.

1938
01:51:38,570 --> 01:51:41,080
Right.
So what I'm sensitive to is that someone

1939
01:51:41,081 --> 01:51:44,670
like,
so you could tube when he came to.

1940
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:47,620
This is osama bin laden's favorite 
philosopher,

1941
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:49,850
uh,
when he came to America in the,

1942
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:54,940
in the fifties,
he saw his hosts and their neighbors 

1943
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,080
spending all their time,
you know,

1944
01:51:56,180 --> 01:52:01,180
bragging about how well mowed their 
lawns were and what just what new 

1945
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,330
chevrolets they had purchased,
and he looked at all of this as just,

1946
01:52:04,350 --> 01:52:09,350
it's just the quintessence of,
of desecration and lost opportunity and 

1947
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:15,100
the lack of profundity and for which for
him,

1948
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:20,200
the,
the corrective obviously was islam and 

1949
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:21,070
half of that is right.

1950
01:52:21,100 --> 01:52:26,100
How it's possible to be totally 
captivated by the wrong things in this 

1951
01:52:26,100 --> 01:52:30,421
life and to make yourself not.
So obviously being a guard at auschwitz 

1952
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:36,480
with a clear conscience is the extreme 
of the extreme states of happiness.

1953
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:37,090
What was that?

1954
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:39,720
Or being a guard at auschwitz with 
happiness.

1955
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:40,580
Yes.
Okay.

1956
01:52:40,581 --> 01:52:41,720
Yeah,
we have a worth still.

1957
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:44,150
Right?
So that's the extreme case.

1958
01:52:44,151 --> 01:52:46,780
Enter.
And to realize that is that,

1959
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:50,920
that that job was not only filled by 
psychopaths,

1960
01:52:51,230 --> 01:52:53,030
right?
That it's psychologically normal.

1961
01:52:53,031 --> 01:52:55,790
People could,
could be brought to that point.

1962
01:52:55,910 --> 01:52:56,540
That's.
Yeah.

1963
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,940
I recognize that.
That's the situation we're in,

1964
01:52:59,300 --> 01:53:04,300
but most of us live our lives in a 
different place where it's just 

1965
01:53:04,490 --> 01:53:09,490
mediocrity and pettiness and an egg and 
needless anxiety and very dimly.

1966
01:53:12,261 --> 01:53:15,830
We recognize the possibility of 
overcoming that on a day to day basis.

1967
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,800
And um,
you know,

1968
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:21,890
honestly,
I think the atheism,

1969
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,830
the lack of belief,
the lack of faith in an afterlife,

1970
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:29,831
for instance,
the lack of the lack of belief in the 

1971
01:53:29,831 --> 01:53:32,381
notion that you get everything you want 
or make it everything you want to after 

1972
01:53:32,381 --> 01:53:35,471
you die and helps leads,
leads to greater depth rather than to 

1973
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:41,000
superficiality.

1974
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:41,390
Here,
it's like,

1975
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:43,990
wait,
when I kiss my daughter's good night,

1976
01:53:44,630 --> 01:53:49,630
right?
It is with the understanding that I may 

1977
01:53:49,791 --> 01:53:51,530
never see them again.
Right?

1978
01:53:51,531 --> 01:53:56,531
It's not with the assumption that if the
roof caves in will all be reunited and 

1979
01:53:57,021 --> 01:53:59,630
heaven will along with our pets.
Right?

1980
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:03,410
Which is what many people find consoling
about faith.

1981
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:05,830
But that,
and,

1982
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:10,790
and so what I would say,
what I hate in myself and what I hate in

1983
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:16,270
our culture is everything conspires to 
make the preciousness and,

1984
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:21,440
and sacredness of the present moment.
Difficult to realize.

1985
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,180
And that's,
that's what I,

1986
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,730
that's the tide against which I

1987
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:29,850
keep looking.
I'm,

1988
01:54:31,650 --> 01:54:34,280
I'm,
I'm not gonna answer my own question

1989
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:39,300
primarily because of the length of the 
list and the knowledge of the time.

1990
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:46,220
But I would say that if there's one 
thing I hated the fact that a 

1991
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:50,570
conversations like this civil discussion
on the most important matters between 

1992
01:54:52,501 --> 01:54:57,501
people who have enormous amounts in 
common and have important disagreements 

1993
01:54:57,501 --> 01:55:02,300
which engaged with the past and which 
are going to be facilitated for a long 

1994
01:55:02,881 --> 01:55:07,881
time by a knowledge of all the 
extraordinary progress we're about to 

1995
01:55:07,881 --> 01:55:11,421
hit.
That can take place in an arena like 

1996
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:15,201
this with an audience like you who have 
all come out and now set sat here for 

1997
01:55:18,750 --> 01:55:20,520
two hours.
Um,

1998
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,330
and I think it's at any rate,
for my point of view,

1999
01:55:24,331 --> 01:55:28,890
one of the most positive things I can 
imagine in the world at the moment

2000
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:33,410
that an evening like this is happening 
with an audience like you.

2001
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:40,310
Unless either of you want to say 
anything.

2002
01:55:40,990 --> 01:55:41,810
I think on behalf of them,

2003
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:46,870
all of us,
I just to say what a thrill this is for 

2004
01:55:46,870 --> 01:55:50,391
us.
And thank you to you and I hope that 

2005
01:55:50,391 --> 01:55:55,011
this is an example of a constructive 
discussion of a kind that might even at 

2006
01:55:55,171 --> 01:55:58,290
some point catch on.
So thank you.

2007
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:00,340
You

2008
01:56:01,260 --> 01:56:04,590
put your hands together for sam harris,
Jordan Peterson,

2009
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:05,610
and Douglas Murray.

2010
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,430
All right.
