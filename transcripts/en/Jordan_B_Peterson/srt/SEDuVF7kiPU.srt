1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,353
Yellow,
so some of you may have heard about the 

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,990
Google memo that has been circulating 
virally around the Internet for the last

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,943
couple of days that was written by James
Demore who was fired for it last night 

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,403
and a colleague of his reached out to me
and put us together and so I'm going to 

5
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:28,821
talk to James today about exactly what 
happened and why and perhaps what should

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,190
be done about it.
So I'll.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,670
So that's what we're going to do.
The interview I had with him,

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,020
which finished at about 3:00 on Tuesday,
August eighth.

9
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,720
Follows immediately after this 
introduction.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,880
Hi everybody.
I'm speaking today with James Demore and

11
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:58,860
an unidentified google employee who 
wishes to remain anonymous.

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,953
Reasons that I think are obvious.
And James last week put his hand in a 

13
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,774
blender by circulating an internal memo 
that I would say has become somewhat 

14
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,230
infamous.
So James,

15
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:14,064
let's start with,
let's start with a bit of discussion 

16
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,680
about you tell us who you are,
about your background and about what you

17
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,550
were doing at Google.

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,080
Alright.
Yeah.

19
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,920
So I was actually just,
you know,

20
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:27,754
I really interested in science and 
psychology and stuff and then I really 

21
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,460
liked puzzles and that's how I got into 
Google.

22
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:36,740
Actually I did one of their coding 
competitions,

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,410
they just recruited me out of that.
And so I Google,

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,600
I was mostly working on search and image
and video searches.

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,713
So what's.
Tell us about your educational 

26
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:50,614
background a bit.

27
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,680
Alright.
Yeah.

28
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,514
So I just did a random science and math 
and undergrad and I ended up with a 

29
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,564
degree.
I didn't really know what I was gonna 

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,273
do.
So I started doing research at Mit and 

31
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:10,401
then uh,
I went to a systems biology at Harvard.

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,380
I initially wanted to work with Martin 
Nowak.

33
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,070
He's really great in evolution and Game 
Theory.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,190
But uh,
then I started working on other things.

35
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,550
So tell us a bit of road systems 
biology.

36
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:24,780
What,
what is that exactly?

37
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,010
What kind of research were you doing?

38
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:28,840
Alright.
Yeah.

39
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,683
So systems biology has many different 
meanings but it's generally just 

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,003
mathematical biology and uh,
I guess seeing biological systems as a 

41
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:44,500
whole rather than just individual 
molecules.

42
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,600
And so I,
I liked looking at populations and so my

43
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,770
interest in evolution.

44
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,460
So why did that make you a viable 
candidate at Google?

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,373
It's eight.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,513
Uh,
I think they just saw a smart guy that 

47
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,003
could code.

48
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,240
Now you've been there three years,
is that correct?

49
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,860
But also as an intern before that?

50
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,180
Yeah.
So about four years total.

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,453
And so how would you say you've 
performed as an employee and Google and 

52
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:17,440
people being happy with you or have you 
been here?

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,630
No,
I,

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,600
I got promoted twice.
My last review was a,

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,460
the highest possible to per which is the
top two percentile.

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,410
So it definitely wasn't based on 
performance if they fire me.

57
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,430
Have you enjoyed working at Google as it
being a good experience?

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,070
Yeah,
I love Google.

59
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,870
That's horrible part.
Like I've always been the biggest Google

60
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,290
fanboy,
all like I've never had an iphone.

61
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,573
I've always tried to convince my friends
to use android and all of these 

62
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,320
different things.
And yeah,

63
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:57,940
I mean this is just puts a sour taste in
my mouth.

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:58,750
Okay.
So,

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,970
so you've got a good educational 
background.

66
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:03,550
You were interested in things that 
Google would be interested in.

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,713
Your good coder,
you've worked with him for a number of 

68
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,624
years,
have done an excellent job and you're 

69
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:11,230
pretty pro google.
That's basically the background.

70
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,990
Okay.
Now last week you wrote a memo which has

71
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,740
attracted a tremendous amount of 
attention and in that memo you,

72
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,280
you made a number of claims and the 
claims were,

73
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,090
and please correct me if I've got this,
if I'm not summarizing this property,

74
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,433
you were attempting to describe reasons 
why there might be a lack of gender 

75
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,550
parody might exist within Google,
for example,

76
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:39,760
and with an NGO,
engineering or broadly,

77
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:42,540
but also in occupations more broadly.
And you,

78
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,883
um,
you laid out a very elaborated document 

79
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,150
and I reviewed it and as far as I can 
tell,

80
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,990
your opinions are well supported by the 
relevant psychological science.

81
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:59,440
And I think what I'll do in the 
description of this video when I link it

82
00:04:59,441 --> 00:05:03,160
is putting the references so then people
can decide for themselves.

83
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,830
I want to put up a webpage about gender 
differences in general,

84
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:09,730
but I'll try to hit the highlights for 
this particular document.

85
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,220
So why did you do this?

86
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,293
Yeah,
so about a month and a half ago I went 

87
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:19,814
to one of our diversity summits,
all of it on recorded and super secret 

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,160
and they told me a lot of things that I 
thought just were not right.

89
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,673
Okay.
What do you mean unrecorded and super 

90
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:34,104
secret?

91
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,633
Well,
I mean they were telling us about a lot 

92
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:37,824
of these potentially illegal practices 
that they've been doing to try to 

93
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:45,030
increase diversity and

94
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,980
what kinds of practices?

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,463
Uh,
well basically treating people 

96
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,000
differently based on what their race or 
gender are.

97
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,920
Yeah.
Basically.

98
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,330
I see.

99
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,163
I'm so,
and it was ultra secret and unrecorded 

100
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:01,734
and in what manner?

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,030
Uh,
yeah.

102
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,160
So I,
most meetings I Google,

103
00:06:06,161 --> 00:06:06,994
I recorded anyone at Google watch it.
We're trying to be really open about 

104
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:11,164
everything except for this now.
They don't want any paper trail for any 

105
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,450
of these things.

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,371
Well,
okay.

107
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:18,204
Why?

108
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,830
Because I think it's illegal and I mean 
as some of the internal polls showed,

109
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,513
there were a large percent of people 
that agreed with me on the document and 

110
00:06:29,971 --> 00:06:30,804
so if everyone got to see this stuff 
then they would really bring up some 

111
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,214
criticism,

112
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,723
a large number of people in Google and a
very large number of well-informed 

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,333
biological scientists we might also add.
So I was quite struck by your document 

114
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,120
given that.
No,

115
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,093
it would have been at a decent document 
for a well informed psychologists 

116
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,410
research psychologist to.
Right.

117
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,090
But it was somewhat of an outsider,
but you've got the,

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,540
you got the highlights.
Accurate as far as I'm concerned.

119
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,470
So.
Okay.

120
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:04,304
So you went to this diversity meeting 
and you weren't happy with the sorts of 

121
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,920
things that you were being told and with
the practices are,

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,010
is that both correct?
Yeah.

123
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,480
And what we're being told.

124
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,690
Well,
so that,

125
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,113
I mean there's a lot of ways in which 
they pressure people to increase the 

126
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:25,424
diversity of their team.
And now there's no way to do that 

127
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:32,330
besides actually choosing someone based 
on their race or gender.

128
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,164
Right?

129
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,970
Mean,
precisely.

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,073
Uh,
I am more women or underrepresented 

131
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:44,010
racial minorities.

132
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,580
Can I jump in?
Yeah,

133
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,020
yeah.
I,

134
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,970
I would hesitate to say that that's 100 
percent true.

135
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,410
One hundred percent right.
So the organization that I'm in,

136
00:07:56,411 --> 00:08:01,090
I have not personally seen anything that
I would deem crossed the line,

137
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,043
you know,
I personally believe that there are a 

138
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:07,960
good amount of synergies to be found if 
you can combine,

139
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,183
you know,
slightly different ideologies into a 

140
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,664
room and that is the,
the thesis that some groups are working 

141
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:17,260
towards.
Um,

142
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,094
obviously there's going to be a 
distribution of how people follow the 

143
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,810
rules.
Um,

144
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,670
and you know,
it's unfortunate to hear that it's,

145
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,130
you know,
it could be that some people fall to the

146
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:33,640
wrong side of that distribution,
but that certainly wouldn't,

147
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,140
it would not apply to everybody.

148
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,523
Certainly.
It certainly also distressing to hear 

149
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,563
that there is acceptance of the idea 
that diversity can be mapped onto race 

150
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:45,204
and gender,
especially with regards to performance 

151
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:49,200
because there's no evidence for that 
whatsoever.

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,071
So.
Okay,

153
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,990
so you went to this meeting and then you
decided to write this document and um,

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,140
how long had you been working on it 
before he released it?

155
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,043
Yeah,
so I was doing it throughout my free 

156
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,190
time.
I,

157
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,013
and I just wanted to clarify my thoughts
on this and I really just want it to be 

158
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,660
proven wrong because,
you know,

159
00:09:10,661 --> 00:09:11,494
if what I was saying was right then 
something bad is happening and so about 

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,690
a month ago I submitted it to feed back 
to that program and you know,

161
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,260
I saw that people looked at it but no 
one actually said anything.

162
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,400
And what did you submit?

163
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,603
Uh,
I mean I basically said what I said in 

164
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:32,460
the,
in the document and then I linked to the

165
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:37,440
document itself and so I actually 
published this about a month ago

166
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,613
and

167
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,493
it was only after it got viral and then 
we to the news that Google started 

168
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,284
carrying,

169
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,300
how did it go viral and how was it 
leaked?

170
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,660
Yeah.
So I,

171
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:57,800
there is a group at Google called 
skeptics and so I was like,

172
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,903
okay,
maybe they'll be able to prove me wrong 

173
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:02,690
in some way.
Like they're skeptical about things,

174
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,240
right.
I wasn't naive I guess,

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,810
and so I sent them a message like,
okay,

176
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,673
what do you think about this?
Is Google in some sort of echo chamber 

177
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:14,540
or I'm crying and echo chamber

178
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,293
and,

179
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,830
and then it just exploded after that.
And you know,

180
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,460
our internal.
Yeah.

181
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,790
It was just spread throughout all 
google.

182
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,950
Do you and do you know,
was it the,

183
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,970
was it the skeptic's group that started 
to spread it around?

184
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,780
Yeah.
And then

185
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,480
there were a lot of upper management 
that uh,

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,733
you know,
specifically called it out and started 

187
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:45,050
saying how harmful it is and how is 
unacceptable.

188
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,950
This sort of viewpoint is not allowed at
Google.

189
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,350
Yeah.
What sort of viewpoint?

190
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,184
Exactly the idea that there are 
differences between men and women that 

191
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:56,210
actually might play a role in,
in,

192
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,170
in,
in,

193
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,060
in the,
in the,

194
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,480
in the corporate world.
That's an opinion that's not acceptable.

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,090
Yeah,
it seems a,

196
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,013
well,
understandably it is just these issues 

197
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:09,794
are tricky morally and politically,
but thing that was disturbing to me 

198
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:17,900
about watching the response to you is 
that as far as I can tell,

199
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:19,880
there isn't anything that you said in 
that paper.

200
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:20,714
First of all that is in fact biased in 
the manner that should open you up to 

201
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:25,124
the sorts of charges that have been 
opened up against you or that violates 

202
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,860
the scientific literature as it 
currently stands.

203
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,950
So both of those are rather distressing.

204
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,003
Yeah,
and there's a lot of misrepresentation 

205
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:42,050
by upper management just to silence me I
think.

206
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes.
And why is that?

207
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,023
You think like why?
Why is it the Google couldn't have 

208
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:47,374
actually you think that Google couldn't 
have come out and have an intelligent 

209
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:52,660
discussion about this instead of.
Well first of all,

210
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,930
releasing like Danny,
I read Danielle Brown's response to you,

211
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:57,940
which I thought was absolutely 
appalling.

212
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,540
It was formed and the following and then
they fired you,

213
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,670
which seems to be like really bad pr 
move,

214
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:06,970
but more importantly doesn't actually 
deal with the issues at hand.

215
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,300
You know,
they're basically saying something like,

216
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,310
well,
what was the rationale for firing you?

217
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:14,350
Exactly what was the excuse that was 
given?

218
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,490
So the official case was that I was 
perpetuating gender stereotypes

219
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,350
that you were perpetuating gender 
stereotypes?

220
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,493
Yeah.
And did they say anything else about 

221
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,540
your performance or about anything else 
that you'd done?

222
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,220
No,
it was,

223
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,600
that was the only reason.

224
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,760
And who,
who,

225
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,470
who fired you?
Technically?

226
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,293
Uh,
it was my hr representative and my 

227
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,653
director.

228
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,940
Okay.
And do you end,

229
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,343
do you have any idea on who's ordered 
they were acting or if this was 

230
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:50,030
something that they conjured up 
themselves or.

231
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,673
I,
I'm sure I probably went from higher up 

232
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,380
than that because I missed a huge pr 
move.

233
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:02,570
So they would need approval from higher 
ups.

234
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,380
Right.
And I think the CEO,

235
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,940
the CEO actually made some comments 
about the issue today,

236
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:10,310
which I'll probably cut into this video 
as we,

237
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,340
as I edited.
So yeah.

238
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:14,410
Okay.
Alright.

239
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,110
So the first question is how are you 
doing?

240
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,053
I'm doing okay.
I there's a lot of messages that I'm 

241
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:28,410
trying to sort through and just trying 
to figure out what I should do now,

242
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:29,244
but

243
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,953
yeah,
you've been given some interesting job 

244
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,710
offers as far as I know.

245
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,590
Yeah,
I've gotten a surprising amount as part.

246
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,513
Yeah.

247
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,071
Yeah.
Well,

248
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:40,640
I suspect,
I'm sorry,

249
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,780
I'm virtually certain that you have a 
majority viewpoint.

250
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,020
It's just the people who hold the 
alternative perspective,

251
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:50,400
which are the radical social 
constructionist types,

252
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:53,260
who insists that everything is a 
consequence of socialization.

253
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,750
There are a little bit more organized 
politically,

254
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,584
but they're clearly wrong.
Scientifically they're wrong factually 

255
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,140
the wrong ethically for that.
So.

256
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,663
So you,
you probably have more support than you 

257
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,600
think and it'll be very interesting to 
see how that turns out.

258
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,383
So,
so what do you think about having 

259
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,274
written this mean now?
Your life is going to be turned upside 

260
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:17,150
down and for quite a while I suspect.
I mean,

261
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,660
so you put yourself out on the line 
doing this,

262
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,120
so what do you think about that?

263
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:32,780
It definitely sucks,
but at least I was proven right know

264
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,140
when.
What do you mean by proven right?

265
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,780
Oh,
just the whole

266
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,790
culture just tries to silence.
I needed a dissenting view

267
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,810
and then we really need some more 
objective way of looking at these.

268
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,463
Yeah,
well I felt the same way with the 

269
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,750
University of Toronto decided to,
you know,

270
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,590
an attempt to shut me down after I need 
my videos.

271
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:03,470
I thought,
well that just proves my point because I

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,313
mean I made the videos saying,
well I don't like the climate that's 

273
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,154
developing it.
It's making it very difficult to have 

274
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:09,584
conversations about certain things.
And your example is even more egregious 

275
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,084
I think because at least objected to a 
piece of legislation that in principle 

276
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,760
would have been a benefit to an 
identifiable group,

277
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,103
but say the transgender group,
I don't believe it is of any benefit to 

278
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:28,130
them,
but you could make a case that it was,

279
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,593
but you.
All you did as far as I can tell is 

280
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,173
review the modern personality literature
and the literature on individual 

281
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,170
differences relating to men and women 
and other groups.

282
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,470
And there's actually not very much your 
opinion in your piece at all.

283
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,963
So what that means is that it is not 
possible to actually have a discussion 

284
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:49,784
about the scientific literature on these
issues without putting yourself at risk 

285
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,254
and that's a hell of a thing for an 
engineer because being engineers and 

286
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,873
rely on the facts as far as I can tell.
And one of the things I like about 

287
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:06,650
engineers is that they tend to stick 
fairly closely to the facts that they're

288
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:09,710
not a very political group.
You know,

289
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,080
generally speaking,
they're much more practical.

290
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,740
I don't know how they can expect a 
silence.

291
00:16:18,741 --> 00:16:23,660
So many engineers then intelligent 
people and just

292
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,990
deny science.
Like it's like

293
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,580
this.
Yeah.

294
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:30,210
Well the question too is what are your 
supporters within Google going to do?

295
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:34,300
Because you know,
I would say you're a great warning man,

296
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,870
because you,
you showed what happened,

297
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,970
you showed exactly what happens if you 
have enough,

298
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,070
I don't know what you'd call it,
curiosity and courage I suppose,

299
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,550
but,
but mostly curiosity to lay out what you

300
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:57,870
think for discussion.
You opened this conversation.

301
00:16:57,871 --> 00:17:02,580
You said that you weren't jumping up and
down and insisting you were right.

302
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,443
You were trying to lay out what you 
understood from doing a fair bit of 

303
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:09,540
reading and,
and make the case that the,

304
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,763
these facts,
the facts about the differences between 

305
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:13,734
men and women and employment choice and 
payment and all that aren't being 

306
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:18,480
discussed and they're not being 
discussed.

307
00:17:18,481 --> 00:17:19,314
I mean we know for example,
and I'll put this citation down in the 

308
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,540
description,
has been very difficult for the Swedes,

309
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,383
for example,
to flatten out the gender distribution 

310
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:30,534
for engineers in Sweden and in and in 
and in the Scandinavian countries in 

311
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,674
general,
despite their advanced social 

312
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:38,280
engineering,
let's call it.

313
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,920
And they also can get male nurses,
you know,

314
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:44,040
I think it's four out of five nurses in 
Scandinavia,

315
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:44,874
if I remember correctly,
are female and the reverse number are 

316
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:49,643
our engineers are male and you know,
that seems to be associated with this 

317
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,530
quite well founded.
Um,

318
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,033
scientific observation that women tilt 
towards interest in people and men tilt 

319
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,194
towards interest in things and that 
that's associated with testosterone 

320
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,890
exposure in utero.
This is science.

321
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,773
Anybody beating an ideological trump 
because most of the people I would say 

322
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:16,614
that most of the people who are 
publishing this would have been even 

323
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,300
happier.
How did turned out the other way,

324
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,953
you know,
the findings actually run contrary to 

325
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,644
their biases because academia is 
generally full of people whose biases 

326
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,874
are less and now and then you know,
scientific findings emerged to dispute 

327
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,413
on India.
Logical proposition not certainly the 

328
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:43,260
case with role of biology versus society
in establishing gender differences.

329
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:44,094
So the science is very credible.
It doesn't mean it's completely beyond 

330
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,174
dispute,
but that's not the point either because 

331
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:51,594
your survey was actually pretty decent 
survey of the current state of affairs 

332
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,600
with regards to individual differences.
That doesn't mean it's right.

333
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,600
So,
okay,

334
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:01,680
so what,
what are your,

335
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,633
what are your,
what does your family think about all 

336
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,433
this?

337
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,340
Yeah,
they definitely support me,

338
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,670
but they don't really know what I should
do from here.

339
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,504
They don't want me to just go to a ton 
of news corporations and do all these 

340
00:19:17,071 --> 00:19:17,904
interviews and stuff and because they 
just want to twist whatever I say 

341
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,133
towards their agenda to.
It's not really clear what I should be 

342
00:19:25,201 --> 00:19:26,034
doing.

343
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,751
Yeah,
well,

344
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:29,120
there's certainly no shortage of people 
that want to talk to you.

345
00:19:29,121 --> 00:19:29,954
I mean,
I'd been contacted by four or five 

346
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,980
journalists who would like to speak with
you.

347
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,670
We can talk about that afterwards.
I can let you know who they are,

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,620
but um,
yeah.

349
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:43,490
Well you've got a,
you've got a conundrum on your hands.

350
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,760
No,
I mean you're,

351
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,870
you're a,
you're a very straightforward person and

352
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,810
you're obviously not grinding any acts,
at least not in any order is waiting.

353
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,820
So my suspicions are that talking to the
right people could be substantial use to

354
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:01,934
you,
but I guess it also depends on what it 

355
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,544
is that you want me.
And that's something we can talk about 

356
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,270
now you've,
you've,

357
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,443
you've rattled up the cages have a fair 
number of people and a fairly large 

358
00:20:13,931 --> 00:20:14,764
organization,
interestingly enough just on the heels 

359
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:17,824
of Google and youtube.
So the announcement about the new free 

360
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,940
speech restrictions on,
on Youtube,

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,833
you know,
and their incorporation of Ngo who's 

362
00:20:24,311 --> 00:20:25,144
into that sensor set process.
So it's been quite a week for Google I 

363
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:32,080
would say.
So you've opened up this can of worms,

364
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,933
what is it that,
so imagine if you're looking six months 

365
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,863
down the road and say,
and things happened that were good 

366
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,103
because of what you did,
what is it that you would like to have 

367
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:44,524
happen

368
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,590
at the very least I want,
because I do still care about google.

369
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:51,424
I want some conversation to be had and 
for the ideologues to not just have 

370
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,270
their way,
but yeah,

371
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:06,271
I still don't have a clear vision on how
exactly this will happen.

372
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,183
How,
how this can spread farther than just 

373
00:21:10,301 --> 00:21:11,134
google

374
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,330
well farther than just google.

375
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,663
Yeah.

376
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,450
You know,
um,

377
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,450
I mean I would say my experiences with 
the premise is that the first thing that

378
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:27,531
happens that will happen is that you'll 
get jumped on by people who call you the

379
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:29,484
sorts of epithets that would be 
appropriate if you were a bad guy and 

380
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,920
you should just shut up and go away.
Okay.

381
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,043
That's already happened.
But I think you're going to get through 

382
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:41,460
that real quick because I went through 
your,

383
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,643
um,
your writings which are not as screened 

384
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,470
by the way on are certainly not anti 
diversity street.

385
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,713
I went to the writing center and I can't
see anything there that identifies you 

386
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:52,704
as the sort of person that can be easily
and permanently tarred with a hateful 

387
00:21:56,611 --> 00:21:58,070
epithets.
But you know,

388
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,530
it's logical for the public,
let's say,

389
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:05,640
including the media to jump on someone 
like you when they blow a whistle.

390
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,503
Because the first thing that you might 
presume if someone's causing trouble is 

391
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,034
that there's something wrong with them.
So then you have to sort of beat them 

392
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:15,024
awhile with the idea that there's 
something wrong with them to see what 

393
00:22:17,641 --> 00:22:18,474
happens.
And so the first thing is you have to 

394
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:21,144
withstand that,
but there don't seem to be any smoking 

395
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,930
pistols into your background.
So for example,

396
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,063
you were in an ideal Google employee,
well that protects you a lot and you 

397
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,044
don't have a history of this,
of any sort of trouble making and you 

398
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:37,380
have a solid educational background and 
you're clearly a reasonable person.

399
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:42,420
And so the first thing is just to steel 
yourself to get through that.

400
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,513
And then what happened,
I think if you do talk to media 

401
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:48,264
organizations and especially if you talk
to them the way that you're talking to 

402
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:52,014
me,
which is extraordinarily calm and 

403
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:53,874
composed,
then you're going to reveal yourself 

404
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:01,010
even more as a reasonable person and the
press overall will start to shift behind

405
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,594
you.
And I think the reason for that is one 

406
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:09,060
thing you got to remember about the 
press is that when push comes to shove,

407
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,670
they're actually rather in favor of free
speech

408
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,210
giving.
Without it they would be dead.

409
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,143
So I don't think like,
I don't think that you have to worry 

410
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:26,511
about being exploited and twisted by 
media sources.

411
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:31,761
I actually think that it might be to 
your advantage to talk to people,

412
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,830
you know,
you can figure out who those people are,

413
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,993
but you're just not the kind of person 
that can be easily transformed into a 

414
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:42,384
villain.
And the more that you can demonstrate 

415
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,770
that,
the better might be,

416
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,980
you know,
for the cause that you're engaged in,

417
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:53,981
but also for yourself.
So what?

418
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,070
So like how are you feeling about this 
emotionally?

419
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,950
You must be in a bit of a state of 
shock.

420
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,920
Thanks.
It's been a stressful week for sure.

421
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:14,750
I'm not feeling too negative about it.
Yeah,

422
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,500
I.
It hasn't fully hit me,

423
00:24:16,501 --> 00:24:17,334
I don't think.

424
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,223
Yeah.
Well it will because God only knows 

425
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,500
what's gonna happen to you over the next
few weeks.

426
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,160
Right?
It's going to be a real rollercoaster.

427
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And the other thing that you might 
consider is that it's possible that this

428
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,370
will turn out extraordinarily positive 
for you.

429
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,733
You know,
there's gonna be it's gonna be a rough 

430
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,514
ride,
but

431
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,990
to the degree that you are accurate in 
your observations,

432
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,853
then you know it's not that easy to.
It's not that easy for the opponents of 

433
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:44,744
truth to have a battle with truth.
It's not easy to have a battle that you 

434
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,990
tended to lose.
So can I just go over some of the things

435
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,220
that you sent so that we can discuss it.
So I'm going to take a look here.

436
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,240
So you started with a pretty good solid 
statement.

437
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:05,594
I would say Google's political bias has 
equated the freedom from offense with 

438
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:09,764
psychological safety,
but shaming into silence is the 

439
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,880
antithesis of psychological safety.

440
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:15,003
Well,
that seems even more relevant now in 

441
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:16,954
your situation.
The science is created ideological echo 

442
00:25:19,941 --> 00:25:23,090
chamber where some ideas are too sacred 
to be honestly discuss.

443
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,610
Well,
we can check that one off too,

444
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:26,444
right?
It certainly seems to indicate that was 

445
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:29,504
the case.
The lack of discussion discussion 

446
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,933
fosters the most extreme and 
authoritarians elements of this 

447
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,990
ideology.
Some of the extreme,

448
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,530
the extreme is all disparities in 
representation or do new oppression.

449
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,760
That's a good one,
right?

450
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:43,040
That's a univariate hypothesis.
It's very,

451
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,810
very simple minded.
And then the authoritarian element,

452
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,653
you defined as the idea we should 
discriminate correct for this 

453
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,490
oppression.
Great.

454
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,623
And then you make a claim just 
difference in distributions of traits 

455
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:57,044
between men and women May in part 
explain why we don't have 50 percent 

456
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,230
representation of women in tech and 
leadership discrimination to reach equal

457
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,620
representation is unfair.
Divisive and bad for business.

458
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,573
Okay,
so that's your thesis and then you go 

459
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,243
along and try to justify it.
So the first thing you do is talk about 

460
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:18,854
left wing versus right wing biases,
and I should point out that you don't 

461
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,000
concentrate on the left biases or on the
right biases.

462
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,260
You're completely even handed with 
regards to laying out the pros and cons.

463
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,700
So the lack of compassion for the week.
Disparities are due to injustices.

464
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,610
Humans are inherently cooperative 
changes,

465
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:40,970
good slash unstable,
open an idealistic,

466
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,253
fair enough man,
you're dead on with regards to the 

467
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:44,874
relevant psychological literature.
Where are we seeing that political 

468
00:26:47,491 --> 00:26:48,324
correctness is motivated by 
agreeableness and that liberalism is 

469
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:55,740
fundamentally predicted by openness and 
the right biases.

470
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,200
Respect for authority,
disparities are natural.

471
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:00,360
Adjust humans are inherently 
competitive.

472
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,860
Changes,
dangerous,

473
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,410
stable.
That would be high conscientiousness,

474
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:05,244
low openness and they're closed rather 
than open and pragmatic rather than 

475
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,420
idealist.
Yeah.

476
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:10,254
Well,
I don't think any reasonable person 

477
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:11,964
could read that column and say that you 
were coming down hard on the side of 

478
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,100
either part of the political spectrum.

479
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,870
Dr Peterson.
Can I jump in with a question?

480
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,723
It appears from my interactions with 
many people that they are projecting 

481
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:33,881
words that were not written onto the 
paper and would you be able to elaborate

482
00:27:34,701 --> 00:27:35,534
on the schemas that people develop and 
how they classify information in their 

483
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:44,780
minds because this is very much how 
stereotypes form I would think,

484
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,943
um,
is by kind of just grouping a bunch of 

485
00:27:47,211 --> 00:27:48,044
disparate but semi related people or 
things together and then projecting an 

486
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,980
idea that may or may not pertain to 
that.

487
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,521
Yeah.
Well,

488
00:27:55,521 --> 00:27:58,400
it's a,
it's a low resolution thought issue.

489
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:58,930
I mean,
what,

490
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,700
what's happened to James is that he,
you know,

491
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,543
he,
he,

492
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,610
he put up his hand and said,
wait a second,

493
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:07,430
I don't agree with the diversity 
ideology.

494
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,230
And he was immediately declassified 
essentially as a misogynist and bigot.

495
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,260
And that's the simplest thing to do,
right?

496
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,094
Because misogynists and bigots,
we'll hold viewpoints that are anti 

497
00:28:21,021 --> 00:28:21,854
female and racist.
And so it's a lot easier just to paint 

498
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:26,804
someone with a broad brush,
especially if they're violating the 

499
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:32,960
tenants of your implicit temperament,
let's say.

500
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:38,410
Then it is to dive into the details were
real thought occurs.

501
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:39,794
And I think one of the sins that James 
committed was that he actually dared to 

502
00:28:44,091 --> 00:28:44,924
make this about details rather than 
about vague hand waving ideology that's 

503
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,390
very annoying to people who don't want 
to think because in order to analyze his

504
00:28:53,391 --> 00:28:55,130
claims,
you'd have to go through,

505
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,370
well let's say 20 or 30 scientific 
papers and actually understand what they

506
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:00,204
mean.

507
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,093
And that's very annoying,
especially if you're pursuing a given 

508
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:04,820
agenda.
So.

509
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,343
Okay.
So then you say neither side is 100 

510
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:08,714
percent correct.
And both viewpoints are necessary for a 

511
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,790
functioning society or in this case 
company.

512
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,833
Yeah,
well I think the data is solid there 

513
00:29:16,191 --> 00:29:17,024
too.
I mean our research has indicated that 

514
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,483
open people who are primarily liberal 
start companies and the more closed 

515
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,590
people,
the conservatives,

516
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,540
the traditionalist are good at running 
them.

517
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,613
They're better at being managers and 
administrators that's associated with 

518
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:33,230
high conscientious.
So you've got it right there.

519
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,433
A company too far to the right,
maybe too slow to react over a higher 

520
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,813
hierarchical and uninteresting and 
accompany too far to the left will 

521
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,103
overdressed,
diversify its interests already trusts 

522
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,040
it's employees and competitors and 
change perhaps to rapidly.

523
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,681
Yeah,
great,

524
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,491
fine,
perfect.

525
00:29:51,491 --> 00:29:55,060
Nicely balanced as far as I can tell,
only facts and reasons can shed light on

526
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:55,894
these biases,
but when it comes to diversity and 

527
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:58,114
inclusion,
Google's left bias is created a 

528
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,250
politically correct monoculture that 
maintains its hold by shaming descenders

529
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,090
into silence.

530
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,360
Well,
that certainly seems to be the case this

531
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,223
time as removes any checks against 
encroaching extremist and authoritarian 

532
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:13,720
policies,
right?

533
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,633
Like Google,
we're regularly told that implicit 

534
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:17,854
unconscious and explicit biases are 
holding women back in tech and 

535
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:21,610
leadership.
Of course,

536
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:25,150
men and women experienced bias in the 
workplace differently.

537
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,023
We should be cognizant of that,
but it's far from the whole story on 

538
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:29,980
average men and women biologically 
different.

539
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,814
In many ways.
These aren't just socially constructed 

540
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,540
because they're universal across 
cultures.

541
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,020
Clear biological causes links to 
prenatal testosterone.

542
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,890
Biological males castrate them at birth 
and raised.

543
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:43,660
His females often still identify and act
like males.

544
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,673
The underlying traits are highly 
heritable and they're exactly what we 

545
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:49,330
would predict from an evolutionary 
psychology perspective.

546
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,433
No,
I'm not saying that all men differ from 

547
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:54,730
women in the following ways or that 
these differences are just,

548
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,773
and then you put it into nice chart 
indicating that the amount of overlap 

549
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,610
between men and women per trade is 
greater than the amount of difference.

550
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,430
Right,
and so you state that directly.

551
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,570
That's.
That's perfect.

552
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:08,404
That's a very good way of defending your
thesis and also of not overstating the 

553
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:13,624
case.
Then you do a nice job of of also 

554
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:17,494
graphically indicating what happens if 
the distribution is ignored and people 

555
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:24,280
are just treated as if they're a unit 
polar representatives of a given group,

556
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,863
which is kind of what the what the 
people who are predicating the push for 

557
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,140
diversity on gender and race are 
assuming.

558
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,560
Right.
Which is.

559
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,683
Which is really so funny because it's 
really a biologically essentialist 

560
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:38,440
argument.
Much,

561
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:41,920
much greater than than than the argument
that you're making,

562
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:42,754
which is that men and women and the 
members of different races are so 

563
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:52,351
different that in order for a full 
diversity of viewpoint to be achieved,

564
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,670
you have to pull in people by race and 
gender which which,

565
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,513
which implicitly states that the 
differences are so great that the 

566
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:02,110
distributions don't overlap.

567
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,850
You couldn't make them more racist and 
misogynist statement than that and it's,

568
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,943
and it's also technically wrong because 
men and women are more alike than they 

569
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,444
are different.
Maybe if you summed up all the 

570
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:15,754
differences,
you could absolutely differentiate 

571
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,330
between,
you know,

572
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,283
in all likelihood you could,
but some of those differences are 

573
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,880
clinically irrelevant to the workplace.
Okay.

574
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:27,760
Then you go through the personality 
difference literature and you're.

575
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,673
You're exactly right on that.
I see that the CEO took you to task for 

576
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,350
using the word neuroticism.
However,

577
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:36,184
that is the technical term in the 
personality literature and there are 

578
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,730
historical reasons for that.
I'm a better word,

579
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:44,420
might be negative emotion,
but it's clearly the case that women are

580
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:48,950
higher in negative emotion than men,
and that means that they are on average,

581
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:53,350
less tolerant of uncertainty and stress.
They suffer more psychologically for for

582
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,810
the equivalent levels of uncertainty and
stress,

583
00:32:56,811 --> 00:33:01,220
and that is also why cross culturally 
women have more depressive disorders and

584
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:02,054
anxiety disorders and the research on 
that is rock solid rock solid men have 

585
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,550
their own problems,
right?

586
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,383
They're more likely to be antisocial,
they're much more likely to be in 

587
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,213
prison,
they're more likely to have learning 

588
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:13,214
disabilities.
So it's stating that there are 

589
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,830
differences in the rates of certain 
kinds of psychopathology.

590
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,490
It doesn't put any either gender into a 
position of relative inferiority.

591
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,303
So,
and then you quote research that 

592
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,024
suggests that greater nation level,
gender equality leads to psychological 

593
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:32,924
dissimilarity,
dissimilarity and men and women's 

594
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:36,470
personality traits.
Absolutely.

595
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,780
That's what the Scandinavian studies 
indicate.

596
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,450
There's been a number of them and 
they're very large studies,

597
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,480
so you've got that right.
What?

598
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,650
What does what the researchers 
demonstrated was that as Ka Ka,

599
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,060
Ka,
as

600
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,203
countries move to flatten out the socio 
economic playing field and remove 

601
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,094
discrimination,
the differences between men and women 

602
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:01,064
are many of the differences between men 
and women maximize instead of minimize 

603
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:04,674
it and in Scandinavia you really see 
maximization of the difference in men 

604
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,900
and women with regards to interest in 
people versus interest in.

605
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,430
Thanks.
A major,

606
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,060
major issue.
Men's higher drive for status.

607
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,983
Yeah.
Well we know that women are hyper 

608
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:22,910
agamous and that they choose men on the 
basis of their socioeconomic status,

609
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:23,744
right?
Well documented cross culturally and 

610
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:25,964
also just rational because women have to
make themselves dependent when they are 

611
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:32,954
pregnant and when they have infants,
so that makes perfect sense for them to 

612
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,760
seek out the most competent person they 
can manage,

613
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,133
the most common and generous person they
can manage in order to help them bear 

614
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,880
the burden.
So,

615
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:45,223
so not no,
no dispute there at least know you're 

616
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:50,924
not
diverting from the central tenants of 

617
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:59,150
evolutionary psychology and biology.
People will disseminate those findings,

618
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,930
but you're not conjuring this out of 
thin air.

619
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:05,450
There's a nice in scientific literature 
behind you,

620
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,510
so,
and you know,

621
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,650
it's also very interesting to look at 
the US labor stats on gender differences

622
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:16,040
in occupations,
you know,

623
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:20,270
because it's so funny to watch the 
radical feminists only go after the high

624
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:21,440
status occupations.

625
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,470
It's like 100 percent of brick layers 
are net.

626
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:28,790
We don't hear that being being a 
complaint about.

627
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,400
And of course men occupied most of the 
outside jobs,

628
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,550
they move more and they will do more of 
the dangerous jobs as well.

629
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,550
Um,
so,

630
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,483
so these are all factors that are,
are relevant but completely undiscussed 

631
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,403
as far as I can tell by this sort of 
ideological types that have been going 

632
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:49,410
after you.
So women are on average,

633
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:51,000
more cooperative.
Yeah.

634
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:52,740
Especially with members of their 
ingroup.

635
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,000
Whether they're more cooperative with 
members of their outgroup is a different

636
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:57,631
story,
right?

637
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,464
Because agreeable people are in group 
oriented and very hard on outgroup 

638
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,830
members,
which I think is partly why the pc types

639
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:09,090
are so hard on their enemies because you
guard the nest predators,

640
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:12,240
predators on infants essentially.
Something like that.

641
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,610
Women on average are more prone to 
anxiety.

642
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,830
Yes.
That's true.

643
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,330
A women on average look for more work 
life balance.

644
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,523
That seems to be the case.
I don't know if the literature on that 

645
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,360
is tight,
you know,

646
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,100
but it's certainly the case that law 
firms,

647
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:29,934
for example,
have a hell of a time keeping their 

648
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:34,860
women in,
in partnership positions because most of

649
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:37,380
them don't want to work the 60 hour work
week,

650
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:38,214
60 to 80 hour work weeks that are 
necessary to performance at that 

651
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,510
extremely high level.

652
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,573
So Dr Peterson for,
for anybody who might be new listening 

653
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:48,544
in,
you mentioned that a lot of women might 

654
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:55,750
not be
interested in working 60 to 80 hour work

655
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,593
week.
Do you think it would make sense to 

656
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:59,550
expand upon that just a little bit?
Um,

657
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,393
I know you talked through hyper to me,
but you've also mentioned the thing 

658
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:07,240
about why would anybody want to do that 
no matter what your gender is.

659
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,243
We got to get the mystery right here.
The mystery isn't why there are a bunch 

660
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:13,494
of people who are low status because 
almost everyone's low status 

661
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,210
comparatively speaking,
right?

662
00:37:18,211 --> 00:37:22,140
Men and women alike.
It's a small minority of people who were

663
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:22,974
high status on any dimension and they 
tend to be hyper successful and they 

664
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,534
tend to be men.
So you see this in scientific 

665
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:30,750
publishing,
for example.

666
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:35,751
So the median professor male publishes 
as much as the median professor,

667
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:38,730
female,
but the vast majority of the,

668
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:43,560
of the high publishing people are males.
And that seems to be because there are a

669
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,060
small percentage of males who are very 
static,

670
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,330
very focused,
very energetic,

671
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,630
and very much prone to put their career 
first.

672
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,080
And part of the theory for why that is,
is that some men are that,

673
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,610
that the,
the,

674
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,623
the,
um,

675
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,613
evolutionary and sexual tradeoff for men
with regards to high status is much 

676
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:05,934
higher than it is for women.
So there's good documentation and I can 

677
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,234
find these references to that.
The number of sexual partners or 

678
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,124
opportunities that a man has in previous
year as tightly associated with the 

679
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,073
socioeconomic status.
Whereas the number of partners or 

680
00:38:21,061 --> 00:38:21,894
opportunities for partnering that a 
woman has is negatively correlated with 

681
00:38:24,691 --> 00:38:25,524
your status.
And that might be partly because high 

682
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:32,661
status women who are looking for either 
even higher status men priced themselves

683
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:36,700
out of the mating market and there's 
actually pretty good of that as well.

684
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,310
So.
So you're fine,

685
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,750
you're fine with all of that.

686
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,193
The harm of Google was biases to achieve
a more equal gender and race 

687
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,144
representation.
Google has created several 

688
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,124
discriminatory practices programs,
mentoring in classes only for people 

689
00:38:54,401 --> 00:38:55,234
with a certain gender or race,
a high priority queue and special 

690
00:38:57,731 --> 00:39:00,560
treatment for diversity candidates 
hiring practice,

691
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,653
which can effectively lower the bar for 
diversity candidates by decreasing the 

692
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:05,780
false negative rate.
Yeah,

693
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,730
that's a big problem.
Either have standards early,

694
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:09,603
don't.
The problem is is that if the standards 

695
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,873
producing inequitable outcome,
then what happens is people criticize 

696
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,324
the standards and that would be fine if,
if the standards board no relationship 

697
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,980
to the job.
But the problem is,

698
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:23,814
is that if you have your hiring 
practices set up halfway intelligently 

699
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:27,521
and,
and,

700
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:28,354
and it's never perfect,
you're actually hiring for attributes 

701
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,300
that would make a job defectiveness much
more likely.

702
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:36,283
Yeah.
So how did you come across all this 

703
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:39,514
information?
A part of it was through that diversity 

704
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:43,594
summit
and just looking through all the stuff 

705
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:50,250
that we have online or in through our 
internal sites.

706
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,753
Yeah,
so you can do in a certain bit of 

707
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:54,990
literature review.
Yeah.

708
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,273
Yeah.

709
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,153
These practices are based on false 
assumptions generated by our biases and 

710
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,860
can actually increase race and gender 
tensions.

711
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,491
Yeah.
Well,

712
00:40:05,491 --> 00:40:06,324
the whole unconscious bias thing is a 
great example of that is like first of 

713
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:10,584
all those tasks,
the implicit association tests are 

714
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:17,301
nowhere near reliable or valid enough,
so nowhere near the quality necessary to

715
00:40:18,061 --> 00:40:22,020
diagnose anyone as having a unconscious 
bias.

716
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,110
Second,
second,

717
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,150
the data relating those so called 
unconscious biases to actual behavior is

718
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:32,040
weak.
Third,

719
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,183
there was no evidence whatsoever that 
anti unconscious bias training programs 

720
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:40,320
have any positive effect whatsoever and 
some that they have negative effect,

721
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:45,360
partly because people don't like to be 
called racists and marched off to forest

722
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:48,870
reeducation training,
so suggestions.

723
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,700
Demoralized diversity.
Yeah,

724
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:51,534
that would be good.
And start to define it more 

725
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:54,270
appropriately,
right?

726
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,203
Just start having a real conversation 
about what proper hiring practices 

727
00:40:58,891 --> 00:40:59,724
should be,
which should be objective standards 

728
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:06,600
universally applied without bias because
that's the best we can do that.

729
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,480
That's still going to introduce some non
equal outcomes,

730
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:11,940
but of course hiring practices are 
designed to do that.

731
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,463
For example,
clearly designed to reward more 

732
00:41:14,821 --> 00:41:18,480
intelligent people
who is highly heritable.

733
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,740
That's actually a real problem.
Yeah,

734
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,574
definitely.
And we definitely set up hiring 

735
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,270
practices to reward conscientious 
people.

736
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,653
So,
um,

737
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,640
what are,
what,

738
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,430
what about banks need to negative 
emotion?

739
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,460
It seems to me that screening for 
stress,

740
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,483
which is a reasonable thing to do in 
high stress jobs unless you want to put 

741
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,290
the person in the position where they're
likely to collapse,

742
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,490
to be miserable.
I don't see any utility and not

743
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,443
Dr Peterson.
I had a question relating to that from 

744
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:54,300
an employment standpoint.
Is there an Optima,

745
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,473
um,
sensitivity to stress that you've seen 

746
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,620
from the most economically productive 
employees?

747
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,543
By that I mean,
I feel like there's a middle ground 

748
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:09,150
between people who are laid back versus 
people who are,

749
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,063
um,
probably overstimulated by external 

750
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:17,550
factors that make them self conscious.
And these people,

751
00:42:17,551 --> 00:42:21,930
I think at least at the lower mid levels
of many companies actually have a little

752
00:42:21,931 --> 00:42:22,764
bit more anxiety that powers their 
ascension through the dominance 

753
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:26,124
hierarchy.

754
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:27,183
Yeah.
Well it's a tricky issue because you're 

755
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:29,554
probably the sort of negative emotion 
that might be useful in motivating you 

756
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:36,700
is probably more associated with 
conscientiousness.

757
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:37,534
Then with neuroticism,
neuroticism seems to be pretty tightly 

758
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:43,240
to anxiety and emotional pain,
frustration,

759
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:44,500
disappointment,
grief.

760
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,170
Those all sort of fit into those 
categories.

761
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:51,910
Whereas the negative emotion perhaps 
that's associated with conscientiousness

762
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,903
and industriousness in particular seems 
to be more something like self contempt 

763
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,183
and disgust and so conscientious people 
are made uncomfortable by their lack of 

764
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,593
productive effort,
but that doesn't seem to be associated 

765
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,040
with trait neuroticism.
It's a different thing.

766
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,300
So that's partly why it's so necessary 
to get the psychometrics.

767
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:14,781
Right,
right.

768
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:16,580
And to get the.
To get the measurement right.

769
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:17,414
So the best hiring,
the best hiring screeners are the big 

770
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:21,824
five personality tests,
roughly speaking especially weighted 

771
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,220
towards conscientiousness and for 
complex jobs in general.

772
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,443
Cognitive ability test.
Although there is some question about 

773
00:43:32,481 --> 00:43:35,090
the legality of those in the current 
political situation.

774
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,493
So
all alienating conservatives disposed 

775
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,163
noninclusive and generally bad business 
because conservatives tend to be higher 

776
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:44,514
in conscientiousness,
which is required for much of the judge 

777
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,540
and maintenance work characteristic of a
mature company.

778
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,910
Yes,
absolutely.

779
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:52,463
So

780
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,050
now here's what you suggest.
Confront those biases.

781
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,180
While you've done that.
We've seen how that went.

782
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,173
I would start by breaking down.
Google is scores by political 

783
00:44:04,121 --> 00:44:07,750
orientation and personality to give a 
fuller picture and do our how our biases

784
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:10,240
are affecting our culture.
That's a fine idea.

785
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,620
Stop restricting programs and classes to
certain genders or races.

786
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,543
Yes.
Well obviously having open and honest 

787
00:44:18,011 --> 00:44:21,160
discussion about the costs and benefits 
of our diversity programs.

788
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,233
Well,
I guess that's what we're trying to do 

789
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,094
right now.
Discriminating just to increase the 

790
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:29,600
representation of women in tech is 
misguided and biased.

791
00:44:29,601 --> 00:44:30,434
Is mandating increases for women's 
representation in homeless work related 

792
00:44:33,511 --> 00:44:36,120
that violent as prisons and school 
dropouts.

793
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,283
Yes.
It's the same thing and it's the same 

794
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,690
issue as the bricklayer issue as well.
And what are you going to do?

795
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:43,524
You're going to chase the nurses out of 
the women out of nursing and medicine 

796
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,273
and psychology and social work.
And and university undergraduate 

797
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:52,620
programs where they're radically 
overrepresented.

798
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,680
So what about Jews?
You're going to get rid of them too.

799
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,050
They're overrepresented in most complex 
occupations and Asians as well.

800
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,933
So are you only,
you're only going to do this in very 

801
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:06,200
limited circumstances.
You're gonna.

802
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,750
Figure out some way to put a limit on 
that or you seems very unlikely.

803
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,270
I almost wonder what the Adl is,
you know,

804
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,113
we'll be thinking six,
six months from now or 12 months from 

805
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:20,370
now,
given the high number of,

806
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,750
you know,
at least in the United States,

807
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,340
I'm Ashkenazi Jews in leadership 
positions at companies that are advocate

808
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,293
advocating for less of themselves are 
less people who are in the bucket that 

809
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:30,774
they're in.

810
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:31,963
Yeah.
Well as long as the discussion centers 

811
00:45:33,351 --> 00:45:36,920
on the overrepresentation of white men,
people seem to have no problem,

812
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:39,350
but you start to break that down a 
little bit.

813
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,670
And because a Jewish white men are 
particularly overrepresented as well,

814
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,850
I'm going to make an issue out of that.
Really.

815
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,713
We're going to do that.
So now the Asians are already having a 

816
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:55,160
harder time getting into universities.
So that's well documented.

817
00:45:55,161 --> 00:45:57,260
So.
And that that's a terrible thing,

818
00:45:57,261 --> 00:45:59,750
partly because of the cost to the 
individuals involved,

819
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,613
but also the cost to society because it 
means that we're not taking the people 

820
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:04,664
who are most competent and allowing them
to expand their education to the 

821
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,103
greatest degree possible.
And because there aren't that smart 

822
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:12,764
competent people are actually rather 
rare and it's just society's advantage 

823
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:19,670
to exploit the hell out of them and pay 
them well for that.

824
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,480
But it's not like they're of no benefit 
and everyone knows that when they try to

825
00:46:23,481 --> 00:46:26,870
hire someone.
Competent de emphasize empathy.

826
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:29,870
Yes.
Empathy is a good

827
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:36,880
ethic for small family units and a 
terrible ethic to run a company by.

828
00:46:37,761 --> 00:46:40,640
It looks like conscientiousness is the 
right ethic to run a company,

829
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:41,474
but I think conscientiousness,
we don't have good animal models for 

830
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:44,774
conscientious will say.
But I think conscientiousness probably 

831
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:51,680
evolved so that human beings could,
could operate in groups that were larger

832
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:53,800
than just kingsize,
you know,

833
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,570
because equity makes sense that a kitten
level.

834
00:46:56,571 --> 00:46:57,404
Every mother wants her children to have 
a good outcome in life and once 

835
00:47:00,831 --> 00:47:03,350
resources distributed equally between 
them.

836
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:06,380
So it's not like it's something that 
doesn't have a niche

837
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,590
micro prioritize intention,
our focus on microaggressions,

838
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,433
etc. And other unintentional 
transgressions increases our 

839
00:47:14,661 --> 00:47:17,060
sensitivity.
You do A nice job of criticizing.

840
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,360
Now I read derald wing sue's book on 
microaggression.

841
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,373
It's an appalling.
It's appalling load of tripe to put it 

842
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:27,800
bluntly and I believe scott lilienfeld,
who's a very good psychologist,

843
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:32,801
has recently published a shredding the 
the construct validity of the concept of

844
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:34,354
microaggression.
So it's a nonviolent construct right 

845
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:37,564
from the bottom up.
It's purely ideological in nature and 

846
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,803
it's also one of those constructs that 
allows anyone who's offended to to 

847
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,230
weaponize.
They're weaponized discourse around it.

848
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:51,760
So reconsider making unconscious 
training bias training.

849
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:53,870
Mandatory for promotion committees.
Yeah.

850
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,320
That should be considered.
It should be stopped.

851
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,440
There's no scientific basis whatsoever 
for proceeding with that operation.

852
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,650
so.
Great.

853
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,641
Well,
you know,

854
00:48:05,641 --> 00:48:06,474
it's a pretty straightforward document 
as far as I'm concerned and I've gone 

855
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:10,554
through it with a fairly fine tooth comb
as a behavioral scientist and I would 

856
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:18,630
like to state for the record that I 
believe that what you said in there,

857
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,703
if not accurate,
was at least representative of the 

858
00:48:22,141 --> 00:48:24,240
current state of art,
a mall,

859
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,193
well trained psychometrically.
I'm informed psYchologists who are 

860
00:48:30,001 --> 00:48:32,310
experts in the field of individual 
difference,

861
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,850
so congratulations
to pay such a price for it.

862
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,003
All right,
well thank you very much for the 

863
00:48:44,511 --> 00:48:46,330
conversation.
Oh,

864
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,220
one other question.
Why did you agree to talk to me?

865
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,103
I am a huge fan,
so I know that you went through similar 

866
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,280
things being any influence on,
on this you're going to pay on.

867
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,870
Actually,
I'm not sorry.

868
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,900
I'd like to say I was sorry,
but I'm not actually really clean.

869
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,520
I,
I do think that you're going to be pay a

870
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,363
big price for this,
but that the net consequences will be 

871
00:49:13,011 --> 00:49:15,310
very positive and I'm.
I,

872
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:18,260
I think you did an excellent job on this
document.

873
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:19,094
I think you were very careful.
I think the fact that you're being 

874
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,630
labeled with episodes and that you were 
fired is absolutely reprehensible.

875
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:28,483
It's clear to me that you're just trying
to figure out what the hell is going on 

876
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:36,980
and that you know you're not,
you're not any of the things that people

877
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:40,010
would like to think you are so that they
don't have to bloody well.

878
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,960
Think about what it is that you said it 
did,

879
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:42,794
so congratulations to you that 
courageous people are rare and you put 

880
00:49:46,401 --> 00:49:48,980
yourself on the line and I really 
learned that in the last year.

881
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:53,900
So I would say keep your head up.
Assume that this is gonna work out.

882
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,270
I wouldn't hide from the press because 
the press is actually,

883
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,050
you're the right person for the press to
be

884
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:08,210
something for you to use.
Know you're well spoken,

885
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:09,350
you're quiet,
you're,

886
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:11,870
you're,
you're convincing your rational.

887
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,133
Um,
you're obviously at least you come 

888
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:17,960
across as a decent guy very,
very rapidly.

889
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,830
There's no reason I would say there's no
reason not to let people see who you are

890
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:25,933
because I think that would improve your 
credibility and make your message even 

891
00:50:29,331 --> 00:50:31,190
more powerful.
So you think,

892
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:32,600
no doubt,
I mean you're,

893
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,240
you are,
have every right to defend your privacy,

894
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,320
you know,
but,

895
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:38,173
and that's fine,
but I don't think that you have any 

896
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:40,844
reason to be afraid of depressed.
I would say a couple of things when 

897
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:47,450
you're talking to the press,
