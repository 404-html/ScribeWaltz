1
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,360
Hey guys,
what's up?

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,030
Welcome to answer them.
My name is [inaudible] and I'm an editor

3
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,864
for a stout which is the largest Dutch 
web luck in the world today and once 

4
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:30,170
again joined by a man and no longer 
needs any introduction.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,570
Dr Jordan Peterson.
How are you doing?

6
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:35,420
Thanks for sitting down with us again.
Nice to see you again.

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,813
Uh,
the last time we sat down for a talk in 

8
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,390
our studio in two weeks.
That will be exactly one year ago.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,763
And then with us and it was the first 
time you responded on video to the 

10
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,530
aftermath of the,
of the getting human interview.

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,843
And we also did a discussion of my 
distillation into five points of your 

12
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:56,450
philosophy for the people at home for 
the people watching.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,660
You can find a link in the description 
if you want to,

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,590
if you want to check it out today.

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,240
I again want to do five things and I'm 
going to run through it.

16
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,074
And before we start,
we're going to do a year review of 2018 

17
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,180
in which I just want to hear how you 
look back on last year.

18
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:12,160
What you've been through,
what,

19
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,413
what,
what were the defining experiences and 

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,490
then we're going to discuss how in 
identity politics,

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,470
a collective narrative substitutes the 
individual experience,

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,530
and then we're going to leave the 
physical world and go metaphysical.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,633
We're going to discuss the movie 
gladiator and why it is so ingrained in 

24
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,650
my generation psyche more so than any 
other movie of it,

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,190
and then we're going to discuss how to 
become sorry,

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,253
out to become something approximating 
the male archetype or we don't to focus 

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,120
especially on the human notion of 
individuation and delve into that.

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,300
And five and final point,
we're going to discuss the idea,

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,533
the idea that the artist is a portal 
between the dream world and the 

30
00:01:57,561 --> 00:02:00,590
collective unconscious on one hand and 
consciousness.

31
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:01,424
On the other hand,
I wonder if we should reverse the order 

32
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:04,244
of the fourth and fifth.
So start with art and then 

33
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:09,920
individuation.
Alright,

34
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,090
I can do that.
Noted.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,070
Yeah,
I think that'll make a better flow.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,590
Alright,
we'll do that.

37
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,730
Well,
without further ado,

38
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:22,731
let's delve into it year review.
I've always wanted to do that.

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,410
I'm sorry,
2018.

40
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,293
What were your,
what were the defining experiences for 

41
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,510
you?
How do you look back on it?

42
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:32,870
You visited over 100 cities.
One on.

43
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,790
I can't even name 100 cities,
so that's impressive.

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,513
Well,
I did visit a couple of points so but I 

45
00:02:39,441 --> 00:02:44,441
think it was 115 lectures and so
100 cities.

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,490
The defining features of it.
Well,

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,043
back in January,
that's when my book came out and it was 

48
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:54,824
at that point that I started to 
thoroughly realized that there was 

49
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:00,544
enough of a market for what it was that 
I was talking about to risk 

50
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,330
experimenting with large scale venues 
and I,

51
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:12,164
I found that out
because of my experience to experience 

52
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,653
this year before I had done a series of 
biblical lectures on Genesis and I 

53
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:30,031
rented a theater in Toronto more out of 
curiosity than a good sense,

54
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:35,161
let's say to see if there might be an 
audience for such a thing.

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
And the theater held about 500 people 
and I get 50 lectures over the course of

56
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:47,011
a couple of months and every.
It's sold out every time so that.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,833
Well,
that was,

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,843
you might call that a data point was 
interesting because it wasn't obvious 

59
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,894
that a discussion of something as Arcane
and archaic and hypothetically outdated 

60
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,663
as the book of Genesis would draw an 
audience and the audience was also 

61
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:14,101
primarily composed of the people who you
would least likely to come and attend to

62
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,154
such a thing.
And that was mostly men and they held 

63
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:18,724
you in like a rockstar.
It was like plus when you entered stage 

64
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,461
yet I.
well,

65
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,450
I guess it's a strange thing to see 
actually,

66
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,343
that's for sure.
Especially in the context of the 

67
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,660
discussions,
you know,

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,650
so.
So then,

69
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,290
well then I went to London.
I think I've got the itinerary,

70
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,573
the timeline correct.
I might have mixed up except for a 

71
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:43,294
couple of things,
but I went to London to talk about the 

72
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:50,110
launch of my book because it was 
published their first and I think it was

73
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:55,000
published on January 23rd,
so that's almost a year behind us now as

74
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:58,120
well.
And the publishers,

75
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:02,270
they're wanting to arrange a public talk
and so they first read it,

76
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:03,104
that 300 seat auditorium theater and 
it's sold out instantly and so they 

77
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,650
moved it to a thousand seats,
if I remember correctly.

78
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:15,640
And then to a very large venue of the 
Apollo,

79
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I think that was in January.
Although as I said,

80
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm not exactly certain that might have 
followed my.

81
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,860
Yeah,
I think that's right.

82
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,203
So,
so that was extremely interesting as 

83
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,850
well.
And that went very well.

84
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,280
And uh,
my.

85
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,163
After I came back from London,
my daughter and I decided to try to do 

86
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,693
the same thing in La at the orpheum.
So we contacted them and of course they 

87
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:55,660
were very skeptical and they had every 
right to be because they didn't know who

88
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,670
I was and I wasn't represented by any 
organization

89
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,023
or if you have sold out to,
these are all theaters of about 2,500 

90
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,490
pasty.
So they're fairly large scale.

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,220
Well,
at the same time,

92
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,860
around the same time,
interestingly enough,

93
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,861
I was contacted by an organization in La
called CAA creative artists agency.

94
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,580
And it's the largest,

95
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,273
um,

96
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,400
it's the largest agency of its type and 
I suppose the most prestigious,

97
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,290
I was negotiating with another one at 
the same time or as an alternative,

98
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,560
but they contacted me more or less out 
of the blue it said that they would like

99
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,860
to represent me and they were associated
with live nation,

100
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:37,694
which does theatrical bookings for 
performers of all sorts all over the 

101
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,540
world.
And so things just fell into place.

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,973
Christie,
oddly enough,

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,910
my daughter Mckenna pushed very hard for
my,

104
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,510
uh,
my enrollment with Ca.

105
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:57,170
She thought after multiple conversations
with them that they were very competent,

106
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:58,004
which they have turned out to be.
And so things just started to roll from 

107
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,740
there.
And we,

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,953
we hit major cities,
the major markets first in the United 

109
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,050
States.
And that went very successfully.

110
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:17,051
And so we extended that to Canada and 
then into smaller markets.

111
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,050
US and
115

112
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,130
lectures,
I think about a hundred of them sold out

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,220
completely.
The other ones did well sometimes those,

114
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,270
we're in markets that I returned to a 
few months previously.

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,750
So.
So those are highlights.

116
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:36,584
I mean,
the highlight though really is the fact 

117
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:44,291
that the lecture series has been so 
positive,

118
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,980
you know,
the events are unbelievably causative.

119
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,593
They're not political.
I wouldn't say they're fundamentally 

120
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,510
psychological.

121
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,130
They concentrate on individual 
development.

122
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,410
I speak about politics from time to 
time,

123
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:02,870
but more from a psychological 
perspective,

124
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:03,704
outlining the temperamental reasons why 
people might lean to the left or to the 

125
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:11,660
right and emphasizing the necessity of 
both perspectives,

126
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,523
let's say,
and,

127
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,663
and the what med necessity of them 
engaging in continual dialogue in order 

128
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:22,991
to keep the ship of state sailing,
sailing upright and,

129
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,733
and,
and oriented towards the proper 

130
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,410
destination and say,
what else?

131
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,244
Well,
at the same time it was still a 

132
00:08:34,101 --> 00:08:39,101
tremendous amount of media attention,
often negative,

133
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
sometimes positive.

134
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,873
Um,

135
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,750
a lot of contentious interviews with 
journalists.

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,730
Uh,
interestingly enough,

137
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,590
the more contentious interviews like the
Kathy Newman interview,

138
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,290
but more recently an interview I did 
with Gq

139
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,820
tend to attract the most attention on 
youtube.

140
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,113
I'm also the most stressful and 
difficult of interviews and something 

141
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:06,504
that,
for the sake of my own psychological 

142
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,400
stability,
should probably be somewhat avoided.

143
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,450
Takes me about three days to recover 
from an interview like that,

144
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,040
and then also the overwhelming success 
of the book,

145
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:20,874
which has now been,
we have contracts in place to translate 

146
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,950
12 rules for life into 50 languages,
which pretty much does all the languages

147
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,010
where there's reasonable publication 
market and um,

148
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:37,550
it's so two and a half million copies 
and in hardcover trade paperback,

149
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,873
primarily hardcover.
That also includes ebooks and kindle 

150
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:41,904
downloads and that sort of thing.
The English language world and maybe 

151
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:49,551
another half a million in the countries 
where translations have appeared.

152
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,093
Those so far I would say.
So there's a huge market for unpacking 

153
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,080
old stories.
Well,

154
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,990
apparently there's a huge market and 
there's a huge market.

155
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,824
More importantly,
I would say for a discussion that 

156
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:09,000
centers on the relationship between 
responsibility and meaning,

157
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,540
which is also something that I'm working
on delineating in my next book,

158
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,270
which I'm writing right now.
In fact,

159
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,820
I was writing it just reading,
uh,

160
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,800
a central chapter,
chapter six,

161
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:20,634
which is called a notice.
That opportunity lurks where 

162
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,584
responsibility has been abandoned.
And one of the things I noticed in the 

163
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,534
lectures is that whenever I talk about 
the relationship between responsibility 

164
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:39,630
and meaning,
the lecture hall always goes dead silent

165
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,803
and that's very significant,
especially because it's happened more 

166
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,210
than 100 times and I really be watching 
this.

167
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,430
So I read that most specifically that 
there's a void in our culture,

168
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
I think produced by nonstop discussion 
of rights and privileges and that void 

169
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,710
has to do with the necessity for the 
counterbalancing discussion,

170
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:04,140
which is a discussion of responsibility.

171
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,730
Thing is is the conservative people tend
to

172
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,310
market responsibility as duty,
right?

173
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,370
Sort of as should or should not often,
should not sometimes should.

174
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:21,623
And that's perfectly reasonable because 
we have duties and they're necessary 

175
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,573
because we're social creatures and we 
have to engage in reciprocal 

176
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,850
interactions with others,
but it still misses the point.

177
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,260
A point which has also missed by people 
on the left who were always,

178
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,094
I would say collaborating about rights 
and who are entering hierarchical in 

179
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:43,794
their fundamental orientation.
Most of the sustaining meaning that 

180
00:11:49,081 --> 00:11:49,914
people find in their lives is a 
consequence of them adopting 

181
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,380
responsibility.
And,

182
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,933
and that's,
that's something that's very much worth 

183
00:11:59,111 --> 00:11:59,944
deeply considered to be audience goes 
Thailand because somehow it's encoded 

184
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,530
into their psyche than if they adopt 
responsibility.

185
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,650
Something good happens to them.
Well they know.

186
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,693
Yeah,
they definitely know what they ever 

187
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:14,823
heard it articulated.
If there's two things that people 

188
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:23,941
usually tell me when they come up to me,
which is another thing that's happened a

189
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,700
lot in the last year,
like I was just out yesterday,

190
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,780
walked down to the gym with my wife,
which is about five blocks later.

191
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,790
So when I was probably stopped by 15 
people or so on the street,

192
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:40,300
you know,
15 minute period of time,

193
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,163
no one.
And that happens pretty much wherever I 

194
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,704
go now regardless of the country,
which is also extremely interesting and 

195
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:53,770
a testament to the insane breach of,
let's say youtube and podcasts.

196
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,540
People always tell me one of two things,
you know,

197
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,374
they say that they've been listening to 
my youtube lectures or watching them or 

198
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:06,723
podcasts or reading the book and that 
that's been useful to them in terms of 

199
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,524
finding direction and purpose and an 
affirmation even though that's a word 

200
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,134
that should be used very cautiously now 
because it's sort of being mouth to 

201
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,210
death,
a strength,

202
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:25,960
let's say an encouragement.
Those was a better words or they tell me

203
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:26,794
that it found words to describe things 
they always knew to be true but didn't 

204
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,150
know how to say.
This is also extremely useful for people

205
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,993
and perhaps the fundamental purpose of 
intellectual adventure and discourse on 

206
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,130
the humanities end of the distribution,
right?

207
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:42,964
To articulate truth,
ancient truths and to bring it up to 

208
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,500
date and that's very useful for people 
and see.

209
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,180
I kinda Kinda laid out a fairly standard
argument in some sense in the lectures.

210
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,093
The first a set of propositions and I 
try to make them inviolable in some 

211
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:06,040
sense propositions that no one would 
disagree with.

212
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,580
The first is that life is very difficult
and rife with suffering and contaminated

213
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:15,780
by malevolence at every level.
There's natural level.

214
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,090
That's the proclivity of nature to try 
to kill you,

215
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,130
and there's social malevolence and 
individual malevolence and um,

216
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,020
and that worsens the essential tragedy 
of life.

217
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,040
And so the fundamental truth as 
religious types have always had this,

218
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,013
life is suffering.
The consequences of that is that you 

219
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:43,660
need to sustaining meaning to,
to help you avoid bitterness.

220
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,290
And then the question is,
well,

221
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,730
where is that sustaining meaning to be 
found?

222
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,190
If it can be found at all?
And the answer to that seems

223
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,023
to be not in rights and privileges,
sending pulse of freedom and 

224
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,810
instantaneous gratification.
Not In any of that,

225
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,644
but in the adoption of responsibility 
for the appalling conditions of the 

226
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,134
world at all of those levels.
And then the determination to do 

227
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:13,280
something about that.
And I do believe that people,

228
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,280
as soon as you tell people that they 
understand it,

229
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,890
and it's partly because
I,

230
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:21,724
I,
I speak to people about who they 

231
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:27,731
spontaneously admired because aberration
is the instinct for imitation.

232
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,240
Let's at the themes in gladiator,
by the way.

233
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes,
definitely.

234
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,223
Definitely.
Yeah.

235
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,153
Well,
it's one,

236
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,260
it's one of the themes of leadership per
say.

237
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:41,803
Hypothetically,
a leader is someone admirable and 

238
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:46,970
someone admirable is someone that you 
follow to follow,

239
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:49,810
is to imitate,
imitate this,

240
00:15:49,811 --> 00:15:50,644
to practice a mode of being so that you 
can undertake that motive being 

241
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,270
autonomously.
Yeah.

242
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,770
So if you look at who or what you 
spontaneously admired,

243
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,270
you could get some sense of what 
constitutes that,

244
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,113
which is a value and it's inevitably,
I believe inevitably the people who are 

245
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,284
admired are people who take 
responsibility and the more 

246
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:18,580
responsibility that they take,
the more admirable they become.

247
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,050
And so I don't see how any of that is,
is disputable in some fundamental sense.

248
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,830
Let's develop this further when we get 
to glare.

249
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,610
I think that's a good.
That's a good point.

250
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,710
Um,
what I wanted to ask you,

251
00:16:32,711 --> 00:16:36,520
you were quite recently actually,
you are in a breitbart event and turning

252
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,383
point USA.
And I want to just ask you a straight 

253
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,570
question about that.
Where are you?

254
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,790
Are you comfortable there?

255
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,910
Well,
it wasn't a Friday.

256
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,890
It was a turning point USA event and I 
was interviewed by Breitbart,

257
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:50,530
but

258
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,590
I thought it was,
I thought it was a dual event.

259
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,480
It had both Breitbart and turning point 
on the,

260
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,263
on the posters.

261
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,460
Oh look,
that could be,

262
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,620
that could be.
It's not an indictment,

263
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,830
but I just felt
comfortable there.

264
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,790
Well,
yes,

265
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,650
no,
I mean no.

266
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,000
Uh,
uh,

267
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,543
I find American political events,
like I tend to view that to some degree 

268
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,880
from the perspective of an 
anthropologist.

269
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,900
The American political scene is very,
very different than the Canadian

270
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,413
evangelical element to the American 
political scene that's completely 

271
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:30,590
absent.
I'm

272
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,820
kind of a circus element and being 
critical,

273
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:38,060
like there's some real enthusiasm 
nearby,

274
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,263
but you could really see like a 
Protestant revival isn't that 

275
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,680
characterizes American political 
discourse and I've seen that many of the

276
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,514
larger scale American political 
spectacles that peripherally or century 

277
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,290
involves.
That's strange and interesting.

278
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:59,930
But I wouldn't say it's a situation that
I feel particularly comfortable in.

279
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,233
Um,
I don't have any objection to speaking 

280
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,484
in such events because I think that 
whether or not I should speak at such a 

281
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:15,291
dance is dependent to a large degree on 
what it is that I'm speaking about and I

282
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:20,070
spoken twice to the turning point people
and I've outlined,

283
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:25,200
well a lot of the themes that I just 
don't run with you and you know,

284
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:28,860
I've encouraged them to act 
responsibility,

285
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,980
which I think is a message that 
conservatives have that salable to young

286
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:35,244
people in a way that it,
it hasn't been for maybe three 

287
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,684
generations.

288
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,880
Yes,
I understand.

289
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,943
So I'm also,
I'm not saying that they're bad people 

290
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:44,684
you shooting per se,
should not be associated with the thing 

291
00:18:47,031 --> 00:18:50,870
is mostly that those events are so 
ideologically hypercharged.

292
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,780
Yep.
And that's,

293
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,463
that's

294
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,440
my participation serves as a,
as a balance to that,

295
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,540
you know,
as something that brings it back down to

296
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:08,541
earth because I'm not talking to them as
Conservative Party activists,

297
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,980
let's say I'm talking to them as 
individuals,

298
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,440
as people,
as individuals.

299
00:19:15,441 --> 00:19:16,580
So,
um,

300
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,550
I,
I,

301
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,763
I also,
at both turning point events that I've 

302
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:24,990
attended,
I attempted to lay out the rationale for

303
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:25,824
the left of center viewpoint and to 
explain why that also has to be taken 

304
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,684
into account.
It's a strange thing in some sense that 

305
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:37,911
they invite me because I'm not a 
partisan person in any,

306
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,900
in any fundamental sense.
I've also been working quite extensively

307
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:47,901
with the Democrats in one manner in the 
US as well,

308
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:48,744
trying to help a group of people who are
attempting to pull the central party 

309
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,890
narrative away from the radical 
leftists.

310
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,823
Yeah.

311
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,210
So when it comes to party politics,
your main thesis that I always hear from

312
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,700
you is that,
um,

313
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,500
the openness of say the left and the 
proclivity for order for the ride,

314
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,300
I have to keep each other in balance in 
the dialogue.

315
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,143
You want to ensure neither proclivity 
become so polarized or both so that the 

316
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,390
dialogue ceases then well then you have 
something approximating,

317
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,820
well if not more than at least conflict 
or repression or.

318
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,040
Right?
So yes,

319
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,490
you don't have to watch the experience 
and you have to keep the dialogue going.

320
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,903
That can be managed.
I think this is a good point to 

321
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:43,760
transition to the identity politics 
chapter of our talk.

322
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,630
So what I wanted to discuss is,
and well it's narrative substitution and

323
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,064
this is kind of.
I came up with it myself and don't ever 

324
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,330
makes any sense but sounds impressive 
and that's good enough for me.

325
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,660
So what I kinda mean by this,
Eric Weinstein,

326
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,803
last September with Dave Rubin,
he inserted that the concept of safe 

327
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:06,670
spaces don't serve to protect 
individuals.

328
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,653
They serve to protect narratives that 
can cannot survive scrutiny from the 

329
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:14,000
outside world.
So I've tried to develop this,

330
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,113
this thought a little further and I came
up with the following thought that I 

331
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:22,000
wanted to present to you.
I'm in identity politics.

332
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,863
People's actual individual experience is
replaced by the embodiment of a 

333
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,394
narrative of collective oppression,
which doesn't necessarily reflect their 

334
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,340
actual position in society.
So in short,

335
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,440
there are not as oppressed as the 
narrative.

336
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:38,000
They subscribe to big states.
You

337
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,380
the data on that from the logical 
literature is quite clear.

338
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,040
If you,
if you survey minority group members,

339
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,363
let's say
they almost inevitably state the amount 

340
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,214
of oppression suffered by their group,
far exceeds the oppression they 

341
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:01,710
experienced as individuals.
Very common finding.

342
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,680
Yep.

343
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,910
So,
so how do we,

344
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,660
how do you cope with this very grave 
disparity between data and narrative and

345
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:11,264
never different body by individuals even
though it doesn't reflect their actual 

346
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,790
position in society?

347
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,860
Well,
let's,

348
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,070
let's go back a couple of steps to your 
original propositions.

349
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,583
Weinstein's conference for example,
were that the purpose of safe spaces 

350
00:22:26,161 --> 00:22:26,994
wasn't to protect individuals,
but to protect a narrative that may or 

351
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,840
scrutiny.
I certainly believe that because when.

352
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,850
This is something I hope to do in the 
next year,

353
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:40,290
I've been looking into some of the 
fundamental propositions of the identity

354
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,940
politics and of the political spectrum,
the idea of patriarchy,

355
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,100
the idea of intersectionality,
the idea that

356
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,650
what would you call it,
performance increments can be accrued as

357
00:22:55,651 --> 00:22:56,484
a consequence of diversification of view
points along the standard identity 

358
00:23:00,481 --> 00:23:01,314
politics lines.
Those ideas are intellectually week 

359
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,250
almost beyond comprehension.
Yeah.

360
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,310
The only,
and I looked up,

361
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,220
I think it was Kate Millett,
my,

362
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,200
my memory might be fading.
I looked,

363
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,243
I looked up the research,
let's call it on the idea of white 

364
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:25,134
privilege on the idea of the Patriarchy 
and the idea of intersectionality and I 

365
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:33,810
went and tracked down the people who 
formulated the ideas and started to look

366
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:34,644
seriously at what they have written and 
discussed and frankly it's me 

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,953
intellectually week and I think the only
reason it survived at all is because so 

368
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,010
it was all formulated in the 
universities.

369
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,920
The idea of white privilege,
for example,

370
00:23:52,921 --> 00:23:53,754
was formulated that wet else.
We had the idea of intersectionality at 

371
00:23:56,961 --> 00:24:01,961
the law school at Ucla and I think the 
only reason that these ideas have gained

372
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,603
currency is the serious scholars in 
universities and those were mostly but 

373
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:14,600
not all be those who are pursuing a 
research in the stem disciplines.

374
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:15,434
Because of the fundamental corruption of
the humanities and the social sciences 

375
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,663
have just ignored them.
They haven't been subject to January 

376
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,790
criticism.
Hypothetically.

377
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,624
They're peer reviewed,
but they're peer reviewed by people 

378
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:31,340
who've already taken the poison,
let's say,

379
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:33,620
or who are possessed by the same set of 
ideas.

380
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,340
As soon as you analyze those ideas,
they fall apart.

381
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,533
So other disciplines,
other academic disciplines have plainly 

382
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:42,290
ignored this.
Yeah,

383
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,124
well,
I think it's because they never thought 

384
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:49,271
that the ideas were worthy of criticism,
which has a real criticism.

385
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,310
Your ideas aren't even worthy of 
criticism.

386
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,533
We're going to ignore them,
and the problem is is that's actually 

387
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:59,030
not worked out very well because,
well,

388
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,750
the stem types,
let's say we're busy peering through the

389
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,584
microscopes,
the activist pipes were busy corrupting 

390
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,620
the entire structure of the university 
and then spreading that,

391
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:15,680
that pathology of appallingly bad ideas 
out into the broader culture,

392
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,490
like the idea of intersectionality.
We run a real focus on that.

393
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,130
It's like we could just take that apart 
for a bit.

394
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:24,990
So first of all,
to be an intersection,

395
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,130
intersection list,
if that's a word,

396
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,010
means that you have to buy the 
oppression narrative.

397
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,923
You have to buy the narrative.
That history isn't a battle ground 

398
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,470
between the oppressed and the 
oppressors.

399
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,513
That's the first thing.
So that's a Marxist presumption derived 

400
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,963
from,
I would say it's an analog of the 

401
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,304
proletariat.
[inaudible] struggled that was outlined 

402
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,910
as fundamental marks.

403
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,043
So it's a very bad,
I don't think there's any doubt about 

404
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:50,834
that jeff or Bible out and I don't,
I think it's an appalling poetry one 

405
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,990
side or the idea,
even though there is oppression and that

406
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,940
characterizes all social institutions,
um,

407
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,203
but that's by no means all the story 
then you have to buy the idea that the 

408
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,834
oppression occurs along the canonical 
lines drawn identity lines drawn by the 

409
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,300
identity politics type.
So that would be essentially,

410
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,420
let's say race,
ethnicity,

411
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,510
sexuality and gender as an article,
uh,

412
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,533
categories and I don't think the 
evidence for that is overwhelming as 

413
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:30,824
well.
And then having accepted those 

414
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,500
propositions,
unquestionably,

415
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,310
they,
you noticed that oppression is more than

416
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:41,750
one dimensional St.
Well,

417
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:42,584
if you're black and female,
then your oppression is either the 

418
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,540
summer or the product of those two 
minority statuses.

419
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,113
Um,
I don't find that particularly 

420
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:57,150
compelling or original idea.

421
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,313
I think it's obvious and it's also self 
contradictory and it's easy to think 

422
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:10,521
that through because as you multiply the
number of identically

423
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,640
which you could be oppressed,
you reduced the number of people in each

424
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,663
super ordinate category and my 
suspicions are that you could figure 

425
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,574
this out,
arithmetically with a bit of work 

426
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,780
approximately.
At least imagine that each person can be

427
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:33,290
placed into 10 idea identity categories 
switch,

428
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,510
which I don't think it's unreasonable.
The actually the number of categories is

429
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:38,310
the limit.
It's limitless.

430
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,823
You ended up with no groups.
You end up right back to the individual 

431
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,150
and so so which is essentially what the 
West discovered.

432
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,210
I would say it's some multiple thousands
of years ago.

433
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,733
It's really want to take everybody's 
differences into account which is what 

434
00:27:58,801 --> 00:27:59,634
the intersection was claim you should be
doing and what you end up doing is 

435
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,550
responding to each person as if you're a
unique individual.

436
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,073
So and that's just one example of how 
unbelievably show these ideas are and 

437
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,484
how,
how easily they're subject to what I 

438
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:19,320
would say devastating criticism and that
does support.

439
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,813
Yeah.
But I do think that what is often 

440
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,960
overlooked,
because they're so dominant in our,

441
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,080
the way our perception is shaped what is
often overlooked.

442
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:32,170
But actually very few people subscribe 
to identity politics.

443
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:36,220
I think there was only
one study,

444
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,180
uh,
yeah,

445
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,413
at around 8,000 people.
And the conclusion was that only eight 

446
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,800
percent actually subscribed to this 
narrative and

447
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,710
media and education.

448
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,070
Well,
you can imagine,

449
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,833
you can hypothesize that the political,
if you consider political affiliation 

450
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,253
unit dimensional,
it's not clear that you could make a 

451
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:04,251
normal distribution.
The extremes are rare and yeah.

452
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,130
Then of course the question is how do 
you define what constitutes extreme,

453
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,203
but it does appear that a reasonable 
estimate on both the right and the left 

454
00:29:14,171 --> 00:29:16,430
is something approximating five to eight
percent.

455
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,613
And in that same study,
even the people who were identified as 

456
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:21,374
relatively extreme in relationship to 
their left wing identity politics 

457
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:25,784
position of 40 percent of them had also 
agreed with the idea that political 

458
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:33,020
correctness has gone too far.

459
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,133
Yeah.
So this identity narrative is basically 

460
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,930
it has consolidated its position in the 
universities

461
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,880
and then media

462
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,960
and human resources departments in large
corporations as well.

463
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:49,330
And I wouldn't underestimate the danger 
of that.

464
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,040
That's,
that's the new fifth.

465
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,560
Call them inside the capitalist system 
itself,

466
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,120
welcomed by the capitalists who want to 
have it both ways,

467
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,790
but you have to give the identitarian 
seven,

468
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,653
they're due credit because if their,
if their doctor is indeed as 

469
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:06,214
intellectually week as it appears to us,
they've accomplished quite a lot with 

470
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,590
it.
Yes.

471
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:14,410
Well continuous subsidies for 40 years.
House and hurt,

472
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,723
you know,
what they've managed to do is blur the 

473
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:17,824
distinction between education and 
indoctrination and it's easy to blur 

474
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,374
that distinction because you would hope 
that to some degree what people you 

475
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,880
learn in university can be transposed 
into action now.

476
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,803
And so drawing a distinction between 
education and indoctrination is very 

477
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,490
good to call thing.
Um,

478
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,280
but it still needs to be done.
I've recommended to politicians,

479
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Canada and the US mostly in Canada so 
far that they

480
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,920
ask universities to generate in Ontario 
with my home problems.

481
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,240
The newly elected conservative 
government has required the universities

482
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:09,891
and colleges to formulate a statement,
a free speech policy statement,

483
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,513
and all of the colleges in Ontario have 
now complied and most of them have 

484
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:20,310
adopted some variant of the Chicago 
University of Chicago statement,

485
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,144
which is a real move forward and I've 
been thinking that an equally useful 

486
00:31:25,771 --> 00:31:30,771
thing to do would be to ask ologist in 
universities to formulate policy,

487
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,730
dissociating education from 
indoctrination.

488
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:38,990
And there is precedent for this.
That's nonpartisan.

489
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,580
So for the Canadian Revenue Agency,
which is equivalent to the irs in the US

490
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,810
tax agency for bids charities from 
engaging in political activism.

491
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,223
And so that means there's already a set 
of definitions regarding what 

492
00:31:55,431 --> 00:31:58,640
constitutes activism.
Say rather than charitable work,

493
00:31:58,641 --> 00:31:59,474
which

494
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,383
something that can be useful.
You applied in the education field 

495
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,703
distinguishing activism from education.
Because the problem is is that part of 

496
00:32:07,311 --> 00:32:11,390
the problem is is that there is a small 
minority of very disruptive people,

497
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:12,224
in my estimation,
who have been subsidized or they're 

498
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:19,991
destructive work for about 50 years.
And that's given them a power that's far

499
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:23,030
of proportion to their intellectual 
rigor,

500
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:26,780
to the credibility of their ideas and to
their numerical prevalence.

501
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,290
Yeah,
makes sense.

502
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,963
And I think that the way to defeat this 
is to embody that the male archetype or 

503
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:40,220
ear or I know men or women

504
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,083
doesn't really matter.
So I think we can go through that third 

505
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,533
point,

506
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,090
just make a swot.
It's just big aside.

507
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,890
Move quickly because I'm sure.
Well,

508
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,580
so one of the things that's happened in 
Hungary,

509
00:32:51,581 --> 00:32:55,870
for example,
the president has cuts funding,

510
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,823
if I remember correctly,
to women's studies and I know that in 

511
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:02,210
Brazil there's no pressure being placed 
now,

512
00:33:02,211 --> 00:33:03,044
I don't know this very well on my part,
but there's pressure being placed on 

513
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,893
lgbt activists trips and so you could 
say that one way of dealing with the 

514
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,283
unfortunate and I'm reasonable 
subsidization of this particular 

515
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:25,530
political viewpoint would be to stop 
funding that at the university or public

516
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,350
level.
But the problem with that is it opens up

517
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,380
the specter of direct government 
interference with the autonomy be bad.

518
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:36,783
So then we can go to the other topic,
which is I think the way that you 

519
00:33:40,301 --> 00:33:43,730
undermine a bad story,
no undermine is right.

520
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,363
I think the way that you engage in 
proper discourse in relationship to set 

521
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,583
video,
logical presuppositions is by 

522
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,620
formulating and communicating better 
story or better story with.

523
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:05,500
And that's a better transition.

524
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,410
Well,
hopefully,

525
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,243
well,
hopefully it's the right way of going 

526
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,173
about it.
He person who tells the best story wins 

527
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,673
and that that echoes back to Weinstein's
caution that the purpose of the safe 

528
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,840
springs,
which are clearly purpose of this space,

529
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,550
is clearly not to produce more resilient
individuals.

530
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,413
Jonathan Heit and his coauthor,
it just finished the American mind just 

531
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:34,580
published,
look,

532
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,710
Yanis Ganahl the piano off his name.
Um,

533
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,143
lay out the evidence that the safe space
doctrine actually weakens individuals 

534
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,580
very clearly than I think any reasonable
psychologist or a psychiatrist knows the

535
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:51,844
literature on exposure to anxiety 
provoking stimuli would have to agree 

536
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:57,484
that protecting people from any exposure
to things that they're afraid of or 

537
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,830
contentious like Lidl to weaken them 
rather than just cranking them.

538
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,110
So I think it is to protect the 
narrative.

539
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,443
Um,
yeah,

540
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,560
and,
and,

541
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,510
but I think the best way to combat and 
pathological narrative a better story.

542
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,510
Yeah,
I agree.

543
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,373
And talking about or stories I think I 
would now like to discuss one of the 

544
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,063
best stories I've seen in modern cinema 
and I'm talking about the movie 

545
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:33,700
gladiator that came out in 2000 starting
Russia crow and Jacqueline Phoenix.

546
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,010
You totally,
you saw last night?

547
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,383
Yeah,
I had watched it before so I knew we 

548
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:40,470
were going to talk about it.
So

549
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,470
I was very surprised.
I don't know how I avoided it

550
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,243
now.
And then there's a movie of substantial 

551
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:55,590
cultural significance that you just miss
and that was what I missed.

552
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:56,820
So yeah.
Yeah.

553
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,720
Well you made up for it.
Um,

554
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,863
so gladiator,
I think this movie is ingrained in the 

555
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,960
psyche of my generation more so than any
other,

556
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,740
like epic,
epic movie of it's open source.

557
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,700
So there's not a character's,
there's,

558
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,733
there's Aragorn from Lord of the rings.
There's hector from Troy is William 

559
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,090
Wallace from braveheart or spartacus.

560
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:18,923
There's Leah night is from 300.
All these characters are the same 

561
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,020
archetipal figures,
but somehow only maximum ms dot meridius

562
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,480
really strict,
really sticks through the years.

563
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,460
And I have,
uh,

564
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:33,294
I've,
I've put some thought into this and I 

565
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,440
have some ideas about why particularly 
this character in this movie sticks.

566
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,743
I wanted to present to you three points 
that culminate in what I think is the 

567
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,790
implicit central thesis difference 
throughout the movie.

568
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,213
So I'm going to list now the three 
points and then the central thesis or 

569
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,260
number one is that maximum,
this is by far the best modern portrayal

570
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,690
of the male archetypes.
I'm,

571
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,370
he's highly capable,
but very gentle and these modest in word

572
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:06,204
and body language and these admired and 
loved solely for his character and 

573
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:09,650
skill.
So that's the,

574
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,090
that's the portrayal of the architect's 
going to,

575
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,343
is that the movie also contains the very
best modern portrayal of the embittered 

576
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:17,934
villain whose character and skill are 
simply insufficient and he makes up for 

577
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:24,990
it through deceit and cruelness while 
still knowing every step of the way that

578
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,220
eventually build it.

579
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,410
There's nothing you can do about it.
And three,

580
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,140
the characters themselves are exclusive 
in their own rights,

581
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:39,210
but in this movie there juxtaposition 
within a hostile brother framework which

582
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,044
makes it,
which is a deeply architecture 

583
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,730
framework,
which might be the reason that it's,

584
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,240
it sticks so much more than all the 
other architects figures.

585
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,860
And this brings me to the central 
thesis.

586
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,753
And,
um,

587
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,593
I only figured this out two days ago and
I'm very excited to get to share this 

588
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,654
with you.
I think that central complicit thesis 

589
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,240
throughout the whole movie is as 
follows,

590
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,910
that no matter how powerful someone is,
the bane of a man who sold,

591
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:06,224
who has been irreversibly corrupted far 
out exceeds the pain of a righteous man 

592
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,750
whose wife and son had been murdered and
has been reduced to epic,

593
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,080
which is really something to think 
about.

594
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,800
Oh yeah.
Right.

595
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,593
Okay.
So the themes that you've been 

596
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:27,120
developing.
Okay.

597
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,410
So the first thing we might also note 
that

598
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,013
last over,
maybe that's the right way of thinking 

599
00:38:34,081 --> 00:38:34,914
about it.
You said

600
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:41,510
Maximus is a paragon of soldierly 
virtue,

601
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,713
right?
He's physical combat and a warrior 

602
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:51,190
beautiful up.
He serves his commander,

603
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,400
but also serves the principals.
More importantly,

604
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,743
principles that govern his commander
principals more than the commander 

605
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:06,121
himself and you can tell that because he
chooses not to serve the new emperor

606
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,020
because he doesn't believe that he 
abides by the proper principles.

607
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:14,020
And Communists of course also killed his
own father,

608
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,920
which means that he killed the 
principles by which the state,

609
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,350
um,
he's like,

610
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,720
he's like elder gods in the Mesopotamian
creationists who kill app suit,

611
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,370
who's their father,
and then try to live on this course.

612
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,240
It doesn't work out well for them.
All that does is breed chaos.

613
00:39:31,241 --> 00:39:35,370
And that's exactly what happens in the 
movie gladiator.

614
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,970
Maximus as son is an interesting son,
is also an interesting character because

615
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:46,024
he becomes son as a consequence of his 
virtue rather than as a consequence of 

616
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:51,970
his birthright.
Carbon has the,

617
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,133
has the advantage of birth,
but maximus has the advantage of virtue 

618
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,640
is the virtue of strength.
And you know,

619
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:06,640
that makes the movie in some sense also 
extremely barbaric.

620
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,474
There's just endless and killing,
which is very strange thing when you're 

621
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,360
talking about someone who's operating 
within a fundamentally moral framework.

622
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:17,943
And I guess part of the moral of the 
story is that it's better to be a 

623
00:40:19,721 --> 00:40:22,750
soldier than a coward
and that's,

624
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,550
you know,
that's,

625
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,933
it's not.
I would say that on one hand that self 

626
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:34,760
evident and on the other hand that's a 
mystery because the coward might be able

627
00:40:34,761 --> 00:40:35,594
to avoid the mayhem and killing that 
characterizes the life of the soldier 

628
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,833
anyways.
Maximus does organize himself under the 

629
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,150
virtues of courage and,
and for parents and strength.

630
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,740
Yeah.
So my observation is actually of course,

631
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,673
is a very powerful soldier,
but my observation is that that is not 

632
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:58,924
the reason.
Not so much the reason this archetype 

633
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:03,250
sticks.
Hello?

634
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,323
I read this character that he is the 
absolute embodiment of the 

635
00:41:07,391 --> 00:41:08,224
characteristics that allow you to 
content with tragedy and malevolence in 

636
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,900
an optimal way,
not just on the battlefield.

637
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,340
It's not really about the battlefield.

638
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,931
Right.
Well,

639
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,764
you see,
you see his soldierly capability as a 

640
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,440
representation of competence itself 
guided by principles.

641
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,850
Yeah.
I think that's reasonable.

642
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,513
I also think that that's probably how 
the conduct of the soldier should be 

643
00:41:30,811 --> 00:41:31,644
judged.
It that soldiers are necessary despite 

644
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,093
the mayhem that warfare produces.
We haven't figured out how to dispense 

645
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:46,910
with that.
So do you think.

646
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,580
Sorry.
Do you think that Kayden,

647
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:49,963
do you think that the Cain and Abel 
framework in which it is implicitly a 

648
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,433
structure it,
do you think that adds to do how much a 

649
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,450
story sticks?
Yes,

650
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:01,610
definitely.
Why is that?

651
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,833
Well,
because the story of Cain and Abel does 

652
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:10,601
lay out very,
very elegantly and and it was incredible

653
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:11,924
compression to fundamentally opposed 
modes of being both being characterized 

654
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,323
as able to favorite song.
The most being that characterizes Cain 

655
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,800
and Abel is competent and virtuous and 
God theory,

656
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:29,720
let's say,
but more practically,

657
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,200
which means he's allied with the highest
of principles.

658
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,380
That's the right way to think about it 
psychologically.

659
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:39,410
Whatever the higher the highest of 
principals might be.

660
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,133
There was an attempt.
One of the things that you might 

661
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:44,773
consider psychologically is that the 
movement from polytheism to monotheism 

662
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,543
parallels parallels the integration of 
the individual psyche and the 

663
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,880
development of larger and larger scale 
social organizations.

664
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,770
All those things happened at the same 
time,

665
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,030
so you imagine that the larger scale,
the organization,

666
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,343
the human organization,
so the more people included under the 

667
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,243
umbrella of the same state,
the more organized and orderly the 

668
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:18,424
principles by which that state have to 
function must be because of the 

669
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,204
increasing complexity and also the the 
problem of having to determine how the 

670
00:43:29,211 --> 00:43:32,800
state can remain intact over a long 
period of time without fragment,

671
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:34,123
so the state has to organize itself so 
that the needs and wants of the bulk of 

672
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:40,334
the population are met with sufficient 
regularity so that the state itself 

673
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:49,811
doesn't fragment and that means that the
state has to organize itself in what you

674
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:53,960
might regard as a virtuous manner.

675
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,960
That can be iterated and at the same 
time the people who compose the state in

676
00:43:59,231 --> 00:44:00,064
its increasing complexity have to ally 
themselves with that longterm state 

677
00:44:04,371 --> 00:44:06,260
goal.
So it's a.

678
00:44:06,261 --> 00:44:07,094
it's a.
it's a coalition between psychological 

679
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:13,460
integration and sociological complexity 
and and that's,

680
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,983
that is foreshadowed we might say,
or accompany by the movement from 

681
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:21,044
polytheism,
which is the polling of people in all 

682
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:26,490
directions by fundamental,
motivational and natural forces.

683
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,770
Into monotheism,
which is the direction of the

684
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,220
under the rubric of a single set of 
principles.

685
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:37,620
So single super ordinate set of 
principles.

686
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,320
Now what those principles are not 
obvious,

687
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,900
which is partly why we're having the 
discussion of gladiator.

688
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,830
So I can give you an example of this.
So for example,

689
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,560
um,
in the Old Testament,

690
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,873
you see the articulation of the guiding 
principles emerge in its most fully 

691
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:03,000
formed manner with the commandments of 
Moses.

692
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:09,190
So you might say all of the diverse 
sources that might be polled people,

693
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:14,271
hither and yon have being aggregated 
into a list of thou shalt nots.

694
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,403
Here's how to regulate yourself.
Here's how to get yourself across time 

695
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,670
so that you can have a stable,
longterm,

696
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,583
large scale society.
But then there's a mystery that emerges 

697
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,600
in the New Testament,
which is,

698
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,550
it emerges,
for example,

699
00:45:29,551 --> 00:45:32,010
with Christ is asked by the scribes and 
Pharisees,

700
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:34,140
which is the greatest of the 
commandments.

701
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:39,880
And Christ actually performs a very 
intelligent sleight of hand.

702
00:45:39,881 --> 00:45:40,750
And he says,
well,

703
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,430
you have to love God with all your heart
and all your soul.

704
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:47,220
And you have to love your brother as if 
he's yourself.

705
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:51,190
Love your neighbor as yourself on,
on those propositions,

706
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,570
all the commandments and the law.
There's an attempt to integrate even the

707
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:57,624
commandments into something that's a 
higher order principle and that 

708
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,650
principle actually manifests itself in 
Judeo Christian society as the logos,

709
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,513
whatever that is,
and it's something like truthful 

710
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:08,664
communication devoted towards the 
highest good and the embodiment of that 

711
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:14,214
becomes the fundamental principle.
And in gladiator you see movement 

712
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:19,920
towards that and embodiment,
right?

713
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:20,783
Because maximus is an organized and 
disciplined person who's governed by 

714
00:46:25,351 --> 00:46:27,270
principles.
The question is,

715
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,370
and the question is posed throughout the
movie,

716
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,700
well,
what his role right now asked for,

717
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,030
asked by Marcus Aurelius because he 
failed log.

718
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:36,923
What he's done is a failure.
It's asked by communists and it's asked 

719
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:43,590
by the sister whose,
whose name escapes me at the moment.

720
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,270
It's what?
I think it's loosened.

721
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,861
Okay?
Okay.

722
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,040
Okay.
Um,

723
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,480
and they all asked for what his role,
but she comes the closest.

724
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,750
She says it's a great idea,
but it's not.

725
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:01,710
It's an animating principle.
And the question is,

726
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,360
what is the animating principle?
Now,

727
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:04,194
whatever it is,
maximus embodies that far more than 

728
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,023
common does.
And maximus is a able figure l whereas 

729
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:18,000
comedy or comedic is
clearly a failure of,

730
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,043
of cane,
makes it proper sacrifices and they're 

731
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:25,200
never well regarded.
He says constantly,

732
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:25,741
you know,
that he,

733
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,140
all he ever did was try to please his 
father.

734
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,370
Well,
his sacrifices went on,

735
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:33,123
appreciate it.
And that's what made him bitter and 

736
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:35,164
resentful and murderous and catastrophic
death and evil and to tyrant and all 

737
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,040
that stuff.
So yes,

738
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,530
fundamentally archetypical structure.
So who do you.

739
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:51,190
This is like a compressed version of the
thesis.

740
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,830
Who Do you think in this story?
Is it common as well?

741
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:57,664
It's the same question that the social,
it's posted in the Gulag archipelago to 

742
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:02,710
some degree.
It's like,

743
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,990
do,
do you want to lose your.

744
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,140
What's worse to put your life at risk,
let's say,

745
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,290
or to put everything you love at risk or
they lose your conscience.

746
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,073
And Solzhenitsyn's conclusion was that 
there's no suffering greater than that 

747
00:48:17,291 --> 00:48:20,700
which accompanies last
exhale.

748
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:23,973
There's something very,
very profound about that because one of 

749
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:27,480
the things I've just been reading about 
this,

750
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:32,490
interestingly enough,
that was the prophet Elijah who,

751
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,620
who first seems to have.

752
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,860
It's in the story of the profitable,
profitable Asia as far as I can tell,

753
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:48,120
where there's the first intimation that 
God might speak to human beings,

754
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:52,390
not as the external force of natural 
power,

755
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,430
storms,
fire,

756
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,240
wind,
winter earthquakes,

757
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:02,290
all the,
all the overwhelming natural forces that

758
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,124
human beings were subject to or maybe 
even not as internal forces that would 

759
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:10,174
more characterize some of the other 
polytheistic gods like lost or rage or 

760
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,410
or terror,
but as the voice of conscience itself,

761
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,363
which which is which is described in one
kings which is this contains the story 

762
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:32,210
of Elijah asked the still small voice.
That's the first time that that frees.

763
00:49:32,211 --> 00:49:33,044
It merges and so it's the idea that 
there's something that there's a 

764
00:49:35,951 --> 00:49:40,570
psychological factor conscious itself 
that calls to you,

765
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,603
that that has a dialogue with you.
Even more importantly because it's 

766
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,140
conscious,
doesn't tell you what to do.

767
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,840
It hints at what you shouldn't do and it
isn't a deterministic force.

768
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:54,600
It's not like when your conscious 
scripts you,

769
00:49:54,601 --> 00:49:58,450
you're forced to act in a manner that's 
in accordance with your conscience.

770
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,493
You can choose to violate it,
and so there's this idea that God 

771
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,270
transforms himself or becomes known as 
the voice of conscience and the facts,

772
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,880
the late between human beings and 
divinity itself.

773
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,850
I actually think this is a highly 
credible hypothesis.

774
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,183
Let's say that what you need and 
powerful sustaining meaning to keep you 

775
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:22,354
from the bitterness of cane and that's 
to be found in the relationship with 

776
00:50:25,841 --> 00:50:29,600
something of divine significance.
Well,

777
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,120
maybe that's mediated through your 
conscience

778
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:37,480
and this relationship is absent within 
Kane.

779
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,680
He severed his relationship with 
consciousness and consciousness,

780
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:45,350
but with conscience,
conscience of

781
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,590
conscious.
Yeah.

782
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:49,430
Well,
that's right,

783
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,264
because conscience,
his management conscience is the 

784
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:58,030
manifestation of the instate for good 
and evil.

785
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,010
Yeah.
Nope.

786
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,153
So we can take the argument that a 
little bit about what makes people 

787
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,020
bitter is that they feel that there is 
wrong in the world.

788
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,360
It might be a large scale.
Society is unfair.

789
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,323
The natural world is a catastrophe.
Human beings are intrinsically 

790
00:51:16,971 --> 00:51:21,971
malevolent that the structure of being 
itself is wrong in some moral sense.

791
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:24,223
Okay,
but that's interesting because they 

792
00:51:25,401 --> 00:51:26,234
wouldn't be bothered by that if they 
didn't have some sense of morality 

793
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:32,200
itself.
Well,

794
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,133
that what that means is that conscious,
even the conscious that's driving them 

795
00:51:36,381 --> 00:51:37,214
towards their cynicism is the dawning of
the realization of a moral dimension to 

796
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:43,850
life.
Now,

797
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,013
conscience doesn't seem to manifest 
itself as an alien force that cannot be 

798
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,564
denied.
It's more something that beckons and 

799
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:58,700
Harkins and also something that you need
to enter into a negotiation with.

800
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,190
Interestingly enough,
in the Old Testament,

801
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:06,220
even before the transformation of God,
let's say into the voice of conscience,

802
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:09,410
you have continual intimations that 
whatever.

803
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,161
Yeah,
wait,

804
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:13,310
is is something that can be negotiated 
with.

805
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:14,893
So for example,
Abraham negotiates with Yahuah when he 

806
00:52:18,141 --> 00:52:23,141
tries to save the inhabitants of Sodom 
from being decimated by God's wrath,

807
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,890
he bargains.
He says,

808
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,960
well,
if I could find 50 good men,

809
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:29,120
will you spare the city?
And God says,

810
00:52:29,121 --> 00:52:29,920
yes.
It's one of,

811
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,750
if I can find 20,
if I could find 10,

812
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,930
if I can find a single good map.
And God,

813
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,660
strangely enough,
despite his own audience,

814
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,600
agrees this bargain,
and so god,

815
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:45,320
even in the Old Testament,
the Old Testament,

816
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:49,240
God's often pilloried as a very 
intransigent and tyrannical va,

817
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,683
but it's clear even in the earlier 
stories that he could be negotiated 

818
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,710
with,
oddly enough.

819
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:59,270
Then you see the same thing with Jacob 
who eventually becomes Israel,

820
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,123
right?
And Israel means he who wrestles with 

821
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,530
God,
which is very,

822
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:04,970
very interesting idea,
right?

823
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,960
Is that if God can be assimilated to 
conscience,

824
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,133
then what that means is that the true 
followers of God are those who wrestled 

825
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:18,020
with their conscience and Jacob,
before he's transformed into Israel.

826
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,600
Jacob's a trickster figure,
right?

827
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:22,310
He's a.
he's a maneuver.

828
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,170
He's a salesman.
He's a.

829
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,680
he's someone who's not above using 
trickery to gain is an because he cheats

830
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:29,780
his brother,
for example,

831
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:30,623
out of his birthright,
and that is subject to the same 

832
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,830
treatment at the hands of his uncle,
but in any case,

833
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,673
he's not classically moral person,
but he wrestles with the angel on the 

834
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:40,674
banks of the river when he returns to 
see the product that he's betrayed and 

835
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,893
he wrestled all night with an angel who 
also turns out to be God who puts his 

836
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:49,404
hip joint.
It's a very contentious battle and he 

837
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:52,704
actually defeats the angel who is gone 
and requires him to bless it in the 

838
00:53:58,771 --> 00:53:59,604
morning,
and the blessing is that Jacob will now 

839
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,374
be called Israel,
and that's he who wrestles successfully 

840
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:09,080
with believably interesting sequence of 
ideas because it all.

841
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,500
It also speaks,
I think,

842
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,020
to something approximating human 
destiny.

843
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:13,980
It's like,
well,

844
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:18,981
what's the purpose of man with God in 
God's absence?

845
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:22,080
What will say,
forget God's absence for a moment,

846
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:22,914
but assuming God,
what's the purpose of man given the 

847
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,170
garden to the president and,
and,

848
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:34,140
and I'm
omnipotent.

849
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,813
What's the purpose of man?
And it looks like the the fundamental 

850
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:39,984
idea that's emerging as monotheism 
emergency in the West is that go on and 

851
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:49,080
enter into a partnership to cocreate the
world.

852
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,153
It's something like that and that,
that you do that under the guidance of 

853
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:53,430
your conscious.

854
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,533
So the destiny of men would be to 
transcend in dialog with God 

855
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,620
symbolically speaking,

856
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,553
yes,
and to overcome suffering to the degree 

857
00:55:01,211 --> 00:55:02,044
that that can be managed and to overcome
malevolence to the degree that that can 

858
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:09,520
be managed at the dialogue with God.
That's.

859
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,383
That's the idea that emerges.
That's the great monotheistic idea and 

860
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,330
the thing that it sort of a 
continuation,

861
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:21,331
but stay up the argument I was making 
out with you before about responsibility

862
00:55:21,911 --> 00:55:22,870
in meaning.
It's like,

863
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:23,621
well,
let's.

864
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,454
Let's assume that you find meaning and 
responsibility and that you need a 

865
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:31,360
meeting that will sustain you through 
suffering and malevolence.

866
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:31,901
It's like,
well,

867
00:55:31,901 --> 00:55:33,670
where's that?
Well,

868
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:38,290
let's say it's to be found in hearkening
to the clarion call of conscience.

869
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:42,340
It cody's like,
I can't see how that's wrong.

870
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,230
Maybe if you can also reverse engineer 
it,

871
00:55:46,231 --> 00:55:48,120
that if you take communists as a test 
case,

872
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,730
that when you sever the relationship 
between the individual,

873
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:55,260
the individual and conscious,
then suffering is maximized.

874
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:56,743
Well,
look,

875
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,643
he's.
He suffers terribly isolated from 

876
00:56:00,041 --> 00:56:00,874
everyone,
but the the thing he suffers most from 

877
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,250
is the fact that is alienated from his 
father.

878
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:08,490
Right.
And that,

879
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,230
that,
that torments him terribly.

880
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,120
And that's actually why he hates maximus
so much.

881
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,720
Retail against the team enabled stories 
because Maximus,

882
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,630
for all of the terrible things that's 
happened to him,

883
00:56:19,631 --> 00:56:23,740
he's never severed from the father.
Yeah,

884
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:26,930
and that's the thing come you just 
cannot tolerate.

885
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:30,950
And I do think that this suffering 
exceeds that of maximus.

886
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,510
Yeah,
perfect.

887
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:36,110
Because it's so pointless
to me.

888
00:56:36,111 --> 00:56:41,111
It's such a striking and interesting 
idea then that then to be corrupt,

889
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,840
until it's more suffering than to be the
victim of corruption.

890
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,270
If you're righteous,
you're righteous victim.

891
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,043
It feels so profound and not,
not not that intuitively true because 

892
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:58,200
maximum he loses everything.
His wife and son are murdered.

893
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:00,310
He didn't slip,
so it's not

894
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,550
as common as emperor.
Yeah,

895
00:57:04,551 --> 00:57:05,384
so it's not at face value.
Obvious then maximus suffers less than 

896
00:57:09,351 --> 00:57:10,940
comedy is,
right.

897
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,730
I agree with it,
but it seems,

898
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,583
but it seems to be the thesis running 
throughout the theme was perhaps the 

899
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,334
only reason that Maxima suffers less to 
some degree is that the fact that he's 

900
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:25,874
maintained,
his virtue makes this suffering 

901
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:31,550
bearable,
and you see that as well.

902
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,300
When he has the argument with the man 
who comes to own him,

903
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,193
the former of gladiator decides to do 
the honorable thing and to smuggle 

904
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,293
maximum sort of the of the prison.
He also decides to to take the path of 

905
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:51,643
virtue.
That in some sense gives a transcendent 

906
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:57,410
meaning to his life.
Yet every deems him because he wasn't.

907
00:57:57,411 --> 00:57:59,210
He was also.
He was also a miserable.

908
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,100
Right,
right,

909
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:01,963
and so,
but the redemption that interesting 

910
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,124
there too.
The redemption comes at the cost of his 

911
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:06,314
own death and there's a very interesting
architectural theme there as well 

912
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:11,114
because it is seeing what happens is 
monotheism develops in the West as a 

913
00:58:18,181 --> 00:58:21,390
carbonates,
at least along the Christian mind,

914
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:22,224
is thinking in the figure of Christ,
is that the principle that becomes the 

915
00:58:26,511 --> 00:58:28,670
highest ideal is

916
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,083
the.

917
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,153
It's the mode of being that takes 
suffering voluntarily onto itself as 

918
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,500
it's full responsibility,
right?

919
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:40,260
That's the acceptance of the 
crucifixion,

920
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:43,040
the betrayal that goes along with it.
So yeah,

921
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,480
you know,
Christ spaces statement in the desert,

922
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:49,800
so that's the confrontation with 
malevolence and accepts the necessity of

923
00:58:49,801 --> 00:58:52,950
its own bodily death,
so that's natural.

924
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:53,903
That's the.
That's the terrible power of nature 

925
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:56,394
manifested in death and the terrible 
power of society manifested in the 

926
00:58:59,611 --> 00:59:01,620
ability to punch,
so any faces,

927
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,180
all of those things voluntarily,

928
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,560
and the the,
the,

929
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,753
the

930
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,083
psychological process that enables that 
in some sense of the transcendence is 

931
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,460
the death and rebirth,
rebirth,

932
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,960
and to be redeemed means allow yourself 
to die when necessary.

933
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:27,160
See what happens with the,
with the,

934
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,020
with the gladiator,
the head gladiators.

935
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:34,380
He allows himself to die necessary.
Now he dies a physical death,

936
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:37,910
but there's,
but there's metaphysical deaths that can

937
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:42,110
be undertaken continually.
It's a spiritual death.

938
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:42,973
It's like if you encounter,
if you find yourself entangled in 

939
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,620
corruption and you need to set yourself 
right as a consequence,

940
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,303
what that means is that you have to 
sacrifice some of yourself to the 

941
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:03,590
erroneous part of yourself and so the 
idea is that you can.

942
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,490
You can die and be reborn in a spiritual
sense.

943
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,470
That's what baptism is,
for example,

944
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,543
and that that's what leads you is the 
identification with that part of you 

945
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:14,174
that will die and be reborn in the 
furtherance in pursuit of a higher 

946
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:18,974
order.
Principles

947
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:23,360
are then.
That's what the Holy Ghost.

948
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,743
I think that's the idea of the holy 
ghost fleets as like a gel or something 

949
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:29,114
like that.

950
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,300
Let me just see what.
What would be the best transition

951
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,610
because we do more complex,
which we're talking about.

952
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:45,140
Art is the next thing and you wanted to 
refer us to the last two.

953
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,660
So we still have individualization,
individuation.

954
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,060
Let's start with art,
but look,

955
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,100
look,
I mean I was looking,

956
01:00:52,101 --> 01:00:52,934
for example,
at a painting last night which was 

957
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:58,670
Rafales transfiguration of Christ,
and it's this,

958
01:00:58,910 --> 01:00:59,743
so the transfiguration occurs when 
Christ goes up on the mountain with his 

959
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:05,180
disciples,
I think it's Peter,

960
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:10,181
James and John,
and on the mountain he meets Moses,

961
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,600
so bearer of the mosaic law,
and he meets a lot of show and Elijah is

962
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,660
a prophet who encounters the still small
voice and he's transfigured,

963
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,760
his face shines.
His clothing is,

964
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,140
is,
is,

965
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,750
is lightened to an unbearable,
some like whiteness and it's.

966
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:35,060
It's too much for the disciples to 
tolerate to see all this and so,

967
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,000
so that's his transfiguration.

968
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,340
Then when he comes down from the 
mountaintop,

969
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:41,263
this is all portrayed in this painting 
for she seemed the transfiguration at 

970
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:45,914
the top.
You see the second part of the story at 

971
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:49,970
the bottom,
he comes down and he cast that demon out

972
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:52,850
of a young man and I thought,
well,

973
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:57,510
that's unbelievably apropos because
you know,

974
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,470
while you're smiling,
you can see why it's apropos.

975
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:01,304
At least to some degree.
It's like I think that we all have the 

976
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:05,984
proclivity to be possessed to to a 
greater or lesser degree by the modern 

977
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:11,813
day equivalent of of demons and that's 
ideological possession or possession by 

978
01:02:16,341 --> 01:02:17,174
cynicism,
possession by that cynicism 

979
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:24,430
characterized in possession by nihilism 
or these totalitarian ideologies and the

980
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:27,091
question is,
well,

981
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:31,200
how are those cast out?
And the answer is,

982
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:34,330
and this is portrayed in the painting,
it's portrayed in the story,

983
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:38,190
but strange story of Christ's 
transfiguration and its association with

984
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:39,024
Moses and Elijah,
unbelievably complex narrative 

985
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:42,990
structures,
right?

986
01:02:42,991 --> 01:02:43,824
Pointing at something that was not fully
articulated like that's intuited by the 

987
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:49,464
storytellers and the artist step,
the willingness to die and be reborn in 

988
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:55,374
the service of the highest principle is 
the process by which possession is 

989
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,353
eradicated.

990
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:06,203
That's an idea that idea so 
overwhelmingly complicated and 

991
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:11,714
sophisticated than it has to be dreamed 
up and it has to be represented 

992
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:17,790
artistically before it can be 
comprehended.

993
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,540
The painting by Rafaelle,
the one I'm describing that was regarded

994
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:26,541
as the greatest oil painting in the 
world for 300 years.

995
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:31,380
It's a non trivial piece of art like I 
think it was painted.

996
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,573
Let me just,
let me just check this because I might 

997
01:03:34,391 --> 01:03:39,391
as well get the date right.
It was a renaissance painting.

998
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:44,760
Rafaelle.

999
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,860
Okay,
so from 15,

1000
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,400
20 to 18,
20,

1001
01:03:57,401 --> 01:04:00,040
that was regarded as the greatest oil 
painting in the world.

1002
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:01,500
That's three centuries.
That's.

1003
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:02,743
You got it.
You got to think about something like 

1004
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,530
that happens,
like what's being represented there?

1005
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:10,840
Well,
I think it's what's being represented is

1006
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:11,674
something akin to what I've just been 
discussing and that's a good example of 

1007
01:04:14,621 --> 01:04:15,454
how the artists to storytellers and at 
the end the image makers are lay the 

1008
01:04:22,421 --> 01:04:23,254
pathway for articulated representations.
You see the same thing happening in 

1009
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:27,930
cardiac,
right?

1010
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:28,773
Because it's a story but.
But there's a moral to the story and 

1011
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,183
there's a pointer towards an articulated
set of principles potentially 

1012
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:40,780
articulated set of principles.
So the idea you just laid out,

1013
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:41,703
you think that it had to be.
It had to manifest itself in a dream 

1014
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:50,050
restory version before it could be 
articulated like in an operational way.

1015
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:53,170
Yeah.
Because of the ideas have to look.

1016
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,030
The way I look at it this,
this waves,

1017
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:56,013
first of all,
to some degree these ideas are encoded 

1018
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:02,890
in behavior.
So for example,

1019
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,070
in Exodus,
Moses received the law,

1020
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:07,883
but remember before he received the law,
he's wandering around in the desert for 

1021
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:12,334
a long time,
so it's in chaos with with a group of 

1022
01:05:15,881 --> 01:05:16,714
extraordinary these
who are constantly fighting amongst 

1023
01:05:20,471 --> 01:05:24,190
themselves and who are constantly 
tempted to worship other idols.

1024
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:30,030
So in in a chaotic state.
Then the temptation of principles,

1025
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:33,313
we really manifest itself.
What principle should be guiding us and 

1026
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:40,220
that's portrayed in the exit was story 
as the proclivity to chase after false.

1027
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:41,793
Now the Israelites actually come to 
Moses for a very long period of time in 

1028
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:49,000
pairs or families to adjudicate 
disputes,

1029
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,530
and so he does that to the point of 
exhaustion.

1030
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:53,740
This is prior to receiving the 10 
commandments,

1031
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:56,530
and so what's what happens with the 10 
commandments.

1032
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:57,943
As Moses comes to realize to revelation,
he comes to realize it and articulated 

1033
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:09,670
manner to principles that the Israelites
are already,

1034
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,533
to some degree implicitly guided by that
actually produce peace and harmony 

1035
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,013
behavioral patterns that no one knows 
what they are because they're not 

1036
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,300
conscious enough that they have mapped 
themselves enough.

1037
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,163
So the mosaic revelation is part of that
process of mapping and the mapping 

1038
01:06:28,331 --> 01:06:29,164
itself is represented in the story of 
Moses and within the story of Moses is 

1039
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:36,110
actually contained the articulated 
virtue,

1040
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:37,420
the commandments,
let's say,

1041
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:41,620
but that's only part of the process of 
the unfolding of the virtue.

1042
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:44,820
It still doesn't answer the question,
which is the question.

1043
01:06:44,821 --> 01:06:46,540
It's eventually posted to Christ.
It's like,

1044
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,680
well,
that's all well and good,

1045
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:50,560
but what's the highest virtue?
Well,

1046
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:54,010
that's,
that's any insanely complicated question

1047
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,450
because it's no different than,
well,

1048
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:57,490
how should you conduct your life?

1049
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:58,211
Right?
It's,

1050
01:06:58,211 --> 01:06:59,044
it's the hardest questions,
and so we've had to gather as a 

1051
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:06,880
collective.
We've had to gather information about,

1052
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,380
well,
what is it?

1053
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,603
What does it look like when someone,
when a particular person lives in 

1054
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:13,863
undesirable life?
We tell the story of someone who lives 

1055
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:17,584
in undesirable life or maybe he tells 
his own story and then we aggregate a 

1056
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:21,064
hundred stories of undesirable life and 
then we abstract out from those stories 

1057
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,740
what constitutes undesirable and so 
that's like a picture of cane,

1058
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,340
right?
It's a portrait of cane.

1059
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:33,023
We do the same thing on the other side.
We we listen to people who who've lived 

1060
01:07:36,611 --> 01:07:41,140
triumphantly and we aggregate their 
stories and we set the size of you say,

1061
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:41,974
well then we we,
we extract from that a portrait of able 

1062
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,243
and that's a precursor like
the successful and the unsuccessful are 

1063
01:07:50,501 --> 01:07:55,501
precursors to Abel and Cain and Abel and
Cain are precursors to the divine,

1064
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,823
the divine finger,
so the divine figures of Christ that 

1065
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:00,860
Satan,
right?

1066
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:01,703
It's,
it's an abstract process of continual 

1067
01:08:04,091 --> 01:08:04,924
abstraction and that's all done through 
at least to begin with through ritual 

1068
01:08:09,191 --> 01:08:13,690
and narrative and art is so complicated.
It can't be done then the other way,

1069
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:19,620
so first it's acted out and an entrusted
domain of ritual art and narratives.

1070
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:24,930
Then it becomes operational like an 
traditional loop,

1071
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:26,210
right?
Because once,

1072
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:29,150
well,
once you get the image of the ritual,

1073
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:33,290
then those modes of communication start 
to alter behavior,

1074
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:35,640
you know,
so it's like,

1075
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,460
well,
that's why we're having this discussion.

1076
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:38,294
We're talking about,
we're talking about a movie that's an 

1077
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:41,534
artistic representation and we're 
discussing it to articulate principles 

1078
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:45,644
and we're also articulating those 
principles so that in principle our 

1079
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:51,770
behavior can be altered.
And I never thought about the loop.

1080
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,110
Oh yeah.
See these things,

1081
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:56,090
these things feed back,
right?

1082
01:08:56,091 --> 01:08:57,300
So the,
it's,

1083
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:58,243
it's the collective behavior.
It's that negotiation at the collective 

1084
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,350
level,
fractious centuries long linear,

1085
01:09:05,351 --> 01:09:09,140
long negotiation that produces something
like that.

1086
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:09,974
Synthesis synthesis is represented in,
in drama and mythology and ritual and 

1087
01:09:15,471 --> 01:09:17,000
art.
Then next articulate.

1088
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:17,913
But those notes.
And so the whole process starts to 

1089
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,770
spiral up,
spiral upward editing,

1090
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:28,180
increasingly rapid rate.
So look,

1091
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,693
when I was always wondering that if this
archetypal patterns that lead to the 

1092
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:36,560
most favorable life are already known 
for such a long time,

1093
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:39,500
why does any,
every generation seems to have to invent

1094
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:40,820
them.
And you know,

1095
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,763
there's,
there's no to known like one of the 

1096
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,384
things but plato,
socrates insisted on was that learning 

1097
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:50,750
was remembering.

1098
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,760
Okay,
so let's say that when you're born you,

1099
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:59,920
you have a proclivity to manifest the 
number of patterns and you certainly do.

1100
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,980
You can manifest the patterns of rage 
and fear and hunger and thirst and like,

1101
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,340
but,
but then also imagined,

1102
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:11,410
okay,
so it's something like this,

1103
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,170
as this looping process occurred,

1104
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,633
the people who are more likely to 
manifest the pattern that is being 

1105
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:30,301
pointed to are more practically likely 
to live and to successfully propagate.

1106
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:35,973
So there's an evolutionary elephant that
the society values something and the 

1107
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:42,934
degree to which you manifest that value 
is proportionate to your success and 

1108
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:50,080
your success is proportionate to your 
reproductive fitness.

1109
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,303
Then as that overtime the proclivity for
that sort of ethical behavior will 

1110
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:02,350
become coded in some sense in your 
genetic structure selected for,

1111
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:07,210
for that.
So then you might say,

1112
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:10,300
well that exists.
This is Mrs. What the archetype is.

1113
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:11,134
In some sense it exists as the 
possibility of being gripped by a 

1114
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,224
particular kind division.
Now there might be enough diversity in 

1115
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:24,120
the ideal so that you can't emerge from 
the womb

1116
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:29,220
fully Christian if you don't know what I
mean,

1117
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:33,403
but that doesn't mean that there won't 
be something that can suit you as a 

1118
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:38,274
consequence of observing the 
manifestation of a kind of ideal and it 

1119
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:45,990
doesn't to you because otherwise you 
wouldn't be gripped by the damn stories.

1120
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,160
But here's the rub to it.
Can't be hard coded.

1121
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:56,490
Exactly.
So here's,

1122
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:59,850
here's something interesting about 
Christianity.

1123
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:05,300
It was actually posed as an interesting 
question in and the musical Jesus Christ

1124
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:08,470
superstar near the end,
um,

1125
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:09,603
the,
the,

1126
01:12:09,670 --> 01:12:10,503
the,
the actor who played Judas asked Christ 

1127
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:16,830
after he's dead,
that sort of a,

1128
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,730
there's a scene where everyone's singing
and dancing.

1129
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:25,731
It's a strange sort of disco scene.
And Judas asks why Christ had to come to

1130
01:12:26,281 --> 01:12:27,114
Earth at such a strange time and in such
an isolated place because he appears as 

1131
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,690
a carpenter in a region,
you know,

1132
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:37,680
2000 years ago.
Why then,

1133
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,603
why is there?
And that answer is the divine principle 

1134
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:48,590
has to manifest itself constantly within
the confines of an individual life.

1135
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:54,080
With all of the peculiar idiosyncrasies 
and limitation for that individual life,

1136
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:55,823
and so part of the reason that the ideal
beckons is because you can't just be 

1137
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:06,621
born as Christ
because Christ represents,

1138
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,220
let's say,
this overarching idea.

1139
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,053
It's actually been union of the divine 
with the particulars of your time and 

1140
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,620
place and so because your particular 
eyes.

1141
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,143
Then you have to determine how to 
manifest the archetype in your 

1142
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:23,184
conditions and your specific conditions 
that's partly associated with that 

1143
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:31,350
dialogue with your conscious,
so there's an architecture mode of being

1144
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:33,083
supposedly,
ideally we'd have to integrate in with 

1145
01:13:34,891 --> 01:13:39,090
your surroundings and what needs to be 
met.

1146
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:42,090
That's right.
It has to be manifest in the particulars

1147
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:45,450
of your time and place.
That's the individuation process.

1148
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:50,160
That's exactly what it is because you 
regard the self.

1149
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,440
You'll regard to Christ as a symbol of 
the self.

1150
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,323
He actually reversed the spiritual and 
the psychological and sociological and 

1151
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,240
psychological,
and he thought he was thinking about the

1152
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:07,130
cosmic Christ as for Yoga,
selfless,

1153
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:07,973
the totality of individual,
but it was everything that you were 

1154
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:12,130
right

1155
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,800
now,
everything that you were in the past,

1156
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:15,634
but also everything that you could 
possibly become a cross your set of 

1157
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:22,900
potential futures.

1158
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:24,173
Here's there's one paragraph from young 
then I'm going to send to you in the 

1159
01:14:26,901 --> 01:14:30,060
chat right now and I would like to ask 
you if you could,

1160
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:31,093
could read it out.
It's not that long because I think that 

1161
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:36,320
illustrates exactly what what you're 
talking about.

1162
01:14:37,070 --> 01:14:42,070
I'm sending you a link.
If you click on it,

1163
01:14:46,161 --> 01:14:46,994
it's an image.

1164
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,760
What is summit is for each
when the bug unfolds and from the lesser

1165
01:14:55,851 --> 01:14:59,240
to greater emergence.
As Nietzsche says,

1166
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,133
one becomes two and a greater faker,
which always was but which remained 

1167
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:05,504
invisible appears to the lesser 
personality with the force of 

1168
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,980
revelation.
Yes,

1169
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:12,260
and that's the manifestation of the 
self.

1170
01:15:12,261 --> 01:15:15,110
That's right.
What that is is an intimation of who you

1171
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:20,111
could be and it's also an intimation of 
what you're associated with.

1172
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:22,820
That might guide you to what you could 
be,

1173
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,030
so you might say it's a revelation of 
your old core stability,

1174
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:31,250
but it's your rev revelation of your 
possibility in relationship to something

1175
01:15:31,251 --> 01:15:33,220
that's infinite transcendent.
Yeah.

1176
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:37,100
That's the one I would also say that 
that does.

1177
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,023
That is also very commonly manifested by
a transformation in the relationship 

1178
01:15:43,131 --> 01:15:46,280
with conscious because when something 
like this happens,

1179
01:15:46,281 --> 01:15:48,350
sometimes this happens to people,
for example,

1180
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,700
in a hallucinatory or psychedelic 
experiences,

1181
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:54,103
right?
They start to take their conscience 

1182
01:15:55,641 --> 01:16:00,560
seriously as the CEO believed,
at least to some degree that

1183
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,883
what guided your interest and that would
include your conscious was a 

1184
01:16:07,381 --> 01:16:08,214
manifestation of the totality of the 
self in the restricted domain of the 

1185
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:15,040
present.
Okay,

1186
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:15,781
so that's.
Okay,

1187
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,330
so.
So okay.

1188
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,780
Which one always was,
but which remained invisible,

1189
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,880
right?
That's the heavenly father.

1190
01:16:23,890 --> 01:16:26,870
That would be.
The markets are really as principal,

1191
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,970
that manifested itself in,
in,

1192
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:29,933
in Maximus that resists and which 
markets really has also made himself 

1193
01:16:37,711 --> 01:16:40,830
subordinate to at least to some degree,
right?

1194
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:44,400
That's the one which always was,
but which remained invisible.

1195
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:45,383
Yeah.

1196
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:51,740
He was truly an hopelessly little will 
always drank.

1197
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:52,574
The revelation of the greater down to 
the level of this littleness and will 

1198
01:16:57,201 --> 01:17:00,750
never understand that the day of 
judgment for his littleness has dawn,

1199
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:07,320
the man who is inwardly great.
We'll know that the long expected friend

1200
01:17:07,321 --> 01:17:08,154
of his soul,
the immortal one has now really come to 

1201
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:12,194
lead captivity captive.
That is to seize hold of him by who was 

1202
01:17:16,561 --> 01:17:17,394
a mortal,
had always been confined and held 

1203
01:17:18,951 --> 01:17:22,100
prisoner and to make his life flow into 
that greater life.

1204
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,380
A moment of deadliest peril.

1205
01:17:27,390 --> 01:17:28,223
Just prophetic vision of the tightrope 
Walker reveals the awful danger that 

1206
01:17:31,861 --> 01:17:32,694
lies in having a tight rope,
walking attitude towards an event to 

1207
01:17:35,971 --> 01:17:39,330
which St Paul gave the most exalted name
he could find.

1208
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,970
Yeah,
that's quite a.

1209
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,610
that's quite the densely pack.
That one

1210
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:49,883
it's from.
It's from the archetypes and the 

1211
01:17:50,911 --> 01:17:55,020
collective unconscious page 1:21 if 
that's volume one,

1212
01:17:55,021 --> 01:17:56,900
right?
Because volume two is ion,

1213
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,010
which is even more frightening books,
so yes,

1214
01:17:59,011 --> 01:17:59,844
because in apparel talks about there is 
the parallel psychosis at least in part 

1215
01:18:04,231 --> 01:18:08,760
inflation because the manifestation of 
that,

1216
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:11,850
that second figure,
but say the self,

1217
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,170
it's,
it's,

1218
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,003
it's a devil's temptation as well 
because once you see that there's a 

1219
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:21,000
relationship between you and the 
transcendent,

1220
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,510
let's say you start to take that 
seriously and you can,

1221
01:18:24,990 --> 01:18:25,823
you can,
you can become inflated by that 

1222
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,560
prophetic duty,
let's say,

1223
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:35,130
and and that's,
and that's a very dangerous.

1224
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:39,220
He actually writes this like 20 pages 
further,

1225
01:18:39,221 --> 01:18:40,054
use this for the great psych danger,
which always is always connected with 

1226
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:43,734
individuation lies in the identification
of ego consciousness with the self is 

1227
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:49,230
produced inflammation,
which Trenton,

1228
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:53,030
which threatens conscience consciousness
is illusion.

1229
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,940
Yes.
And he wrote a great essay,

1230
01:18:54,941 --> 01:18:58,410
a great essay called relations between 
the ego and the unconscious,

1231
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,633
which is completely unconscious,
incomprehensible unless you know the 

1232
01:19:02,311 --> 01:19:03,144
background that we're discussing where 
he wasn't very carefully that you have 

1233
01:19:07,261 --> 01:19:10,910
to stay in the proper relationship to 
the self,

1234
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:12,920
right?
If the self overtakes the,

1235
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:14,043
the,
the,

1236
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:15,023
the ego,
then that's a descent into like manic 

1237
01:19:18,811 --> 01:19:23,340
religious insanity.
That ones has to be struck where there's

1238
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,174
a relationship with the transcendent,
but there's also still the grounding in 

1239
01:19:28,381 --> 01:19:32,400
the particular stuff here and now you 
see this echoed this idea equity.

1240
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,253
Interestingly enough,
in the superhero mythology that 

1241
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,180
dominated the adolescents imagination in
20th century,

1242
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,170
every superhero,
so imagine the superhero.

1243
01:19:42,171 --> 01:19:46,230
It's like a partial manifestation of the
redemptive archetype.

1244
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,620
Every superhero has to have an alter 
ego.

1245
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,090
And the alter ego well for Superman is 
Clark camp,

1246
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:57,240
mild mannered reporter and for 
Spiderman,

1247
01:19:57,241 --> 01:19:58,170
it's,
you know,

1248
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,590
high school,
troubled high school,

1249
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:01,443
cause I nerd.
But what's so interesting about those 

1250
01:20:05,431 --> 01:20:10,080
stories is that they understand without 
the alter ego,

1251
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:15,200
there's no superhero that both of those 
have to exist at the same time,

1252
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:16,853
the limitations and the end,
the transcendence of the limitations 

1253
01:20:21,121 --> 01:20:25,750
have to both be there at that terrible 
paradoxical juxtaposition

1254
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:28,713
because the character isn't.
The character can't exist without that 

1255
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,520
tension.
And I think that that's.

1256
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,683
Well,
that motif wouldn't recur continually 

1257
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:43,581
unless there was something to it that 
was narratively precise and accurate.

1258
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:45,953
There's something in this paragraph that
I want to tie it together when our 

1259
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,320
previous stuff,
because you talks about the end stage of

1260
01:20:52,321 --> 01:20:55,680
individuation as a coming together with 
the immortal.

1261
01:20:55,740 --> 01:20:56,573
It goes with the immortal.
Now Joseph Campbell Campbell does 

1262
01:20:58,711 --> 01:20:59,850
exactly the same.
He says,

1263
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:00,684
the Christ in you doesn't die.
The Christ and you survived the death 

1264
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:05,910
and resurrection and use that in our 
last talk.

1265
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,730
When you close your,
um,

1266
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,483
you've never elaborated on the death of 
socrates and how he died in truth and 

1267
01:21:14,601 --> 01:21:15,434
honor.
And then you said that part of the 

1268
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:20,040
spirit doesn't die.
So there is this theme of

1269
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:26,660
these people are somehow connected with 
something that is immortal and eternal,

1270
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:32,430
could not be understood simply as they 
have

1271
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:38,040
established a relationship with an 
archetypal mode of being that is eternal

1272
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,870
and that continues to exist beyond them 
and before them,

1273
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,003
but they've,
they've established a relationship with 

1274
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:46,210
that.
Is that what that,

1275
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:47,150
what he means by,

1276
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:50,330
by the immortal?
Yes.

1277
01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:52,000
That,
that is what's meant.

1278
01:21:52,001 --> 01:21:53,280
Is that right?
It's that.

1279
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:55,490
It's the turtle pattern.
It's theater.

1280
01:21:56,230 --> 01:22:00,460
It's like you're the eternal music and 
the music goes on.

1281
01:22:00,461 --> 01:22:01,294
Even if you depart the scene,
the Christian is a Christian insistence 

1282
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:05,934
so that that I also wouldn't overlook 
which is that also characterized as the 

1283
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:13,540
finite,
right?

1284
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:18,140
That's the promise of the resurrection.
The resurrection of the body is that the

1285
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:18,993
Christians insists that about 
transcendent factor exists and that's 

1286
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:24,183
the Christ.
That's the word that's there at the 

1287
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:29,020
beginning of time and at the end of time
as as the judging revelation,

1288
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:33,200
write this transcendent locals that's 
eternal,

1289
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:37,510
but that's no more valuable in some 
sense.

1290
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:41,650
Then the particular
creature that's that's,

1291
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:42,613
that's subject to apparent,
apparent permanent death and it's very 

1292
01:22:49,061 --> 01:22:49,894
difficult for modern people to grant the
idea of the bodily resurrection any 

1293
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,153
credence and
it's not something of which anyone can 

1294
01:23:01,211 --> 01:23:03,790
speak.
I believe with any degree of

1295
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:08,873
what would you say it,
knowing the Oregon consort or something 

1296
01:23:11,161 --> 01:23:14,280
like that,
but at the same token,

1297
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:18,420
the world is a very strange place and it
isn't obvious to me that

1298
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:27,120
I've learned to.
I've learned to be very cautious in

1299
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:33,880
Housley dismissing deep and ancient 
ideas regardless of their strangeness,

1300
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:37,810
and I do think that.
See,

1301
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:38,644
the thing that's so interesting about 
that Christian insistence is that it 

1302
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:46,890
valorizes the particular unbelievably 
important because you could say,

1303
01:23:47,171 --> 01:23:48,004
well,
if it's merely a matter of the eternal 

1304
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,113
and the particular doesn't matter,
but then if the particular doesn't 

1305
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,054
matter,
you ended up with that kind of 

1306
01:23:55,721 --> 01:24:00,000
nihilistic Buddhism,
the suffering that characterizes or even

1307
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:00,853
in the proclivity for Christianity to 
degenerate into the forums that Nisha 

1308
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:07,900
criticized,
which is well,

1309
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:10,810
when you chase everything,
we do an eternal beyond.

1310
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,033
It justifies everything terrible that's 
happening on earth as trivial and 

1311
01:24:14,861 --> 01:24:15,694
insignificant.
That relieves you of your moral 

1312
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:19,450
responsibility for,
for addressing it.

1313
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,810
You can't,
at the very minimum,

1314
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:23,644
the idea that the body is resurrected 
valorization of the value of the 

1315
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,644
particular here and now,
and an emphasis on the fact that that 

1316
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:37,780
has defined value as well.
It needs to be attended to and cared for

1317
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,120
properly.
At minimum it stopped.

1318
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,330
It's
just one.

1319
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,460
One thing,
uh,

1320
01:24:45,461 --> 01:24:46,294
under paragraph I want to reflect on.
It's the when you sense that 

1321
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,280
individuation is a,
could be a moment of deadliest apparel.

1322
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:56,080
And then he refers to the tightrope 
walker from now.

1323
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:57,243
What this means is that it can be so the
danger can be so great when you embark 

1324
01:25:02,221 --> 01:25:07,221
on individuation in almost by definition
means that the lesser you,

1325
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:10,950
unless they're part of your soul and 
your soul as to die,

1326
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,710
and then I think I've been there and in 
my own life,

1327
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:16,544
and
that requires violence and recovery is 

1328
01:25:20,731 --> 01:25:21,930
by no means guaranteed,

1329
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:22,980
right?
That's exactly.

1330
01:25:23,010 --> 01:25:23,730
Well,
that's why.

1331
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:24,563
That's why that Motif,
that's the Motif of going into the 

1332
01:25:27,151 --> 01:25:28,510
abyss,
to to,

1333
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:32,400
to rescue your father like it's an 
abyss.

1334
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,860
There's no guarantee that you'll emerge 
from it.

1335
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:41,980
It's a real.
It's genuine peril.

1336
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:44,940
Now the you know the,
the,

1337
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:49,170
the what you need to be armed with in 
some sense to face.

1338
01:25:49,171 --> 01:25:54,171
That is the willingness to die,
that faith in rebirth,

1339
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:56,080
the,
the,

1340
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,100
the,
the,

1341
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,093
the willingness as well,
or the decision to start abide by the 

1342
01:26:04,131 --> 01:26:08,040
truth
because in a moment of great peril,

1343
01:26:08,041 --> 01:26:08,874
this is another thing that.
This is one of the things I think that 

1344
01:26:11,431 --> 01:26:12,264
terrified me into
attempting to abide by the truth to the 

1345
01:26:16,841 --> 01:26:18,570
degree that I've been able to manage 
this.

1346
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:19,613
See,
I started to understand not least by 

1347
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:24,640
reading young that there were some 
points in my life where I needed to rely

1348
01:26:24,641 --> 01:26:25,474
on my own judgment that I would be in a 
particular situation that no one could 

1349
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:34,800
advise me about because no one would 
have access to the information about the

1350
01:26:34,801 --> 01:26:37,380
particularities of my situation that I 
would have

1351
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,270
and that I can call on

1352
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:42,800
my relationship with the eternal,
let's say to some degree.

1353
01:26:42,801 --> 01:26:46,670
But if I had worked and corrupted my own
judgment

1354
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:49,563
when,
when the necessity for a decision 

1355
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,690
emerge,
I would make the wrong decision and then

1356
01:26:55,691 --> 01:26:56,524
I'd be lost.
What stood out to me the few times you 

1357
01:26:59,111 --> 01:27:03,350
talked about this in a few lectures,
like as a sidetrack,

1358
01:27:03,370 --> 01:27:06,170
you talked about the death of the soul 
and what,

1359
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:09,070
what stood out to me is that you did 
this in a very,

1360
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:11,380
very efficient route when you really 
felt.

1361
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:14,500
It seemed to me like you felt the 
gravity of it.

1362
01:27:15,210 --> 01:27:16,043
And um,
and then when you kind of laid out your 

1363
01:27:20,351 --> 01:27:22,660
own story that you had to stop drinking,
stop smoking,

1364
01:27:22,661 --> 01:27:25,390
do to,
to focus more on your work

1365
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:28,490
intuitively.
There was to,

1366
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,533
it was a kind of a disparity between how
visceral you could talk about the death 

1367
01:27:33,521 --> 01:27:37,660
of the soul and what you described as,
what that meant for you,

1368
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:42,190
which I interpreted as mainly changing 
your lifestyle a little and,

1369
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:43,043
uh,
and,

1370
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:48,090
and focus on your studies.
So the question would be why?

1371
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,310
Why,
why do you think I saw the disparity and

1372
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,203
if the disparities in the there,
how is it that you can talk about the 

1373
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:56,680
death of the soul,
which such figures?

1374
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,020
Well,
I think I do think that there are things

1375
01:28:02,021 --> 01:28:02,854
that are worse than death.
I think that psychological 

1376
01:28:07,001 --> 01:28:07,834
disintegration might be worse than death
because it can go on for so long and it 

1377
01:28:12,571 --> 01:28:17,310
can be so incredibly painful.
To your point about communists,

1378
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:18,203
communists is correct.
Is that the state that he exists in is 

1379
01:28:21,151 --> 01:28:22,200
worse than death.

1380
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:23,843
It's hell

1381
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:28,050
now.
The disparity.

1382
01:28:28,051 --> 01:28:30,390
I'm not sure exactly what you meant by 
that

1383
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:33,343
meant
you talk with such vigor and then start 

1384
01:28:36,261 --> 01:28:38,420
your fist.
We're awake about the death of the soul.

1385
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:42,280
And then when you talked about letting 
parts of yourself die,

1386
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,633
you said it was mainly,
it was stopped drinking and stopped 

1387
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,103
smoking.

1388
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,613
Zero responsibility I would say needs to
some degree is the letting go of that 

1389
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:59,700
because I had to make a choice between 
something approximating gratifying,

1390
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,543
immediate pleasure seeking and hyper 
social or hyper social way of Ba now 

1391
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:12,501
that wasn't sustainable and in many ways
for obvious reasons and doing,

1392
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,083
doing the difficult intellectual work 
already had decided to embark on and 

1393
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,040
that was a death of a previous 
personality.

1394
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,450
It is trivial in some sense because 
it's.

1395
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,753
It's,
it's burning off that which obviously 

1396
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:33,810
needs to be burned off.
But I would also say by the same token,

1397
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:36,270
that that doesn't make it a straight 
forward process.

1398
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:38,130
You alluded to this,
you know,

1399
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:38,964
you said that you underwent a similar 
set of experiences where the old parts 

1400
01:29:44,401 --> 01:29:45,840
of you had to die.
It's like,

1401
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:46,950
well that's

1402
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:53,430
sub optimal and immature as they are.
First of all,

1403
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,433
NGOs are still parts that are alive and 
still and still an element of your 

1404
01:29:58,861 --> 01:29:59,694
beginning.
They might even be parts that you love 

1405
01:30:01,681 --> 01:30:02,514
and that other people love,
and there are certainly things that 

1406
01:30:05,491 --> 01:30:06,324
you're familiar with,
their modes of being that you're 

1407
01:30:08,730 --> 01:30:09,563
familiar with it.
It's a major sacrifice to live elements 

1408
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:16,470
of your personality.
It's also a proper sacrifice.

1409
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:20,850
It was not an indictment on your report.
I understand that.

1410
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:21,993
See,
the problem with the identity politics 

1411
01:30:24,451 --> 01:30:29,220
types as far as I'm concerned,
is the proclivity is always to sacrifice

1412
01:30:29,230 --> 01:30:34,230
someone else feel oppressive and it's 
always externalized the oppressor,

1413
01:30:36,410 --> 01:30:40,230
but in the individuation process,
you're the oppressor.

1414
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:44,100
You are the oppressor,
but it's much.

1415
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:45,870
See,
and this is also the problem,

1416
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:46,704
this is something I really came to 
understand what I was writing the 

1417
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:51,270
forward for.
The new version of social gets in school

1418
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,430
like archipelago was.
What's the problem here?

1419
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,313
Well,
something has to be sacrificed and put 

1420
01:30:58,291 --> 01:31:01,600
the world right.
Well who,

1421
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:04,000
what,
who or what is going to be sacrificed,

1422
01:31:04,001 --> 01:31:04,834
but you better make the proper 
sacrifices established the right 

1423
01:31:07,810 --> 01:31:10,090
relationship with the transcendent.
Well,

1424
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:15,120
let's identify the evil as something 
external to us and sacrifice that well.

1425
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:16,960
What does that mean?
Well,

1426
01:31:16,961 --> 01:31:20,380
what it meant in the Russian revolution 
was that everyone died,

1427
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:23,910
but more specifically,
everyone was killed.

1428
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:26,830
They were made into a burnt offering

1429
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:30,950
to God and it was inappropriate.
It's like,

1430
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:34,500
what if you're going to sacrifice 
because you have to sacrifice yourself,

1431
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,293
right?
That's the.

1432
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,760
That's the.
That's the.

1433
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:42,860
That's the crucifixion metaphor and 
sacrifices.

1434
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:46,620
You allow those parts of you that are 
unworthy to die.

1435
01:31:47,010 --> 01:31:49,580
You encourage them to die even and,
and,

1436
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:50,503
but we don't want to be foolish to say 
that that's merely a matter of pursuing 

1437
01:31:55,111 --> 01:31:56,430
your bliss,
let's say,

1438
01:31:56,431 --> 01:31:57,180
in,
in the,

1439
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:02,180
in the Joseph Campbell manner or in 
maybe in the city.

1440
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:09,150
I mean,
that's being a bit hard on Campbell,

1441
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:12,290
but it was an unfortunate phrase.
Yeah,

1442
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:17,340
because if he knew better because he 
knew about the journey into the abyss,

1443
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:21,210
the sacrifice is,
even if it's partial,

1444
01:32:21,211 --> 01:32:22,260
it's still a depth.

1445
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:27,020
I think also that this is why the death 
and rebirth,

1446
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:31,290
rebirth theme resonates so immediately 
in,

1447
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:34,550
in popular culture and in literature.
For example,

1448
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:35,533
Gandalf who fell into the underworld,
the bell rock and then emerged as the 

1449
01:32:40,611 --> 01:32:41,130
white.

1450
01:32:41,130 --> 01:32:42,010
Right,
and everyone's,

1451
01:32:42,011 --> 01:32:43,450
everyone's soul.
Well,

1452
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:44,353
that's,
that's a,

1453
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:49,510
that's a real representation of the 
transfiguration of Moses Christ Gandalf,

1454
01:32:49,561 --> 01:32:50,394
the white,
so it's not like tolkien didn't know 

1455
01:32:53,311 --> 01:32:57,060
these things and he knew these things 
perfectly well.

1456
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,830
That's right.
In such a relief.

1457
01:32:58,831 --> 01:33:01,560
I remember when I was a kid reading Lord
of the rings for the first time,

1458
01:33:01,561 --> 01:33:02,394
I was so appalled when gandalf 
disappeared and so relieved when he 

1459
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,800
made,
when he was like,

1460
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,690
oh no.
GANDALF's garden.

1461
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,010
Like it's the death of God,
right?

1462
01:33:11,011 --> 01:33:12,660
What?
What are we going to do?

1463
01:33:12,740 --> 01:33:15,450
Open the great wizard.
This has disappeared.

1464
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

1465
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,733
And it is a terrible trial and you see 
that with Gandalf's experiences in 

1466
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,970
underworld and he comes out white.
Well,

1467
01:33:23,971 --> 01:33:24,804
it's funny,
it comes up white white's interesting 

1468
01:33:26,191 --> 01:33:28,890
because white is the sun,
then white is purity,

1469
01:33:28,891 --> 01:33:31,290
but why is also age,
you know,

1470
01:33:31,291 --> 01:33:32,124
and to undergo those experiences is also
to risk all the physiological 

1471
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:40,280
psychophysiological stress that widens 
your beard and that,

1472
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:41,880
that crazy your hair.

1473
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:46,070
I'm going to tweet out now Jordan 
Peterson says white is purity.

1474
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:49,540
Yeah,
yeah.

1475
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:55,000
Know the thing is you also see this in 
more general popular culture.

1476
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:58,150
Have you ever heard of Dragon Ball z?
No.

1477
01:33:59,040 --> 01:33:59,873
It was a cartoon.
It's an enemy and you have these 

1478
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:05,820
creatures.
They're called sayings,

1479
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:06,693
and whenever they're warriors and 
whenever they're in a fight with some 

1480
01:34:09,191 --> 01:34:12,550
eternal enemy and the moment they're 
about to die,

1481
01:34:13,570 --> 01:34:16,870
they can their their spirit and their 
body can't take anymore.

1482
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,263
They become super science,
which is the resurrect and they 

1483
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:23,110
transcend and their hair stands up and 
it turns,

1484
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,730
turns,
turns yellow,

1485
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:26,230
and they get electricity all around 
them.

1486
01:34:26,231 --> 01:34:30,550
So whenever they are about to die,
that's when they transcend.

1487
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,443
So they have been completely destroyed 
and that's when their transcendence 

1488
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,340
occurs.
In the beginning.

1489
01:34:36,341 --> 01:34:40,390
They can control it,
and that's a theme that keeps the entire

1490
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:43,600
saga together is this continual 
transcendence of the.

1491
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,213
One of the themes that I developed in 
maps of meaning is that there's ways of 

1492
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,540
construing yourself like you Construe 
Yourself as who you are.

1493
01:34:53,710 --> 01:34:56,500
That's a stable state.
Let's say who you are right now.

1494
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:57,380
That's me.

1495
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,833
And then that all falls apart and then 
you consider yourself as the chaos that 

1496
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:07,580
ensues when everything falls apart.
And that's a state of hopelessness.

1497
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:08,414
And,
and then maybe you recovered from that 

1498
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:14,570
and you establish a new sense of order.
You say,

1499
01:35:14,571 --> 01:35:15,404
well,
I passed through the underworld and now 

1500
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:19,700
I'm in a better place and this is me,
this better place,

1501
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,700
but then it's subject to fragmentation 
as well,

1502
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:23,534
and so what you learn is that you're not
the order no matter how compelling and 

1503
01:35:29,961 --> 01:35:30,794
secure and promising that order is and 
you're not the chaos that ensues when 

1504
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:39,020
that order is fragmented and you're not 
even the reestablishment of new order.

1505
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,033
You're the process by which that 
transformation continually occurs and 

1506
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,613
that is the process of death and rebirth
and that's where you identified with is 

1507
01:35:48,621 --> 01:35:49,454
that ever renewing process of death and 
rebirth and that identification with 

1508
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:55,933
cracks that the Christians and the 
Christian narrative is aiming at 

1509
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:01,480
instilling,
aiming to,

1510
01:36:01,700 --> 01:36:04,010
to the degree that something like that 
aims.

1511
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,633
So is this also the Nietzsche refers to 
the man is a road between Beeston over 

1512
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:12,053
men.
I know that's not exactly the Christian 

1513
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:17,430
the delineation,
but instilled in more.

1514
01:36:17,550 --> 01:36:21,560
I think that's probably more associated 
with the idea that we were talking about

1515
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:23,500
earlier.
I mean these ideas are all late,

1516
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:24,343
but I think that's more associated with 
the idea of the partnership between man 

1517
01:36:28,641 --> 01:36:30,620
and God,
mediated by conscious

1518
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:38,020
man is that is that intermediary
finger because we're.

1519
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:39,223
We're moving towards the idea,
but we're clearly not that that is a 

1520
01:36:43,821 --> 01:36:46,610
tight rope lights because moving towards
the idealist,

1521
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:47,444
precarious,
not the ideal and you can tumble at any 

1522
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:54,530
moment.
Seriousness to our being

1523
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:56,923
psychically,
psychologically and spiritually as well 

1524
01:36:59,601 --> 01:37:03,070
as physically it's well not.
That's part of aA.

1525
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:08,380
turtle crucifixion as well as a constant
vulnerability of being a burden of being

1526
01:37:11,391 --> 01:37:12,224
human.
The necessary burden I suppose to me in 

1527
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:21,011
my more,
what would you call them?

1528
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,150
I don't know.
You have these moments of thinking where

1529
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:32,820
they're more metaphysical,
more metaphysical moments I suppose.

1530
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:33,833
I do see that go on in there and engaged
in a partnership to bring about the 

1531
01:37:39,630 --> 01:37:41,030
Kingdom of God on earth.
Something like that.

1532
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:44,130
That there's something about that story.
That's exactly right.

1533
01:37:44,131 --> 01:37:44,964
That we should be struggling up yield 
with our burdens towards the highest 

1534
01:37:48,451 --> 01:37:49,284
possible ideal,
and if there's something about that 

1535
01:37:50,651 --> 01:37:55,150
that's true or at least it's more true 
than anything else we can conceive of.

1536
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:58,260
And so that's the great adventure of 
lights.

1537
01:37:58,261 --> 01:37:59,094
That's what you want to be cold too.
I think you are called to that by your 

1538
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:07,290
conscience,
I think.

1539
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,740
Refer we we've talked for about 90 
minutes now.

1540
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:13,210
I think this is a good time to.
Yeah.

1541
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:15,790
This is a great note to close off on.
