1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,660
All right,
on to another trait.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,063
So

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,850
we talked about extroversion and
neuroticism and I basically laid out the

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,851
case for you that extroverted people
were more sensitive to incentive reward

5
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:26,580
and people who are high in neuroticism
more and more sensitive to anxiety on to

6
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:31,581
emotional pain and that there are
fundamental biological subsystems

7
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:35,430
associated with those dimensions.
And that it's not a single dimension,

8
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:38,760
which is also a very important thing to
note because people tend to think of

9
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,460
happy as the opposite of sad,
you know,

10
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:42,420
and it's,
it's not,

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
it's not because you can be happy or not
happy and you can be sad or not sad.

12
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:53,100
And I suppose if you're really sad,
you're not happy and sad at the same

13
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,611
time,
right?

14
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:55,380
So that would mean that you'd be an
introverted,

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,200
somebody who's high in neuroticism and
high and introversion.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,180
Um,
you know,

17
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,690
you're not very enthusiastic under those
circumstances and you're quite sensitive

18
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:04,530
to negative emotions.

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,050
So,
and

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,940
well,
that's just how it goes.

21
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,190
And now you know,
the traits,

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,230
you might think that in some sense you
could score high on a trade and low on a

23
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:20,720
trade in that maybe high would be better
than low.

24
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,520
It's very,
very complicated.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
I mean,
basically what you have to assume is

26
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:27,620
that the traits are now normally
distributed.

27
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:31,160
I think I have a normal distribute here
in a normal distribution here.

28
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,840
And also that there's an average,
most people cluster around the average

29
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:36,980
and then there's,
you know,

30
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,670
increasingly few people as you move
farther and farther to the extremes.

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,200
Well,
the reason that there's normal

32
00:01:42,201 --> 00:01:46,250
distribution is because there are
adaptive advantages.

33
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:50,780
Speaking from a biological perspective,
there are adaptive advantages to every

34
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:53,870
position on that distribution.
So you might say,

35
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,060
well,
what's the use of being extremely

36
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:58,910
anxious and easily hurt?
And the answer to that might be,

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,410
well,
it's complicated,

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,740
but some potential answers might be,
um,

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,350
well,
it's not clear how sensitive you should

40
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:10,130
be to distress if you're going to be a
good caretaker of small infants,

41
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:10,964
for example.

42
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,840
And I think that that's a relevant issue
because women tend to be higher in trait

43
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,690
neuroticism than men.
It's about half a standard deviation

44
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,940
that occurs.
Interestingly enough,

45
00:02:19,941 --> 00:02:23,710
pretty much right at puberty.
So if you look at boys and girls before,

46
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,760
before puberty,
there's not much difference in

47
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,610
sensitivity to negative emotion.
There seems to be a hormonal

48
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:31,550
transformation and uh,
you know,

49
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,450
we don't know exactly why that is.
Although we do know that it manifests

50
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:37,310
itself in a couple of different ways.
First,

51
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:41,450
it never goes away after that.
So women and men never equalize again in

52
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:43,490
terms of their sensitivity to negative
emotion.

53
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,230
Second,
it's,

54
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,710
it's true cross-culturally,
pretty much wherever you look.

55
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,060
And we'll talk about the cross cultural
findings a little bit in more detail

56
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,610
today because they're quite interesting.
And third,

57
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:59,950
it's also in keeping with the clinical
findings that women are much more to

58
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,650
both depression and anxiety from a
clinical perspective.

59
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,810
So maybe three to four times a
susceptible.

60
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,730
It depends on how you measure it
obviously.

61
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,430
But you know,
there's a lot of converging evidence

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,500
that suggest that and then well
it's not the only gender differences.

63
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,600
The other big gender differences in is
in agreeableness.

64
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,340
And that's the trick we're going to talk
about today.

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,010
Agreeableness is a tricky,
tricky trade.

66
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,140
It's not that easy to figure out because
it overlaps to some degree with what you

67
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,820
might think about extroversion.
Like extroverts are enthusiastic and

68
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,620
assertive,
but they're also really social,

69
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,380
right?
They cause they're gregarious and they

70
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,530
like to be around people and they liked
to tell jokes and,

71
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,250
and you might even think of them as
friendly in that if you meet an

72
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,750
extrovert,
they're going to make friends with you

73
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,180
pretty quickly or they're going to try
or they're going to try to charm.

74
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,310
You at least are trying to amuse you at
least.

75
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,110
And then you think,
well,

76
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:56,680
agreeableness is compassion and and
politeness.

77
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,650
So how does that exactly differ from
friendliness?

78
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,630
And the answer is well,
warm,

79
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:05,230
compassionate are compassionate and
empathic people care about you,

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,870
whereas the extrovert doesn't
necessarily care about you.

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,760
I mean they're,
they're in,

82
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,900
they're interested in being around you.
That's not the same thing as caring for

83
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,531
you.
You know,

84
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:19,531
like you could be interested in being
around interested in being around dogs

85
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,190
to play with them,
let's say.

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,910
But that doesn't necessarily mean that
you'd have any interest in caring for

87
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:27,430
them.
And so agreeableness looks like a caring

88
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,830
dimension.
And I think the right way to think about

89
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:31,660
it seems to be to be something like
this.

90
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,670
Imagine that during your life,
you,

91
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,720
you,
you,

92
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,830
uh,
you engage in a sequence of reciprocal

93
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,020
trains are reciprocal interactions.
Okay.

94
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:45,160
And you might say,
well,

95
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,430
how often should you give and how often
should you take?

96
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,080
And roughly speaking,
it should be 50,

97
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:50,914
50.
Right?

98
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,210
And hopefully the consequence of that is
each person gains more in fact than they

99
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,980
would if they were just working in
isolation.

100
00:04:56,981 --> 00:05:00,310
So it's a really good deal.
But I would say roughly speaking,

101
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:05,200
that as you become more agreeable,
it's more like 60 40 for the other

102
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,660
person or 70,
30 for the other person or 80,

103
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,130
20.
And then as you become more

104
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,020
disagreeable,
it's the other way around.

105
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:14,530
It's 60% for me and 40% for you and so
forth.

106
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:19,531
And so one tails off into extreme
selfishness and the other tales off into

107
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:25,561
extreme
self sacrifice and too much selfishness.

108
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,370
It puts you in prison.
And too much self sacrifice.

109
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,540
Well
that's more complicated.

110
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,530
I would say that part of the pathology
that fried identified as characteristic

111
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:41,470
of the eatable family was,
is actually a consequence of too much

112
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:44,170
agreeableness and sort of the Hansel and
Gretel story.

113
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,450
You know,
you all know the Hansel and Gretel

114
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:50,020
story.
Hansel and Gretel have their two little

115
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:53,050
kids and their mother gets remarried or
their father,

116
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,270
I think it's their mother,
but I don't remember.

117
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,640
And anyways,
the step decides that the kids are kind

118
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:03,230
of a pain and that she or he convinces
the alternative partner to take them out

119
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,200
in the forest and just abandoned them.
They make their way back once,

120
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:09,680
but then they take them deeper into the
woods the second time anyway,

121
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,050
so they're wandering out.
They're all lost in the woods.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,810
Right.
Which is a kind of a symbolic descend

123
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,040
into chaos.
Right.

124
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,220
And,
uh,

125
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,340
they find a gingerbread house and you
know,

126
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:22,220
that's pretty good deal when you're a
little kid and you're lost and cold and

127
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:23,300
it's dark.
It's like,

128
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,960
it's such a good deal that you might be
a little suspicious of it because not

129
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:29,030
only is it a house,
which is right on,

130
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,270
but it's a house made out of cookies,
you know,

131
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:37,130
so,
and inside there's a woman who wants to

132
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,720
fatten up the kids and eat them.

133
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,410
And you know,
they eventually managed to fool her push

134
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:43,400
for in an,
and it's quite a bloodthirsty story,

135
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:47,270
like a lot of these fairy tales are,
but there's a really profound moral in

136
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:47,710
it.
And the,

137
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,400
and the profound moral is something like
beware of someone who does too much for

138
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:55,160
you because there's a devouring element
to that.

139
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,840
You know,
and this is why,

140
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,360
look,
most of the time when you hear people

141
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:02,220
talk about things like compassion and
empathy and you know,

142
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,850
on politeness and that sort of thing,
they're treated as if they're

143
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:06,380
untrammeled virtues.
And that's,

144
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,630
that's a mistake.
It's a mistake,

145
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,850
a grill.
This is a weird trait because there are

146
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:14,840
market advantages and disadvantages to
people all along the distribution.

147
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,880
So,
you know,

148
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,440
agree,
disagreeable people.

149
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,550
Um,
they're,

150
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,530
they're blunt.
So that would be the impolite element.

151
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,460
And there they don't shy away from
conflict.

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,220
And you might think,
well that doesn't sound very good,

153
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,840
but that's not right.
Lots of times,

154
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,970
especially if you're trying to solve
hard problems,

155
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,290
you want to have people around you who
are blunt and,

156
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,660
and somewhat afraid of conflict.
Because very frequently there isn't any

157
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,510
difference between thinking about
something and having conflict,

158
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,120
you know?
So if you're really committed to an idea

159
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,360
and I'm committed to an idea,
we're either going to act it out

160
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:57,320
mutually and actually engage in either
competition or direct,

161
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,320
you know,
combat roughly speaking or we're going

162
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:04,940
to hash it out so that we can exist
harmoniously as we move into the future.

163
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:09,920
And the problem with avoiding conflict
is that conflict's inevitable.

164
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,430
Like because sometimes a,
you don't know what to do and it's a

165
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:15,590
really complicated situation,
you know,

166
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:19,580
so you have one position on it.
Maybe your partner has another position.

167
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:23,570
Both positions are justifiable say with
regards to disciplining children cause

168
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:28,250
that's one or with finances,
those are common points of contradiction

169
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,680
between couples.
It's like it's not obvious who's right.

170
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,140
So how do you figure it out?
Well,

171
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:37,820
you either push each other around
physically or you push each other around

172
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,240
mentally,
which I think has made it even worse

173
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,970
over the long run.
Or you hit the problem straight on and

174
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:48,440
address it and then there's conflict.
But maybe if you're fortunate,

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,770
you get through the conflict and you
figure out the problem and then you can

176
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:55,590
have peace.
And so the de they downside to

177
00:08:55,591 --> 00:09:00,210
agreeableness as far as I can tell,
is that it's over concerned with the

178
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:02,730
establishment of,
or the maintenance of peace in the

179
00:09:02,731 --> 00:09:07,620
present and under concerned with the
establishment of peace in the future.

180
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,470
And I think that's what
conscientiousness does instead.

181
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,500
So my idea,
I have no idea if this is correct by the

182
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:14,334
way,
but,

183
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,490
so I'm,
I'm moving out towards the fringes of

184
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,100
knowledge on personality,
but I think one per what happened,

185
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,890
it's hard to get conscientiousness out
of animals.

186
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,650
You know,
like most things you can develop an

187
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:26,880
animal model for it,
right?

188
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,310
Conscientiousness,
that's a tough one.

189
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,850
We haven't been able to come up with a
reasonable animal model or

190
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,830
neuropsychological model.
Laura psychopharmacological model or a

191
00:09:34,831 --> 00:09:39,120
theoretical model or a cognitive model
like the things we don't know about

192
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,120
consciousness.
Conscientiousness are are manifold,

193
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,490
but anyways,
I think what's happened is the degree of

194
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:50,491
illness is a good heuristic for
establishing harmonious egalitarianism

195
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,720
in very small groups.
So you know,

196
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:58,410
if you're in a family and you have
parents because generally if you're in a

197
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,380
family you do,
you know one of the concerns about the

198
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:04,350
parents is that resources are fairly
distributed.

199
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,100
You know,
in generally parents are loath to really

200
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:13,101
produce much of a dominance hierarchy in
terms of affection in relationship to

201
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:14,430
their children.
Right.

202
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,790
It seems kind of like a violation of the
parental contact contract.

203
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,910
So,
but then the question is what happens

204
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:25,580
when you enter into bigger organizations
where familial ties either can't be

205
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,940
maintained merely because of the size of
the organization or because the

206
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:33,270
organization is just too complex to be
run that way.

207
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,960
I think that's when conscientiousness
kicks in and conscientiousness is more

208
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:40,830
of a cold virtue.
It's not exactly based as far as we

209
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:43,170
could tell.
It's not based in any social emotion.

210
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,440
It's more like here are the articulated
rules whereby the social organization

211
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,070
functions,
I'm going to adhere to those and follow

212
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,960
them and that's what makes me
conscientious.

213
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:59,070
Now there's an order of the part and
that would be absence of rule breaking

214
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:01,260
and keeping things in their proper
position.

215
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,540
And then there's an industriousness
element,

216
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,950
which also seems to have something to do
with keeping social norms.

217
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:12,270
Like although there's an element of
going for the ideal instead of just not

218
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,620
breaking rules and industriousness,
conservative people are more

219
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:19,440
conscientious than liberal people and
that kind of makes sense,

220
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,510
right?
Because conscientiousness is concerned

221
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:25,530
with the maintenance of current social
rules and then playing the game

222
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:28,470
according to the rules.
Liberals are higher in openness and

223
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:32,040
lower in conscientiousness.
So they're more likely to transform the

224
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,110
rules,
which is something conservatives don't

225
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,690
relate because they're doing fine
playing the current gate,

226
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,580
you know?
And there's some real utility in

227
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:43,470
maintaining the current game because if
it's too unstable then well then you

228
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,960
have a descent into chaos and that's not
good for anybody.

229
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,513
Okay.
So,

230
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
so back to agreeableness now.
So the big difference men and women in

231
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,700
terms of traits seems to be,
so you could put,

232
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,630
first of all I should show you,
let's see if I got this here.

233
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,470
Yeah,
so there's two overlapping normal

234
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:06,670
distributions.
Okay.

235
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:09,340
And the blue ones are women and the red
ones are Nana.

236
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,900
And the blue is agreeableness.
Like the blue is shifted over to the

237
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:17,260
more agreeable side and the red is
shifted over to the less agreeable side.

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,250
The first thing that you should notice
about that isn't that the differences

239
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:23,680
exist.
The first thing that you should notice

240
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:27,070
is that almost all of the territory is
overlapped.

241
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,870
And so what that means is that if you
took men and women,

242
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,870
if you drew men and women randomly from
the population,

243
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,830
there'd be a deviation from 50 50 with
regards to who was the most agreeable

244
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,570
individual.
But at least,

245
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,510
no,
let's see if I can get this right.

246
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,830
I probably can't because I don't
remember exactly the effect size.

247
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,160
It's probably about 0.2 maybe it'd be
60% probability that you draw out a

248
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:02,850
woman who was as more agreeable and 40%
probability that you draw to man,

249
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,760
you know,
as a deviation from 50 50 so there's

250
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,610
lots of women who are more disagreeable
than men and there are lots of men who

251
00:13:08,611 --> 00:13:10,590
are more agreeable than the typical
woman.

252
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,440
But there are differences.
And one of the things that's really

253
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:15,600
worth noting when you look at a normal
distribution,

254
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:19,980
because this is where things get weird.
So you could say there's not that much

255
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,890
difference on average between men and
women.

256
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,770
But the thing is the average is often
knock them relevant issue.

257
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,820
The relevant issue is often the extreme.
So for example,

258
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,050
if you're going to imprison people,
so look at that red curve.

259
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,590
What you see is that if you,
although it's not drawn exactly

260
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:39,630
perfectly,
but what you would see if the curve was

261
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:44,400
proper here
is that once you were out here,

262
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,570
say where the you could only,
you're only interested in the one out of

263
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:52,560
50 most disagreeable person,
all those people would be mad.

264
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,810
And that's why partly why almost
everybody in prison is male.

265
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,230
So the x,
because you don't put people in prison

266
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,600
unless they're very extreme.
And one of the things

267
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,720
criminals tend to be extreme in his,
they're low in agreeableness,

268
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,800
surprise,
surprise.

269
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,020
They're kind of callous.
They're in it for themselves.

270
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,730
You know,
they're stubborn,

271
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,560
they don't,
they don't care about you one way or

272
00:14:15,561 --> 00:14:17,870
another.
And if they're low in agreeableness and

273
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,900
conscientiousness,
then they don't care about you and they

274
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,180
aren't going to play by the rules.
That started to touch on psychopathy.

275
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,210
So you can model psychopathy pretty well
with the big five,

276
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,460
low agreeableness,
low conscientiousness.

277
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,250
So then you get someone who could care
less about you,

278
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,310
who lies all the time or who doesn't
follow the rules,

279
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,950
won't work.
So they have a parasitical lifestyle,

280
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:40,610
which is actually one of the dimensions
of psychopathy,

281
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,870
a pair of civical lifestyle.
And uh,

282
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,720
yeah.
And then if you look over on the other

283
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,750
direction and you took the one in 50
person who was the most compassionate

284
00:14:50,751 --> 00:14:53,630
then that be virtually all those people
would be women.

285
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,960
So,
oh I,

286
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,980
I've gone up,
there is probability is 63% so it's 63%

287
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,650
chance that the woman you drew wrote
would be more agreeable than 37% chance

288
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:11,360
that the men men would be.
So you can convert most effect size

289
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:14,540
statistics into odds ratios like that.
And I'll actually tell you about how to

290
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:17,330
do that later.
It's quite cool and it really gives you

291
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,120
a much bigger understanding of what an
effect means.

292
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,430
Like one of the things you won't be
taught about properly,

293
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:24,290
you don't likelihood when you take your
statistics,

294
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:27,230
although it might've changed,
is that they won't tell you how to

295
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,380
interpret the size of an effect.
And really the only thing that matters

296
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,180
is how big is the effect.
Right.

297
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,070
And that's,
that would be in most studies,

298
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,904
that would be

299
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,920
the size of the effect would be the
distance between one of those peaks in

300
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:45,671
the distance,
you know,

301
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:47,740
and the other.
That's how much the groups differ.

302
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,390
And then of course the group's
different,

303
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:52,630
but there's this spread up to the people
within the groups differ as well.

304
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,410
So the statistical calculation takes
into account how big the mean difference

305
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,350
is by well correcting for the,
for the spread of the numbers around

306
00:16:02,351 --> 00:16:05,980
that meat.
And so and so you need well and you need

307
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:09,430
to know how big that effect is.
And you need to be able to understand

308
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:12,700
that in a way that's visualized.
So for example,

309
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,630
you might have a correlation Coefficient
of 0.2 so what you'd imagined,

310
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:21,631
imagine a graph like this and then a
bunch of dots and then align running

311
00:16:22,901 --> 00:16:25,990
through them at 0.2.
There's a lot of dots that aren't on the

312
00:16:25,991 --> 00:16:29,560
line because it's only accounting for
40% of the various right cause you

313
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:31,180
square it to get proportion of the
variance.

314
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,880
So 0.2,
there's some relationship that not much,

315
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:38,080
there's an awful lot of scattered.
So the two variables are related.

316
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,160
If you have an rf 0.2,
you can calculate an odds ratio.

317
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,570
It's,
it turns out to be 60,

318
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:47,110
40,
because the r is the difference between

319
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,500
the probability of one group,
Huh?

320
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,510
Probability of drawing.
Now a member of one group characterized

321
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,060
by that particular feature compared to
the member of the other group.

322
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,830
So you get a hat,
you've got to get,

323
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,990
have uh,
like a,

324
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,730
an ad hand way of,
of,

325
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,960
of understanding these effects sizes
because otherwise you can't understand

326
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:11,020
psychological papers.
Like what's a correlation of 0.1?

327
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:12,780
What's that good for?
What's a for you know,

328
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,130
what correlation point to a correlation
of 0.3.

329
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,990
And it's very,
very tricky because you're most of the

330
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,260
like there are people who've made sort
of tables of whether or not you should

331
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:24,910
consider an effect size,
large,

332
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:25,990
medium or small.

333
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,140
But it was basically a guests just like
the 0.05 level of significance was an

334
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:34,540
arbitrary,
somewhat arbitrary decision.

335
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,240
Now,
one of the things you'll find is that in

336
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:40,300
psychology,
you rarely see two variables that are

337
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:43,360
related to one another more than 0.3.
Okay?

338
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,490
You need to know that because if you
don't know that,

339
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,310
you have no idea what to make of a given
phenomenon.

340
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,400
So for,
and it's tricky.

341
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:54,750
So for example,
an optimized combination of Iq and

342
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:59,340
conscientiousness and predict your job
performance at somewhere between 0.5 and

343
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:04,341
0.6 so now if you square that,
that's 25 to 36% of the variants and you

344
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,480
think,
well that's not very much,

345
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,030
it's only a quarter of the variance in
job performance,

346
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,730
but it's hard to measure job
performance.

347
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,300
So there's lots of error in it and
there's error in the measurement of

348
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,730
conscientiousness.
So some of that's just noise,

349
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,640
but,
but importantly,

350
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,200
even if it's 25% of the variance,
so we said a correlation of 0.5 then you

351
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:29,160
could use it to raise the probability
that you'd pick up an above average

352
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:34,161
employee from 50 50 to 75 25 cause 75
minus 25.5 so it's a big effect.

353
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,810
And then the economic consequences of
that are Nassif because it turns out,

354
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,300
you know,
if you're a very good at what you do and

355
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:47,370
you're not very good at it,
I might say,

356
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:51,270
well how much more is it to my advantage
to employ you rather than you?

357
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,520
And one of the questions would be,
well,

358
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:56,730
how much difference in performance is
there between people?

359
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,230
Like if everyone lines up like maybe
it's a assembly line job and once you

360
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:02,970
get it,
once you're trained,

361
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,850
everyone has exactly the same rate of
production.

362
00:19:05,851 --> 00:19:08,580
Well then it doesn't matter if you're,
you know,

363
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,580
if you have a higher Iq and you're more
conscientious because there's no

364
00:19:11,581 --> 00:19:16,050
variability in the performance.
But in lots of jobs there's massive

365
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:18,480
variability.
It might even be nonlinear.

366
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,480
And we'll talk about that when we get to
our discussion of the prieto

367
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,930
distribution.
So what that means is that some people

368
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,360
are not only not productive in their
job,

369
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,670
they're negatively productive in a big
way.

370
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,520
You hire them and they take money out of
the company.

371
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,530
So this often happens.
For example,

372
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:38,100
if you hiring competent managers,
because not only are they not doing

373
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,680
their job,
they're stopping 20 other people from

374
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,540
doing their job.
Well they're,

375
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,150
you know,
eating resources like mad doing that.

376
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,490
So it can be,
it's a re can be a real catastrophe.

377
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,270
So bad hire,
if someone's making $100,000 a year,

378
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:54,660
a bad hire costs the company about
$350,000.

379
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,990
So you didn't need many of those before,
especially if you're a small company

380
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,270
before you're just done.
So,

381
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,420
and the,
the distribution between people in terms

382
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,540
of performance varies with job.
But with some jobs it's tremendous.

383
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,130
Like in sales,
you know,

384
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:12,840
so in sales you really see us prieto
distribution where almost everyone is

385
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:16,530
making no sales and then there's a few
people at the end of the distribution

386
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,080
who are doing all of it.
So,

387
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,480
and you know,
there's lots of jobs that are like that.

388
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,240
They're not normally diff production
isn't normally distributed.

389
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,250
So,
all right.

390
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:27,900
So anyways,
back to

391
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:30,803
back to

392
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,810
aggression or agreeableness here.

393
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,990
So most of the time,
most of the time what you'll see in

394
00:20:39,991 --> 00:20:44,991
psychology is that the statistical
assumption that's made in a paper when

395
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:49,450
they're comparing two,
you know is one group significantly

396
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:52,360
different than the other.
The statistics are predicated on the

397
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:55,990
assumption that the distribution of
those scores is normal.

398
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,100
And what you'll hear a psychologist
telling you is this central limit

399
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,350
Theorem,
which is this theorem says that if a

400
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:07,351
random variable x is the sum of a large
number of small and independent random

401
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:11,020
variables than almost no matter how the
small variables are distributed,

402
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,600
x will approximately be normally
distributed.

403
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,830
While you think if you take human traits
like,

404
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,460
like let's say intelligence for that
matter,

405
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,740
God only knows how many genetic random
genetic factors that could have been one

406
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:28,320
way or another have to sum up to cause,
you know,

407
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:33,330
to produce the influenced the
intellectual capacity of one person and

408
00:21:34,151 --> 00:21:35,980
then to produce that amount of
variation.

409
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,310
It's a lot of random things.
And so what happens is it comes out

410
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,890
basically normally distributed,
so,

411
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,270
but some things aren't randomly
distributed and production seems to be

412
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,640
one of them.
And success seems to be another,

413
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,570
which is why,
you know,

414
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:53,020
1% of the people have 50% of the money.
Because what happens is,

415
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,770
well,
if you're smart and you work hard,

416
00:21:56,771 --> 00:21:58,690
then you multiply how smart you are,
right?

417
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,410
But then it starts to accrue to you.
You know?

418
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:07,360
So if you have $100,000 in the bank and
it's making say 5% a year,

419
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:10,060
you make quite a bit of money just
because you already have the money.

420
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:13,090
So having the money puts you in the game
like it does if you're in the real

421
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:16,600
estate market.
And once you start to become successful

422
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,180
at something,
well then people expect you to be

423
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,460
successful and they open up more doors
to you and your,

424
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,610
your network of influence wines.

425
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,400
And so you have more opportunities and
then people come to you.

426
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:31,810
And so what happens is that as you start
to become successful,

427
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:34,870
the probability that you're going to
become increasingly successful

428
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:38,080
increases.
And so you can get into an exponential

429
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,000
rate of return,
which is exactly what you want to have

430
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,290
happen.
If you start a startup,

431
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,640
right?
You don't want linear growth,

432
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:46,210
you'll just die.
You want it to go viral and most things

433
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,160
don't.
But the things that do are super

434
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:51,160
successful and people go viral during
their lifetime,

435
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:54,970
especially if they're engaged in some
kind of creative in,

436
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:59,110
in some sort of creative enterprise.
And making money actually turns out to

437
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,590
be from the entrepreneurial perspective
anyways,

438
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,260
essentially a creative enterprise.
It's not that surprising.

439
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,840
Now,
one of the things that no one will

440
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:12,610
probably ever show you is why things are
normally distributed and what exactly

441
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:14,800
that means.
And so I'm going to show you something.

442
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,350
Um,
maybe I even have a,

443
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,210
I might even have saved video of it,
which would be smart and,

444
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:23,044
but unlikely.

445
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,490
Sorry,
I should have had this,

446
00:24:00,491 --> 00:24:02,200
but I forgot.
I forgot about it till now.

447
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:03,034
So,

448
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,450
well we'll just look on youtube,
but that should do the trick.

449
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,920
Um,
gold,

450
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,313
that's a good one.

451
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:49,400
It's called,
I want you to do is you take a ball,

452
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,670
you drop it into the tall and it bounces
off all these nails before it makes,

453
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:58,500
going into one of these categories.
And when the ball hits is,

454
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,503
isn't it?

455
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,120
This is it go from bullet,
uh,

456
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,390
because the first person to meet one of
these,

457
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,550
and so it was cold Galton I want you to
do is you take a ball,

458
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,990
you drop it into the top and it balances
off all these nails before basically

459
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:20,310
going into one of these categories.
Uh,

460
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:24,590
and when the ball hits each night,
in theory there is a 50,

461
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:29,591
50 chance of it going left or right.
And so each path is pretty much

462
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,590
unpredictable.
If I was to take two balls and put them

463
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,990
in,
if I'm trying to get the exactly the

464
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:38,840
same,
they will end up in completely different

465
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,990
positions.
We cannot accurately predict where any

466
00:25:41,991 --> 00:25:44,150
given board more go.
However,

467
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,250
we can make a few statements,
we can say that or is more likely to end

468
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,020
up then in the middle,
then the age,

469
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,620
because of they said two categories.
There are lots of different paths.

470
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,010
It ended up here.
There are only a few tasks to end up on

471
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,760
the edge.
So we can do is take this piece of

472
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,970
scientific equipment
and stop putting an easy it by the

473
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:08,804
handful.

474
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,540
Yeah,

475
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,510
if we put it absolutely loads of biggest
balls,

476
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,530
even though each individual,
while we could accurately predict where

477
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,770
it's going the way we can accurately for
date,

478
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,100
the overall package
I met pat and we ended up with is called

479
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,500
a normal distribution in fact to a
funeral.

480
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:36,440
Okay.
So now imagine when you're looking at

481
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:41,090
mean differences between groups.
That's in some sense analogous to asking

482
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,070
if all the have fallen

483
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:47,580
into a pattern because there's one entry
point or two,

484
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,260
right.
And you might say,

485
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,060
well,
what's the difference between one and

486
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:54,030
two?
Because maybe one entry point is here in

487
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,640
one entry point is here,
is that the same?

488
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,010
Or maybe they're here,
you know,

489
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:04,011
so there's a continuum of same and
different and you can calculate the

490
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:09,600
probability that one normal just that
had a distribution is a single

491
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,670
distribution from a single point,
which would be,

492
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,910
there's no mean differences or that it's
from two different points,

493
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:16,890
which would be a mean difference between
the groups.

494
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:20,400
So you get a curve like this and a curve
like this and then you can do a

495
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:25,401
statistical calculation that would tell
you what the probability of that shape

496
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,830
emerging merely from chance would be at.
What we've picked in psychology and many

497
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:34,410
sciences is this.
If there's less than a one in 20 chance

498
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,860
that the shape of the distribution is by
chance,

499
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,210
then you can infer that there's a
significant difference between the two

500
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:47,211
groups because you could have a pattern
like that emerge in this experiment.

501
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,190
Just out of chance.
In fact,

502
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:53,460
with if you see the one that's on the
board there right now,

503
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,650
you see there's two peaks in it.
You might say,

504
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:57,060
well,
those are the peaks of two different

505
00:27:57,061 --> 00:27:58,980
populations.
It's very unlikely.

506
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:04,370
Now how you calculate whether the
difference between those two peaks is

507
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,560
significant.
From a statistical perspective,

508
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,600
it's partly based on chance,
right?

509
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:10,434
It's just,

510
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,850
okay.

511
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,220
It's just the probability that that
distribution would,

512
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,870
would manifest itself spontaneously.
But it's also affected by how many balls

513
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:23,290
you dropped down.
And the reason for that is that if you

514
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:27,460
only drop down one ball,
do you have a normal distribution?

515
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,380
Well,
maybe,

516
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,410
but you can't tell because there's only
one ball and maybe you drop 10 down and

517
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,430
while you're going to get something that
maybe is patchy and maybe has one or two

518
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:42,280
places where there's two bowls stack,
but it's still not much of a normal

519
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:45,700
distribution.
But if you draw up 150,000 of them down

520
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:48,130
here,
it's going to be virtually perfect.

521
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:52,750
And so basically what happens is that
the statistics in for are based on the

522
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:56,680
presupposition that the more subjects
you have in the experiment,

523
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,560
the better the shape of the normal
distribution,

524
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:04,000
which would be the tighter the
approximation of the sample to the

525
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:06,520
underlying population,
to the actual population.

526
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,990
And the less difference you have to have
between the groups in terms of magnitude

527
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:13,540
for that to not be a consequence of
chance.

528
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,880
Okay.
So you need to know three things when

529
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:20,230
you're interpreting the straightforward
statistics that have to do with group

530
00:29:20,231 --> 00:29:21,910
differences.
In psychology experiments,

531
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:23,710
you need to know number one,

532
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,590
okay,

533
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,070
how big the sample is because the bigger
the sample,

534
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,970
the smaller effect will be significant.
You need to know how significant the

535
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:36,270
effect is.
That's the probability and you need to

536
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:40,470
know a big,
the effect is that's the effect size.

537
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,690
And you can't know one of those things
without doing all three of them.

538
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,310
So when you're interpreting and
experiment,

539
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:47,350
you always need to know effect,
size,

540
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,570
the probability that that effects sizes
due to chance and how many subjects

541
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,730
there are in the experiment.
Okay.

542
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,090
Because those things are related and you
can't interpret one of them in the

543
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,070
absence of the other.
Okay.

544
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:03,810
So
and all I'll show you I'm not,

545
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,580
I should show you this prieto just
right.

546
00:30:05,581 --> 00:30:07,830
Maybe I can find this.
I might as well show it to you now.

547
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:12,570
Creedal distribution,
what's it called?

548
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,820
Animation.
Maybe it'll show up.

549
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,723
That would be lovely.

550
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,653
Well,
let's see.

551
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:30,060
I haven't looked at this one,
but statistics,

552
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,270
the general distribution is a family of
continuous probability distributions.

553
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,630
It is often use to model the towns of
another distribution.

554
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,410
It is specified when three parameters,
location,

555
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,180
scale,
and shape.

556
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,690
No,
I'm city specified.

557
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,540
Plan the scale and nothing like an audio
or only video.

558
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Okay,
let's cycle physics.

559
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,243
Animation.

560
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,810
Yeah,
I can't find it.

561
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,440
So I'll just tell you about it.
Did he step?

562
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,353
It'll work.
All right,

563
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,710
so you're playing monopoly.

564
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,263
Okay.

565
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,410
Monopoly is an interesting game to some
degree,

566
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,210
but one of the rules in monopoly is that
there's a finite number of properties

567
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,730
and a finite amount of money.
Okay?

568
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,650
So it's,
it's an that's an important feature

569
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,090
because what that means is that there's
going to be winners and losers if you

570
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:43,560
played the game long enough.
Okay?

571
00:31:43,561 --> 00:31:45,480
That's what it absolutely entails.
Now,

572
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,000
you know,
economists argue about whether or not

573
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:53,001
the economy is a zero sum game where
there has to be winners and losers or

574
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:57,540
whether it's more infinite game because
the amount of money continually

575
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:58,590
increases,
right?

576
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,990
So you know,
if the amount of money you continually

577
00:32:00,991 --> 00:32:03,210
increases,
it's not obvious that anybody has to be

578
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:04,350
poor.
Okay?

579
00:32:04,351 --> 00:32:06,930
So here's what happens in monopoly.
So first of all,

580
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,490
you all started out with the same amount
of money,

581
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,110
right?
So that's fair.

582
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,730
Okay.
And then what do you do?

583
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,430
You shake the dice and he make some
decisions.

584
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:18,930
And so it's not a bad model for life.
The dice shaking is the random element.

585
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,420
And you know,
what happens to you in your life is

586
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:24,780
going to be a reasonable chunk of
random,

587
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,681
you know?
I mean,

588
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:28,860
because you can be struck by illnesses
or a family member can,

589
00:32:28,861 --> 00:32:30,280
you know,
there's arbitrary things that are going

590
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:33,150
to happen to you.
You need to know that because you have

591
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:37,650
to think when something bad happens to
you about whether or not that was just

592
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:42,410
random or whether you it and you know,
it's kind of horrible to think that it's

593
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:44,840
random because then you can't control
it.

594
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:47,480
But on the other hand,
it also means that sometimes when you

595
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,550
fall down,
it's actually not your fault.

596
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,000
It just happened.
And so you need to know that randomness

597
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,440
has a fair,
like it's,

598
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:57,560
it's a nontrivial contribution to
people's life course.

599
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,950
Okay.
So the dice represent the randomness now

600
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,250
and then you make decisions about what
you're going to do with your

601
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,450
opportunities.
And you know,

602
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:10,451
I think if you took 20 pete
and they had different levels of

603
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:16,340
experience and expertise with monopoly,
my suspicions are is that there are

604
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:20,330
better players and that they would win
more often if you play them across time.

605
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,210
That it's not purely a random game,
although maybe it is.

606
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,990
So anyways,
what happens is you basically start

607
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:27,860
trading,
right?

608
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,260
You trade with the bank,
you trade with the board and you trade

609
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:32,240
with other players.
And so,

610
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,230
and you do that randomly.
And what happens is that with each trade

611
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,530
someone gains a bit more and someone
loses a bit more.

612
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,460
But something always happens,
which is as you gain more,

613
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,510
your options increase.
And as you lose more,

614
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:46,340
your options decrease,
right?

615
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,690
So by the time you're down to $1,000 and
three properties and it's three quarters

616
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,240
of the way through the game,
you know you're in a whole,

617
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:55,850
your heart [inaudible] it's very
unlikely that you're going to climb out

618
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:58,640
of it because one little negative event
we'll take you out of the gate.

619
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,910
Now you know there's some trivial
probability that you'll get back into

620
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:04,370
it,
but everyone knows that sinking feeling

621
00:34:04,371 --> 00:34:08,060
that occurs when you,
you're just more or less baggage on the

622
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:08,894
game,
you know.

623
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:14,540
But what happens to the other people is
that one of them starts to pull out way

624
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:18,020
ahead and what happens as you continue
to run the game,

625
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,290
we'll say for the,
for the moment merely as a consequence

626
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,290
of chance,
someone will end up with all the money

627
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:27,980
in all the properties now.
Like the importance of that can't be

628
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:30,740
overstated.
That's a non [inaudible] that's a non

629
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,730
normal distribution.

630
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:35,630
And although you won't hear about this
in psychology ever,

631
00:34:35,631 --> 00:34:38,270
I didn't understand this until like five
years ago,

632
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:40,970
which is absolutely pathetic.
Maybe it's 10 years ago now.

633
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,840
But because I was under the assumption
that almost everything that

634
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:47,900
psychologists studied that was important
was normally distributed.

635
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,600
That's wrong.
Lots of things are distributed in a

636
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:52,700
prieto distribution.
And that's,

637
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,500
I think what happens is that you get
feedback loops developing,

638
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,750
you know,
as you fall,

639
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,430
the probability that you're going to
fall increases because you're not as

640
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:06,920
resilient and because things can take
you out faster.

641
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,250
And so you know,
you start to get poor,

642
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:14,300
well then you don't eat quite as well.
You're rushed off your feet more,

643
00:35:14,301 --> 00:35:17,000
so you're sick more often,
then your income falls,

644
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,220
then you have to,
you're either under severe financial

645
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:21,170
stress or you have to move to a poor
neighborhood.

646
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,730
And then if you move to a poor
neighborhood,

647
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,570
the people around you aren't
characterized by as many opportunities,

648
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:26,900
you know?

649
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,230
And maybe it's rougher and so that makes
you more depressed and you can just see

650
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,290
it's this and then,
but on the other hand,

651
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:36,310
if you're starting to climb up,
you get exactly the opposite phenomena,

652
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,870
which is you start putting away some
money so you're more resilient to,

653
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,940
you know,
random economical occurrences.

654
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,560
And as you'd become,
well for this argument,

655
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,720
we'll just use wealth.
As you become wealthier,

656
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,550
you know,
you move into better and better

657
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:53,670
neighborhoods and then the people around
you have more and more opportunities to

658
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:57,450
distribute and you can go like that and
that's what happens to people.

659
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,520
So,
but most people end up stacked down

660
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,740
near the barely clinging to the edge of
the world and of the prieto

661
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:09,180
distribution.
You know,

662
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:14,181
when a huge part of our economic and
political discourse is really what to do

663
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,790
about that.
Like there's maybe two arguments.

664
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,850
One is,
should there be a burrito distribution

665
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:22,860
at all?
Shouldn't just be normally distributed,

666
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:25,020
which is kind of what a middle class
society would look like,

667
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,840
right?
Most people have the average amount of

668
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:29,850
money.
There's some people who are maybe three

669
00:36:29,851 --> 00:36:33,360
or four standard deviations above the
mean and there's some poor people and

670
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:37,140
you just can't flatten it out more than
that because you'd end up with tyranny.

671
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,600
You know?
Cause if you push a system,

672
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,510
you can push a system to do anything you
want it to do.

673
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:46,800
But as you deformant warp it,
it takes more and more forced to

674
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,870
regulated.
Now the distribution of money isn't even

675
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,360
close to a normal distribution.
In fact,

676
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:58,950
if you take the top 1% of people who
have the money and you look at that

677
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:01,230
distribution,
it's a wild pareto distribution.

678
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:05,160
And if you take the top 0.1% and you
look at that distribution,

679
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,200
it's a wild pareto distribution.

680
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:11,820
And so like it's 1% of the 1% who own
half of what the 1% will,

681
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,940
you know?
So it just doesn't end until you get to

682
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,320
the richest person in the world,
you know?

683
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:20,490
And then they own something like
the richest person in the world probably

684
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:22,560
has $100 billion.
That would be my guess.

685
00:37:22,561 --> 00:37:25,230
It might be potent.
So,

686
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,670
but $100 billion is a lot of money.
It's a very large amount of money and so

687
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,200
he's like 50 standard deviations above
the mean way where it's not even

688
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:41,460
imaginable.
Now you might say,

689
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,230
should it be normally distributed and
sort of the ideal ideal democratic

690
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:49,500
socialist society in some sense.
Then you might say,

691
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:53,460
well,
perhaps not because maybe you want an

692
00:37:53,461 --> 00:37:57,360
undue proportion of the rewards to go to
people who are unduly productive.

693
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,730
Now you know,
you think you have a huge advantage,

694
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:04,830
for example,
to be born into money,

695
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,250
but it actually turns out that in the
United States anyways,

696
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:12,690
if you had to choose between being born
at the 95th percentile for wealth or the

697
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:16,920
95th percentile for intelligence,
you'd be better off at the age of 40 if

698
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,610
you were born at the 95th percentile for
education or for intelligence.

699
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,220
So wealth matters,
but it doesn't matter as much or

700
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,680
hereditary wealth matters.
But it doesn't matter as much as people

701
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:28,470
think it matters.
But that's partly because you actually

702
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:31,490
can get ahead in a functional society if
you're smart and hardworking.

703
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,410
You know,
if you're in a corrupt society and work

704
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,870
just makes you into a sheep to be
fleeced,

705
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:39,910
well then it's obviously better.
Dude born rich.

706
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,190
And so I would say the advantage to be
booked to being born is proportional to

707
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,460
the amount of corruption in the society.
If it's a corrupt society,

708
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,930
it's your only hope.
If it isn't,

709
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,780
it might not even necessarily be all
that good for,

710
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:54,270
you know,
um,

711
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,000
what's his name?
The best investor in the world,

712
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:02,530
the richest investor in the world,
whose name his name escapes me.

713
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,290
What's that?
Perfect.

714
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:05,711
Yeah.
Yeah.

715
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,660
He's not leaving very much money to his
kids.

716
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,450
Like it would be a lot by our standards,
but by his standards,

717
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:11,081
it's like,
you know,

718
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:14,920
the pennies in the bottom of this is
ashtray in his car.

719
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,230
So,
and the reason he doesn't want to leave

720
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:19,780
them a lot of money is because he
actually thinks it deprives them of

721
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:22,720
necessity.
And depriving someone of necessity is

722
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:24,520
not really a very good thing because you
know,

723
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,720
partly the reason you're motivated isn't
only because you want some good things

724
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,180
to happen.
It might also be because you know,

725
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:33,610
we,
you better watch out and get your life

726
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:35,710
together or you'll get cut off at the
knees and you know,

727
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:37,930
if you're too protective then that all
goes away.

728
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,170
And so it isn't necessarily obvious that
that's for the best.

729
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,510
So,
so then you might think,

730
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,070
well,
we should have a modified prieto

731
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:49,480
distribution because that'll enable
people who are hyper productive to be

732
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:50,350
rewarded for it.

733
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:54,250
But more importantly,
if you don't have a prieto distribution

734
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,670
in your society,
there aren't individuals who amass large

735
00:39:57,671 --> 00:40:00,790
pools of capital.
And then it's very difficult for there

736
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:03,670
to be investment taking place because
some things are really expensive.

737
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,610
So for example,
if you want to build a fabrication plant

738
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:09,040
to make computer chips,
you need about $4 billion.

739
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:13,810
And it isn't really all that useful.
It seems to me that it wouldn't be all

740
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,470
that useful if the only institution who
ever had that much money was the

741
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,240
government.
Because that would mean that the

742
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:21,670
government would have to be the lead
investor in everything.

743
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,820
And that's just not tenable.
You know,

744
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,740
you're going to replace all the venture
capitalists with government agents,

745
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,120
you know,
government workers,

746
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:32,230
that's not going to work.
So you do want there to be fairly large

747
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:36,360
pools of capital and you can also make a
case that you don't want all the power

748
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,240
centralized.

749
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,400
And so if you take wealth away from
people,

750
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,160
I mean high levels of wealth,
what happens is again,

751
00:40:42,161 --> 00:40:44,890
you start to centralize power in the
government because it's the only

752
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,580
institution that's large enough to wield
a lot of clout.

753
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,980
You know,
when they say in the u s that most

754
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,880
billionaires now are self made and so
then you might think,

755
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:58,540
well if someone is capable parceling out
the crux,

756
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,700
there's always going to be crooks.
If someone is capable of generating $1

757
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,000
billion by the time they're 40 it's
conceivable that that's the sort of

758
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:11,110
person you want to have that much money
because obviously they know what to do

759
00:41:11,111 --> 00:41:11,681
with it,
right?

760
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,690
I mean it's easy to waste money.
You can do that.

761
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:17,800
I mean I've seen people blow through $3
million in two years with no problem.

762
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,040
Like you can,
you can distribute money if you're not

763
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:25,080
careful,
like like snow melting in your hands.

764
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:27,160
It's hard to keep it,
it's hard to use it.

765
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,430
It's hard to invest it properly.
And it's certainly possible that you

766
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:33,800
want fairly large pools of capital
distributed in the society.

767
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,130
So

768
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,830
there are multiple points of power,
so,

769
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:41,000
but you could still argue about exactly
what sort of premium distribution you'd

770
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,740
want.
And there's some good demonstrations in

771
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:44,320
the,
in the u s okay,

772
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,160
I can show you that too.
That's a good one.

773
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:56,523
Okay.

774
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,320
There's a chart.
I saw it recently.

775
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,420
I can't get out of a Harvard business
professor and economist ask more than

776
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:09,421
5,000 Americans how they thought wealth
is distributed in the United States.

777
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,880
This is what they said.
They thought it was dividing the country

778
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:15,790
into five rep groups at the top,
bottom and middle,

779
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:19,720
three 20% groups.
They ask people how they thought the

780
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:23,530
wealth in this country was divided.
Then he asked them what they thought was

781
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:28,531
the ideal distribution and 92% that's at
least nine out of 10 of them said it

782
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:32,680
should be more like this.
In other words,

783
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,080
more equitable than they think it is.
Now,

784
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:38,170
that fact is telling,
admittedly the notion that most

785
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:41,680
Americans know that the system is
already skewed unfairly,

786
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,540
but what's most interesting to me is the
reality compared to our perception.

787
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:52,350
The ideal is as far removed from our
perception of reality as the actual

788
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:56,170
distribution is from what we think
exists in this country.

789
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,430
So ignore the ideal for a moment.
Here's what we think it is.

790
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:04,180
Again,
and here is the actual distribution.

791
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,520
Shockingly skewed,
not only do the bottom 20% and the next

792
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:14,521
20% the bottom 40% of Americans barely
have any of the wealth.

793
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,470
I mean,
it's hard to even see them on the chart,

794
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,820
but the top 1% has more of the country's
wealth.

795
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:27,090
Then nine out of 10 Americans believed
the entire top 20% should have

796
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,300
mindblowing,
but let's look at it another way because

797
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,850
I find this chart kind of difficult to
wrap my head around.

798
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,840
Instead.
Let's reduce the 311 million Americans

799
00:43:37,841 --> 00:43:40,540
too,
just to representative 100 people.

800
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,360
Make it simple.
Here they are,

801
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,190
teachers,
coaches,

802
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,320
firefighters,
construction workers,

803
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,670
engineers,
doctors,

804
00:43:48,671 --> 00:43:50,680
lawyers,
some investment bankers,

805
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:52,270
a CEO,
maybe a celebrity,

806
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:55,670
or now let's line them up according to
their wealth course,

807
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,060
people on the left wealthiest on the
right,

808
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,410
just a steady row.

809
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:03,760
Folks based on their net worth.
So that's other complicated before based

810
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:08,761
on which 20% quintile they fall into.
Now let's reduce the total wealth of the

811
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:13,831
United States,
which was roughly $54 trillion in 2009

812
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,260
to this symbolic pile of cash and let's
distribute it among our 100 Americans.

813
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,570
Well,
here's socialism.

814
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,060
All the wealth of the country
distributed equally.

815
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,080
We all know that won't work.
We need to encourage people to work and

816
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:32,100
work hard to achieve that good American
dream.

817
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:37,101
Keep our country moving forward.
So here's that ideal.

818
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,230
We asked everyone about something like
this curve.

819
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,470
This isn't too bad.
We've got some incentive as the

820
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:48,360
wealthiest folks are now about 10 to 20
times better off than the poorest

821
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:50,310
Americans,
but hey,

822
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:52,440
even the poor folks aren't actually
poor.

823
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,890
Since the poverty line stayed almost
entirely off the chart.

824
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,310
We have a super healthy middleclass of a
smooth transition into wealth and yes,

825
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,740
Republicans and Democrats alive chose
this curve.

826
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:10,190
Nine out of 10 people,
92% said this was a nice ideal

827
00:45:10,381 --> 00:45:13,470
distribution of America's wealth,
but let's move on.

828
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,540
This is what people think America's
wealth distribution actually looks like

829
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,230
that was equitable clearly,
but for me,

830
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,530
even this still looks pretty great.
Yes,

831
00:45:25,531 --> 00:45:29,760
the poorest 20 to 30% are starting to
separate quite a lot compared to the

832
00:45:29,761 --> 00:45:34,650
ideal in the middle class is certainly
struggling more than they were while the

833
00:45:34,651 --> 00:45:38,280
rich and wealthy or making roughly a
hundred times that of the chorus

834
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,540
Americans in about 10 times that of the
still healthy middle class.

835
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,230
Sadly,
this isn't even close to the reality.

836
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,160
Here is the actual distribution of
wealth in America.

837
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,180
The poorest of Americans don't even
register.

838
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,310
They're down to pocket change and the
middle class is barely distinguishable

839
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:01,380
from the poor.
In fact,

840
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,470
even the rich between the top 10 and 20
percentile are worse off only the top

841
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:08,040
10% or better off.

842
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,700
And how much better on so much better
off at the top.

843
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:16,701
Two to 5% are actually off the chart at
this scale and the top 1% this guy,

844
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,830
well,
his stack of money stretches 10 times

845
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:27,300
higher than we can show.
Here's his stack of catch restaffed all

846
00:46:27,301 --> 00:46:31,200
by itself.
This is the top 1% we've been hearing so

847
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:35,910
much about so much green in his pockets
that I have to give him a whole new

848
00:46:35,911 --> 00:46:38,790
column of his own because he won't fit
on my chart.

849
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:43,020
1% of America has 40% of all the
nations.

850
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:47,100
Well,
the bottom 8% eight out of every 10

851
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:52,101
people or 80 out of these hundred only
has 7% between them,

852
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,910
and this has only gotten worse in the
last 20 to 30 years.

853
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:02,150
While the richest 1% take home almost a
quarter of the national income today in

854
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:07,851
1976 they took home only 9% meaning
their share of income is nearly tripled

855
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,860
in the last 30 years.
The top 1% half the country stocks,

856
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:18,861
bonds and mutual funds,
the bottom 50% of Americans and only

857
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,760
half a percent of these investments,
which means they aren't investing,

858
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,970
they're just scraping by.
And I'm sure many of these wealthy

859
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:31,630
people have worked very hard in,
but do you really believe that the CEO

860
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,690
is working 380 times harder?
It is average employee and if not as

861
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:38,320
lowest paid employee.

862
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,330
See that's the one error I think that's
in this video,

863
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,010
how hard you work is irrelevant in terms
of how much money are almost irrelevant

864
00:47:46,011 --> 00:47:48,920
in terms of how much money you generate,
right?

865
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:51,350
Because obviously the people who work
really hard,

866
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:55,040
I mean who works hard,
those guys that are digging holes out in

867
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:58,520
the road in the winter there,
they're working hard,

868
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,893
right?
But

869
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,450
you're not rewarded for the physical
effort that you put in or rarely there's

870
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:07,490
some association,
but not very much.

871
00:48:07,491 --> 00:48:12,110
And so it isn't whether or not the CEO
works 380 times harder.

872
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:17,350
It's whether or not their productivity
can be leveraged enough to justify that

873
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:18,464
level of,

874
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,990
uh huh

875
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,470
compensation.
Now you can make arguments on both sides

876
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:27,470
of that and it depends a lot on the
industry and on the individual and all

877
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:29,210
of those things,
but you don't want to,

878
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,640
you don't want to reduce this argument
to one of hard work.

879
00:48:31,641 --> 00:48:34,310
It's not appropriate.
It's too unsophisticated,

880
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,550
but the average,
the average worker needs to work more

881
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,430
than a month to earn with the CEO makes
him one hour.

882
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:54,080
We certainly don't have to go all the
way to socialism to find somebody that

883
00:48:54,081 --> 00:48:58,250
is fair for hardworking Americans.
We don't even have to achieve what most

884
00:48:58,251 --> 00:49:03,251
of us consider might be ideal.
All we need to do is wake up and realize

885
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,720
that the reality in this country is not
at all what we think it is.

886
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:11,363
Okay,

887
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,930
so there,
there's a two minute explanation for

888
00:49:14,931 --> 00:49:18,440
trump and sanders.
Really,

889
00:49:18,441 --> 00:49:21,020
I'm dead serious about that.
I'm dead serious about that.

890
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:23,000
You know,
because the right wing working class

891
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,710
right wing,
they think they'd been absolutely

892
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:27,690
screwed over and they have,
and then you know,

893
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,960
the left thinks,
well there's way too much power

894
00:49:29,961 --> 00:49:32,840
concentrated at the top and the
distribution would be the answer.

895
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,510
The problem is is that,
and this is the real problem,

896
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,570
it's not that he's figured out how to
distribute the money.

897
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,230
Like first of all,
there's a natural proclivity.

898
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:44,870
You might say,
you can map model it with laws of

899
00:49:44,871 --> 00:49:48,140
physics.
There's a natural proclivity of money to

900
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:51,860
rate rank itself out like that.
And so that happens in every culture.

901
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,710
Now you,
maybe you can modify the steepness,

902
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,920
but it's not easy to figure out how,
you know when there's a bunch of

903
00:49:57,921 --> 00:50:01,250
problems,
because there's a bunch of problems that

904
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:03,590
are associated with the more dim witted
solutions.

905
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,710
For example,
lots of people think that poverty is

906
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:09,830
caused by lack of money.
And that's really not a very

907
00:50:09,831 --> 00:50:12,740
sophisticated theory because there's
lots of things that cause poverty.

908
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,250
Low Iq causes poverty.
And I'm not saying that all poor people

909
00:50:16,251 --> 00:50:18,380
have low Iq,
because that would be stupid.

910
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,130
But obviously if you have an Iq of 80
and you can barely read,

911
00:50:22,131 --> 00:50:25,070
the probability that you're going to end
up poor is pretty damn hot,

912
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,180
right?
So,

913
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,820
so you've got,
and you know it's about 10% of the

914
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:32,210
population who has an Iq less than 80
that's a lot of people.

915
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,810
And so they're not literate.
So if you think about what they can do,

916
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,880
they can't run computers,
generally speaking.

917
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,980
Okay,
well then there's people who are ill,

918
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,110
you know,
there's a lot of them.

919
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,250
Then there's people who are alone,
and that's a big problem because they're

920
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,050
one step away from disaster,
right?

921
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,750
If you're alone,
then there's people who have alcohol and

922
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,060
drug problems and people was screwed up
families.

923
00:50:53,061 --> 00:50:55,460
And you know,
you can go on and on to add up the

924
00:50:55,461 --> 00:51:00,461
reasons that people fall off the edge of
the world and money won't scratch the

925
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:02,960
surface for many of those problems.
For addiction,

926
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:06,200
for example.
Now maybe spending on programs that

927
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,940
would remediate addiction would be
useful.

928
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:09,500
But if you're an addict and you get
money,

929
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,730
that's not a good thing because all that
means is that you're going to just rent

930
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:15,260
out the addiction until you run out of
money.

931
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,430
And so you've got to have a more
sophisticated idea of what constitutes

932
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,860
poverty before you can properly address
it.

933
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:25,250
And then you also have to take into
account that a lot of what's driving

934
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:30,110
people crazy say in places like the u s
isn't the fact that there's absolute

935
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:32,390
poverty,
cause there's abs actually not that much

936
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:37,420
absolute poverty in the u s so if you
take the bottom 5% of the US population

937
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:41,480
by world standards,
they're doing just fine.

938
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,850
So,
but by American standards,

939
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:46,370
they're doing terribly.
And so you have the relative poverty

940
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:51,371
problem and relative prob poverty drives
aggression.

941
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,520
And so that's something that's really
worth knowing and this is something that

942
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:58,910
the conservatives just haven't seemed to
figure out as far as I can tell because

943
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,590
the conservatives might say,
well,

944
00:52:00,591 --> 00:52:04,010
you should let the money pile up on the
right hand side because you know the

945
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,730
system is fair and smart people deserve
to be rewarded and so on and so forth.

946
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,960
The problem is is that as that curve
increases in height,

947
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,040
the probability that the surrounding
society is going to become violent

948
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,600
starts to ratchet up tremendously.
And you see this in places like Central

949
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:24,200
America where if you have money,
you have to live in a bubble because if

950
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:25,670
you don't,
people will kidnap you.

951
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,060
And so then you might think,
well if you have $1 billion but you

952
00:52:29,061 --> 00:52:31,850
can't go outside except in a helicopter
with armed guards,

953
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,770
how rich are you really?

954
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,220
You know,
in in,

955
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,990
in a place like Canada,
like in Montreal or Toronto.

956
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:42,170
There's good examples is the city is so
damn safe that you don't have to live in

957
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:45,260
your house.
You can live in the city and that's a

958
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:49,910
massive economic like that should be
calculated as part of your net worth.

959
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,330
And that's a consequence of reasonable
public programs.

960
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:56,330
And the fact that you know,
the distribution of income in Canada

961
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,700
hasn't gotten to the point where things
are destabilizing.

962
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,900
And so conservatives should be watching
out for that incredible

963
00:53:02,901 --> 00:53:06,740
disproportionality of income as much as
anyone else if one of their prime

964
00:53:06,741 --> 00:53:09,050
concerns is to maintain social
stability.

965
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,810
So,
but the problem,

966
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,210
the problem that we haven't been able to
solve as a culture from an economic

967
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:21,980
perspective is how to distribute money
down the prieto distribution in a way

968
00:53:21,981 --> 00:53:25,160
that actually works.
It's way harder than you think.

969
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,600
You know.
So for example,

970
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,370
if you set up large social social
services institutions,

971
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,880
governmental institutions,
or charities even for that matter,

972
00:53:35,881 --> 00:53:37,410
the problem is,
is that the,

973
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,210
the uh,
the,

974
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:42,510
what would you call it,
the baseline cost of the organizations

975
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,270
is so damn high that hardly any of the
money ever gets to the people that it's

976
00:53:45,271 --> 00:53:47,940
supposed to be helping.
I mean that's really the case with

977
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:51,450
foreign aid in places like Africa where
the poor people virtually never did any

978
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:52,560
money.
You know,

979
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:55,440
so
you know,

980
00:53:55,441 --> 00:54:00,030
so you think a corporation spends about
95% of its time just ensuring that it

981
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:02,700
survived,
but it uses that much resources just to

982
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,160
keep running.
You set up a charity or you know,

983
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:07,500
a social welfare institution,
you get the same problem.

984
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,410
All the money is eaten up by the people
who are running the institution.

985
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:11,910
And I'm not being cynical about that.

986
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:12,960
They have to live,
you know,

987
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,480
it's,
it's really expensive to hire someone.

988
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,400
You know,
if you want someone qualified,

989
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:22,080
if you pay them $50,000 that basically
costs you 100,000 because you have to

990
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:24,870
give them an office and it has to have
light and heat and all of that.

991
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:26,790
So you know,
10 employees,

992
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,210
it's 1 million bucks already.
And so if you're fundraising as a

993
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:34,380
charity to just get past the point where
you're surviving is almost impossible.

994
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,530
And then there's little logistical
difficulties of actually distributing

995
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:39,210
the money.
How the hell do you do that?

996
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,020
It's not easy.
Finland is instituted a guaranteed

997
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:45,870
minimum wage,
minimum salary per month.

998
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:46,681
They,
you know,

999
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:49,950
and they're experimenting with that,
but it's a small country and it's

1000
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:53,310
relatively homogenous.
It's more like a big city or a moderate

1001
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:56,040
size city actually.
So you could think that the logistics

1002
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:57,420
would be a lot more straight forward.

1003
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,490
But anyways.
Okay.

1004
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,800
Well,
so that's actually a preview to some

1005
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:04,200
degree of what we're going to talk about
when we get to conscientiousness.

1006
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:06,750
But you do need to know these things
statistically and you have to,

1007
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,310
you have to,
uh,

1008
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,220
you know,
you have to understand what the

1009
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:13,710
statistics are representing.
Okay.

1010
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:17,160
So people,
I mentioned that there are gender

1011
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:20,310
differences in,
in personality and you know,

1012
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,890
that's a very controversial claim,
weirdly enough.

1013
00:55:23,310 --> 00:55:24,900
Um,
it's something that's always rather

1014
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,800
shocked me that it is controversial.
Um,

1015
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,280
this is from the Gender Equity Resource
Center at Berkeley.

1016
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,020
Gender is a socially constructed system
of classification that describes

1017
00:55:37,021 --> 00:55:39,600
qualities of masculinity and femininity
to people.

1018
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:44,250
Gender characteristics can change over
time and are different between cultures.

1019
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:45,810
Well,
the amount,

1020
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:48,420
the number of things that are wrong with
those two sentences is almost,

1021
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,510
it would take about three hours to
actually point them out.

1022
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,950
I mean,
first of all,

1023
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,600
the fact that gender characteristics can
change over time and are different

1024
00:55:57,601 --> 00:56:01,440
between cultures in no way implies that
those things are socially constructed.

1025
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,910
It implies they partly socially
constructed at best.

1026
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:08,310
But it also,
it also indicates that some of the

1027
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:11,340
reasons that things might change over
time and are different between cultures

1028
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:13,530
could be biological.
Like there's no,

1029
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:17,610
there's no saying anything.
There's no a priori demonstration that

1030
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:19,470
that's impossible.
It's not impossible.

1031
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,040
And gender is a socially constructed
system of classification.

1032
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,060
Well actually no,
that isn't what the dad does seem to

1033
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,920
indicate.
And so the best out of that,

1034
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:33,550
I know on that or the Scandinavian
studies one personality and what we'll

1035
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:34,384
take a look at them.

1036
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:40,203
Nope.

1037
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,220
Oh,
this is a good one.

1038
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:56,760
So this is interactions with reach
rhesus monkeys in toys.

1039
00:56:56,761 --> 00:57:01,110
We compared the interactions of 34
rhesus monkeys living within 135 monkey

1040
00:57:01,111 --> 00:57:03,870
troop with human wheeled toys and plush
toys.

1041
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,810
Male monkeys,
like boys showed consistent and strong

1042
00:57:06,811 --> 00:57:10,020
preferences for wheel toys while female
monkeys,

1043
00:57:10,021 --> 00:57:13,050
like girls showed the fit greater
variability and preferences.

1044
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,260
That's the magnitude of preference for
wheeled over.

1045
00:57:16,261 --> 00:57:19,200
Plush toys differed significantly
between males and females.

1046
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,920
As similarities to human findings
demonstrate such preferences can develop

1047
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:27,921
without explicit gender socialization.
So exposure to prenatal life events,

1048
00:57:29,421 --> 00:57:33,600
stress is associated with masculinized
play behavior and girls.

1049
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,150
So,
and that was,

1050
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:37,350
uh,
uh,

1051
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,070
an analysis of in utero exposure to
hormones.

1052
00:57:41,071 --> 00:57:44,490
Because one thing that seems to happen,
this is,

1053
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,680
you know,
this is one of the many things that

1054
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:50,910
contribute to the differences between
males and females is that the basic

1055
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,250
human body phenotype is feminine.

1056
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,540
So if you have x,
y chromosomes or xx chromosomes,

1057
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,150
and you're not exposed to testosterone
in Utero,

1058
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:05,370
you'll come out with a female
physiology.

1059
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,420
So what happens is that in utero that
the,

1060
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:13,500
the male embryo is masculinized by
testosterone,

1061
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:16,290
no testosterone.
There's also testosterone production for

1062
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:17,160
women,
you know,

1063
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:21,540
but there's more for the male babies.
And there's some evidence that suggests

1064
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:26,541
that the more testosterone that a fetus
is exposed to in Utero,

1065
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:31,790
the more masculinized their cognitive
styles and toy preferences and behaviors

1066
00:58:32,311 --> 00:58:34,290
are.
But it's also the case for females.

1067
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:37,020
Like if the more they're exposed to
testosterone in Utero,

1068
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:40,590
the more that's also the case.
And that's what this particular study

1069
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,480
showed.
So

1070
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,340
this is,
yes,

1071
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:48,860
this is Simon Baron Cohen's work he did
the work with,

1072
00:58:48,861 --> 00:58:49,910
with uh,
with,

1073
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,040
with fetal development and he showed
that,

1074
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,120
um,
fetal testosterone is inversely

1075
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:59,510
correlated with social behaviors such as
eye contact and infancy,

1076
00:58:59,511 --> 00:59:03,650
peer relations and preschoolers and
mentalistic interpretations of animate

1077
00:59:03,651 --> 00:59:04,484
motion,

1078
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,950
male fetuses are exposed to higher
levels of testosterone and then our

1079
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:13,540
female fetuses.
So his theory actually is that autism is

1080
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:18,070
the extreme end of masculinized
cognitive development because it's all

1081
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:21,010
female oriented,
no peep people orientation at all.

1082
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,100
And then the,
the opposite end of the distribution,

1083
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:28,010
he's associated with predisposition to
psychosis.

1084
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:30,860
Although I that I find that part of the
theory weaker.

1085
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,900
Um,
but you know,

1086
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,250
it's,
who knows,

1087
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:37,040
it's certainly a possibility.
So yeah,

1088
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,830
and I contact is one of the things
that's really lacking in people who are

1089
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:40,820
autistic.
And you know,

1090
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,570
he had an awful lot of social
information from observing the face and

1091
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:47,810
you have specialized circuits for
pulling in emotional information from

1092
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:49,070
face observation.
So,

1093
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:51,290
so

1094
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,993
yeah,

1095
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:03,810
UN indices of gender equality and
economic development are associated with

1096
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:06,000
larger gender differences in
agreeableness,

1097
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:10,800
but not an extroversion or neuroticism.
So what's happened in the Scandinavian

1098
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:13,230
countries?
So imagine that any given trade is a

1099
01:00:13,231 --> 01:00:17,850
combination of environmental variables
and genetic biological variables.

1100
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,280
Okay.
Now you tend to think of those things as

1101
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:23,880
isolated,
but they're not weirdly enough,

1102
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:29,390
the relationship between biological
determination and cultural determination

1103
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:33,930
is determined by the culture,
which is a very strange thing.

1104
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:38,960
So what I mean by that is that
if you are two years old and I threw you

1105
01:00:40,351 --> 01:00:43,140
in a box and did nothing but beat you
everyday for 10 years,

1106
01:00:43,141 --> 01:00:46,260
the probability that you would come out
agreeable is very low.

1107
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:47,840
Right?
So,

1108
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,800
and the,
the point I'm making is that you can

1109
01:00:49,801 --> 01:00:54,270
take an individual and if you put them
in a radical enough environment,

1110
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,010
you can pretty much shift them where
you're,

1111
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,060
where you're going to shift.

1112
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,170
Now the harder you want to shift them,
the more force it's going to take.

1113
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:02,611
So,
you know,

1114
01:01:02,611 --> 01:01:04,410
like if you took a really agreeable
person,

1115
01:01:04,411 --> 01:01:09,411
you'd have to be pretty malevolent to
set up the circumstances that would

1116
01:01:09,721 --> 01:01:12,390
really make them self centered in
predatory.

1117
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:17,250
But I suspect you could do it.
So what happens in the Scandinavian

1118
01:01:17,251 --> 01:01:20,820
countries is that there's been a lot of
attempt to,

1119
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:26,130
to flatten out the contribution of the
society on gender differences.

1120
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:29,790
And so all that's happened is that the
biological differences have maximized.

1121
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,130
See,
because what you're really looking for

1122
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:35,730
is his contribution for society to have
a contribution.

1123
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:39,590
There has to be different treatment for
men and women because otherwise this

1124
01:01:39,591 --> 01:01:43,440
society has no effect on the differences
between men and women obviously.

1125
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,830
And then there's nothing left.
But biological differences now there

1126
01:01:46,831 --> 01:01:49,220
could be no biological differences.
You know,

1127
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,860
that's one possibility in the strict
social constructionists would predict

1128
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:53,040
that.

1129
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,900
In fact,
they still teach that universities all

1130
01:01:54,901 --> 01:01:58,440
the time and which,
which I truly believe is appalling.

1131
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:02,080
I think the data is already in on that.
And um,

1132
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,720
there are consequences of this too,
so that it's still the differences

1133
01:02:06,721 --> 01:02:09,280
between men and women to say with
regards to agreeableness still aren't

1134
01:02:09,281 --> 01:02:11,130
that baby even in the Scandinavian
countries.

1135
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:14,190
But there are a lot more consistent and
larger there than they are in any other

1136
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:17,010
societies that have been studied.
So that's pretty weird.

1137
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,400
And these are big samples.
These are samples of tens of thousands

1138
01:02:20,401 --> 01:02:22,020
of people.
They're not trivial studies.

1139
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,030
This is a cool one because it,
it,

1140
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:28,260
it turns out,
you know,

1141
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:30,330
there were a lot of reasons,
there were a lot of,

1142
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,350
there has been a lot of discussion about
why the gender segregate in terms of

1143
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,950
occupation and you know,
some,

1144
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:38,550
sometimes that's,
that's,

1145
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:40,620
that's taken the form of an Iq argument.

1146
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,840
So probably,
I don't know if you guys remember this

1147
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:47,310
because maybe it's too long ago,
but this president of Harvard University

1148
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,360
whose name was Larry Summers,
he also served in whose cabinet I don't

1149
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:53,520
remember at the moment.
It's probably Obama's,

1150
01:02:53,521 --> 01:02:54,900
but I'm afraid.
I don't remember.

1151
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,700
Anyways,
Larry Summers is very high powerful

1152
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:04,620
person in the United States and he was,
he was giving a talk at Harvard at one

1153
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:08,910
point and he was when the Americans
started to get concerned about science,

1154
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,370
technology,
engineering and mathematics,

1155
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,920
the stem subjects say,
because they're kind of thinking we need

1156
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:17,370
more people in the stem subjects in
order to kickstart the economy,

1157
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:19,140
which may or may not be true.
But anyways,

1158
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:22,020
that was the idea.
And one of the problems that was being

1159
01:03:22,021 --> 01:03:26,310
dealt with was the relative dearth of
women in the stem disciplines.

1160
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,420
And Summers made reference to a body of
research that suggested that.

1161
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,760
So there's take that normal distribution
there.

1162
01:03:35,761 --> 01:03:37,200
Okay,
you see that one on the screen.

1163
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,380
Now imagine you search,
you put another one right on top of

1164
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:42,390
that,
but you flattened it so you just pushed

1165
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:45,240
it down right in the middle.
And so what would happen is it's a

1166
01:03:45,241 --> 01:03:47,790
little lower in the middle,
but it goes out a little farther on the

1167
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,860
sides.
And so then what happens,

1168
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,100
which is analogous to what I told you
happened with agreeableness,

1169
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:56,580
is that if you go out four standard
deviations above me,

1170
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,880
so let's say to the 99 what is it?
85 95 99 to the 99.9 percentile.

1171
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:06,930
So one person in a thousand,
assume one person in a thousand becomes

1172
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:12,260
a genius level is capable of genius
level accomplishment in the stem areas.

1173
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,813
Okay?
So it's one,

1174
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,740
maybe it's more than that,
but let's say one in a thousand,

1175
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:18,460
you're going to get a pretty decent
person at that rate.

1176
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,240
They're all going to be men if the male
curve is flatter.

1177
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:25,110
But if you go down the other side of the
distribution and you look for the person

1178
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,220
who's one in a thousand most,
um,

1179
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:29,430
intellectually impaired,
they're also going to be men.

1180
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,810
And so that idea was that the mean
levels of Iq between men and women are

1181
01:04:33,811 --> 01:04:35,850
the same,
but the standard deviation is different.

1182
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,710
And the underlying biological
justification for that,

1183
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,230
roughly speaking,
is there often is more variability in

1184
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:46,620
male behavior across animal species
because males are actually more

1185
01:04:46,621 --> 01:04:48,900
expendable than females.
And so,

1186
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:52,920
and there's a much,
there's a differential reproduction rate

1187
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,710
among males that's high enough.
So that half of your,

1188
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:59,160
you have twice as many female ancestors
as male ancestors.

1189
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,530
Now you think,
well that's impossible,

1190
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,230
but it's not.
If the average woman had one child,

1191
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,360
sorry,
if the average,

1192
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,310
yeah,
the average woman had one child

1193
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:10,800
throughout history and the average man,
man,

1194
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,730
man who had children had to then that's
what you get.

1195
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,010
But what it would mean is that there's
an equal number.

1196
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:21,120
Men would have had zero.
And the distribution for men in

1197
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,700
fathering is a lot more like that.
It's a pretty high probability that a

1198
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:29,350
woman will have at least one child where
it's a relatively high probability that

1199
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:31,840
a man won't.
And so that's all you need.

1200
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:36,250
And so given that that difference in
reproductive value,

1201
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:38,410
in some sense,
it's not like the men don't have

1202
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:41,110
reproductive value,
it's that the reproductive value can be

1203
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,300
fulfilled by a relatively small number
of men.

1204
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,030
So men aren't the limiting factor in
reproduction.

1205
01:05:46,031 --> 01:05:48,100
Women are,
and so not to cross species.

1206
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:51,700
And so what happens is the male seem to
get more variable in their,

1207
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,760
in their behavioral display because
there's more advantage to winning and

1208
01:05:56,891 --> 01:06:00,010
not.
And once you lose it doesn't matter how

1209
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:02,080
much you lose by in some sense.

1210
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,900
So anyways,
he got harassed to death for that.

1211
01:06:04,901 --> 01:06:07,210
I think they actually,
I don't remember what happened to them,

1212
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:10,150
but I think he had to stop being
president of Harvard University.

1213
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,280
But he didn't even say that that was
true.

1214
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,200
He just said that it was one of the
possibilities.

1215
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,640
But,
and you know,

1216
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:18,490
there is debate about that.
There's no debate richly,

1217
01:06:18,491 --> 01:06:23,350
no debate about the average Iq.
There is some debate about the standard

1218
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:28,351
deviations and I think the strongest
evidence is sort of enlightening in line

1219
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:32,290
with the testosterone.
The fetal testosterone exposure is that

1220
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:35,830
men have a small edge and spatial
reasoning and that's the main mental

1221
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:38,710
rotation for example,
and that seems to be associated with

1222
01:06:38,711 --> 01:06:42,820
higher levels of fetal testosterone.
Now you do also see sometimes that women

1223
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:45,940
have a small engine,
verbal and verbal intelligence and

1224
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:48,850
verbal fluency,
but that might be more associated with

1225
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:51,570
trait openness because trade openness,
the open,

1226
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,670
the creative activity part of treadle
Vanessa is higher among women than it is

1227
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:57,850
about men,
but regardless of all that,

1228
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:03,850
what really seems to make the difference
with regards to the way that the sexes

1229
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:09,210
distribute themselves in the in the
career landscape is interest and the

1230
01:07:09,641 --> 01:07:13,120
biggest differences between men and
women that are normally recorded are

1231
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:17,710
recorded in terms of interest and the
basic distribution seems to be people

1232
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:21,790
versus things which is quite cool
because that was derived as an

1233
01:07:21,791 --> 01:07:25,660
independent dimension before Simon Baron
Cohen started to do is work on fetal

1234
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:29,200
testosterone exposure and those things
just happened to map on to each other

1235
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:33,790
like his empathizing versus
systematizing is a lot light people

1236
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:37,900
versus things and it also looks a lot
like agreeableness and in fact I have a

1237
01:07:37,901 --> 01:07:39,040
student,
we checked that out.

1238
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,610
We took Simon Baron Cohen's
questionnaire and mapped it onto the big

1239
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:47,110
five and the empathizing dimension is
indistinguishable from from

1240
01:07:47,111 --> 01:07:50,080
agreeableness systematizing.
It looks a bit more complex.

1241
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,350
We haven't quite sorted that out.
But so men prefer working with things

1242
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:57,760
and women with people.
And the,

1243
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,240
the uh,
effect size is almost one standard

1244
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:02,440
deviation,
which is,

1245
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,331
well,
it's a,

1246
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:08,680
it's a remarkably powerful effect size.
You rarely see an effect size of that

1247
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:10,330
magnitude in,
in,

1248
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:13,300
uh,
in psychology or in the social sciences.

1249
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:17,150
It's a very big determinant.
So man show stronger people.

1250
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:20,360
People have categories,
jobs into six categories using this

1251
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:24,320
thing they call Riasec realistic
investigative,

1252
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,070
artistic,
social and conventional,

1253
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,780
realistic,
investigative,

1254
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:32,450
artistic,
social,

1255
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,700
conventional,
no difference in enterprising.

1256
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:36,430
Yeah,
the middle one is enterprising and

1257
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:41,150
that's kind of a factor analysis derived
categorization system to end it is

1258
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,520
related in intelligible ways to the big
five.

1259
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:46,340
So anyways,
men show stronger,

1260
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:51,290
realistic and investigative interests
and women show stronger artistic,

1261
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:54,380
social and conventional interests.
So,

1262
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:59,360
and there's no difference in
entrepreneurial interest essentially.

1263
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,880
So kind of know what you think about
that,

1264
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:04,520
but see one of the things that's,
it's happened,

1265
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:09,110
oh yes.
That's actually what this next slide

1266
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,940
talks about.
So that's very good

1267
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,650
difference between men and women
interested in engineering,

1268
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,550
science.
And math.

1269
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,260
So the men are much,
much more interesting engineering.

1270
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,950
It's a big,
big effect.

1271
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,070
There are somewhat more interested in
science and that'd be the harder ends of

1272
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:32,890
the science that aren't social,
you know,

1273
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:36,050
and they're more interested in math.
And so one of the things that you see

1274
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,040
happens,
for example,

1275
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:42,041
if you take high math achievers at grade
11 or grade 10 there's not a huge

1276
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:46,220
difference in numbers between girls and
boys in the United States.

1277
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:50,210
But if you track them across time,
the proportion of the high ability

1278
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:55,790
people who go into mathematics or an
allied discipline is way higher among

1279
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,920
the boys than it is among the girls.
Oh,

1280
01:09:57,921 --> 01:10:00,610
you can make a case that there's some
sociol you know,

1281
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:02,390
there may be,
there's some social conditioning that's

1282
01:10:02,391 --> 01:10:05,540
associated with that except that it's
hard to make that case when all that

1283
01:10:05,541 --> 01:10:09,800
you're the only people you're picking
are people who already equally good at

1284
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,270
mathematics.

1285
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:13,550
Because if it was cultural,
you'd think that you wouldn't be able to

1286
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:16,050
pull them out to begin with.
You have to make the case that all of

1287
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:20,180
the cultural difference in terms of
ability is taking place after the,

1288
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,760
the sorting is,
has occurred.

1289
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,250
That just doesn't seem right.
But what the,

1290
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:27,320
what,
what seems to be the case is the women

1291
01:10:27,321 --> 01:10:29,780
who are very,
very advanced and mathematical ability

1292
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,360
aren't that interested in pursuing it as
a career.

1293
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:37,610
So it's interest.
So women underrepresented in stem,

1294
01:10:37,611 --> 01:10:38,570
science,
technology,

1295
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:39,740
engineering and mathematics.
Well,

1296
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:42,140
women are walking,
Lee overrepresented in lots of

1297
01:10:42,141 --> 01:10:43,640
disciplines though.
So for example,

1298
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:46,250
there'd be you becoming increasingly
dominant in,

1299
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:48,500
in medicine.
So,

1300
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,780
you know,
and not that's a real switch because of

1301
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:52,490
course that wasn't the case 50 years
ago.

1302
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,300
So high end,
cognitively complex jobs that involve a

1303
01:10:56,301 --> 01:11:00,290
lot of social interaction and a lot of
care for people are overwhelmingly

1304
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:02,390
becoming dominated by women.
So,

1305
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,730
but math,
physical science is computer science and

1306
01:11:04,731 --> 01:11:07,730
engineering don't seem to be,
at least at the moment in that,

1307
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,190
in that group.
So,

1308
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,840
and there's,
there's,

1309
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,960
there's a,
you know,

1310
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,630
um,
occupations where women are unbelievably

1311
01:11:22,631 --> 01:11:25,060
underrepresented.
So why do you think that is?

1312
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,340
I mean,
if you looked at this list,

1313
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:28,930
what would you,
what would you say?

1314
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:29,793
Why would that be?

1315
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:33,543
What's that?

1316
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:35,533
Meetings.
Okay.

1317
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:37,570
Anything else?
Well,

1318
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,290
it's physical,
a lot of that,

1319
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:40,370
right?
Construction,

1320
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:41,240
forestry,
mining.

1321
01:11:41,241 --> 01:11:43,530
I mean those are very,
very physically demanding jobs.

1322
01:11:43,531 --> 01:11:46,730
So they require a fair bit of strength.
Generally you have to be isolated

1323
01:11:46,731 --> 01:11:48,680
somewhere,
especially for forestry and mining,

1324
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,990
you know,
other dangerous jobs.

1325
01:11:50,991 --> 01:11:54,380
Men are way overrepresented and
dangerous occupations.

1326
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:58,160
And so almost all the exceedingly
dangerous occupations are done by men.

1327
01:11:58,340 --> 01:11:59,840
It's actually part of the reason that
women,

1328
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:03,320
that men make more money than women.
There's a bunch of reasons.

1329
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:07,370
It's not pure arbitrary social prejudice
by any stretch of the imagination.

1330
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,940
You need a multivariate equation in
order to account for the differences.

1331
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:13,340
There's lots of different factors.
One of them is,

1332
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:17,660
is that um,
male run small businesses make more

1333
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:20,750
money than female run small businesses.
And I think the reason for that is that

1334
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:23,210
females often do that part time when
they're,

1335
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,410
when they're having kids.

1336
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:27,290
So they're not devoted entirely to the
small business,

1337
01:12:27,291 --> 01:12:29,660
but it's a way that they can keep in the
economic game.

1338
01:12:29,661 --> 01:12:31,130
While they're also pursuing their
family.

1339
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,230
Um,
men are more likely to move to work in,

1340
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,410
they're more likely to do dangerous jobs
and they're also more likely to work

1341
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:42,440
longer hours.
And so all of those account for some of

1342
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:44,660
the reason that men are paid more than
women,

1343
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,500
it's not pure prejudice.
So there's a good example of,

1344
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:53,120
of the differences in male versus female
dominant dominated occupations,

1345
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,580
brick masons,
block masons and stone masons.

1346
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:58,670
There's virtually no women.
Cement Masons,

1347
01:12:58,671 --> 01:13:01,400
concrete,
fisher finishers and terasa workers,

1348
01:13:01,401 --> 01:13:05,330
electrical power line installers,
carpet floor and tile installers,

1349
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:06,680
heating,
air conditioning,

1350
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:10,520
refrigeration mechanics and installers,
structural iron and rebar workers,

1351
01:13:10,521 --> 01:13:13,340
Boston truck mechanics and diesel engine
specialists,

1352
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,590
miscellaneous vehicle in mobile
equipment,

1353
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:18,110
mechanics tool and die makers and
roofers.

1354
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:23,260
All of those are 99% or more male
dominated female dominated occupations

1355
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:27,890
in the u s number one secretaries and
administrative assistance.

1356
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,470
You know,
that's the most common job category for

1357
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:33,710
women that's unchanged since the Middle
1950s so,

1358
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:36,200
and that's partly because those are
actually pretty good jobs.

1359
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:38,270
They pay well,
they're regular,

1360
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,120
they're secure,
they're not too demanding,

1361
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:43,940
they're predictable.
Like if you have to have a jaw rather

1362
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:45,280
than a career that's a,
you know,

1363
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:48,740
cause a career or something,
I suppose that pays you outside of the

1364
01:13:48,741 --> 01:13:50,900
money that you're making for the job.
You know,

1365
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:55,790
it's got additional benefits in terms of
status or discovery or accomplishment or

1366
01:13:55,791 --> 01:13:57,830
creativity.
But if you just want a job,

1367
01:13:57,831 --> 01:14:01,130
that's not a bad job.
Secretary is childcare workers,

1368
01:14:01,131 --> 01:14:02,840
receptionists,
Teacher's assistants,

1369
01:14:02,841 --> 01:14:04,460
registered nurses,
bookkeeping,

1370
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:08,210
accounting and auditing clerks,
maids and housekeeping cleaners,

1371
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,460
nursing,
psychiatric and home health aides,

1372
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:13,450
personal and home care aides and general
office clerks.

1373
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:17,530
So,
all right,

1374
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:22,090
we'll go over agreeableness some more on
Thursday and we'll talk more about

1375
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,230
conscientiousness as well.
