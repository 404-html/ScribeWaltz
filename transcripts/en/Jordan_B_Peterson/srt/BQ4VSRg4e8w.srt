1
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,420
This one is particularly complicated.
So because with piaget,

2
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,003
you enter a whole new domain of,
of axiomatic thinking that's the right 

3
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,240
way to think about it.
See,

4
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,010
each of these people that we're 
discussing,

5
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:24,844
each of these theories comes out the 
construction of the world from a 

6
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:30,100
different perspective.
And it's really fundamentally different.

7
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:33,820
It's different way deep down at the 
level of fundamental assumptions.

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:36,010
And so piaget is who's,
uh,

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,310
who's probably the world's most famous 
developmental psychologist,

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,400
but although he didn't consider himself 
a developmental psychologist,

11
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:45,490
he considered himself a genetic 
epistemologist.

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,090
And what that meant was that he was 
interested in pissed homology,

13
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:53,740
which is how knowledge structures work 
and genetic means formulation of.

14
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:54,574
And so he was interested in how children
formulate their knowledge structures in 

15
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,950
the world.
And uh,

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,033
he was a constructivist because he 
believed that human beings construct 

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,073
the,
they don't only construct the 

18
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:09,310
representations of the world and it's 
deeper than that.

19
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,320
It's more like the construct the world 
itself.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,363
Now,
it depends to some degree on what you 

21
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:15,430
think of as the world.
And of course that's,

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,443
so there's a reality definition issue 
that's nested at the bottom of this and 

23
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:20,224
it's very complex one.
And so I'm going to have to walk you 

24
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:24,010
through it piece by piece.
Now,

25
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,950
piaget was a genius.
He was,

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,640
he wrote a paper I believe on molluscs 
when he was 10 and had it published in a

27
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:31,474
scientific journal.
And he was offered the curatorship of a 

28
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,384
museum as a consequence of that.
And his parents had to write the museum 

29
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,923
directors and tell them that he couldn't
curate the museum because he was only 

30
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:41,734
10.
And so that gives you some idea about 

31
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,100
piaget and he's published many,
many,

32
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:48,400
many books and many of them haven't been
translated into English yet.

33
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,070
And so he was quite the,
he was quite the,

34
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,243
you know,
large intelligence creature and he 

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,230
studied all sorts of things.

36
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,063
Uh,
so I'm going to tell you a little bit 

37
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,204
about constructivism.
We're going to start you with a quote 

38
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:06,250
from Piaget and to its,
he's done some books,

39
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,084
some of his books I found quite 
straightforward and some of them very 

40
00:02:08,891 --> 00:02:09,724
difficult.
And I think it's often because of the 

41
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,823
quality of the translation.
This happens to be a relatively 

42
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,270
difficult section.
I don't think it's translated that well,

43
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,980
but whatever.
We're going to go through it.

44
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:18,814
I'll explain it to you a little bit.
So Piaget said the common postulate 

45
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,750
that's assumption of various traditional
epistemologies,

46
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:26,973
theories of valid knowledge is that 
knowledge itself is a fact and not a 

47
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,344
process.
And then if our various forms of 

48
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,290
knowledge are always incomplete and our 
various sciences still imperfect,

49
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,760
that which is acquired is still acquired
and can therefore be studied statically,

50
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,130
hence the absolute position of the 
problems.

51
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,963
What is knowledge or how are the various
types of knowledge possible under the 

52
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,090
converging influence of a series of 
factors?

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,193
We're tending more and more today to 
regard knowledge as a process more than 

54
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:56,524
a state,
any being or object that science is to 

55
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,304
hold fast dissolves.
Once again in the current of 

56
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,214
development,
it is the last analysis of this 

57
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,590
development and of it alone that we have
the right to state it is a fact.

58
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,980
What we can and should then seek is the 
law of this process.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,113
Quotes.
We are well aware on the other hand of 

60
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,380
the fine book by Kuhn on scientific 
revolutions.

61
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,290
Now there is an awful lot of information
in that paragraph,

62
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,290
so we'll unpack it a little bit before 
we go on.

63
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,023
Now,
one way of looking at science is that 

64
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,530
it's a collection of fact,
right?

65
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,393
That's,
that's what piaget is stating to begin 

66
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:32,050
with.

67
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,883
And that was that we assume that the 
facts that science has gathered are 

68
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,940
facts and static,
but if you observe them across time,

69
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:40,774
what you find is that scientific facts 
tend to shift and transform because 

70
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,480
scientific theories that are applicable 
in one century,

71
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:47,314
let's say,
turn out to be less applicable than the 

72
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,744
next.
Now there's been a lot of argument and 

73
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:53,140
discussion about this,
um,

74
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,213
because the fact that facts change seems
to indicate that they're not so self 

75
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,604
evidently fact and there are people and 
perhaps coon would be among them who 

76
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:08,671
believed that science consisted of the 
juxtaposition of paradigms.

77
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,564
So those are sets of axioms within which
something operates and the paradigms he 

78
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:15,424
considered them often incommensurate you
couldn't move from one to another 

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,910
because the axioms were different.
There was no necessarily no what,

80
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,744
what might you say?
There was no necessary means of 

81
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:27,510
communication between them but,
and,

82
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,710
and,
and Piaget knew of Thomas Kuhn's work.

83
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,900
That's the scientist structure of 
scientific revolutions,

84
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:32,734
which was published in 1962 it's a 
classic text in the philosophy of 

85
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,850
science.
And,

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,720
and what piaget assumed more was more 
like a,

87
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,330
I would say more like a classic view of 
science where,

88
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,493
so for example,
when Newton came up with Newtonian 

89
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:48,334
physics,
there was a set of propositions upon 

90
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,220
which Newtonian physics was based.
And then when Einstein transformed those

91
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,950
propositions,
what happened was that Newtonian physics

92
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:01,951
became a subset of Einsteinian physics.
And so the way that piaget looked at the

93
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,650
development of factual ideas,
at least in part,

94
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,484
was that you'd come up with a set of 
ideas that were facts and then that 

95
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:11,460
would be superseded by a different 
theory within that,

96
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,320
within which that original theory would 
be nested.

97
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,440
And so that what happens that each 
theory in some sense,

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,513
although it transforms,
it becomes more complete as the 

99
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,810
scientific progression continues.

100
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,643
Now,
Kuhn didn't precisely believe that 

101
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:27,820
although exactly what Kuhn meant by a 
paradigm shift,

102
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,700
because Kuhn originated that term isn't 
clear,

103
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:31,534
but he didn't seem to actually believe 
that science had this capacity to 

104
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,493
present a series of facts and then alter
the underlying presuppositions and then 

105
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:41,770
to nest that within a broader series of 
facts.

106
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,604
Like you would assume if you were 
thinking about the relationship between 

107
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,333
Newton and Einstein.
So newtonian physics is a subset of 

108
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:51,430
Einsteinian physics.
So now that's kind of how Piaget thought

109
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:53,710
about how human beings develop 
knowledge.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,980
He believed that we came up with,
well,

111
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,790
let's say you want it to chop down a 
tree.

112
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,980
That might be a good example.
I mean,

113
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,460
you could use a a dull ax made of bronze
and it's like,

114
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,100
well that would chop down the tree.
It'd be a lot of work.

115
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,934
They'll,
and then maybe you replace that with a 

116
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:13,010
sharp steel ax that's designed like a 
wedge so that you can really hack down a

117
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:13,550
tree with it.

118
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,240
Or maybe you replace it with a saw.
And so the,

119
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,970
it's not like the bronze ax could chop 
down the tree,

120
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:23,390
but the steel ax can do a better job in 
this saw can do even a better job.

121
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,523
And so the way that Piaget thought about
the transformation of human knowledge 

122
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:31,400
structures from,
from infancy onward essentially was that

123
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,743
infants would produce a representation 
of the world that was sort of low 

124
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,540
resolution but quite tool like it would 
work in the world.

125
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,703
But then as they progressed,
the nature of those tools would become 

126
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,930
refined and sometimes transformed 
completely.

127
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,020
So some,
sometimes you imagine that a child would

128
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:48,854
use in a sense a low resolution picture 
of something and then they would 

129
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:55,280
increase its resolution as they filled 
in the details.

130
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,203
That would be a simulation.
That's the Piagetian notion of 

131
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,084
assimilation.
You're using the same basic theory but 

132
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,574
filling in the details and then now and 
then you'd have to switch to another 

133
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,060
picture entirely.

134
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,680
And that would be more like 
accommodation.

135
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,753
That's where you'd have to transform 
your internal structures completely in 

136
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,980
order to properly represent an act 
within the world.

137
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:16,370
And so that's the basic difference 
between accommodation and assimilation.

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,593
So assimilation is like micro 
alterations in accommodation is 

139
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,120
transformation of the knowledge 
structure itself.

140
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,193
And so that's part of,
so what Kuhn pointed out was that 

141
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,673
there'd be a set of facts and then 
there'd be an anomaly arise of some 

142
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,600
sorts of like at the end of the 19th 
century,

143
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,040
the only remaining and normally was at 
least one of the remaining anomalies was

144
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,570
that,
um,

145
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,800
no matter which direction you shine a 
light beam in and no matter how fast the

146
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,960
platform on which you're standing is 
moving,

147
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,210
the light beam has exactly the same 
velocity,

148
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:49,160
which seems impossible.
So you know,

149
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:49,994
if the earth is moving this way around 
the sun and you shine a light off the 

150
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,384
earth,
you'd expect the speed of light to be 

151
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,080
the speed of light plus the speed of the
earth.

152
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,913
And then if you shown it the other way,
than you'd expect the speed of light to 

153
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,570
be the speed of light minus the earth 
speed.

154
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:03,404
But that isn't what happens no matter 
how fast the platform on which the 

155
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,520
person shining,
the lightest standing,

156
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,160
the speed of light is always the same 
two every observer.

157
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,800
So,
and people kind of thought of that is,

158
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,860
that wasn't the only anomaly,
but that was one of them thought of that

159
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,694
is the only anomaly left in physics at 
the end of the 19th century and it 

160
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,560
turned out that was a bad one.
How long?

161
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:24,530
There was some other ones as well,
like the fact that light tends to behave

162
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:27,350
as a wave and a particle more or less at
the same time,

163
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:28,184
which doesn't seem possible.
So there's a couple of things left over 

164
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:33,170
in Newtonian physics that Newtonian 
physics couldn't explain,

165
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,110
but by the end of the 19th century there
were famous scientists saying,

166
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,490
yeah,
well we got this all wrapped up.

167
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,323
There's really nothing left to discover.
And then along came quantum mechanics 

168
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,894
and Einsteinian relativity and bang,
the whole world was like really 

169
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,034
different.
And quantum mechanics is much more 

170
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:51,530
comprehensive theory of the world then 
Newtonian physics,

171
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,190
all of the electronics you use wouldn't 
work if quantum physics wasn't correct.

172
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,423
Roughly speaking.
And so that little tiny anomaly blew 

173
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,803
into something that knocked the slats 
out underneath from underneath the 

174
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:05,190
entire axiomatic structure of Newtonian 
physics.

175
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,020
It showed it was wrong at its 
fundamental level,

176
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,790
even though it turned out to be a 
subset,

177
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,640
a correct subset of something that was 
much broader.

178
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:14,100
And so you can kind of think of that as 
that's what kids are doing.

179
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:14,934
As they progress,
they develop a theory that accounts for 

180
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,020
a certain set of,
you could say facts,

181
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,910
but it,
this is not a place it gets tricky.

182
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,880
And then they modify those and make them
more and more refined.

183
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,370
But now and then they have to undergo 
quite a transformation,

184
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:27,204
not be a stage transition in piaget.
Adyen thought that that's the stage 

185
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:31,644
transition idea and that would be a,
in some sense to Kuhnian scientific 

186
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,574
revolution.
Now what Piaget is trying to state here 

187
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,900
is that,
um,

188
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,300
because there's this weird problem with 
facts,

189
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:44,730
which is that they tend to transform 
across time.

190
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,713
You know,
like if you go take a biology course 

191
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:49,560
right now in 20 years,
pretty much everything you read,

192
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,423
you learned are very much of what you 
learned will turn out to have been 

193
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,124
wrong.
And that's kind of weird because it 

194
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,070
isn't wrong right now and you'd think,
well,

195
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,904
how can it be wrong in 20 years?
And that that's a really complicated 

196
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,860
problem.
And in order to solve that,

197
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,970
you kind of have to think about facts 
like tools instead of them as,

198
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:09,180
as thinking about them as our objective,
independent realities.

199
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:12,090
Because a bad tool can still work as a 
tool,

200
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,760
whereas a bad fact just kills your stone
dead.

201
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,570
And so payers,
anyways,

202
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,423
in any case,
that seems to be a completely 

203
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,110
unnecessary phenomena.

204
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,553
Okay.

205
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,350
Oh God,

206
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,373
yeah.

207
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,250
There's no,
no reason for that.

208
00:10:57,251 --> 00:11:00,190
That's just sheer spite as far as I can 
tell.

209
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,091
Okay,
so,

210
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:06,110
so here's one of Piaget's propositions 
and,

211
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,020
and it is that because facts flux in 
some sense across time,

212
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,263
you're looking for something that 
doesn't change across time to call it a 

213
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:15,844
real fact.
And so what Piaget is trying to point 

214
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:19,810
out in this,
let's call it introductory paragraph,

215
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:20,644
is that the one thing that doesn't 
change is the manner in which people 

216
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,970
generate facts rather than the facts 
themselves.

217
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,480
So the ultimate fact is a fact about the
way people generate fact.

218
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,930
All right?
And so piaget's theory and part is a,

219
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,900
is a theory about how knowledge is 
acquired and transformed.

220
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,123
And so it's not that not,
it's not a study of the knowledge 

221
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,180
itself,
it's a study of the process by which the

222
00:11:40,181 --> 00:11:41,014
knowledge is generated.
And he believed that that process was 

223
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,250
unchanging,
at least with regards to human beings.

224
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,083
And so you could think of the Piagetian 
genetic epistemological mystery as 

225
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:53,020
being,
how is it that people form and transform

226
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,560
of the world.
And one of his conclusions about that is

227
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:59,710
that there's a standard process.
And then the reason that I'm telling you

228
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:02,500
about piaget right now is because as far
as I can tell,

229
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,334
the standard [inaudible] description of 
the manner in which knowledge is 

230
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,994
acquired and transformed is the same 
thing that's represented in the 

231
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:11,770
mythology of the show.
Monic transformation,

232
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,690
which is that there's a state of being 
and then it's disrupted,

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,640
disrupted by something chaotic and 
there's a disintegration period.

234
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:21,550
And that's the space between the stage 
transitions for,

235
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,563
for children in which time they're often
upset because their little theory about 

236
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:27,220
the world isn't learning isn't working 
anymore.

237
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,533
And then in that chaotic period,
they adjust themselves to new anomalies 

238
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,794
and anomalies are what occur when you 
act in the world and what you want to 

239
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:37,390
happen doesn't happen,
right?

240
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,760
Because that means there's something 
wrong with your knowledge structure.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,210
If you act and then something happens,
you don't want to happen.

242
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,460
Something's wrong with the way you're 
representing the world.

243
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,380
Or You could say something's wrong with 
the world,

244
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,360
but good luck with that.
Although,

245
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,194
you know,
people can modify the world as well as 

246
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:54,310
modifying their belief structures and 
people do that a lot.

247
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,773
But so this,
the PPF git and stage transition as far 

248
00:12:58,991 --> 00:12:59,824
as I can tell,
is a micro case of the broader idea of 

249
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,033
the existence of an orderly state.
It's dissolution into a chaotic state 

250
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:08,200
because something unexpected has 
occurred.

251
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,950
And then it's re transformation into a 
more integrated state.

252
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,750
Now Piaget would say,
well,

253
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,763
the initial state and the chaotic state 
and the final state aren't the ultimate 

254
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,424
realities.
The ultimate reality is the process of 

255
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:24,070
moving through those stages.
And that's how people acquire knowledge.

256
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,140
And that's,
you could say that's the central element

257
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:27,850
of human beings.
And I would say that's a,

258
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,983
that's another re representation of the 
hero myth that because the hero is the 

259
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,580
person who notes anomaly,
note something that's changed.

260
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,410
It's outside of explored territory in 
counters.

261
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,080
It defeats it,
let's say,

262
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,520
or get something of value from it and 
then recasts it into the world,

263
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,920
shares it with the community,
restructures the world.

264
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,910
And so that's the central story.
It's,

265
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,090
it's not the central story of human 
beings,

266
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:52,924
but it's,
it's close enough for our purposes at 

267
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,260
the moment.
So,

268
00:13:56,261 --> 00:13:57,910
okay,
so that's what piaget is about.

269
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,320
How to human beings encounter the world 
and,

270
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,420
and what happens when they do that?
Now the thing about the world for piaget

271
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:08,980
is it's also a complicated place.
It's not exactly the set of,

272
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,173
it's not the set of all objective facts 
that remain to be discovered because 

273
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,170
piaget is a constructivist and he's more
of a pragmatist than he is.

274
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,220
Precisely a scientific realist.
And so that's a complicated thing.

275
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,690
Very,
very complicated thing.

276
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,710
I don't know if any of you,
and maybe this is completely irrelevant,

277
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:29,320
I don't know if any of you listened to 
my argument with Sam Harris,

278
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:30,154
but Sam Harris is a scientific realist 
and I was trying to make at least in 

279
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,740
part a p is Yeti and point,
but he was having none of that,

280
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,270
that's for sure.
But,

281
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,420
um,
but piaget makes the point and so,

282
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,610
you know,
I'm going to let him speak in some sense

283
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:44,990
as we proceed through this and,
and uh,

284
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,320
well you'll see why he does what he 
does.

285
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:48,723
So if all knowledge is always in a state
of development and proceeding from one 

286
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,870
state
to a more complete and efficient one,

287
00:14:56,871 --> 00:14:59,600
so that,
that implies a hierarchy of states,

288
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,434
right,
that you move from one knowledge 

289
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,784
structure to the next one,
which includes the previous one and is 

290
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:04,940
better.

291
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,130
And it's better because it covers more 
territory.

292
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,500
That's how you know it's better.
It does the same thing.

293
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:12,050
The old tool does plus some additional 
things.

294
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,033
So it's a definition of better,
it's a good thing to have a definition 

295
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:16,274
of better and worse if all knowledge is 
always in a state of development and 

296
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:22,340
consists in proceeding from one state to
a more complete deficient one.

297
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,413
Evidently it is a question of knowing 
this development and analyzing it with 

298
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,194
the greatest possible accuracy,
which is something I happen to agree 

299
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:30,704
with.
But that's partly because I read Piaget 

300
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,654
and,
and I think I understand what he meant 

301
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:34,634
and he's,
he's quite the thinker and so I'm going 

302
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:40,040
to see if I can pull you in a little bit
about this because it's,

303
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,701
it's,
well,

304
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:42,230
it's exceedingly complex.
You know,

305
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:44,240
and most of the time when people talk 
about piaget,

306
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,160
they just talk about his surface 
experiments.

307
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
They don't talk about what he was 
actually up to.

308
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:48,754
And what he was up to was while he was 
trying to figure out how people 

309
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,860
represent the world and learned.
And that's not only,

310
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:55,970
it's not only that,
you know,

311
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,040
this is another thing people don't know 
about piaget,

312
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:03,041
is that he was trying to reconcile the 
chasm between science and values.

313
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,510
That's what drove him through his entire
intellectual life.

314
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,450
He was attempting to bridge the gap 
between science and religion.

315
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,880
That's another way of thinking about it.
And that was explicit.

316
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:13,100
He knew that that's why he did 
everything he did.

317
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,440
And so the thing that's so cool about 
piaget,

318
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,573
I think is that he actually started to 
provide what you might think about as a 

319
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,390
rational basis for morality.
It's not exactly rational.

320
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:27,320
That's the thing because it's rational,
rational belief,

321
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,183
like scientific realism has a certain 
set of presuppositions at its core and 

322
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:35,060
piaget doesn't use those presuppositions
to solve the problem.

323
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,163
The problem is so deep,
the the gap between what is and what 

324
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:41,450
ought to be.
That's the David Hume's problem.

325
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:42,284
You can't derive an ought from an is 
just because you know a bunch of things 

326
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:48,950
doesn't give you an unerring guide to 
know what to do about those things.

327
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,933
There's a gap there.
And Harris and people like him say that 

328
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,610
gap is illusory.
But most philosophers,

329
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,890
including David Hume,
including piaget,

330
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,210
these are heavy duty people,
including heidegger would,

331
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,020
would disagree with that.
They don't believe that,

332
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,660
that,
that that gap is nonexistent.

333
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,690
And,
and,

334
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,770
and Harris believes that you can nest 
values within science.

335
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:10,604
And,
and that's the proposition that he 

336
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,900
continually puts forward,
like most of the so called new atheists.

337
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,440
But it's a hell of a lot more difficult 
to do than you think that's for sure.

338
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,910
And so,
anyway,

339
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:23,330
so how is Piaget proporting to manage 
this?

340
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,390
Well,
one thing he does is he,

341
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,403
for piaget,
it's really important that you have a 

342
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,920
body.
And that's one of the things that's very

343
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:33,530
cool about his thinking.
So you could think about him as an early

344
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:38,450
exponent of embodied cognition.
It's like he's not exactly a Cartesian,

345
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,373
a follower of descartes.
He doesn't really believe that you have 

346
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:43,820
a spirit or say a rational mind that is 
in some sense,

347
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,654
separate from your body,
which has an implicit presupposition of 

348
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:48,310
a lot of,
a lot of,

349
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,760
uh,
philosophical claims.

350
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,773
Piaget really sticks you in your body.
And the other thing that Piaget claims 

351
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,614
is that your abstract knowledge is 
actually determined by the structure of 

352
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:02,340
your body and that it unfolds from your 
body up into abstraction.

353
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,070
And that's what happens as infants 
transform into adults.

354
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,350
First of all,
almost all their knowledge is embodied.

355
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,210
And what that means is that it's not.

356
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,793
Look,
there's a couple of different kinds of 

357
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,370
memory like the most,
the most

358
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,500
fundamental distinction you might think 
of is between procedural representation,

359
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,190
procedural memory,
and and representational memory.

360
00:18:23,191 --> 00:18:24,024
So when you remember your past,
that little movie that runs in your 

361
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,604
head,
or maybe the facts that you can recite 

362
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:30,060
about your past,
that's episodic memory,

363
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,840
that's representational,
but procedural memories,

364
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,920
different procedural memories,
how you walk,

365
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,350
you don't know how you walk.
That's how you ride a bike.

366
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,210
It's how you play the piano.
It's how you type.

367
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,040
So it's,
it's automatic,

368
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,440
right?
It's built into your nervous system.

369
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,274
It's built into the nerves that 
innervate your musculature and they're 

370
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,000
completely separate memory systems.
Now one can represent the other,

371
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:51,834
which is interesting.
The representational system can 

372
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:57,060
represent the output of the body,
which is basically what you happen.

373
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,073
What happens when someone tells a story,
even when you tell a story about your 

374
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,284
own life.

375
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,720
But the contents of procedural memory,
uh,

376
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,633
proceed the contents of representational
memory and they're shaped in different 

377
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:10,410
ways.
So for example,

378
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,333
part of the wisdom that's encoded in 
your body is there because of things 

379
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,904
you've practiced.
But it's also there because you've 

380
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:18,180
practiced things in his social 
environment.

381
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,283
And so while you practice those things,
the effect of the social environment 

382
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:22,974
shaped the way you learned it.
And that's encoded right in your 

383
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:27,600
neurons.
It's not representational,

384
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,523
it's encoded in the way you do things.
It's encoded in the way you smile when 

385
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:33,990
you look at someone or frown or when you
do that.

386
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,110
And that's all implicit.
It's not under your conscious control.

387
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:37,944
It's not even in that system.
And so piaget figured this out and so 

388
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:41,664
one of the things he said was that you 
start as an infant by building your 

389
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:47,370
procedural memory,
not your representational memory.

390
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,370
That's partly perhaps why you can't 
remember your infancy.

391
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,430
You don't actually don't have that kind 
of representational memory there.

392
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,370
What you do is you act,
you learn to act,

393
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:57,204
you build your body so that it can move.
And you do that partly by experimenting 

394
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,404
with your own body.
But you also do that by experimenting 

395
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:03,984
with your body in a context that's 
shaped from the beginning by the 

396
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,300
presence of other people.
So for example,

397
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,040
you know a child learns how to 
breastfeed.

398
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,440
It's mouth is pretty wired up right at 
birth.

399
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,303
Hey,
and the rest of its body isn't wired up 

400
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,330
very much at all,
but its mouth is and you might think,

401
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:19,164
well that's just a reflex that piaget 
would agree with that it's a builtin is 

402
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,980
something built in that that a baby can 
do right at birth.

403
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,880
But even in the act of breastfeeding,
the baby has to learn how to modify that

404
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:33,690
reflex so that it gets along with its 
mother.

405
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
So even at the very beginning with the 
most,

406
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,340
you might think the most primordial 
acts,

407
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,290
there's a sociological and influence and
there's a mutual dynamic going on that's

408
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,490
really,
really important.

409
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,500
It's really important.
And so in some sense for piaget,

410
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:48,334
the structure of society is implicitly 
built into the structure of the 

411
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:55,300
procedural memory system.
And so one of the things you might think

412
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:58,150
about that,
and Piaget makes much of this because he

413
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,090
looks at the relationship between play 
and dreams and imitation.

414
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,193
So he's kind of a quasi psychoanalyst.
One of the things that means is that 

415
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:06,820
coded in your behavior,

416
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,080
coded in your behavior
is,

417
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,860
is this is the social structure in which
you emerged.

418
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,440
And it's coded in a way that you don't 
actually understand.

419
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,910
You just know how to act and then you 
can figure out how you're acting and you

420
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,250
can extract out of that some of the 
social rules.

421
00:21:27,251 --> 00:21:28,630
But you don't,
you don't,

422
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,640
that doesn't mean that you know the 
rules.

423
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,620
It meant that the rules were built into 
you.

424
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,440
Here's the way of thinking about it.
Like a wolf pack,

425
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,200
Wolfpack knows how to operate together,
knows how to hunt,

426
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,093
right?
And each wolf knows where every other 

427
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,790
wolf is in the dominance hierarchy,
but they don't know.

428
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,160
They know that they don't have rules,
right?

429
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,290
They don't have a code.
They don't have laws.

430
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,690
What they have is behavioral 
regularities,

431
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:53,590
patterned behavioral regularities.
And those are like a morality.

432
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,551
They're very,
very,

433
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,020
in fact,
that's exactly what they are.

434
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,640
A dominance hierarchy of animals that 
aren't representational,

435
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:01,900
you know,
that don't have language.

436
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,763
At least they don't have language.
The dominance hierarchy is a kind of 

437
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,340
morality.
It's a way of,

438
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,983
it's a way of setting up individual 
behavior within a social context to 

439
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,760
maximize cooperation and minimize 
competition and so on.

440
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,460
And so piaget would say that,
you know,

441
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,700
the origin of [inaudible] and Frans de 
Waal,

442
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:20,980
who's a great primatologist by the way,
Frenz F,

443
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:21,401
R,
a,

444
00:22:21,401 --> 00:22:22,031
n,
s,

445
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:22,930
d,
d,W ,

446
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,940
a,
l,

447
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,300
he's written a lot of books about the 
emergence of morality and chimpanzees in

448
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:29,260
particular.
And you know,

449
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,094
he follows the same line of logic.
It's that the morality emerges out of 

450
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,544
the interaction between the chimpanzees 
and it's bounded by the necessity that 

451
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,060
the actions take certain forms.
So for example,

452
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,360
if the chimpanzees act in a way that 
each of them kills everyone else,

453
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,740
it's like that's the end of it.

454
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,753
It's the end of the game.
So that's not a very functional 

455
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,440
morality.
It's,

456
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,120
it doesn't produce survival of the 
individuals.

457
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,130
It doesn't produce flourishing of the 
individuals.

458
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:57,880
Certainly it produces extinction of the 
individuals and the death of the group.

459
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,650
So as far as dwell would be concerned 
from an evolutionary perspective,

460
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,870
that sort of mode of interacting is a 
dead end.

461
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,890
And so one of Piaget's claims implicit 
claims is that,

462
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,990
and this is one of the things that's so 
brilliant about piaget is that,

463
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,230
um,
the interactions between people,

464
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:18,064
the social interactions between people 
necessarily emerge within a kind of 

465
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:25,330
bounded space.
And this space is the space of the game.

466
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,040
So we're always playing games always.
And a game,

467
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:30,874
you might think about a game as a 
microcosm of the world and a small 

468
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,420
child's game is a tiny fraction of a 
microcosm of the world.

469
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,253
But then you get up into adult games and
you could think about those maybe as 

470
00:23:41,081 --> 00:23:43,780
multiplayer online games.
That's one good representation.

471
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,400
But even more sophisticated things like 
being a lawyer,

472
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:49,190
say or like working at Mcdonald's or any
of those things.

473
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,203
Those are also forms of game and,
and that P and people negotiate the 

474
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,160
rules and that game is nested inside 
sets of broader games.

475
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,220
And so for Piaget,
the game,

476
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,623
the chill,
the games that children play kind of 

477
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,760
transform inexhaustibly and,
and,

478
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,160
and what incrementally into the games 
that adults play.

479
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,253
And,
and a game that's playable as an adult 

480
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,000
is a functional game.
It's an acceptable game.

481
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,834
And one of Piaget's claims is that not 
only do people start playing games 

482
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,694
unconsciously in a sense and implicitly,
but then they start to play games more 

483
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:27,620
consciously.
They actually,

484
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,810
they actually represent the games to 
some degree,

485
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:30,950
at least in their actions.

486
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,770
Then they start to learn the explicit 
rules of the game,

487
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,320
but only later after they know how to 
play it.

488
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,050
And then at the highest stage of moral 
development,

489
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:43,610
they start to realize that not only are 
they players of games and followers of a

490
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:46,820
rules,
but they're also producers of rules.

491
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,013
So it start,
you start out not being able to play a 

492
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:51,920
game at all,
then you can play a game with yourself.

493
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,050
Then you can play a game with a few 
other people.

494
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,160
Then you can play rule governed games 
with lots of people and then you realize

495
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,590
that you make the rules and you can make
new games.

496
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,830
And that's the highest level of moral 
development according to piaget.

497
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,330
It's very,
it's brilliant.

498
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:06,770
It's,
it's bloody brilliant.

499
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,663
He's the first person that I ever really
encountered who was able to put the 

500
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:13,160
notion of an emergent morality on 
something,

501
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,790
you know,
broadly commensurate with the scientific

502
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:17,420
perspective.

503
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,820
But you have to understand that in order
to do that,

504
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:23,300
he had to sacrifice a little bit of his 
notions of scientific realism.

505
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,220
And that's what basic sigma 
constructivist.

506
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,343
And so,
and so we're going back to 

507
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:30,380
constructivism.
So he says at the beginning,

508
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:32,270
and this is the beginning of the 
development of knowledge,

509
00:25:32,271 --> 00:25:34,580
just not unfold itself as a matter of 
chance,

510
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,630
but forms of development.
So we said there's not only do knowledge

511
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:42,230
structures change across time and 
they're embedded in the social world,

512
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,064
but the manner in which they change 
across time actually has a bit of a 

513
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:46,094
structure.
And so that would be the Piagetian 

514
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:49,280
stages of development.
Just so you know,

515
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,114
now,
people have debated ever since piaget 

516
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,110
proposed this,
if,

517
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,780
if those developmental stages are fixed 
and necessary,

518
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,360
and if he identified them properly and 
even,

519
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:02,030
and as well,
whether or not they could be sped up,

520
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,220
which he always called the American 
problem,

521
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,470
could you speed up these stages of 
development?

522
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:10,190
And there's a lot of argument about 
whether those stages exist in the manner

523
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:12,650
that piaget described are and whether 
they're fixed it,

524
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,484
all of that.
But that's still the fundamental 

525
00:26:14,961 --> 00:26:15,794
elements of,
is the fundamental element of his 

526
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:18,480
theory.
Um,

527
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,130
so,
and in,

528
00:26:21,131 --> 00:26:21,964
in suits,
the cognitive domain has an absolute 

529
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,130
beginning,
which means you were,

530
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:27,110
you're here now,
but at one point you weren't.

531
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:30,200
So there was an absolute beginning to,
to you as a phenomena,

532
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,770
it's to be studied at the very stages,
gnawing,

533
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,613
known as formation.
That's his rationalization for being a 

534
00:26:35,391 --> 00:26:36,890
genetic epistemologist,
right.

535
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:40,370
Someone who studies the formation of 
knowledge structures across time like an

536
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:42,020
embryologist,
someone like that,

537
00:26:42,021 --> 00:26:43,800
right,
who developmental embryologist,

538
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
the first name of genetic epistemology 
is therefore if one can say so to take 

539
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:51,930
psychology seriously and to furnish 
verifications to any question which each

540
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:52,764
epistemology necessarily raises yet 
replacing the generally unsatisfying 

541
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:56,994
speculative or implicit psychology with 
controllable analysis and so basically 

542
00:27:00,181 --> 00:27:04,950
what he's saying there is that you can 
guess at his stance like Freud did about

543
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:06,210
developmental psychology.

544
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,043
Freud kind of projected backwards from 
his patients into the dim mist of 

545
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:10,974
childhood and came up with like what 
would a hypothetical developmental 

546
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,480
sequence and Piaget said,
well,

547
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:16,314
we're not going to do that.
We're going to go run experiments on 

548
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:19,740
kids,
often individuals,

549
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,290
but sometimes multiple individuals.
We're going to,

550
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,630
we're going to observe exactly what 
they're doing.

551
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,000
He watched his kids in their cribs for 
example,

552
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,834
unbelievably intently and with great,
he was like an ethos logist which is a 

553
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,100
person who studies animal behavior 
observationally like Frans to wall.

554
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,173
He was like an ethos adjust of children,
not exactly an experimental 

555
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:39,744
psychologist,
although also an experimental 

556
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,024
psychologist and he more or less 
established the field of developmental 

557
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:46,230
psychology.
So he said,

558
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,064
well let's empirically analyze how 
children learn and then maybe we can 

559
00:27:50,011 --> 00:27:53,340
figure out how this knowledge process 
unfolds and we don't have to guess about

560
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:53,430
it.

561
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,710
We can,
we can use controllable analysis.

562
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:56,544
And so you could say he introduced 
scientific methodology even though he 

563
00:27:59,281 --> 00:28:00,114
wasn't a scientific realist,
he introduced scientific methodology 

564
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,234
into the study of child development,
but more importantly into the study of 

565
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:07,950
how knowledge structures unfold across 
time.

566
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,323
So he was a philosopher as well,
but a strange type of philosopher 

567
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:15,960
because he was interested in how 
philosophy itself emerges in the mind of

568
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,570
the child.
And so that's what piaget was up to.

569
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,404
And so quite quite remarkable.
And he had credibly wide range of 

570
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:26,430
interests be fitting someone who 
probably had an Iq of like 190 I mean he

571
00:28:26,431 --> 00:28:28,890
was seriously smart guy,
like way,

572
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:29,724
way outside of the normal range.
And so this is the sort of questions he 

573
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,960
was trying to answer.
Well,

574
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:34,794
how do you,
on what you base your judgments because 

575
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:38,820
you make judgments about things better 
or worse.

576
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,870
Say,
well,

577
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,060
how,
how,

578
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,770
how do you come up with that ability?
How does that emerge?

579
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,500
And on what basis do you make the 
judgments?

580
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,673
Um,
there's a famous ruling on pornography 

581
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,394
that I believe the Supreme Court of the 
United States laid down and one of the 

582
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:54,264
justices wrote something that's become 
infamous or famous depending on how you 

583
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:57,931
look at.
He said,

584
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:59,340
well,
I can't define pornography,

585
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:01,620
but I know it when I see it.
And,

586
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,823
and that's,
that's a notion of the incomplete 

587
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:05,634
ability of the representational system 
to represent the contents of implicit 

588
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,940
perception or the or the procedural 
system.

589
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,100
You can know that you know something but
you,

590
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,700
that doesn't mean you can describe why 
it doesn't mean you can describe how you

591
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:20,310
know it and you don't.
How do you focus your eyes?

592
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,260
Like you don't know how you focus your 
eyes.

593
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,940
You just focus them,
you know,

594
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,370
how do you smile like this?

595
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,660
Well,
maybe less ugly,

596
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,470
but you know,
you can't describe how you do it.

597
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,304
You can't describe the musculature.
You can represent the output of the act 

598
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,503
and you can do it,
but you can't represent it and you're 

599
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:42,670
just stuffed full of skills like that.
Which is another example of the way that

600
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:45,370
you're way more complicated than your 
understanding of you.

601
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:46,763
You know,
one of the things people often ask is 

602
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,920
how can we use the rat has a model of a 
person cause like,

603
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,790
you know,
a rats,

604
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,190
not much of a person depending of course
on the person.

605
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,730
But the real answer to that is,
well,

606
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,390
compared to what?
Like compared to your understanding of a

607
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:04,300
person,
a rat is an excellent model of a person.

608
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,110
So it's not as good a model of a person 
as a person is.

609
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:12,880
But compared to imagination,
let's say it's in comparatively better.

610
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,680
And you know,
that's because we share like,

611
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,880
I dunno what,
98% of our genes or some damn thing with

612
00:30:18,881 --> 00:30:19,810
rats,
it's like,

613
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,703
it's really up.
I think we share 90% of our genes with 

614
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,820
yeast for God's sake,
you know?

615
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,970
And so we're a lot more rat lake than 
yeast.

616
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,813
Like so.
And I think with chimps it's over 99% 

617
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:32,650
you know,
so it's not a bad model.

618
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:33,484
Obviously it's not perfect,
but it always depends on what you 

619
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,760
compare it to.
You know,

620
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,040
when you hear animal rights activists 
say things like,

621
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:39,874
well,
we can replace that with computer 

622
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:41,830
simulations.
It's like,

623
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:44,560
no,
we can't because you can't simulate what

624
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:47,020
you don't know or at least not very 
well.

625
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,340
So that's a silly idea.
You know,

626
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,193
even though they have a point,
it's not so great to torture animals to 

627
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:55,000
death and all that.
But what are his norms?

628
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,350
Well,
that's a good question.

629
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:00,010
Where do norms for behavior come from?
You have norms when they're violated,

630
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:02,170
it annoys you.
It doesn't mean you know what your norms

631
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,004
are,
but you do kind of get a sense of what 

632
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:07,210
they are when they get violated.
That really upset me.

633
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,320
Well,
what does that mean?

634
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,460
Well,
you don't really know.

635
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:10,294
You might have to think about that for 
like six months while you got so upset 

636
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,370
about that.
But you can notice that you got upset.

637
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,310
And that means that you do have 
expectations and norms,

638
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,350
let's say.
But you don't know where they came from.

639
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,860
Now obviously in part they came from 
your intrinsic structure,

640
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:24,694
but also a,
there are a consequence of your 

641
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:27,850
learning,
but even more importantly,

642
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:30,700
there are consequence of your learning 
in a social environment.

643
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,713
So all of those phenomena which exceed 
your comprehension determine the nature 

644
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:36,844
of your norms.
And often you only detect them when 

645
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,034
they're violated.
So because why bother paying attention 

646
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,420
to something that works?
You just don't.

647
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
No one does.
They take it for granted.

648
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,910
It's almost the definition of something 
working.

649
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,840
It's like,
you know,

650
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:54,190
you think I'm driving my car to school 
and you think you're in a car,

651
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:55,024
but you're very naughty in a car.
You're in a thing that gets you from 

652
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:01,150
home to school and you can pretend that 
that is so annoying.

653
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,550
You can pretend that.

654
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,530
So you might think,
well,

655
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:22,940
the thing that's I'm,
I'm in,

656
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,953
is it,
it's kind of a weird example is this is 

657
00:32:25,251 --> 00:32:28,970
this object with objective qualities 
that you call a car,

658
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,043
but,
but that isn't exactly how you actually 

659
00:32:31,431 --> 00:32:34,130
perceive or act towards it.
What happens is,

660
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:36,530
is that as long as it's doing what it's 
supposed to do,

661
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,950
which means that its function is intact,
not what it is,

662
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:43,100
but it's function,
then you can use a really low resolution

663
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,190
representation of the thing.
The car is just what gets you from point

664
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,630
a to point B,
right?

665
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:50,540
And so the fact that you don't 
understand the damn thing at all,

666
00:32:50,541 --> 00:32:52,970
it's completely invisible to you,
but it isn't.

667
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,800
When it quits,
as soon as it quits,

668
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:57,140
it becomes a car.
It's like bang car.

669
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,240
Oh my God,
I don't understand this thing at all.

670
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,380
Now what do I do?

671
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,850
Well,
you panic a little bit,

672
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:03,080
right?
Because,

673
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,820
well,
what do you know about your car?

674
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,020
Nothing.
Nothing.

675
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,180
Nothing at all.
And worse than that,

676
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:09,014
now the car is become the intersection 
between you and whoever's going to fix 

677
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:13,754
your card.
So that introduces a whole bunch of 

678
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:17,690
human elements into it.
Like are they going to figure out what's

679
00:33:17,691 --> 00:33:19,200
wrong with it?
Are they going to rip you off?

680
00:33:19,201 --> 00:33:22,220
Is your car ever going to work again?
Are you going to get to work?

681
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:23,054
What's going to happen tonight?
So all of a sudden that thing that you 

682
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:27,980
were in that was a car turns into this 
massive,

683
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:31,250
complex,
unbelievably complicated thing.

684
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,060
And that's actually what it is.
Your initial representation of it.

685
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:39,890
It's like it's really low resolution.
It's like one bit and then bang,

686
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:42,770
it breaks down and Poof,
complexity,

687
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,930
complexity,
complexity everywhere.

688
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,930
And that complexity,
that's what the world's made out.

689
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,763
If you remember we talked about William 
James in that crazy nitrous oxide 

690
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:56,840
induced pseudo tippy poetry that he was 
writing in the 1890s when he was talking

691
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:57,674
about chaos.
Well that chaos that he was talking 

692
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,120
about,
out of which order emerges,

693
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,750
that's the same thing as that complexity
that's hovering in the background.

694
00:34:05,751 --> 00:34:09,380
And children have to operate in a world 
that's actually that complex.

695
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,360
But they're not smart enough and neither
are you.

696
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,373
So they build partial representations 
that sort of work and the parents 

697
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:18,640
scaffold them.
So the way children manage this,

698
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,450
like children,
they don't know anything but stay.

699
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:22,280
They're still alive.
So what's up with that?

700
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,593
You know,
part of it is the child is laying out 

701
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,533
one of its procedures in the world in 
accordance with its understanding and 

702
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:31,700
something goes wrong.
What does the child do?

703
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,010
Cries,
right?

704
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,420
It,
it defaults.

705
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:37,300
It defaults to this distress cry.

706
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,133
And what happens is the adults move in 
with their superior skills and their 

707
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,313
enhanced understanding and they mediate 
between the partial knowledge of the 

708
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:49,130
child and the actual complex world.
And without the child.

709
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,220
That's why if you take your child to the
mall and just leave,

710
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:53,263
you know,
it doesn't take very long for them to 

711
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:55,490
get really,
really,

712
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:57,080
really,
really upset,

713
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,820
you know,
depending on the child,

714
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,670
some of them almost instantaneously,
you know,

715
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,550
one day I was in the Boston airport with
my daughter,

716
00:35:04,551 --> 00:35:06,860
she was about three and three and a half
maybe.

717
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:07,694
And my son,
he was about two and we were there to 

718
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:10,910
pick someone.
I was just packed.

719
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,860
And so I had them by the hand,
you know,

720
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,170
and uh,
I told my daughter a bunch,

721
00:35:15,171 --> 00:35:16,004
if she ever got separated from me in a 
crowd just to sit down immediately 

722
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,230
wherever she was or as close there by 
it,

723
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,740
I would find her don't move well.

724
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,210
Somehow I got separated from them and I 
look behind them and they weren't there.

725
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:30,044
And I found out later she followed 
someone else who looked like me from 

726
00:35:32,661 --> 00:35:34,460
behind.
And she,

727
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:36,410
I found her in about three minutes,
you know,

728
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,190
which is a long time man,
if you're three years old at an airport,

729
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,790
she was sitting there like paralyzed,
you know,

730
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,923
butter is,
her brother was with her and he didn't 

731
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,650
care at all.
And the reason he didn't care is because

732
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,720
as far as he was concerned,
she was an adult.

733
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,280
But as far as she was concerned,
she was an abandoned kid in an airport.

734
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,050
You know,
it was very hard on her.

735
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:56,610
And it's because the,
you know,

736
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,444
she was protected from the complexity by
her primordial representations in my 

737
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,900
presence.
But as soon as my presence disappeared,

738
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:06,900
the complexity came flooding back and 
just overwhelmed her.

739
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,980
And that's chaos and uncertainty.
And then she'd cry and the cry says,

740
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,230
help I motive by league,
I'm drowning,

741
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm drowning,
you know,

742
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,593
intervene.
And so that's how kids in part can get 

743
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:20,320
along in the world with their incomplete
knowledge representation.

744
00:36:20,321 --> 00:36:23,460
So always also how you get along in the 
world because you're,

745
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,294
it's incomplete beyond belief,
but you got all these other people 

746
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:29,550
around you in the whole damn society 
filling in the gaps.

747
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,610
And so you walk around like you're doing
what you're doing,

748
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:33,530
but you don't.
Yeah,

749
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,580
you just hardly know it all.
You know,

750
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,040
if you can fit into that system,
great,

751
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,310
you've got it on your side and you can 
use it to fill the gaps.

752
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,443
That's also partly why people are so 
concerned with maintaining their social 

753
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,770
identity,
like the real identity.

754
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,600
I'm not talking about some surface 
identity,

755
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:49,434
but you see,
because you have set up a set of 

756
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:56,940
expectations and desires about how you 
want the world to unfold,

757
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,133
and you do that within a social context 
and as long as your desires and the 

758
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,090
actions of the community match,
which means you're at home,

759
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,490
roughly speaking,
as long as they match,

760
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,650
you stay emotionally regulated.

761
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,590
You like that.
That's why you can stay calm in here.

762
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:17,550
It's like your desires are being played 
out by everyone else because one of your

763
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:18,384
desires is that none of these crazy 
primates starts brandishing a knife for 

764
00:37:21,121 --> 00:37:24,150
example,
or even twitching or any of that sort of

765
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:26,340
thing.
You don't want any of that.

766
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,743
And if it starts happening,
it's like you get wary very quickly and 

767
00:37:30,691 --> 00:37:33,210
maybe you look and maybe you won't and 
maybe you'll freeze.

768
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,760
Maybe you'll get the hell out of there.
Maybe you'll get aggressive,

769
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,150
but that match has to maintain itself 
intact.

770
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,340
Or your entire nervous system gets 
dysregulated.

771
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,520
And the reason for that is that as soon 
as that matches disrupted,

772
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,120
the underlying complexity and chaos of 
the world reveals itself.

773
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:53,040
And so does your inadequacy and then 
your body defaults into Predator mode.

774
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:53,874
And,
and the fact that you don't know 

775
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,094
anything and that everything is really 
complicated becomes very evident to you 

776
00:37:58,681 --> 00:37:59,514
very quickly.

777
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,533
And people hate that.
It's the worst thing that can happen to 

778
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:05,700
them,
the bottom falling out of their world.

779
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,043
And so that happens more when your 
fundamental presumptions about things 

780
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,434
are are challenged.
And then you have to solve the problem 

781
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:15,510
of what constitutes a fundamental 
presupposition.

782
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,433
You know,
how do you know which presupposition is 

783
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,523
peripheral in which one central?
And you can tell in part because the 

784
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:26,700
more upset you get about something,
the more central it is that that thing's

785
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,740
about to your entire structure of 
belief.

786
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,753
And that's one way of getting into that 
unconscious structure of bleed from a 

787
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:34,740
psychoanalytic perspective.
So one of the things that happens to me,

788
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:35,574
for example,
as a therapist has all be talking to my 

789
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:38,224
clients and they'll be talking about 
something difficult and all of a sudden 

790
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:42,350
they'll cry and they often don't know 
why.

791
00:38:42,351 --> 00:38:43,660
And so I stopped them right there.

792
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,670
It's like something went through your 
mind,

793
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,683
something happened.
And the cry indicates that you've moved 

794
00:38:49,601 --> 00:38:50,434
beyond your domain of competence out 
into the unknown world all of a sudden 

795
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,330
into chaos.
What's that chaos,

796
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,820
what exactly happened?
And people,

797
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,973
you know,
they're usually embarrassed that they 

798
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:01,660
cry,
but often they can remember what flitted

799
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:03,550
through their mind and it's a 
represented,

800
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,593
it's a,
it's some encounter with the chaos 

801
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:09,670
beyond their conceptual systems that 
produces that emotional response.

802
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,590
And then we can dig into that.
Find Out,

803
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:12,490
oh,
that's a trauma.

804
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,500
Especially if it's more than a year and 
a half old.

805
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:17,710
And those can be a various depths and 
profundity,

806
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,080
you know,
sometimes they're so bad that the person

807
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:23,290
just breaks down completely and they 
never put themselves together.

808
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,343
You know,
that's when something's just wall up to 

809
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:27,520
you.
It's hit you right at the bottom of your

810
00:39:27,521 --> 00:39:29,170
axiomatic structure,
so to speak,

811
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:30,004
right at the trunk.

812
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,510
But when you're doing therapy with 
people and you watch how they respond to

813
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,353
emotionally,
you look for those tiny eruptions of 

814
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:36,394
negative emotion.
And those are like holes in their 

815
00:39:38,111 --> 00:39:38,944
conceptual structure.
And those have to be sewed up by their 

816
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:43,660
man.
You in the process of dialogue,

817
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,830
you figure out,
okay,

818
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:48,250
there was a bit of unexplored territory 
there that manifested itself.

819
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,353
It produced an emotional response in you
that indicates that you've reverted in 

820
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:52,924
some sense to childhood.
That would be the Friday and 

821
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,443
interpretation.
Now we have to figure out what it was 

822
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:00,340
that it's in that whole what caused that
tear.

823
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,353
And then we have to go back and 
articulate it and analyze it and study 

824
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,444
it until we can sew it up and then and 
our t and and get to the gist of it to 

825
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:08,794
make it into a adaptive story.
And then you can leave it behind and it 

826
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:15,310
actually produces neurological 
transformation as you do that.

827
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,143
The memories in some sense actually 
moved their psychophysiological 

828
00:40:19,121 --> 00:40:19,954
location.
You could say their location in your 

829
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,044
psyche,
but you can also note that the brain 

830
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:27,970
systems that are handling the memories 
aren't the same.

831
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,583
So they're much more limbic,
they're way lower and closer to the 

832
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:33,940
emotional centers when it's still raw 
trauma.

833
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:34,774
And by the time it's fully articulated,
it's more represented in an articulated 

834
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:39,640
story,
a causal story.

835
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,833
And that's partly why writing about 
emotional events actually helps you 

836
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,160
overcome them.
So,

837
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,630
and it's possible that writing about how
it is that you overcome emotional events

838
00:40:49,631 --> 00:40:53,200
in general is actually the best kind of 
therapy right now.

839
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,093
How do you solve a particular problem?
But how is it that you orient yourself 

840
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:01,000
in the world so that you solve the class
of the fact that there are problems,

841
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,201
right?
That's,

842
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,690
that's the ultimate story.
And I think that's the hero myth.

843
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,560
And I also think that that's the 
knowledge generating process that piaget

844
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,280
is talking about you.
That's because you have,

845
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,570
you're constantly overcoming problems in
the world.

846
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,763
And the problems are that you don't know
enough to get what you want from the 

847
00:41:16,751 --> 00:41:19,720
world.
And so you get that mismatch mismatch.

848
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,673
There's,
you've got whole brain systems that are 

849
00:41:21,461 --> 00:41:24,460
designed to do nothing but detect that 
mismatch,

850
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,323
like crucial central brain structures.
And we'll talk about that a lot when we 

851
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,070
get into the,
into the physiology.

852
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,230
So,
all right,

853
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,573
how does,
on what is an individual basis 

854
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,080
judgments?
What are his norms?

855
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:36,914
How are they validated?
How do you know if you're right about 

856
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,704
your norms?
What's the interest of such norms for 

857
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:44,840
the philosophy of science in general?
That's a really tough one.

858
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:45,674
It's like,
well you have norms and expectations as 

859
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:52,610
a human being and because of that they,
they have a determining influence on the

860
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,800
manner in which you conduct science.

861
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:56,023
So for example,
here's one of the problems with the 

862
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,950
street realist view.
So we could be having a discussion and I

863
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,521
could say,
well,

864
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,340
you know that tile is to the right of 
that tile.

865
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,503
And then I could say,
well this brick is smaller than that 

866
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:08,690
brick.
And then I could say,

867
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:09,920
you know,
the roof is white,

868
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,530
really quite white there and it's dark 
back there.

869
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,140
And like after about 20 statements like 
that,

870
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:18,470
you're just going to want to slap me.
And the reason for that is that,

871
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:22,010
well those statements are perfectly 
valid representations of fact,

872
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,060
but there's an infinite number of facts 
and most of them are irrelevant.

873
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:28,850
And that's the thing.
That's the thing.

874
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,760
The facts have to be relevant.
Like,

875
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:32,594
if you come to a lecture and all the 
person does is tell you irrelevant 

876
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,140
facts,
what happens.

877
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,790
You've been in lots of lectures like 
that.

878
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,133
What happens when you start fantasizing 
about something that might be more 

879
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:46,751
worthwhile,
you know,

880
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:51,380
or you go to sleep because your brain is
a lot smarter than you are.

881
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:54,500
It figures hell if all we're going to 
get exposed to here as an infant,

882
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,483
infinite number of irrelevant facts,
we might as well have a nap until 

883
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,860
something important happens.
So it's true.

884
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:03,470
It's exactly how it works.
Now this is going to get big.

885
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,810
Isn't that what happens next?
No.

886
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,520
So,
okay.

887
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:08,354
So,
and then how does the fact that the 

888
00:43:10,161 --> 00:43:13,000
child children think differently?
Um,

889
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,430
effect our presumption of fact itself.
Children live in the world,

890
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:19,280
they think differently about the world,
but yet they survive.

891
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,780
And so,
well,

892
00:43:20,781 --> 00:43:23,180
I already mentioned a partial solution 
to that.

893
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:24,320
Adults intercede,
you know,

894
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:25,820
around the edges,
around the borders.

895
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,570
Children do this all the time.
May,

896
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,820
so it's called referencing.

897
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:30,860
Um,
and they do it two ways.

898
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:31,700
So,
for example,

899
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,713
if you're in a room with your child,
maybe two way and most runs across the 

900
00:43:36,231 --> 00:43:38,000
child will orient to it,
watch it,

901
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,130
track it.
That's pretty much unconscious.

902
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,540
And the mother,
let's say,

903
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,403
we'll do that too.
And then the child looks at the mouse 

904
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:44,894
and it looks at the mother and the 
reason is is because the child doesn't 

905
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:48,344
know what the mouse is.
And so then it looks at the mother to 

906
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:51,434
read from the mother's face,
which is a projection screen of 

907
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:54,404
emotions,
how to classify the mouse in terms of 

908
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:58,490
import.
And if the mother is like all calm about

909
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:00,170
it and it gives the kid a pad,
it's like,

910
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:00,951
you know,
okay,

911
00:44:00,951 --> 00:44:02,360
whatever,
you know,

912
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,460
not to danger.
That's what the most is first danger,

913
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,760
not danger.
It's way after that that it's a mouth.

914
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,751
You think?
No,

915
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:12,584
it's the most to begin with.
It's like these things are not so 

916
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,970
straight forward.
They are not so straight forward.

917
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,480
So anyways,
if the mother climbs up on the table,

918
00:44:19,481 --> 00:44:20,314
it has a screaming fit,
then the child's already prepared 

919
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:25,970
because of this anomaly to be 
emotionally responsive.

920
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:28,700
The child looks at the mother's face,
it's got terror on it.

921
00:44:28,701 --> 00:44:31,860
The most child thinks small danger,
big danger.

922
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,230
It's like phobia,
phobia,

923
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,093
phobia.
Now all kids that won't happen to cause 

924
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,824
some are very emotionally robust,
but if their child's very high in 

925
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,390
neuroticism,
trait neuroticism,

926
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,433
the probability that they'll develop a 
permanent semipermanent fear of the 

927
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:48,024
mouse is extraordinarily high and that's
what should happen because the mother 

928
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:54,720
tells you what the most is in the face.
Does it say mouse?

929
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:56,303
It says safety.
Danger and that's the first thing you 

930
00:44:58,261 --> 00:44:59,160
want to know about something.

931
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,570
He said safer.
Is it dangerous?

932
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,703
And that's a tricky one.
A because whether something is safe or 

933
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:06,420
dangerous is not exactly no objective 
fact.

934
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,703
There's a guy named Jj Gibson who wrote 
a book called an ecological approach to 

935
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,574
visual perception,
which I would highly recommend and his 

936
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:14,784
claim in that book.
It's a real work of genius I believe is 

937
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,290
that when you see,
when you walk towards a cliff,

938
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,790
you don't see a cliff,
you don't see a cliff and infer danger,

939
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:27,570
what you see as a falling off place and 
you infer cliff.

940
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,850
And you can tell that some of you have 
vertigo.

941
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:30,684
You go up on the 26th floor out into a 
balcony and it's like you don't want to 

942
00:45:33,271 --> 00:45:34,104
go near the edge.
Maybe you feel like you're going to 

943
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,650
throw yourself over because people have 
that kind of what if,

944
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,330
what if I fell or what if I jumped over?

945
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,163
It's like stay away from that.
It's like that perception of the danger 

946
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:47,220
precedes your perception of the balcony 
and the object.

947
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,890
Now you know that's how your brain is 
wired.

948
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,940
The danger's first object's second.
So when people with blind sight,

949
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:56,280
who I've talked about before who think 
they're blind,

950
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,413
they can't see,
then they tell you that they can still 

951
00:45:58,861 --> 00:45:59,694
detect fearful faces and you could 
detect their detection by measuring 

952
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:05,290
their skin conductance.
And so their eyes are mapping right onto

953
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,910
their fear and reflex systems without 
any intermediary of objective perception

954
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:09,744
whatsoever.
So don't be thinking that what you see 

955
00:46:12,241 --> 00:46:14,760
in the world is the objective world and 
then infer its meaning.

956
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,360
It could easily be exactly backwards.
And it looks like if you look at how the

957
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:21,480
brain is set up that it is in fact 
actually backwards,

958
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,830
or at least parallel,
but,

959
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,510
but the,
but the danger,

960
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,440
not danger.

961
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,810
Perception has to be very,
very,

962
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:29,010
very,
very fast.

963
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,940
And so it proceeds the more elaborate 
cognitive interpretations,

964
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,803
even the perceptions because it actually
takes a while to see something because 

965
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:38,250
it's really complicated to see 
something.

966
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,970
And so you can't just wait around to see
the damn thing before you act.

967
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,953
You just not fast enough.
So they say if you're a pro tennis 

968
00:46:45,451 --> 00:46:48,480
player,
the time it takes the ball to leave your

969
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:52,080
opponent's racket to get to you,
it's not long enough for you to plan any

970
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:52,914
motor act.
So what you're doing is you've got the 

971
00:46:55,441 --> 00:46:56,274
moat,
you disinhibit the motor act by looking 

972
00:46:57,601 --> 00:47:00,420
at the stance of your opponent and 
watching.

973
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,020
And by the time they hit it,
you're already prepared for the response

974
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,720
because you're just not,
it's coming at 120 miles an hour.

975
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:10,170
It's like it's going 50 feet.
You don't have the reflexes for it.

976
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,480
So your,
your,

977
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,720
your eyes are making your body ready 
without in some sense,

978
00:47:15,721 --> 00:47:16,554
without your conscious perception,
you become conscious if you make a 

979
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,190
mistake,
right?

980
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:21,024
In fact,
that's kind of what consciousness is 

981
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:23,100
for.
It's like detect error,

982
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,090
fix,
detect,

983
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:24,924
error,
fix.

984
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,660
That's consciousness.
It's not planned what you're going to do

985
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,950
next,
although it's not that simple either.

986
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:33,160
Other problems that Piaget was trying to
address.

987
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:34,630
While what,
what are numbers?

988
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,560
What does it mean for there to be space?
What do we mean when we,

989
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,870
when we talk about time,
how do we,

990
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,780
how did we come up with that concept?
What does speed mean?

991
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,823
How do we know an object is permanent?
How do we know that an object stays the 

992
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:53,070
same across sets of transformation?
So that's a very classic piaget,

993
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:53,904
Eddie and problems.
So let's say you give a kid a ball of 

994
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:56,680
clay and then you crush it.

995
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,513
So it's now a cylinder is like,
is that the same thing or is it a 

996
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,200
different thing?
And the answer is,

997
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,360
well it's the same thing and it's a 
different thing,

998
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:05,194
but there's something about it that 
remained constant across the 

999
00:48:07,391 --> 00:48:08,224
transformations.
And so one of the things that piaget is 

1000
00:48:10,391 --> 00:48:15,250
trying to figure out is what remains 
constant across transformations.

1001
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,470
Because you might think about that is a 
real fact.

1002
00:48:17,471 --> 00:48:18,910
Protons are like that,
right?

1003
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,953
They remained constant across 
transformations and so we assume that 

1004
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,690
they're pretty damn real and they last 
guy to know how long protons last.

1005
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:27,580
It's like,
I don't know what it is.

1006
00:48:27,581 --> 00:48:29,560
It's some tens of billions of,
so don't worry,

1007
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,990
your protons are going to just sit right
there and behave,

1008
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,730
you know?
So they last for a very,

1009
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:34,564
very,
very long time across sets of 

1010
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:37,810
transformation so we can regard them as 
real.

1011
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,273
He was interested in why children play 
and why there are patterns in play and 

1012
00:48:41,861 --> 00:48:43,600
how that's related to dreams.

1013
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:46,900
And he was really interested in the fact
that we imitate other people.

1014
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,470
And this is another part of piaget,
staggering genius in my estimation,

1015
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,304
because he was one of the early 
developmental thinkers who understood 

1016
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,144
that our capacity for learning was not 
so much mediated by language as it was 

1017
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:00,604
mediated by our capacity to use our 
bodies to represent the bodies of other 

1018
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,430
people.
And that's mind boggling.

1019
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:09,220
It's a mind boggling idea.
So you know,

1020
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,130
you hear a monkey see monkey do,
but it's actually not true.

1021
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:16,570
They're not very good at imitating 
octopuses or Octopi.

1022
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,553
They can imitate actually.
So if you give an octopus a bottle with 

1023
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:22,840
a cork in it and there's a crab in the 
cork,

1024
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:25,300
it configure it how to get out the cork 
and sneak out the crab.

1025
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,433
But if you get an octopus to watch 
another octopus do that and learn to do 

1026
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:30,094
it faster.

1027
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,710
Those things are smart.
And that's partly,

1028
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:34,150
that's because they're all technically 
right.

1029
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,230
And so they actually have something they
can do something with like our hands.

1030
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,760
There's our tentacles.
You know,

1031
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:43,400
an Octopi can operate in the world 
because they have tentacles and,

1032
00:49:43,401 --> 00:49:44,234
and you know,
you hear about the superhuman 

1033
00:49:45,011 --> 00:49:47,080
intelligence of things like dolphins and
whales.

1034
00:49:47,081 --> 00:49:48,310
It's like,
yeah,

1035
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,890
no,
they're basically test tubes.

1036
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:51,724
You know what,
what are they going to do snout appa 

1037
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:54,040
city?
It's like,

1038
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:55,270
no,
they're not going to do that.

1039
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,660
They can't manipulate the world.
So whatever their intelligence is,

1040
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,790
it's way different than ours.
Okay.

1041
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:03,910
Imitation.
So partly what you're doing all the time

1042
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,833
is imitating other people.
All of you are imitating each other 

1043
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:09,580
right now you can tell because look 
around,

1044
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,870
you're all doing exactly the same thing.
So it's,

1045
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,753
it's mass imitation.
And that's really a huge part of social 

1046
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:18,910
structure is that we're constantly 
imitating each other.

1047
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,103
And so that means that your body and her
body are very much matched 

1048
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:23,884
physiologically.
Right now you're in the same state and 

1049
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:26,344
you can tell,
cause he basically have same expression 

1050
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,473
and as long as all you crazy primates,
violent primates have the same 

1051
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:33,944
expression on,
you can pretty much be sure that all of 

1052
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:40,490
you are thinking and about to do 
approximately the same thing.

1053
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:41,324
And so you can keep that match between 
your desire slash expectation and 

1054
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:47,780
reality happening.
And that's why we have a face.

1055
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,150
It's so that other people know what the 
hell we're up to.

1056
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:52,580
And that's why you're always watching 
people's faces.

1057
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,110
Cause you want to see what they're up 
to.

1058
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,570
And that's why you have whites around 
your iris.

1059
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,673
Gorilla's don't.
And so that's because I can see exactly 

1060
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:03,470
where your eyes are pointing because 
they're highlighted by that white.

1061
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:07,670
And I'm unbelievably good at detecting 
the precise direction of your gaze.

1062
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,250
And so if you stand on the corner and 
look up at buildings,

1063
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,093
other people will stand beside you and 
look up cause they think well that guy 

1064
00:51:13,611 --> 00:51:14,444
would be standing there pointing his 
eyes into the sky unless there is 

1065
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,340
something of interest to a primate like 
me.

1066
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,920
And so this classic social psychology 
experiment,

1067
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:22,754
you'll get people gathered round trying 
to figure out what the hell it is that 

1068
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:27,910
you're pointing your eyes at.
Right?

1069
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:28,744
Cause that indicates intense interest 
interest in something valuable that I 

1070
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:32,834
might be able to share or partake in if 
I can figure out what it is that you're 

1071
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:35,864
up to.
And so all your ancestors who didn't 

1072
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:40,730
have nicely defined eyes,
they all got killed or they didn't mate.

1073
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,833
And that's why you have these beautiful 
white eyes with this like colorful iris 

1074
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:46,484
in the middle.
It's so that people can tell what the 

1075
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:50,870
hell you're up to and they're more 
likely to cooperate with you,

1076
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,240
more likely to mate with you and less 
likely to kill you,

1077
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:55,310
which is probably a good thing.

1078
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,410
All things considered.
And so,

1079
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,573
you know,
if you look at the same thing that 

1080
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:02,000
someone else is looking at,
your imitating them.

1081
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,553
And one of the things that's interesting
is that if you're looking at the same 

1082
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:06,944
thing that someone else is looking at 
and you inhabit the same value 

1083
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,454
structure,
then your emotional responses are going 

1084
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:12,524
to be very much akin to one another.
And you can tell that when you go to a 

1085
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:20,360
movie and you watch the hero and you 
embody the hero while you're doing so,

1086
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,403
and the emotions that you produce inside
of you by imitating the hero on the 

1087
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:27,380
screen enable you to figure out what the
hero is going through.

1088
00:52:27,530 --> 00:52:28,363
And you can learn from that.
And so that's a very complex form of 

1089
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:31,664
imitation.
And we do that when we tell stories or 

1090
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:36,080
we watch stories.
And those stories are really complicated

1091
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:36,914
because as we already outlined,
there not just factual representations 

1092
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:41,174
of someone's action during a day there 
representations of the important things 

1093
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:47,030
that the person did,
the meaningful things.

1094
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:48,103
And so when you go see a movie,
all you're doing is watching meaningful 

1095
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:52,280
things.
If the movie's any good.

1096
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,960
And you know that because well,
if the movie isn't meaningful,

1097
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,350
well then you leave your board,
right?

1098
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,220
And the fact that it's meaningful is 
what keeps you in the seat.

1099
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,470
And you don't necessarily know why.
In fact,

1100
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:08,600
you often have no idea why it's 
meaningful.

1101
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,560
It's like watching Pinocchio rescue his 
father from a whale.

1102
00:53:12,561 --> 00:53:14,060
It's like,
what the hell?

1103
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:14,980
You know,
how,

1104
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:17,060
why is that meaningful?
While you don't know.

1105
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,000
But it is.
So moral concerns,

1106
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,670
while we already talked about Piaget's 
concern about morality,

1107
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,100
oh boy,
this really not good.

1108
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:42,370
Okay,
here's a proposition.

1109
00:53:42,371 --> 00:53:43,204
Constructivist proposition.
Knowledge does not begin in the eye by 

1110
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:50,860
by which he means they're kind of two 
ways of looking at the world.

1111
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,140
There's more,
but we'll start with that.

1112
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:55,270
One is,
is that all of your knowledge comes from

1113
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:57,400
outside sense data.
Okay.

1114
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:58,650
And the,
um,

1115
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,080
that's kind of a behavior is claiming 
before that it's a,

1116
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:06,400
it's an empiricist claim.
And then the other idea is no,

1117
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:07,234
that can't be right because you have 
internal structures that enable you to 

1118
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:11,900
look at the world and interpreted and 
so,

1119
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:15,370
and in some of those might be implicit 
axiomatic,

1120
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,413
like the fact that you have two eyes and
you look at the outward into the world 

1121
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:20,620
and that you can hear and that you can 
touch.

1122
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:21,783
It's like the fact of those senses isn't
dependent on the empirical reality for 

1123
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,680
those senses to manifest themselves.

1124
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,030
They're already built into you.
And people like Khan,

1125
00:54:29,031 --> 00:54:29,864
for example,
made the proposition that we had a 

1126
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:35,380
priori knowledge structures and that we 
use them to interpret the world.

1127
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:38,200
And so it's different than him.
It's different than empiricism.

1128
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,280
And so what piaget is saying,
well it's neither of those are,

1129
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:43,240
right,
exactly.

1130
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,170
It's not like you will learn everything 
from the world through your senses.

1131
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,183
And it's not as if you project 
everything onto the world as 

1132
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:51,304
interpretation.
It's something in between and it's a 

1133
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:55,150
dynamic,
it's a dynamic.

1134
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,910
And so,
and it's like bootstrapping.

1135
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:59,410
That's the right way to think about it.
You know,

1136
00:54:59,411 --> 00:55:02,080
when you're coding computer boots up,
that means bootstrapping,

1137
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,213
it's off.
And then a bunch of simple processes 

1138
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,930
occur.
And then out of those simple processes,

1139
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,400
some more complex processes emerge.
And then out of those,

1140
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:13,240
some more complex processes emerge and 
all of a sudden your computer is there.

1141
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,850
Well that's kind of what Piaget thinks 
happens to you.

1142
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,630
You bootstrap yourself.
And so you have got a couple of reflexes

1143
00:55:19,631 --> 00:55:22,210
to begin with.
Like the sucking reflex for example.

1144
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:23,403
And you've got some proclivities.
Like maybe you can sort of flip your 

1145
00:55:25,691 --> 00:55:26,524
hand or,
or you develop that and you have 

1146
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:29,170
reflexes.
So,

1147
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:31,870
you know,
if you blow on a baby for example,

1148
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:34,330
the PV will go like this.
It's built into it.

1149
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,460
It's like an,
it's a,

1150
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,313
it's a startle reflex essentially.
So that startle reflex is there right 

1151
00:55:39,161 --> 00:55:39,581
from the,
again,

1152
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:41,800
it's a whole body reflex.
And,

1153
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:42,730
uh,
you know,

1154
00:55:42,731 --> 00:55:43,564
if you stroke the bottom of their feet,
their fetal sort of curl up and if you 

1155
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:48,250
put your finger in their hands,
even a newborn,

1156
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:51,250
if you put your finger in their hands,
you can lift them right up.

1157
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,040
And it's sort of well clinging ape 
thing,

1158
00:55:54,041 --> 00:55:54,874
you know,
because chimpanzee infants cling to 

1159
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,080
their mother for like five years.

1160
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,913
And so that reflex is still there.
So the kid comes into the world born 

1161
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,234
with these simplistic low resolution 
procedures that enable it to get a 

1162
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,290
foothold on the world.
And then out of that,

1163
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:14,590
the child emerges.
And that's so the constructivist idea is

1164
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,424
that,
well it isn't like you have your heads 

1165
00:56:17,861 --> 00:56:21,880
full of fully developed axiomatic 
structures and it isn't that you get all

1166
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:22,714
your knowledge from the world,
it's that you have a bit of structure 

1167
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:27,520
there to begin with.
That gives you a toll hold on the world.

1168
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,270
And then you act in the world and as you
act,

1169
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:32,403
you generate information and out of that
information you make the structures 

1170
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:40,351
inside of you and you make the world.
That's a constructivist idea is that you

1171
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:41,224
take whatever's there,
this tremendous complexity and you 

1172
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,900
sorted into you and the world.
And so,

1173
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,063
and so that,
that goes back to that William James 

1174
00:56:49,751 --> 00:56:51,500
idea about that initial chaos.

1175
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,680
And it's a hard conflict.
It's a hard,

1176
00:56:53,681 --> 00:56:57,190
hard concept to grasp because that isn't
really how we think.

1177
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:59,470
You know,
we think that there's an objective world

1178
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:00,304
and there's this objective world and 
that the objective world is just there 

1179
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,010
and this objective world is maybe a 
subset of that.

1180
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:08,230
But that is not the Piagetian 
presupposition.

1181
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:12,070
It's not a presupposition of 
phenomenologist in general who will talk

1182
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:13,510
about later.
But,

1183
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,500
so here's one example of,
of how to think about this in a sense.

1184
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:18,580
It's like,
you know,

1185
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,414
you think as Piaget said,
you kind of think that your 

1186
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,360
representations of the world are fixed.
So we'll go back to the urine,

1187
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:28,030
a longterm relationship and the person 
betrays you scenario,

1188
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,893
right?
So you've been with this person 10 

1189
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:34,210
years.
You assume fidelity and faithfulness and

1190
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:35,740
honesty and all of that.
You,

1191
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:36,670
you,
uh,

1192
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:37,750
we've a shared narrative.

1193
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,583
You both had habitat,
it structures your existence and 

1194
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:41,644
regulates your motion.
Then you find out that the person has 

1195
00:57:43,361 --> 00:57:45,550
not only betrayed you once,
but multiple times.

1196
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:46,660
It's like,
okay,

1197
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:48,573
what you thought isn't what happened,
but here's the weird thing you see 

1198
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,653
because you interpreted the world 
obviously within the confines of that 

1199
00:57:55,961 --> 00:57:58,780
relationship and you had an,
you know,

1200
00:57:58,781 --> 00:57:59,614
obviously you had an interpretation,
but there was also a world that's the 

1201
00:58:03,221 --> 00:58:07,120
world you thought you lived in.
It's like those were facts.

1202
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,930
Well all of a sudden those aren't facts.
They're not at all facts.

1203
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,900
And so what happens that's that descent 
into the underworld.

1204
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:14,734
It's like all of a sudden what happens 
is that past that you thought was fixed 

1205
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:22,150
now becomes this weird mixture of 
fantasy because you're wondering,

1206
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:22,780
well what,
what,

1207
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,610
what?
What is it that happened then?

1208
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,750
And you're going to run through all 
sorts of fantasies.

1209
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,460
Some of them are going to be really 
dark,

1210
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:31,294
you know,
really dark about what happened in the 

1211
00:58:32,351 --> 00:58:34,990
state of the world and all that.
And those are unconscious fantasies.

1212
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:37,930
And that's mingled inextricably with the
world,

1213
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,483
right?
Because you don't know the facts 

1214
00:58:40,751 --> 00:58:41,584
anymore,
which kind of suggests that maybe you 

1215
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:43,654
never did know them.
And that's pretty strange thing because 

1216
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:46,863
you know you're operating as if you've 
got this factual representation of the 

1217
00:58:49,421 --> 00:58:51,820
world,
but it can be appended like that.

1218
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,610
And so that makes you think,
well what about these facts?

1219
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:58,150
Like are kind of,
they're kind of hard to get a handle on.

1220
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,060
You know,
and you see this a lot in courtroom,

1221
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,373
in courtrooms situations because of 
course what the court decides is what 

1222
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:06,334
happened.
And the answer is we don't exactly know 

1223
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:10,024
because you could keep making the 
context of interpretation wider and 

1224
00:59:13,361 --> 00:59:14,194
wider.

1225
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,333
So you know,
maybe you bring your partner to court 

1226
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,950
because they've betrayed you,
let's say.

1227
00:59:18,951 --> 00:59:21,440
And you're trying to get a divorce 
settlement predicated on that.

1228
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:22,274
But then they tell a bunch of stories 
about how you were just as miserable as 

1229
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,160
you could possibly be and that anybody 
with any sense would've betrayed you and

1230
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,990
never told you about it because you 
know,

1231
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,750
that's just what a normal,
sensible person would do.

1232
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,430
And so then the question is,
well,

1233
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:37,030
where you actually be trade?
And if you were,

1234
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,540
well,
who was it that betrayed you?

1235
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,374
Was it your partner?
Was it you or was it your bloody mother 

1236
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,630
or your father who taught you to act 
that way or who didn't teach you?

1237
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,520
It's like,
it's a hell of a thing.

1238
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:50,900
Cause you can just keep altering the 
interpretive context and within it,

1239
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:52,820
the facts shift around and then you 
might say,

1240
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:53,930
well,
they're not facts.

1241
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:55,970
It's like,
yeah,

1242
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,260
yeah,
you can say that,

1243
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:58,094
but it's,
it's more complicated than that by a 

1244
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:01,460
large margin.
Anyways.

1245
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:02,294
So Piaget's notion is essentially that,
well this is how I interpreted this is 

1246
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:11,450
sort of,
this is my thinking in some sense,

1247
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:15,210
but I'm offering it to you as a scheme 
for helping you understand piaget.

1248
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,630
It's like Jerome Bruner,
famous,

1249
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,330
famous cognitive psychologist,
said,

1250
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:21,164
we seem to have no other way of 
describing live time set except in the 

1251
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:28,580
form of a narrative and a narrative.
As far as I could tell,

1252
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,414
I think this is the same thing as one of
Piaget's knowledge representations as 

1253
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:35,024
far as I can tell,
there's a representation of you and 

1254
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,874
there's a representation of the future 
and there's behaviors that you use to 

1255
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:44,690
transform one into the other.
And so when piaget talks about,

1256
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:47,060
so this is kind of where the mind meets 
the body,

1257
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,620
that that's how it looks to me.

1258
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:53,060
It's like you have a conception of you 
and you have something you're aiming at,

1259
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,460
you want to have happen.
Those are both representations,

1260
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,790
but when you act in the world,
those aren't representations anymore.

1261
01:00:59,000 --> 01:00:59,833
Those are actually actions.
And so mine transforms into body when 

1262
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:05,420
you act out your notion.
And that's,

1263
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,300
that's sort of how the mind is linked to
the body as far as I can tell.

1264
01:01:08,301 --> 01:01:09,134
And so what Piaget says is that the 
behaviors are built before the 

1265
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:13,784
representation.
And so we're going to take a look at 

1266
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,140
that.
So here's,

1267
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,100
here's Piaget's notion of assimilation 
and accommodation,

1268
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,003
whereas other animals cannot alter 
themselves except by changing their 

1269
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:29,540
species.
That's through Darwinian means,

1270
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:30,374
right?
So what happens is a bear is a kind of 

1271
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:32,774
solution to a set of problems and 
they're the problems that the bears 

1272
01:01:35,211 --> 01:01:37,520
environment presents.
And the bear is just a bear.

1273
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,353
So it's sort of like bears were 10,000 
years ago and the only way the bear can 

1274
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:44,930
solve a new problem basically is by 
generating new random bears,

1275
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:46,670
which is what it does when it 
reproduces.

1276
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,713
And hoping that one of those more random
bears is a better fit for whatever 

1277
01:01:50,541 --> 01:01:52,700
random change might occur in the 
environment.

1278
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,560
That's the whole Darwinian issue,
right?

1279
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:56,900
You can't predict which way the 
environment's going to go.

1280
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:58,543
And so what you do is you take your 
structure and you vary it and you throw 

1281
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:05,570
those out into the world.
And some animals do that expensively,

1282
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:09,620
so they have infants that they have to 
program to that specific environment.

1283
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:13,700
But it takes a lot of investment.
And some creatures do that cheaply,

1284
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:14,534
like mosquitoes.
It's like they don't care for their 

1285
01:02:15,621 --> 01:02:16,880
kids,
but they have a million of them.

1286
01:02:16,881 --> 01:02:20,940
So like who cares if 999,998 die?

1287
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:23,100
There's still twice as many of you as 
their work.

1288
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,750
So those are two different reproductive 
strategies and you could think about all

1289
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:32,520
those mosquito offspring as new mosquito
ideas in embodied form.

1290
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:33,563
And most of them are bad ideas.
And so the environment just wipes them 

1291
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:36,204
out.
Or Piaget is point is we do the same 

1292
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:38,514
thing with our cognitive structures.
And that's the thing that's so 

1293
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:40,914
interesting about people in some sense 
that we've internalized the Darwinian 

1294
01:02:44,401 --> 01:02:47,040
problem.
And so when you think about the future,

1295
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:48,083
what you're doing is generating a 
multiplicity of potential environments 

1296
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,433
and then you're generating a sequence of
avatars of yourself to live in those 

1297
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:56,334
fictional futures.
And then you watch what happens as that 

1298
01:02:58,771 --> 01:03:02,010
avatar lives in each of those,
those fictional futures.

1299
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,950
And if the avatar fails,
you don't act that out.

1300
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,560
It's bloody brilliant.
It's brilliant.

1301
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,000
That's what our brain does.

1302
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,490
It's like it hypothesizes potential 
futures.

1303
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,960
It runs simulations and it kills them.
And that can be really painful,

1304
01:03:15,961 --> 01:03:17,850
but it beats the hell out of dying 
yourself.

1305
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,150
Or maybe sometimes you won't think so 
because it really can be painful,

1306
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,340
but it's,
it's,

1307
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:25,770
it's something that as far as we know,
only human beings can really do,

1308
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:26,663
right?
We invent possible futures and invent 

1309
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:32,130
possible future selves and kill them off
in our imagination.

1310
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,110
And that's what you're doing in an 
argument.

1311
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:35,940
That's what an argument is.
It's like,

1312
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:37,530
well,
here's an Avatar,

1313
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,870
a representational avatar.
You know,

1314
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:40,763
it's based on certain axioms and all 
articulate it and you articulate yours 

1315
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,560
and we'll have them have a fight and 
whichever one survives,

1316
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,740
we'll accept as true and we'll move 
forward and act that out.

1317
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:52,590
And you know,
arguments can be pretty damn intense,

1318
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,453
but hypothetically,
they're not as intense as acting out a 

1319
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:58,170
stupid idea.
That's the thing,

1320
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,213
right?
Better to have some conflict and reach 

1321
01:04:00,631 --> 01:04:05,160
resolution in an abstract sense than to 
embody your stupidity and die.

1322
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,110
And so,
you know,

1323
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:11,130
it's sort of a trade off between anxiety
and an annihilation or pain,

1324
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,740
whereas other animals cannot alter 
themselves,

1325
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:29,574
except by changing their species.
Man can transform himself by 

1326
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:32,454
transforming the world and constructor 
himself by constructing structures and 

1327
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:36,790
the structures.
Arizona,

1328
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,560
they're not eternally predestined either
from within or from without.

1329
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,750
Also piaget,
you know,

1330
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,350
he's,
he's,

1331
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,183
while he's a constructivist,
he believes that there's something that 

1332
01:04:45,961 --> 01:04:48,660
your biology brings to the table and,
and,

1333
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:49,703
and sets up the parameters,
let's say within which you can play 

1334
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:52,464
games.
But within those parameters there's a 

1335
01:04:53,761 --> 01:04:56,070
very wide range of games that you could 
play.

1336
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,590
And so it's not a biological 
determinism,

1337
01:04:58,591 --> 01:04:59,424
even though it's a biological framing.
And you can think about it like a chess 

1338
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:02,610
game.
You know,

1339
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:03,444
let's,
let's assume that the rules of chess or 

1340
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:07,740
biologically determined just for the 
sake of argument,

1341
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:10,320
you can still play a near infinite 
number of chess games.

1342
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,940
And so it's the same with you.

1343
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,773
You come into the world with a set of 
built in axioms that sort of your body 

1344
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:16,524
and your nervous system,
but you can play a very large number of 

1345
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:19,744
games within that set of frames.
And one of the things that's very 

1346
01:05:22,481 --> 01:05:23,314
interesting about that,
something that's very mysterious to me 

1347
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:28,990
is this is a game that I played before 
with students.

1348
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:30,640
So I'm going to play it with you if you 
don't mind.

1349
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:31,990
So we're gonna play a game.
You're ready?

1350
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,610
Okay.
You move first.

1351
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:36,190
Right?
Exactly.

1352
01:05:36,191 --> 01:05:37,450
You don't know what to do.
Right.

1353
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:38,171
And that's,
well,

1354
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:39,004
that's so interesting because I 
basically made the presupposition that 

1355
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,360
you could do anything.
You're completely free.

1356
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:44,943
And what,
what do you do?

1357
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,140
You throw up your hands,
it's like you don't know what to do.

1358
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,380
I'm so free.
It's like free to do what?

1359
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:51,520
Well,
that's not freedom.

1360
01:05:51,521 --> 01:05:52,750
It's just nothing.

1361
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:54,251
But if I said,
well,

1362
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:55,990
look,
what we're going to do instead is when I

1363
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:57,040
move my arm,
right,

1364
01:05:57,041 --> 01:05:58,060
you're gonna move your arm.
Right?

1365
01:05:58,061 --> 01:05:59,140
So let's do that.
Okay,

1366
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:02,170
so I'm going to go like that and you're 
going to good.

1367
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:05,470
And then I'll go like that and then 
we'll have little dance.

1368
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:06,831
Yeah.
Yeah.

1369
01:06:06,831 --> 01:06:08,520
And so you can play a game like God with
a,

1370
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:11,440
with a kid instantly.
And they like that.

1371
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:14,350
They've got that man.
And so I've got to,

1372
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:16,330
I've got some pictures of that.
I'll show you that in a bit.

1373
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:18,820
But even a newborn baby,
if you stick out your tongue,

1374
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:21,850
they can stick their tongue,
hold back and that you think about that.

1375
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:24,640
That's just absolutely mind boggling 
that they can do that and,

1376
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,713
and they really can,
they really do seem to be able to do 

1377
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:28,420
that right at the moment of birth.

1378
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:31,690
And so you know,
you hear babies have no theory of mind.

1379
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:34,930
It's like ah yeah,
no,

1380
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,350
they can imitate.
That's pretty bloody amazing man.

1381
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,840
Like you haven't seen robots that can do
that yet.

1382
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:43,990
Although there are robots now that you 
can teach by moving their,

1383
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:45,063
their arms,
you move their arms and then they'll do 

1384
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:48,064
it.
And so you can actually program them by 

1385
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:51,460
moving them and then they'll just repeat
it.

1386
01:06:51,461 --> 01:06:53,530
And so they're getting damn close to 
imitation.

1387
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:56,320
They're really getting close and then 
look the hell out man,

1388
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,613
because they're going to be imitating 
each other as well as us and they're 

1389
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,740
going to do it so fast.
You just won't be able to believe it.

1390
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:03,993
So that's coming.
The organism adapts itself by third 

1391
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:08,944
materially constructing new forums to 
fit themselves into those of the 

1392
01:07:11,141 --> 01:07:11,974
universe.
Whereas intelligence extends this 

1393
01:07:13,061 --> 01:07:16,060
creation by constructing mental 
structures which can be applied to those

1394
01:07:16,061 --> 01:07:16,840
of the environment.

1395
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,760
That's the Darwinian idea that I just 
mentioned.

1396
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:19,863
You know,
the guys that are building the 

1397
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,034
autonomous cars,
like they don't think they're building 

1398
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:23,134
autonomous cars.
They know perfectly well what they're 

1399
01:07:25,151 --> 01:07:25,984
doing.
They're building fleets of mutually 

1400
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:29,860
intercommunicating,
autonomous robots.

1401
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,293
And each of them you to be able to teach
the other because their nervous system 

1402
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:35,290
will be the same.
And when there's 10 million of them,

1403
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:36,124
when one of them learn something,
all 10 million of them will learn it at 

1404
01:07:37,961 --> 01:07:38,794
the same time.
So they're not going to have to be very 

1405
01:07:40,301 --> 01:07:41,890
bright before they're very,
very,

1406
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:44,020
very smart.
Cause us,

1407
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:44,854
you know,
we'll learn something you have to 

1408
01:07:45,671 --> 01:07:47,920
imitate.
It's like God that's hard.

1409
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:48,754
Or I have to explain it to you and you 
have to understand it and then you have 

1410
01:07:50,771 --> 01:07:51,604
to act it out.
We're not connected wirelessly with the 

1411
01:07:53,561 --> 01:07:55,900
same platform,
but robots.

1412
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:56,913
They are.

1413
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:59,110
And so once those things get a little 
bit smart,

1414
01:07:59,111 --> 01:08:01,510
they're not going to stop at a little 
bit smart for very long.

1415
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,230
They're going to be unbelievably smart 
like overnight.

1416
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,020
So,
and they're imitating the hell out of us

1417
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:08,854
right now too,
because we're teaching them how to 

1418
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:14,140
understand us every second of every day.
The net is learning what we're like.

1419
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,340
It's watching us,
it's communicating with us,

1420
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:17,323
it's imitating us.
And it's going to know it already knows 

1421
01:08:19,431 --> 01:08:21,710
in some ways more about us than we know 
about ourselves.

1422
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:22,873
You know,
there's lots of reports already of 

1423
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:25,094
people getting pregnancy ads or ads for 
infants sometimes before they know 

1424
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:31,334
they're pregnant,
but often before they've told their 

1425
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:35,450
families.
And the way that that happens is the net

1426
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:36,284
is watching what they're looking at and 
inferring with its artificial 

1427
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,614
intelligence.
And so maybe you're pregnant and that's 

1428
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:41,924
just tilting you a little bit,
right to interest in things that you 

1429
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:45,570
might not otherwise be interested in.

1430
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,970
The net tracks that then it tells you 
what you're,

1431
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:48,913
what you're after.
It does that by offering an 

1432
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:54,020
advertisement,
if it's reading your unconscious mind so

1433
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,900
well.
So that's what's happening.

1434
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,850
So,
all right,

1435
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:03,170
so what's the motive for development?
Disequilibrium.

1436
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:07,130
That's a Piagetian term.
This is a life is suffering idea.

1437
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:10,160
It's like,
why learn something cause you're wrong.

1438
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,560
Who cares.
It makes you suffer.

1439
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:14,300
You care.
So you know,

1440
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:16,430
if you run out a little scheme in the 
world,

1441
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,040
little action pattern,
you don't get what you want.

1442
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:20,960
If you're,
especially if you're two years old,

1443
01:09:20,961 --> 01:09:23,990
you burst into tears and cry.
And why is that?

1444
01:09:23,991 --> 01:09:24,824
It's because you don't know what,
you don't know where you are and you 

1445
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:27,320
don't know where you're,
what you're doing.

1446
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:29,510
It's like time for some negative 
emotion.

1447
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,603
It indicates that you're wrong.
And that's terrible in some sense 

1448
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:33,974
because it all,
it almost always means that to learn 

1449
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:37,700
requires pain.

1450
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:41,360
Now I don't believe that.
Exactly because

1451
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:44,450
people are curious,
you know,

1452
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,650
and to go out and be curious and to 
learn new things can be very exciting.

1453
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:52,370
And so what it seems to be is that 
there's,

1454
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,850
there's a rate of learning that's too 
fast and that hurts you.

1455
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,510
That's what makes you cry.
But if you get the rate just right,

1456
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,523
you're just opening up enough novelty so
that you can benefit from the 

1457
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,810
possibilities that gives you a dopamine 
kick.

1458
01:10:05,811 --> 01:10:06,644
Fundamentally,
you can benefit from the possibilities 

1459
01:10:08,721 --> 01:10:12,470
without being overwhelmed by the,
by the unexpected element of it.

1460
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:15,290
And you can tell when that's happening.
And this is one of the coolest things as

1461
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,230
far as I'm concerned.
This is an,

1462
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:19,730
I learned this partly from piaget.
It's like,

1463
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,460
you know,
in order to withstand suffering,

1464
01:10:22,461 --> 01:10:24,320
let's say your life has to have some 
meaning.

1465
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,990
Okay,
well that that means a bunch of things.

1466
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,823
It means that part of the way that you 
overcome suffering is by making the 

1467
01:10:31,221 --> 01:10:34,430
suffering into something meaningful.
And I don't mean that metaphysically,

1468
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:36,500
I mean it technically you've made a 
mistake,

1469
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,930
it causes you suffering,
you learn something about it.

1470
01:10:39,050 --> 01:10:42,110
You don't make that mistake again.
It's real adaptation.

1471
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:42,944
It's not,
it's not defense against death anxiety 

1472
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:46,970
or something like that.
It's real adaptation.

1473
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,073
But more importantly,
the reality that you learned through 

1474
01:10:50,991 --> 01:10:53,710
pain is the oldest reality.
We'll say it's,

1475
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:55,970
it's really old.
It's as old as nervous systems.

1476
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:56,804
And so you've adapted so that you've 
learned to transform your knowledge 

1477
01:11:01,641 --> 01:11:06,560
structures in a way that will minimize 
your potential exposure to future pain.

1478
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:10,310
Add a rate you can tolerate or maybe 
even enjoy,

1479
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:13,950
and so what's happening is you don't 
actually like static.

1480
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:15,263
It bores you,
but you don't like being thrown into 

1481
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,620
chaos.
It's like no little bit of,

1482
01:11:19,621 --> 01:11:20,454
that's fine.

1483
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:21,653
What you want is you want to be opening 
up your no old structures on the 

1484
01:11:23,701 --> 01:11:26,850
periphery to transformation,
voluntary transformation.

1485
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:27,803
That's voluntary exploration and letting
those things manifest a little bit of 

1486
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:34,230
interest in chaos and so you have a 
little bit,

1487
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:35,064
you put a little feeler out there that 
you're willing to let die and it comes 

1488
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,360
apart and you gather a bit of 
information,

1489
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,630
it comes back together stronger and you 
do that all the time.

1490
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,464
If you're,
if you're smart and you're looking for 

1491
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:47,070
new information foraging for new 
information,

1492
01:11:47,310 --> 01:11:48,143
and that means you keep taking little 
bits of yourself apart and 

1493
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:54,360
reconstructing them and over time that 
keeps you alive and active.

1494
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,213
You know,
part of the reason you're alive is 

1495
01:11:56,191 --> 01:11:58,140
because you're dying all the time,
right?

1496
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:00,840
All the cells in your body,
like if they don't die,

1497
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:02,400
you get cancer and that that's it.

1498
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,240
You're,
you're done.

1499
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:04,403
You're a very,
very tight balance between death and 

1500
01:12:06,151 --> 01:12:08,220
life at every,
every single level,

1501
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:11,640
including the cognitive level.
And it's not that fun to learn something

1502
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:14,460
because you have to kill something you 
already know in order to learn it.

1503
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,180
That's another Yeti observation cause 
you,

1504
01:12:17,181 --> 01:12:18,014
you're always interpreting something 
within a structure and if that 

1505
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,680
interpretation is wrong,
even in a micro way,

1506
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:26,670
you have to kill that structure and it's
a biological structure,

1507
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,150
it actually hurts to kill it.
But maybe you can generate something new

1508
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,090
in its stead and if you get the dynamic 
right,

1509
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,940
let the rate right,
then you find that exhilarating,

1510
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,860
not painful.
And that's,

1511
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:40,350
and that's well you can tell when you're
doing that.

1512
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:41,184
As far as I can tell,
you can tell when you're doing that 

1513
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:43,644
because you're engaged in the world in a
meaningful way and what your nervous 

1514
01:12:46,621 --> 01:12:47,454
system is doing is signaling to you that
you're not in a static place that's 

1515
01:12:51,511 --> 01:12:52,080
death.

1516
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,210
You're not in a chaotic place.
That's death.

1517
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,223
You're balanced between the static and 
the chaotic such that the static 

1518
01:12:58,351 --> 01:13:02,910
structures are transforming at exactly 
the right rate to keep you on top of the

1519
01:13:02,911 --> 01:13:06,420
environmental transformations.
And so you're surfing,

1520
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:08,250
you know,
in Hawaii,

1521
01:13:08,251 --> 01:13:09,084
surfers surfing was sacred.
Well that's why it's like can you tell 

1522
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:14,130
someone how to surf?
Well,

1523
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:14,964
you can't because they have to go out 
there and dynamically interact with the 

1524
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:20,520
wave,
but they can stay on top of the wave and

1525
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,090
that's what you have to do and if you're
staying on top of the wave properly,

1526
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:27,160
then it's exhilarating.
And that's the kind of meaning that,

1527
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,403
that it rejuvenates you literally.
It makes you able to tolerate the 

1528
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:34,530
suffering in life and it's not 
metaphysical precisely.

1529
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:37,290
It's because that is what you're doing 
at that moment.

1530
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:40,080
You're,
you're overcoming your limitations.

1531
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,480
And of course that's what you have to do
in order to,

1532
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:43,793
to know and to learn because you want to
be doing both of those things at the 

1533
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:47,034
same time.

1534
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,170
That's what you do when you play a game 
properly.

1535
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,110
Your parents say it doesn't matter 
whether you win or lose,

1536
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:53,580
this is a phd,
an observation.

1537
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,640
It's how you play the game.
What does that mean?

1538
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,193
Well it means that you should play the 
game in a manner that increases the 

1539
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:01,404
probability that you're going to be 
invited to play many games in the 

1540
01:14:03,451 --> 01:14:05,070
future.
Perfect.

1541
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,820
So you master the skills of the game,
but at the same time you master a set of

1542
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:09,654
medis skills,
which is the skills remained constant 

1543
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:16,000
across transforming sets of games.
And that's what it means to play fair.

1544
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:19,570
That's a bloody basis of morality as far
as piaget was concerned.

1545
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,030
It's so damn smart.
You know,

1546
01:14:22,031 --> 01:14:25,780
cause you think all interactions have 
this game like quality,

1547
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:26,614
there's sort of bounded and but there 
are commonalities across all the games 

1548
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,333
and you want to extract out the 
commonalities and you want to learn to 

1549
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:36,034
inhabit the universe that's made out of 
the commonalities between games and 

1550
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:41,290
that's what it means to be a good 
person.

1551
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,730
Roughly speaking.
You know,

1552
01:14:42,731 --> 01:14:45,370
it varies to some degree from culture to
culture obviously,

1553
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:48,160
because each culture is a game unto 
itself.

1554
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,500
But there's something that transcends 
that.

1555
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:53,890
That's the nature of games across game 
contexts.

1556
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:54,933
And you know that,
you know that because you can tell the 

1557
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,830
difference between a game and and 
something that isn't the game instantly.

1558
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,203
Everyone knows.
And it's not like there's only one kind 

1559
01:15:02,951 --> 01:15:05,710
of game.
There's hockey say and there's,

1560
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:10,960
there's a world of warcraft.
I know it's way out of date,

1561
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,030
but so am I.
So it's not surprising.

1562
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,120
So,
but the fact that those things are very,

1563
01:15:16,121 --> 01:15:17,440
very different in,
in many,

1564
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:19,660
many ways.
It doesn't stop you from identifying the

1565
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:21,400
underlying commonalities.
You know,

1566
01:15:21,401 --> 01:15:24,310
their games and their,
they're like stories in a sense.

1567
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,580
So,
and that's a Piagetian.

1568
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:30,160
That's a Piagetian observation.
Very,

1569
01:15:30,161 --> 01:15:30,994
very smart.

1570
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:34,293
So why do you develop?
Well it's because your previous idea 

1571
01:15:37,511 --> 01:15:38,860
there,
your previous frame,

1572
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,540
micro frame,
let's say,

1573
01:15:40,910 --> 01:15:44,370
doesn't fit the circumstance.
And so something happens.

1574
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,700
It,
you go like this,

1575
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:47,470
what's up?
Well,

1576
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:48,304
the world isn't what you thought and 
there's something wrong with your 

1577
01:15:50,261 --> 01:15:51,094
knowledge structure.
And this is partly what makes piaget a 

1578
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:55,360
pragmatist.
You see the pragmatists,

1579
01:15:55,361 --> 01:15:58,180
American School of Philosophy,
William James and his followers,

1580
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,960
they knew that we had bounded knowledge.
We don't have infinite knowledge.

1581
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:02,741
And so they thought,
well,

1582
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:03,574
that means we can't really be right 
about anything because we're definitely 

1583
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,550
wrong.
And so how is it that you can operate in

1584
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:11,290
the world given that you're always 
wrong?

1585
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:12,423
And the answer is
you set up a procedure that has rules 

1586
01:16:17,231 --> 01:16:20,890
for what constitutes true within the 
procedure itself.

1587
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,920
So you play a game and at the same time 
you set up the rules.

1588
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:24,581
So you might say,
well,

1589
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:25,780
is this joke funny?

1590
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,060
And then the answer is,
well,

1591
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:31,450
do people laugh now when I tell the 
joke,

1592
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,610
do they laugh?
And if the answer's yes,

1593
01:16:33,611 --> 01:16:35,710
then it's funny enough you've,
you've,

1594
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,920
you've taken a particular definition of 
funny,

1595
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:41,950
you've transformed it into a local 
phenomena.

1596
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:46,930
And if your behavior matches the 
prediction in that local area,

1597
01:16:46,931 --> 01:16:48,250
you say,
well that's true enough.

1598
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:49,084
Is it like transcendently funny.
Well maybe you'd have to tell it to 200 

1599
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:54,730
different groups of people to figure 
that out.

1600
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:55,564
But mostly it's,
it's funny enough so that when I 

1601
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,320
predicted what would happen when I told 
the joke,

1602
01:16:59,321 --> 01:17:00,154
that's what happened.
And you don't predict it by the way you 

1603
01:17:01,871 --> 01:17:04,090
desire it.
It's not the same thing.

1604
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,250
Cause prediction has no motivation in 
it,

1605
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,620
but desire does and we're always 
motivated,

1606
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,190
always,
always motivated.

1607
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:11,593
So well,
here's a way of thinking about the Ph 

1608
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,700
Eddie and system.
So two year olds,

1609
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,493
they're very
chaotic and they bounced between one 

1610
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:24,290
highly motivated emotional state to 
another.

1611
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,453
And so the first thing that the two year
old has to do is get his or her act 

1612
01:17:30,290 --> 01:17:33,590
together more or less inside.
And so,

1613
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:34,963
you know,
two year olds still have tantrums and 

1614
01:17:35,991 --> 01:17:40,010
they still cry a lot and they still run 
around like mad being joyful crazily,

1615
01:17:40,011 --> 01:17:40,844
which you have to train out of them 
right away because it's nothing but 

1616
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:43,304
disruptive.
And it's one of the most painful things 

1617
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:45,614
about being a parent.
It's like 90% of the time you're going 

1618
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,110
stop having fun,
stop having fun.

1619
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,153
You know,
and then you turn into a teenager and 

1620
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,900
your parents get what they asked for.
And so,

1621
01:17:56,901 --> 01:18:00,740
but because positive emotion is so 
impulsive and so chaotic,

1622
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:04,100
it's really hard to manifest itself.
It manifests it within a,

1623
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:05,203
within a predictable environment.
And so you're dampening down your 

1624
01:18:07,911 --> 01:18:08,744
child's enthusiasm nonstop.
It's but it has to be regulated because 

1625
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:12,733
happiness is impulsive and chaotic and 
people don't like to think that because 

1626
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:16,431
they think,
well,

1627
01:18:16,431 --> 01:18:17,300
we should be happy.

1628
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,440
It's like Mannix or happy,
but they're maniacs.

1629
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:23,240
That's where the word comes from.
Like they're just,

1630
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:28,280
it's not good.
There are two happy way too happy,

1631
01:18:28,281 --> 01:18:29,114
like someone who's way too stoned on 
math or on cocaine and I mean that 

1632
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:34,910
technically because it's,
they're very similar.

1633
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:36,643
They're very similar biochemical states,
so and and cocaine produces happiness 

1634
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:42,643
pretty much in its pure form.
So does meth very rapidly and so it's 

1635
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:47,870
just not good.
You know,

1636
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:50,330
you lose judgment.
He happy.

1637
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:53,600
People do not have good judgment.
They're too happy they're here,

1638
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:55,010
they get dopey.
It's like,

1639
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:56,173
you know,
it's like irrational stock market 

1640
01:18:57,291 --> 01:18:58,790
bubbles.
Oh boy,

1641
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:00,980
it's always going to go up.
It's like,

1642
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:03,650
no,
no,

1643
01:19:03,651 --> 01:19:04,484
it's not always going to go up,
but that's what you think when you're 

1644
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:07,910
happy.
Anyways,

1645
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:08,953
the two year old has to get all these 
motivational systems sort of hammered 

1646
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:13,430
into one thing internally.

1647
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,593
Now in some sense from the Piagetian 
perspective that happens within the 

1648
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:19,780
child,
he thinks of the child is egocentric,

1649
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:20,750
but,
and,

1650
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,583
and that that development takes place 
internally and then it's not until the 

1651
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:24,374
child's,
let's say about three that it can learn 

1652
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:26,833
to bring it's controlled unity into a 
unity with another controlled unity and 

1653
01:19:31,371 --> 01:19:32,204
make a game that happens around three.
And so what happens is that instead of 

1654
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,870
the child only pursuing his or her 
goals,

1655
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,030
although modulated by the social 
environment,

1656
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,193
the child is able to communicate with 
another child and establish a shared 

1657
01:19:44,781 --> 01:19:46,850
goal.
And that's what happens when they play.

1658
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,850
And so obviously you play monopoly.
That's what you're doing.

1659
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:53,060
But when you play Peekaboo,
you doing the same thing.

1660
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:54,073
It's like with your parents,
you're actually playing with object 

1661
01:19:55,821 --> 01:19:58,040
permanence.
Dad's gone,

1662
01:19:58,340 --> 01:19:59,330
Oh look,
dad's here.

1663
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:00,021
Ha Ha,
look,

1664
01:20:00,021 --> 01:20:01,760
he's their dad's gone.

1665
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:02,930
Dad's here,
dad's gone.

1666
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,550
Dad's here.
The Kid Ben,

1667
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:05,384
you can do that for like three hours.
They'd ever get tired it because every 

1668
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,020
time you reappear,
it's an,

1669
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:12,960
it's a miracle in you watch babies.
It's so funny.

1670
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,060
Like you go like this and they go,
then you pop back out and they,

1671
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,860
they're so happy,
they're just overjoyed.

1672
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:21,840
And then you take yourself away and 
they're like,

1673
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:23,490
what's going on?
What's going on?

1674
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,900
Bang.
You reappear.

1675
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:26,550
They don't have a real memory,
you know,

1676
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:27,384
it's like reality is manifesting itself 
in all its freshness moment by moment 

1677
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:33,773
and they can't remember it.
There are neurological conditions that 

1678
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:37,440
do that.
So sometimes,

1679
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:39,210
and there are people who that this has 
happened to.

1680
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,044
So to get hippocampal damage and so they
can't move short term information into 

1681
01:20:43,141 --> 01:20:45,750
longterm storage.
And there's this one guy,

1682
01:20:45,850 --> 01:20:46,683
it very interesting case,
he was a concert pianist and he had a 

1683
01:20:49,081 --> 01:20:53,550
hell of a neurological injury and um,
he could still play the piano,

1684
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:55,050
he couldn't remember ache,
he couldn't,

1685
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,420
he had amnesia and he couldn't move 
information from short term storage into

1686
01:20:59,421 --> 01:21:00,150
long term storage.

1687
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:01,920
So as far as he was concerned,
it was,

1688
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:05,100
it was always like 10 days before he had
his accident.

1689
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,130
He never got passed out.
He was stuck in that moment and then,

1690
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:10,620
but he could still play the piano.
And by was so interesting.

1691
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:11,454
You watch him,
there were films of him before he sat 

1692
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:13,974
down to play the piano.
He'd have like a seizure and then he 

1693
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,420
could play the piano procedural memory 
that was intact.

1694
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,433
And then at the end he kind of have a 
little seizure and then he'd go back to 

1695
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,733
being who he was.
But he had these notebooks and all he 

1696
01:21:25,231 --> 01:21:27,930
did was write in them over and over.
The same thing.

1697
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,360
It's as if,
I've never seen this before.

1698
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:34,620
It's as if I've never seen this before.
It's as if I've never seen this before.

1699
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:40,010
So he's in this ecstatic state where 
everything was novel and new and pure in

1700
01:21:40,081 --> 01:21:42,510
paradise,
but there was no continuity.

1701
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:44,520
And so when his wife would come to visit
him,

1702
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:48,270
he would just be overwhelmed to see her 
overwhelmed every time.

1703
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,310
And even if she just left the room and 
came back in,

1704
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:52,770
it was exactly the same thing.
It's just like the kid.

1705
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:56,520
It's like no object permanence.
And every time the face appears,

1706
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:58,140
it's,
it's a staggering,

1707
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:00,450
and you can see that in the reflexes of 
the child.

1708
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:03,030
And that's,
that's without object permanence.

1709
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:06,330
And so that's what piaget was talking 
about with regards to object permanence.

1710
01:22:06,540 --> 01:22:07,620
It's very,
very cool.

1711
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,130
So anyways,
the two year old's a collection of these

1712
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:11,964
sort of random motivations,
more or less gets his or her act 

1713
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:18,450
together by about three if they're being
socialized properly.

1714
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:19,673
And that means that the parents are 
doing their best to make the child 

1715
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:25,830
acceptable to other children.
That's your damn job as a parent,

1716
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:27,083
you have to understand that because if 
your child is an acceptable to other 

1717
01:22:31,051 --> 01:22:34,230
children,
they won't play with your child and then

1718
01:22:34,231 --> 01:22:35,064
your child will be lonesome and isolated
and awkward and they will never recover 

1719
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,730
because if the kid doesn't get that 
right between two and four,

1720
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:42,833
it's silver.

1721
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,913
They're never going to learn it.
The other kids accelerate forward that 

1722
01:22:45,931 --> 01:22:48,810
kids left behind and it's not a good 
life for that kid.

1723
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:50,730
They don't learn how to play with 
others.

1724
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:51,953
And then they're done.
And there's a huge literature on trying 

1725
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:57,540
to rectify antisocial children,
say from the age of four on,

1726
01:22:57,541 --> 01:22:59,760
it's like,
no you can't.

1727
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:01,163
And you can go ahead and read three,
400 papers on rectification of social 

1728
01:23:05,411 --> 01:23:07,030
behavior.
And figure it out for yourself.

1729
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:10,060
But I did that for about five years and 
it was a while ago,

1730
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:11,830
but I know the literature hasn't 
changed,

1731
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,500
so you got to get it right between that 
period.

1732
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:15,423
You got to get the kid together enough 
so they can control themselves well 

1733
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:19,714
enough so that they can adopt a mutual 
frame of reference with a peer so that 

1734
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:24,424
they can start using that to scaffold 
their development further and become 

1735
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,290
more and more sophisticated and social 
interactions.

1736
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,303
And that's what you're,
you're acting as a proxy for the social 

1737
01:23:32,381 --> 01:23:33,790
environment.
As a parrot,

1738
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:38,140
that's what you're doing now.
A gentle proxy and informative proxy,

1739
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,830
maybe even a merciful proxy,
but a proxy nonetheless,

1740
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:43,780
because they're not going to be around 
you forever.

1741
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:46,600
They're going to be out there among 
people who don't really care about them.

1742
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:48,940
And if they don't have something to 
bring to the table,

1743
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:49,774
at least the ability to cooperate,
they're going to be lonesome and 

1744
01:23:52,691 --> 01:23:54,400
isolated,
and that's not going to be good.

1745
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,560
Well,
here's a,

1746
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,910
here's an,
here's an idea.

1747
01:23:57,911 --> 01:24:01,060
So as you're moving from what is to what
should be,

1748
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:02,830
you're in this little frame of 
reference,

1749
01:24:02,831 --> 01:24:04,900
this little game,
this little Piagetian game.

1750
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,390
Sometimes you get what you want or 
predict,

1751
01:24:07,391 --> 01:24:11,680
that's on the left hand side that makes 
you happy and it validates your frame.

1752
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,610
So if the frame keeps working across 
different circumstances,

1753
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:17,200
you get a reward from that.

1754
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:20,320
The reward produces dopaminergic kick 
that makes you feel good,

1755
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:24,490
but the dopamine also enhances the 
strength of the circuitry that underlies

1756
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:27,610
that particular representation.
That's what reinforcement is.

1757
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,060
It's different than reward.
Reward is what you feel,

1758
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:31,953
let's say roughly speaking.
Reinforcement is the effect of the 

1759
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:38,500
dopamine bathing the neurological 
tissues to make it stronger and grow.

1760
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:39,723
And so if the neurological tissue 
underlies a sequence of actions that 

1761
01:24:42,251 --> 01:24:43,084
produces the desired outcome,
there's a biochemical kick that 

1762
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:46,384
strengthens the nervous structures that 
were activated just before the good 

1763
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:51,820
thing happens.
And so that's how something,

1764
01:24:51,821 --> 01:24:54,160
you know that's valuable,
gets instantiated,

1765
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,980
and if it fails,
instead you get punished.

1766
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:58,600
Pain,
anxiety,

1767
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,583
and that,
that starts to extinguish that 

1768
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:03,064
circuitry.
And we don't know how that works 

1769
01:25:04,451 --> 01:25:05,284
exactly.
We don't know exactly if those circuits 

1770
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:07,414
then start to die because they can 
degenerate across time or if what 

1771
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:12,760
happens is you build other circuits that
inhibit them.

1772
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:15,460
So it's like you've got this knowledge 
structure,

1773
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:16,294
it's built into you and once it's there 
there's not really much getting rid of 

1774
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:20,230
it,
but you can build another one that tells

1775
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:21,064
it to shut up.
Not sort of what happens when you're 

1776
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:23,374
addicted to drugs.
So cocaine bathes the tissue that was 

1777
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:27,934
active just before you took the cocaine 
with dopamine and so that gets stronger 

1778
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:31,324
and stronger and stronger and stronger.
And so you're basically building a 

1779
01:25:34,151 --> 01:25:37,930
cocaine seeking monster in your head and
that's all it wants.

1780
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:42,250
And it has rationalizations and it has 
emotions and it has motivations and it's

1781
01:25:42,251 --> 01:25:44,620
alive,
but it wants one thing.

1782
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:46,660
And the problem is once you build that 
thing,

1783
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:47,494
especially if you nail it a couple of 
hundred times with a powerful 

1784
01:25:49,421 --> 01:25:50,254
dopaminergic agonist like cocaine,
that thing is one vicious monster and 

1785
01:25:54,071 --> 01:25:57,910
it's alive and it's in there and you 
can't get it to go away.

1786
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,180
The only thing you can do is build 
another structure to shut it up.

1787
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,730
But the problem is is that as soon as 
you get stressed,

1788
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:07,160
it interferes with that new structure 
and the old thing comes popping back up.

1789
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,740
Not Good.
I wouldn't recommend it.

1790
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:11,900
And the faster acting.

1791
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:13,200
Okay,

1792
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,560
those dopaminergic agonist,
star cocaine is a good example.

1793
01:26:16,561 --> 01:26:19,050
But so is math.
The faster they hit you,

1794
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:22,020
which is often why people inject them 
instead of starting them.

1795
01:26:22,021 --> 01:26:27,000
Say the faster that transformation from 
steady state to dopaminergic bath,

1796
01:26:27,001 --> 01:26:29,940
the bigger the kick is.
And so you know,

1797
01:26:29,941 --> 01:26:32,970
so speed of introduction of the 
substance matters,

1798
01:26:32,971 --> 01:26:33,804
which is why you drink shots instead of 
drinking say wine or beer because 

1799
01:26:36,781 --> 01:26:40,680
alcohol has very similar,
very similar effects.

1800
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:41,963
So

1801
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:51,020
all right,
so if you get what you want,

1802
01:26:51,021 --> 01:26:53,090
well then you feel good.
But not only do you feel good,

1803
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:56,450
but the frame itself is validated.
And if you don't get what you want,

1804
01:26:56,451 --> 01:26:58,490
well then not only do you not get what 
you want,

1805
01:26:58,491 --> 01:27:01,070
but the frame itself starts to come 
apart at the seams.

1806
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:04,040
And the question and parties,
how far should the frame come apart?

1807
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:07,700
How deeply should you unlearn something 
when you make a mistake.

1808
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:09,470
God,
it's a very,

1809
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:10,790
very,
very hard problem.

1810
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,450
And I'll show you a partial solution to 
it is a very useful thing.

1811
01:27:14,451 --> 01:27:17,120
And this is a Piagetian idea too.
Let's see.

1812
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:20,030
Yeah,
I'm going to go to this for a minute.

1813
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:21,140
So,
so

1814
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:24,830
I'm going to decompose something for 
you.

1815
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,083
And,
and this is partly to give you an 

1816
01:27:27,411 --> 01:27:29,250
introduction to the way behaviors to 
think,

1817
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:33,230
but it's also to help unpack how the P 
is Yeti and notions work.

1818
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:34,423
And so from a Piagetian perspective,
high order abstractions are actually 

1819
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,910
made of what's common among actions and 
perceptions.

1820
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,253
So,
and those things are unified in some 

1821
01:27:43,491 --> 01:27:44,324
sense.
So an abstraction isn't what's common 

1822
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:49,430
across sets of objects.
It's more like what's common across sets

1823
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:52,580
of perceptions and actions.
And so it's a hard thing to understand,

1824
01:27:52,581 --> 01:27:54,530
but,
but this will help you understand.

1825
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:55,364
Okay.
So let's say you want to be a good 

1826
01:27:56,391 --> 01:27:58,280
person,
these kind of abstraction.

1827
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,540
All right?
And then you think,

1828
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,100
well,
what does it mean to be a good person?

1829
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:03,950
It's a box.
It's an empty box.

1830
01:28:04,750 --> 01:28:06,020
No,
it's a box.

1831
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:06,913
And it says good person on the outside,
but it's full of things and might even 

1832
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:11,990
be full of transforming things.
So,

1833
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:14,150
but you know what it means.
You say good person,

1834
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:16,190
you kind of know when you kind of know.
But you know,

1835
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:18,560
if we started talking about details,
we might start to argue,

1836
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:19,730
but it's like pornography.

1837
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:21,290
You know it when you see it.
Okay,

1838
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:22,940
so what does it mean to be a good 
person?

1839
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:25,040
While we could decompose it,
we could say,

1840
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:27,530
well,
if you're one way of being a good person

1841
01:28:27,531 --> 01:28:28,364
is to be a good parent.
And you basically say that being a good 

1842
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:32,900
parent is a subset of being a good 
person,

1843
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:36,710
right?
Because person is bigger than parent and

1844
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:40,220
maybe it'd be to be a good employer and 
to be a good sister and to be a good,

1845
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,383
you know,
to be,

1846
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:43,460
to be a good,
a good partner,

1847
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,680
sort of on the same level of 
abstraction.

1848
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:50,360
So you decomposed good person into your 
major functional roles,

1849
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:52,130
let's say,
and you're good at all of them,

1850
01:28:52,190 --> 01:28:53,570
whatever that means.
Well,

1851
01:28:53,571 --> 01:28:56,180
let's say if you're a good parent,
well,

1852
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:57,014
you have to have a good job because 
otherwise you starve and soda your 

1853
01:28:59,091 --> 01:28:59,540
children.

1854
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,670
So at least you have to financially 
provide in some manner.

1855
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,880
That's a subset of being a good parent.
It's not the only subset.

1856
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:08,460
And then to be a good,
to have a good,

1857
01:29:08,461 --> 01:29:09,294
be a good parent,
you also have to take care of your 

1858
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,244
family.
And so you could decompose that into 

1859
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,590
play with baby or complete meal.
You might say,

1860
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:18,150
well,
if you can take care of family,

1861
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:21,360
you can either order a meal or you can 
cook one.

1862
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:22,223
It's like good for you.
And so then you're cooking a meal and 

1863
01:29:25,201 --> 01:29:25,561
you think,
well,

1864
01:29:25,561 --> 01:29:26,394
what do you decompose that into?
Well now you're starting to get to the 

1865
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,090
micro level.
Say,

1866
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,920
because let's say you're making 
Broccoli.

1867
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:33,053
So you take the Broccoli out of the 
fridge and you put it on the cutting 

1868
01:29:36,271 --> 01:29:38,040
board.
That's actually action.

1869
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:38,874
That's not abstraction.
It's actually something you're doing 

1870
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:41,550
with your body.

1871
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,850
So the abstraction grounds itself out in
micro activity,

1872
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,743
actual action,
that's the connection between the mind 

1873
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:50,520
and the body.
And so you're cutting Broccoli,

1874
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:52,350
right?
But that's not abstraction.

1875
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:56,640
And so if you take apart these higher 
order moral abstractions,

1876
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,474
what happens is you decompose them into 
action perception sequences and they're 

1877
01:30:00,571 --> 01:30:01,500
embodied.
Now,

1878
01:30:01,501 --> 01:30:05,460
Piaget's basic claim is you build the 
dam abstractions from the bottom up.

1879
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,640
That's his,
that's the fundamental piagetian claim.

1880
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:13,220
It's so the kid comes into the world 
with some reflexes and starts building a

1881
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:17,130
body of embodied knowledge out of that 
interaction with other people.

1882
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,530
And then they start playing games in 
that abstracts.

1883
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:20,364
But,
but they moved from the bottom of the 

1884
01:30:22,171 --> 01:30:23,004
hierarchy,
which is actual micro-actions up to the 

1885
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:27,420
top of the abstraction world.
And so it's,

1886
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:30,540
this is how you boost yourself up.
Little bitty stories.

1887
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,590
What little bitty stories at the bottom,
cut Broccoli,

1888
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:37,110
you know,
and then cut corn here,

1889
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,490
set table,
do dishes,

1890
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:40,230
complete meal,
take care of your family,

1891
01:30:40,231 --> 01:30:41,910
be a good parent,
be a good person.

1892
01:30:42,690 --> 01:30:43,523
And you know,
one of the propositions that I am 

1893
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,020
offering you in this class is that to be
a good person,

1894
01:30:49,021 --> 01:30:50,760
you're actually not stuck in one of 
these.

1895
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:51,773
To be a good person means that you're 
the thing that transforms these things 

1896
01:30:54,301 --> 01:30:55,134
continually.
And so that's what's at the top of the 

1897
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:58,980
hierarchy.
And that's basically the hero story,

1898
01:30:58,981 --> 01:31:02,420
which is you're in a state of being,
an anomaly occurs,

1899
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,980
you allow it to demolish you,
and then you rebuild.

1900
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,950
And that's at the highest end of the 
moral hierarchy.

1901
01:31:07,951 --> 01:31:10,800
And that's also essentially a Piagetian 
claim.

1902
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,203
So,
so let's think about emotional 

1903
01:31:13,831 --> 01:31:14,664
regulation because this is a really good
schema for understanding emotional 

1904
01:31:17,641 --> 01:31:18,474
regulation.
How upset should you get and how do you 

1905
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,770
calculate it?
Because if you make a mistake,

1906
01:31:22,771 --> 01:31:24,420
you wake up in the morning and your side
hurts,

1907
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:25,830
okay,
you,

1908
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:27,750
it's the first symptom of pancreatic 
cancer.

1909
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:30,060
You're dead in six months,
a hundred percent chance,

1910
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,910
or you know,
you pulled a muscle.

1911
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:34,890
Well,
which is it?

1912
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:36,181
You might say,
well,

1913
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:38,430
the chances of the pancreatic cancer 
low,

1914
01:31:38,431 --> 01:31:41,640
but they're not zero.
And like infinite times,

1915
01:31:41,641 --> 01:31:45,030
any proportion is a very large number.
So you might be thinking,

1916
01:31:45,031 --> 01:31:47,730
why don't you just have a screaming fit 
anytime ever,

1917
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:50,760
any little thing happens to you,
which is exactly what happens.

1918
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:52,170
By the way,
if you're two years old,

1919
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:53,790
right?
That is what you do.

1920
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,100
So,
and it's because you don't know.

1921
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,530
You don't know,
like things fell apart.

1922
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,700
What does that mean?
Could be anything.

1923
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:02,380
Well that's no good.
Well,

1924
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:05,260
so let's say you're arguing with your,
with your partner,

1925
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,490
you know,
and they,

1926
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:07,324
uh,
I dunno if they make a lousy meal or 

1927
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:10,840
maybe no meals and you're kind of sick 
of it,

1928
01:32:10,841 --> 01:32:11,674
you know?
And so you say you're a bad person and 

1929
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:18,130
what's the evidence?
Not only are you a bad person,

1930
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:18,964
but you've always been a bad person and 
the probability that you're going to 

1931
01:32:22,391 --> 01:32:24,700
improve in the future,
it looks to me to be zero.

1932
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,030
It's like what's the person supposed to 
do punch you,

1933
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,200
right?
Really,

1934
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:31,840
because there's no room in there for any
discussion.

1935
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:35,230
You're done.
It's like you're horrible

1936
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:40,210
and you don't change and you've always 
been horrible and you've never changed.

1937
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:43,390
And you know,
inferring from that into the future,

1938
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,490
you're going to stay horrible and you're
not going to change.

1939
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:48,280
Well at any argument can go there 
immediately.

1940
01:32:48,730 --> 01:32:51,010
It's a really bad idea and it happens 
all the time.

1941
01:32:51,011 --> 01:32:53,620
And this is why people can't have a 
civil discussion.

1942
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:55,180
You know,
they can't say,

1943
01:32:55,940 --> 01:32:56,773
MMM,

1944
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,750
here's an example.
So you've got your four year old,

1945
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:05,000
you want them to clean up their room,
and so it's full of toys.

1946
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:06,260
Let's say they're three and a half.

1947
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:09,980
You look at it and say,
look,

1948
01:33:09,981 --> 01:33:10,641
you know,
clean,

1949
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:12,110
clean this up,
clean up your room.

1950
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:13,093
So you shut the door and you go away and
you magically hope that when you come 

1951
01:33:15,261 --> 01:33:16,094
back the room will be clean.
But of course the child has no idea in 

1952
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:21,590
all likelihood at that age,
or maybe it's two and a half,

1953
01:33:21,591 --> 01:33:22,424
something like that,
they don't know what clean up our room 

1954
01:33:23,991 --> 01:33:25,520
means.
That's like way up here,

1955
01:33:25,521 --> 01:33:26,354
man.
It's like you told your child there's 

1956
01:33:28,311 --> 01:33:30,050
mass every,
be a good person,

1957
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,153
you know,
and then you come back in half an hour 

1958
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:35,690
and they're no better person than they 
were and you get upset.

1959
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:37,970
It's like you can't do that.
You have to say,

1960
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:39,443
you see that teddy bear and you know 
that that kid knows how to see a teddy 

1961
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:44,054
bear and they know how to pick it up 
because you've watched him see a teddy 

1962
01:33:46,341 --> 01:33:47,174
bear and pick it up and you know that 
the child knows the name of the teddy 

1963
01:33:49,461 --> 01:33:49,880
bear.

1964
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:50,713
It's teddy bear.
And so you point to the teddy bear and 

1965
01:33:53,361 --> 01:33:54,830
you say,
do you see that teddy bear?

1966
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,470
And they go yes.
And you say that's good pat,

1967
01:33:57,471 --> 01:33:58,304
pat.
And they get a little kick the DOPA 

1968
01:33:58,941 --> 01:34:01,250
beans.
So that's happy day for the kid and then

1969
01:34:01,251 --> 01:34:03,680
they smile at you.
So you feel pretty good about that too.

1970
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,903
And then you say,
you think you could pick up the teddy 

1971
01:34:06,411 --> 01:34:07,820
bear and they say,
yeah.

1972
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:10,490
And so they go over there and not every 
kid by the way,

1973
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:13,460
but they go over there and they pick up 
the teddy bear and it's like,

1974
01:34:13,461 --> 01:34:14,294
it's a good day for both of you.
And then you say you see that little 

1975
01:34:16,161 --> 01:34:19,130
space on the shelf cause you know they 
know what a shelf is and you know,

1976
01:34:19,131 --> 01:34:21,380
they know what is space is.
And you say,

1977
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,273
take that teddy bear and put it in the 
shelf and they go over there and they 

1978
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:27,020
put it in the shelf and then they look 
at you and you're smiling.

1979
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:31,640
And so the probability that they'll do 
that again is now increased because bull

1980
01:34:31,641 --> 01:34:32,474
watching new smile produces a 
dopaminergic kick and you've just 

1981
01:34:34,461 --> 01:34:35,294
strengthened those circuits.
So I would highly recommend that you do 

1982
01:34:37,521 --> 01:34:40,130
that with your children and with your 
partners.

1983
01:34:40,460 --> 01:34:42,350
Right?
You watch them like,

1984
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:47,330
like a sneaky person and every time they
do something that you actually want them

1985
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:48,164
to do,
you'd notice and you give them a little 

1986
01:34:49,311 --> 01:34:50,990
pat on the head.
Yeah.

1987
01:34:51,050 --> 01:34:53,390
And then they like you,
that's cool.

1988
01:34:53,391 --> 01:34:54,224
But if they don't,
if you don't want them to like you 

1989
01:34:55,431 --> 01:34:57,860
because you hate them and then you won't
do but,

1990
01:34:57,980 --> 01:34:59,390
and you think,
well I don't hate them.

1991
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:00,680
It's like,
Oh yes you do.

1992
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:02,450
You just think about the last month,
man,

1993
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:04,640
there's been 20 times you absolutely 
hated them.

1994
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:08,660
And maybe that's the predominant emotion
and that's not so good over time.

1995
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:12,230
So when they do something good,
if you really want to screw things up,

1996
01:35:12,470 --> 01:35:15,830
watch like a hawk and wait until they do
something good and then punish them.

1997
01:35:16,130 --> 01:35:18,230
That's really fun.
That is,

1998
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:21,530
that really messes with them.
And people do that all the time.

1999
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:25,580
So if you really want to muck things up,
you can even do it more subtly.

2000
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:27,020
You can wait until they do something 
good,

2001
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:27,854
especially if they've never done it 
before and they're just kind of 

2002
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:31,970
tentatively trying it and then you can 
ignore them.

2003
01:35:32,390 --> 01:35:33,223
That's a really good one.
That's even better than punishing them 

2004
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:37,910
because at least when you punish them,
you're paying attention.

2005
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:40,730
If you ignore them.
It's like that's,

2006
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:41,723
that's just perfect.
Also takes hardly any effort on your 

2007
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:45,200
part.
So that's an additional plus.

2008
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:47,143
So anyways,
so if you're having a discussion with 

2009
01:35:48,921 --> 01:35:49,754
someone,
it's like what you're doing with this 

2010
01:35:50,541 --> 01:35:51,291
kid,
you know?

2011
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:54,410
It's like you say,
maybe you're negotiating about meals.

2012
01:35:54,411 --> 01:35:56,160
You don't start with,
you're a bad person.

2013
01:35:56,190 --> 01:35:57,710
That's way the hell up here.
You know,

2014
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,693
you blow the whole person's Schema right
out from underneath them and you might 

2015
01:36:01,701 --> 01:36:02,534
as well get divorced,
which is what will happen if you keep 

2016
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:05,000
doing that.

2017
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,890
Soon you'll roll your eyes at each 
other.

2018
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,600
That means you're getting divorced by 
the way.

2019
01:36:08,810 --> 01:36:10,190
So if you ever watch it,
he does.

2020
01:36:10,191 --> 01:36:12,080
I'm serious.
There's good empirical data on that.

2021
01:36:12,081 --> 01:36:14,840
Once you're at the eye rolling stage,
there's no going back.

2022
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,090
So you should intervene way before that.
It's discussed that ai rule,

2023
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:25,330
once you've hit disease carrying rodent 
status in your mate's eyes,

2024
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:29,900
there's no common back.
So anyways,

2025
01:36:29,901 --> 01:36:30,734
so what you do,
if you want to have a conversation with 

2026
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:34,480
someone,
that's a corrective conversation.

2027
01:36:34,481 --> 01:36:38,690
As you sort of take a Ph,
Eddie and attitude and the attitude is

2028
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,580
go to the highest level of resolution 
that you can manage.

2029
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,253
So let's say,
and that's what you're doing with the 

2030
01:36:45,831 --> 01:36:48,380
kid.
It's like clean up your room,

2031
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,490
be a good person.
It's like,

2032
01:36:49,491 --> 01:36:51,110
no,
they don't know any about anything about

2033
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:51,944
that,
but they do know how to pick up a teddy 

2034
01:36:52,611 --> 01:36:53,150
bear.

2035
01:36:53,150 --> 01:36:56,750
And then maybe you think cleaning up 
your room is a hundred things like that.

2036
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:58,063
And so you have to teach the child each 
one of those hundred things and then 

2037
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:05,270
they learn this is the scheme.
They learn what's the same across all of

2038
01:37:05,271 --> 01:37:07,820
those different actions that's clean,
right?

2039
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:11,720
Pick up the teddy bear,
put away the lady goes make your bed.

2040
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,880
What those have nothing in common 
really.

2041
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:15,680
Like the motor outputs completely 
different.

2042
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:18,380
But they fall under the heading of 
clean.

2043
01:37:18,590 --> 01:37:19,423
But unless you fill the heading of clean
with all the subordinate categories of 

2044
01:37:22,371 --> 01:37:25,940
the action perception sequences that 
make up clean kid can't do it.

2045
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:27,103
And so partly what you're doing by 
attending to your child constantly is 

2046
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:30,824
noticing where they are in the 
construction of this hierarchy and they 

2047
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:36,470
start way down here,
right?

2048
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,420
And so that's why you play peekaboo for 
example.

2049
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:41,240
It's like they can do that and you can,
you know,

2050
01:37:41,241 --> 01:37:42,074
you interact with them cause you can 
watch you do a little something and if 

2051
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:45,950
they respond you got some sense that 
you're,

2052
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:46,963
you're at the same level.
And kids in playgrounds do that with 

2053
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,020
each other right away.
So if you,

2054
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:51,973
if you see two three year olds together,
say they're fairly sophisticated for 

2055
01:37:54,111 --> 01:37:56,370
three year olds,
what they'll do is they'll start playing

2056
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,560
a little primitive game with each other.
Like dog,

2057
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,423
like a dog.
You know what a dog does when it wants 

2058
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:02,610
to play.
It kind of goes like that.

2059
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,970
And that's what kids do and that's what 
adults do too.

2060
01:38:05,971 --> 01:38:07,830
It's a plague,
it's play invitation.

2061
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:10,920
It's like I'm ready but you're smiling.
It's not like I'm ready.

2062
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:12,053
It's and so you can tell the difference 
between a play fight and play and kids 

2063
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:15,864
can too.

2064
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,823
So it's an invitation to play.
And so if you're interacting with your 

2065
01:38:19,231 --> 01:38:20,064
little kid,
they got that place circuit man that 

2066
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:25,200
thing's in there.
Like when there from birth I think cause

2067
01:38:25,201 --> 01:38:28,470
you can play with the kid right from 
birth at least something like peekaboo.

2068
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:31,230
And so you're on the same wavelength 
fundamentally.

2069
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,273
And then you interact with them and you 
see if they're following what you're 

2070
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:36,810
doing is what I'm doing when I'm 
lecturing more or less,

2071
01:38:36,811 --> 01:38:37,644
I'm watching you guys and seeing if 
we're more or less on the in the same 

2072
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,400
shared space,
you know,

2073
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:48,330
and we want the space to be expanding.
Cause if it's just staying the same,

2074
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:51,870
well you might as well play whatever you
play on your computer.

2075
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:56,010
It has to be expanding at the same time.
That's optimal.

2076
01:38:56,011 --> 01:38:57,780
And so when you're playing with your 
kid,

2077
01:38:57,781 --> 01:38:58,614
you put them on that developmental edge 
where they're undoing and then 

2078
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:03,630
rebuilding their little skills.

2079
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:05,160
You know,
you can do that.

2080
01:39:05,161 --> 01:39:09,750
Like I had this memory from when I was a
little kid a while back and I remembered

2081
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:11,663
I used to go over to these people's 
house with my father and my mom and it 

2082
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:17,790
was way up in northern Alberta and these
people were Russian immigrants,

2083
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:21,180
children of Russian immigrants,
and they had a farm house way,

2084
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,133
way out in the country,
way out by the way there where the 

2085
01:39:23,761 --> 01:39:27,060
railroad actually ended.
If you walk north from there,

2086
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,133
you'd walk until you hit like southern 
Europe without fun running into another 

2087
01:39:31,861 --> 01:39:33,570
person.
It was way the hell out in the middle of

2088
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:36,030
nowhere and in new ways.
They had a nice house,

2089
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:37,200
like a warm house,
you know,

2090
01:39:37,201 --> 01:39:39,510
they had three kids and they were way 
older than me,

2091
01:39:39,511 --> 01:39:41,490
but it was real fun,
comfortable place to go.

2092
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:45,090
And I used to sit in the living room 
with my father and his friend.

2093
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:46,620
I said,
whose name was nick?

2094
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,830
And Nick was a really playful guy.
I really liked him.

2095
01:39:49,831 --> 01:39:51,870
He was like my surrogate grandfather and
I used to,

2096
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:53,610
I don't think I was more than about 
three.

2097
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:55,433
I'd sit there and I tried to hit his 
foot with my fist and he would be 

2098
01:39:58,711 --> 01:40:00,000
talking to my dad,
you know?

2099
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:01,290
And my dad would say,
Jordan,

2100
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:02,760
don't bother nick.
Nick would say,

2101
01:40:02,761 --> 01:40:03,594
well he's not really bothering me.
And because dad was checking it out to 

2102
01:40:06,181 --> 01:40:08,790
see if I was an annoying twerp or if I 
was a fun kid,

2103
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,370
you know,
cause it's a fine line.

2104
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:12,803
And so I tried to hit his foot and he 
would move it and I had this memory 

2105
01:40:15,811 --> 01:40:17,610
allow back and I thought,
wow,

2106
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:19,140
that was a good memory.
And I thought,

2107
01:40:19,141 --> 01:40:20,490
what is going on there?
Exactly.

2108
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:23,160
And I realize,
well he sharpened when he was sharpening

2109
01:40:23,161 --> 01:40:24,300
me up,
you know,

2110
01:40:24,301 --> 01:40:25,890
it's like I was aiming at something.

2111
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:29,160
You're aiming at something.
If you're pointing your eyes at it,

2112
01:40:29,161 --> 01:40:30,690
you're pointing your whole damn soul out
it.

2113
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:31,524
You're aiming at something and you're 
trying to get your behaviors and your 

2114
01:40:33,601 --> 01:40:37,740
conceptions in line and organized so 
that you can attain that aim.

2115
01:40:38,130 --> 01:40:39,930
That's what people do.
You know,

2116
01:40:39,931 --> 01:40:41,410
we throw rocks at things.
We've,

2117
01:40:41,490 --> 01:40:43,560
we've,
we fire arrows at things.

2118
01:40:43,561 --> 01:40:46,320
We shoot guns at things,
we aim at things.

2119
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,200
Our whole body is that platform for 
aiming.

2120
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:52,020
And I was trying to aim at his feet and 
he'd move his feet,

2121
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:52,854
you know,
but he'd let me hit at what now and 

2122
01:40:54,071 --> 01:40:56,950
then.
And so let's say you're a rat.

2123
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:58,840
Okay.
Because like I said,

2124
01:40:58,841 --> 01:41:00,250
a rat's,
a good model for a person.

2125
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,920
Let's say you're a little rat,
a juvenile male,

2126
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:06,610
and you want to play because you wanted 
to play and you'll work to play.

2127
01:41:06,611 --> 01:41:08,110
And that's how we know you want to play.

2128
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:10,170
If we're experimental psychologists 
cause you'll brush,

2129
01:41:10,360 --> 01:41:11,193
but button push like mad to get access 
to an arena where you can wrestle with 

2130
01:41:14,681 --> 01:41:15,514
another little rat.
And so rats wrestle just like human 

2131
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:20,830
beings and they even pin each other just
like human beings.

2132
01:41:20,831 --> 01:41:21,664
And they love that.
And so if you put little rat a in with 

2133
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:27,220
little rat B and little rat B is 10% 
bigger,

2134
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:31,150
little rat B can stomp the hell out of 
little rat a all the time.

2135
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:32,553
So they go out there and have a little 
dominance competition and little rat B 

2136
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:39,720
is going to win because he's bigger.
So now he's dominant rat.

2137
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,450
So then they play and they wrestle and 
little rat a loses.

2138
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:48,370
And then next time they both know that 
little rat a is the inviter because he's

2139
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:50,830
subordinate.
So he's the one that has to go up to the

2140
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:52,480
big rat and go,
you ready?

2141
01:41:52,810 --> 01:41:54,220
And the big rat.
Then we'll wrestle.

2142
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:55,083
However,
if you repeatedly pair them and the big 

2143
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:02,320
rat doesn't let the little rat win,
at least 30% of the time,

2144
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,840
the little rat won't invite him to play 
anymore.

2145
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,480
And that was Jaak Panksepp who figured 
that out.

2146
01:42:07,481 --> 01:42:12,481
And that is mind boggling because it 
tells you like the bit,

2147
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,160
there's a,
there's an ethical basis for play that's

2148
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:18,040
so deep that the damn rat and their 
rats,

2149
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:20,560
right,
not known for their sense of fair play.

2150
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,723
The big red has to let the little rat 
win 30% of the time or the little rat 

2151
01:42:24,941 --> 01:42:29,890
will not play anymore.
And even rats know that it's so profound

2152
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:33,670
that discovery like Panksepp discovered 
the play circuit in mammals.

2153
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:34,623
That's a big deal.
That's like discovering a whole 

2154
01:42:35,561 --> 01:42:37,570
continent.
Like that's a big deal.

2155
01:42:37,571 --> 01:42:39,280
He should have gotten a Nobel prize for 
that.

2156
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:43,090
And to see that that's built in that 
sense of fair play,

2157
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:44,470
that's mind boggling.

2158
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,990
You know,
cause that's evidence for the biological

2159
01:42:46,991 --> 01:42:50,290
instantiation of a complex morality,
fair play.

2160
01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:53,680
Even if you can,
when you shouldn't all the time.

2161
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,723
Well.
So when I'm trying to hit nick's feet 

2162
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:56,913
with my hand,
like I'm really paying attention and 

2163
01:42:58,631 --> 01:42:59,464
he's moving it pretty well but now and 
then I get to nail it and I'm feeling 

2164
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:03,490
pretty good about that,
you know?

2165
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:04,324
And he makes a little bit more difficult
all the time so that my aim gets better 

2166
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:09,880
and better and I'm building up my motor 
coordination.

2167
01:43:09,881 --> 01:43:10,714
I'm building up my social skills because
I don't hit too hard and I don't cry 

2168
01:43:13,361 --> 01:43:16,720
when I Miss Because that just makes you 
annoying to play with.

2169
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,583
Right.
So I'm learning really complicated 

2170
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:22,000
things about how to go about finessing 
my aim.

2171
01:43:22,210 --> 01:43:25,090
And that's what you're doing with your 
kids and what are they aiming at?

2172
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:27,700
Well they aim higher and higher.

2173
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:32,410
So when my son was about two and a half,
we had him start setting the table.

2174
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,370
It's,
you don't say,

2175
01:43:33,370 --> 01:43:36,580
you know you want to take grandma's fine
China and to go set the table.

2176
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:41,170
It's like no you don't do that.
You say you know what a fork looks like.

2177
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:42,520
He goes,
yeah I see.

2178
01:43:42,521 --> 01:43:45,130
If you weren't at the forks are,
well that doesn't work.

2179
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:46,690
Cause the drovers way up here,
right?

2180
01:43:46,691 --> 01:43:48,400
So you have to hand him a fork.
You say,

2181
01:43:48,401 --> 01:43:49,234
look,
take this fork and go put it on the 

2182
01:43:50,501 --> 01:43:52,370
table and he's this high,
you know,

2183
01:43:52,371 --> 01:43:54,800
so he goes over to the table and he puts
the fork up here,

2184
01:43:54,801 --> 01:43:55,634
can't even see what he's doing.
He puts the fork up there and then you 

2185
01:43:58,341 --> 01:43:59,174
know,
he's reasonably happy with that and you 

2186
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:03,590
give them a path and then you go and 
give them a really sharp,

2187
01:44:03,591 --> 01:44:04,790
not no,
you don't do that.

2188
01:44:06,330 --> 01:44:08,780
Don't do that.
You give him a spode and you say,

2189
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:11,270
well go put the spoon beside the fork 
and you don't say,

2190
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:13,100
look,
you stupid kid,

2191
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:14,043
you've got to leave enough space between
the fork and the spoon so the plate can 

2192
01:44:16,941 --> 01:44:18,530
fit there.
Don't you know anything?

2193
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,270
You're stupid.
It's like,

2194
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:21,770
well that's right up here,
right?

2195
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,690
You're a bad kid.
No,

2196
01:44:24,020 --> 01:44:25,790
that's bad.
You don't do that.

2197
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:26,923
You go down here and you say,
well good micro routine adaptation 

2198
01:44:29,991 --> 01:44:30,824
there,
Chum,

2199
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:34,850
let's try it again.
You know when you build that up and like

2200
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:35,743
man,
you can't extend the kid passed its 

2201
01:44:37,371 --> 01:44:38,204
point.
His point or her point of exhaustion 

2202
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,190
because it's got to be a game and a two 
year old can probably only do that for,

2203
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,310
you can watch them and some are more 
persistent than others,

2204
01:44:46,311 --> 01:44:48,920
but 10 minutes,
15 minutes,

2205
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:50,263
you're pushing your luck.
You can take a two year old to a 

2206
01:44:51,741 --> 01:44:55,550
restaurant for about 40 minutes and 
expect them to sit and behave.

2207
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:57,410
But after that,
you know,

2208
01:44:57,570 --> 01:44:58,160
they're,
they,

2209
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,160
they're the will exhausts them.
All right.

2210
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:01,791
Well,
anyways,

2211
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:04,370
that's piaget and his nascent form 
fundamentally.

2212
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:05,204
And so if you,
if you remember that diagram and you 

2213
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:07,484
think about how that would be built from
the bottom up and how there would be a 

2214
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:13,510
stage transition every time those things
are learned,

2215
01:45:13,511 --> 01:45:16,250
you kind of got the essential elements 
of Piagetian theory.

2216
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,300
So we'll see you Thursday.
