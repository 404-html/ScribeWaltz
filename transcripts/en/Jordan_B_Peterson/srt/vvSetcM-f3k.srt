00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,180
Hi,
this video has two components,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,130
a three minute announcement of the 
remaining venues of my American 12 rules

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:13,131
for life tour and the new Canadian 
venues that will open up in July and 

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,271
August,
followed by a lengthy discussion with 

5
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:21,171
Ben Shapiro on the narrative substrate.
If human cognition derive from his new 

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Sunday Youtube video and podcast.
So either I'm in Denver,

7
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:32,310
Colorado today.
It's May 7th,

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,310
2018.
I'm going to give the fourth talk of my 

9
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:37,440
American 12 rules for life to her 
tonight.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,760
Or maybe it's the fifth.
First one was Toronto in Washington,

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,730
then Chicago and Detroit.
Now Denver.

12
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,380
So yes,
I guess that's the fifth.

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm announcing the remaining venues 
today in the u.

14
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,701
s where tickets are still available and 
the dates and places for my Canadian 

15
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:59,040
tour.
10 Canadian cities in July.

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:04,041
So there's tickets remaining to 10 
venues in the United States on May 

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,410
Twenty Third Philadelphia on May 29th,

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,140
I'll also be enriched vic in Iceland,
so tickets are available for those.

26
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,470
And then I'm going to be touring Canada 
in July and August the 19th in Toronto 

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,530
on the 20th in Hamilton.
That's July again.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,260
Twenty first in London,
Ontario,

29
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,740
22nd in kitchener onto on the 23rd in 
Ottawa on the 26th in Vancouver on the 

30
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:05,061
27th in Calgary on the 28th in Edmonton 
in August on the 14th at Regina and on 

31
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:13,020
August 15 in saskatoon,
Saskatchewan.

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,480
You can find out more about that if you 
go to Jordan b Peterson.com

33
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,710
and look up events.
That's Jordan Peterson.com

34
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,950
under events also in this video is a 
discussion that I recently did last 

35
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,710
week.
In fact it was just released with Ben 

36
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,230
Shapiro as part of his New Sunday 
podcast initiative and I think we had a 

37
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,181
very good conversation and so the rest 
of this video is taken up with the 

38
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:42,720
conversation that I had with Ben.

39
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,290
I think we got farther on the issue of 
how human perception and cognitive 

40
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:54,951
function is nested inside a fundamental 
narrative substrate and we related that 

41
00:02:55,561 --> 00:03:00,561
to modern findings,
neuropsychology related to hemispheric 

42
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:04,260
function.
I think it was an excellent discussion 

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,260
and so I'm very happy to bring it to 
you.

44
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,580
There's some ads in it because I took it
directly from Ben's video,

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,890
so anyways,
so that's the tour.

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,450
Philadelphia,
Houston,

47
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,590

48
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,090

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,650

in June and May and then rick to vic and

51
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:26,191

and then the candidate tour in July and 

52
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:26,191
August.
Toronto,

53
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:26,860
Hamilton,
London,

54
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,030

Edmonton,
Regina and Saskatoon.

57
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:37,141
And as I said,
you can find out about that at Jordan b 

58
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:41,040
Peterson dotcom events.
Thank you very much and I hope that you 

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,100
can come to one of the talks so they 
seem to be going really well so far.

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,350
We sold out a very large number of them 
and the people seemed quite enthusiastic

61
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:55,351
and I've been able to get farther in my 
thinking than I was in my book and each 

62
00:03:55,871 --> 00:04:00,871
of the talks is designed to eliminate a 
different element of the,

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
let's say,
the 12 rules and the topics that are 

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:06,720
associated with that.
Um,

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,450
so thanks very much and I hope you enjoy
the discussion with Ben Shapiro.

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,100
There's lots of times in your life 
you're not going to be happy.

67
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:18,101
And so that's not gonna work.
You want to have something meaningful 

68
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,160
that's the boat that will take you 
through the storm.

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,830
Well,
here we are with Jordan Peterson and I 

70
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,101
could not be more excited to talk with 
he best selling author of 12 rules for 

71
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,241
life and I will talk with them.
But first I want to say thanks for our 

72
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,061
sponsors over at Helix sleep.
So there's nobody on the planet like 

73
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,061
you.
So why would you buy a mattress belt for

74
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,291
everyone else?
Working with the world's leading sleep 

75
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,571
experts?
Helix sleep developed a mattress that's 

76
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:46,571
customized to your specific height,
weight,

77
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:50,021
and sleep preferences.
So you can have the best sleep of your 

78
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:50,021
life and unbeatable price.
Here's how it works.

79
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,290
You go to [inaudible] dot com,
fill out their two minutes sleep quiz,

80
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,050
and they'll design your custom mattress.
They even customize each side for you.

81
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:57,710
And a partner in 2018 helix sleep has 
taken customized sleep to the next level

82
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,600
with their helix pillow.
It really is fantastic.

83
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,600
They're all new pillows are fully 
adjustable so you can achieve perfect 

84
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:04,600
comfort regardless of sleep position or 
body type effects.

85
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,140
Sleep has thousands of five star 
reviews,

86
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:10,100
plus you get 100 nights to try them out.
But a helix sleep.com/ben

87
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,640
guest right now and you'll get up to 125
bucks towards your mattress order.

88
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,730
That's [inaudible] dot com slash ben 
guest for up to $125 off your mattress 

89
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:18,830
order.
Again,

90
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:23,831
that's [inaudible] dot com slash Ben.
Guests get to deal with Ben Guests and 

91
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:23,831
make sure that they know that we sent 
you.

92
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,241
Okay.
So I could not be more excited to speak 

93
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:28,241
with Jordan Peterson.
Well,

94
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,570
as Jordan knows before the show,
we talk for an hour before the judges 

95
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:31,570
got interesting things we should have 
caught on tape,

96
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,650
but now we're actually going to get a 
chance to do it live.

97
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,110
So here is the Jordan's new book.
If you haven't bought it yet,

98
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:37,610
everybody on planet has bought this 
book.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,250
I was walking through the office today.
We didn't have a copy in the office.

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,520
The person,
the front desk had a copy of book just 

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,520
sitting on your desk.
So that's the way this works.

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,510
At 12 rules for life.
An antidote to casper,

103
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,520
fantastic book.
Obviously tapping all the best seller 

104
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,520
lists all over the world.
Jordan,

105
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,620
thanks so much for joining the show.
Really appreciate it.

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,630
Thanks for the invitation.
You know,

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,920
obviously your,
your prominence has just blown up in the

108
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
year and a half when we were talking 
before the show about why that is and 

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:02,920
why there are so many people who 
suddenly are very angry about you.

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,600
I notice there was an article in 
politico suggesting that young,

111
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,800
angry white males,
your now their leader.

112
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:11,060
So congratulations.
I wanted to ask you about that.

113
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,740
Why do you think that,
number one,

114
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,040
your profile has become so big of late 
and number two,

115
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:21,130
why do you think it is that so many 
members of the of the left are so angry 

116
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,731
about that?
Why are they characterizing people who 

117
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:24,731
listen to you as angry and enraged?
Young white men?

118
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:25,850
We could look at the the 
characterization

119
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,120
to begin with,
you know,

120
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,920
because I think it speaks to the 
pathology of the radical left instantly.

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,200
There are absolutely incapable of 
viewing the world except through group 

122
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,470
identity terms.
Know when.

123
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,810
So if someone comes out and disagrees 
with them,

124
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,380
then they have to characterize them by 
their fundamental group attribute,

125
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:47,381
whatever that happens to be.
Maybe it's gender because that's a 

126
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,980
favorite or maybe it's race and so angry
white men young.

127
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,810
There'll be go sexist,
ageist,

128
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,460
and racist all at once.
Right?

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,700
They're angry young white men.
Well,

130
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,590
it has to be that way.
If you're going to be the.

131
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,830
If you're going to play the left,
this game because that's the only way 

132
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,101
that you can look at the world and then 
if you can't make your opponent 

133
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:09,461
reprehensible in some manner and it's 
strange that they would attempt to make 

134
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,240
them reprehensible on the grounds of 
race,

135
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
age,
sex since that's precisely what they 

136
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,031
stand against hypothetically,
but if you can't make your enemy 

137
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,300
reprehensible along some dimension,
then you have to contend with them 

138
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,591
seriously and so you know,
if I'm not an outright right fascist 

139
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:30,371
like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos,
which was how I was characterized in 

140
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:34,481
Canada because the radical leftists 
can't even get their bloody insults 

141
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:34,481
straight.

142
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:38,380
He's like Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos 
because there's no difference between 

143
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:38,380
them.
Right?

144
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,030
No obvious difference.
It's just another attempt to pilloried 

145
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,260
as far as I can tell,
and I think that it's.

146
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,730
It's dreadful.
I really think it is.

147
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,220
There was an article written by the,
by,

148
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,280
I believe the editor of the New York 
review of books that was just 

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,801
republished in the globe and Mail.
Talking about the emergence of 

150
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:59,690
hypermasculinity and how I was somehow 
responsible for that are contributing to

151
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,480
it like most Fellini and I read that and
I thought,

152
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,460
yeah,
like miscellaneous and I thought,

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,290
okay,
so what are you doing?

154
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,230
I see you're,
you're defining masculinity are 

155
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,450
conflating masculinity and 
hypermasculinity at the same time.

156
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:18,200
Then your virtue signaling by being 
against hypermasculinity,

157
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:23,320
but really what you're trying to do is 
bring down whatever it is that's 

158
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,951
masculinity and what masculinity is in 
in this frame is something like 

159
00:08:26,951 --> 00:08:29,840
competence and so it's part of the 
radical leftists,

160
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,510
general war on competence.

161
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,510
It all as well,
which I think is one of the most 

162
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,660
pernicious elements of the culture wars,
the dissolution of hierarchies.

163
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:43,661
They the assumption that every hierarchy
has to be based on power and serve the 

164
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,950
needs of your group.
Whatever that happens to be,

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,040
that there's no such thing as competence
and so and then the other thing that's 

166
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,490
reprehensible about it because that's 
not enough,

167
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,640
is that it's just wrong.
Like there's.

168
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,060
I've got tens of thousands of letters 
from people and people come up to me all

169
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,060
the time on the street.
I'll give you an example.

170
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,160
This is a great story.
This is really touching.

171
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,550
So I was in la about a month and a half 
ago and I was downtown La and downtown 

172
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,501
La.
It's kind of rough and I was wondering 

173
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,811
around and with my wife and this young 
guy pulled the car up beside you,

174
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:21,320
knocked out and he was kind of a stylish
look in 21 year old Latino guy,

175
00:09:21,321 --> 00:09:22,080
something like that.

176
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,850
It was all excited.
He said,

177
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,010
he asked me who I was and I told him and
he,

178
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,330
you know,
that's what he had presumed and so he 

179
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:31,330
was kind of excited about that and he 
said,

180
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,101
look,
I've watched all your lectures and it's 

181
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:35,541
really helped me and I've been 
straightening out my life and trying to 

182
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:35,541
get my room clean.
Me laughed about that,

183
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,530
but you know,
developing some names and trying to tell

184
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:38,670
the truth and,
and look,

185
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,370
I've really fixed up my relationship 
with my father.

186
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,570
And so then he said,
wait,

187
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:43,440
wait,
just wait a minute.

188
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,370
And I thought,
sure,

189
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,670
sure.
And so he went back in the car and God 

190
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,280
is farther out of his car and he came 
over with his dad like they have their 

191
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,280
arms around each other and he said,
look,

192
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,650
we've really improved our relationship 
and they were both smiling away.

193
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,070
And you know that man,
if you're going to target me for that,

194
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,230
just go right ahead.
Sounds real white supremacist.

195
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh yeah,
yeah.

196
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,900
And,
and it's wherever I go now,

197
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,650
and this is one of the things,
this is the thing that's so wonderful 

198
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:09,660
about that,
all of this as far as I'm concerned,

199
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:13,110
is that people come up to me all the 
time and that's exactly what they say.

200
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,710
They say,
look,

201
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:16,260
I was lost,
aimless,

202
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,060
depressed,
nihilistic.

203
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,610
I'm anxious.
Drug addicted,

204
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,420
alcoholic wasting my time masturbating 
too much.

205
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,750
Although they don't generally use that 
particular example last essentially and,

206
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,330
and,
and hopeless in some sense.

207
00:10:33,331 --> 00:10:38,331
And I've been watching your lectures and
they've really helped and I've really 

208
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:41,451
been putting my life together and I'd 
been trying to say what I believe to be 

209
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,100
true and develop a vision.
And it's really helped and like,

210
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,540
and it's so overwhelming,
you know,

211
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,880
like if I'm doing book signings after a 
talk,

212
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,240
then they'll be a dozen people or more 
who and these aren't like I'm only 

213
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:59,181
talking to people for about 15 seconds,
but you can have a very intense 

214
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,720
conversation in 15 seconds and they'll 
say,

215
00:11:00,721 --> 00:11:01,230
look,
you know,

216
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,580
I like,
I was suicidal man.

217
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,610
Like I was really hanging onto the edge 
of the earth by my fingernails and I'm 

218
00:11:07,891 --> 00:11:09,870
better.
And they have tears in their eyes.

219
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:11,490
It's like,
it's amazing.

220
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,040
Middle with that goes a long way,
man.

221
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,090
I think that when I look at,
at your rise and look,

222
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,150
I talked to people who love what you do.
I mean,

223
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,610
every time I go on the road and I'm 
speaking at a campus,

224
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,910
you're the number one name that gets 
mentioned at people by people who come 

225
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,241
to my lectures.
And I think that the reason for that 

226
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:30,241
that I've,
that I've seen is,

227
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,681
is really twofold.
One is that one of the things that you 

228
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:35,740
really talk a lot about is the notion of
self discipline and purpose in your life

229
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:40,741
and control.
And the idea that you are in control of 

230
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:40,741
your decision making and your decision 
making matters,

231
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,040
that's one.
And the other is that you have,

232
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,070
you have a unique capacity to say no to 
things and when somebody says something 

233
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,170
to you that is illogical but popular,
that you have the capacity to say no.

234
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:55,171
That's what happened in that Kathy 
Newman interview that somebody was 

235
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:55,171
saying to you that made no sense

236
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:55,750
and you just said,
well no.

237
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,180
And then you just stood on that now and 
when you stand on that.

238
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:03,181
No,
I think it gives people a lot of 

239
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:03,181
courage.
Yeah,

240
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:03,181
well I mean the,
the,

241
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,110
the gender issue is really an 
interesting one because one of my 

242
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,680
professional domains of expertise is 
individual differences.

243
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,681
I'm,
I'm a personality psychologist and so I 

244
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:14,360
know the gender difference literature 
and it's,

245
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,310
it's a very solid literature.
Well first of all it's very solid.

246
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,140
It has a 30 year history once per 
psychologists got the personality models

247
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,970
down.
So that would be the big five model.

248
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,490
All empirically derived straight 
statistics,

249
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:29,140
right?
Brute Force empiricism.

250
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Nobody had a theoretical ax to grind 
with the big five except to say maybe 

251
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:37,990
there are human traits.
Maybe they're encapsulated in language.

252
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,840
We can use statistical techniques to 
find out what they are.

253
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,410
That was it.

254
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,840
That's the whole ideology,
so very,

255
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,430
very neutral.
As far as ideology,

256
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,860
school five traits emerge.
Okay.

257
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,050
Are there differences between the sexes?
Turns out there are all right.

258
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:58,051
They're not massive,
although a few some them across all the 

259
00:12:58,051 --> 00:12:59,890
traits you can separate men and women 
with about 75 percent accuracy,

260
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,980
so it's not trivial,
but you have to sum across all the 

261
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:04,980
traits.
Then another question comes up,

262
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,400
well,
are those differences social,

263
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,040
cultural or biological?
Okay.

264
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,690
We can test that.
We'll go around.

265
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:15,070
The world will look at cultures will 
rank order them in terms of the gender,

266
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:20,071
equality of their sociological policies.
We can do that with broad agreement from

267
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:25,591
the right and the left.
Then the hypothesis would be if gender 

268
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:28,480
differences decrease among more 
egalitarian societies,

269
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,320
then the gender differences are 
sociocultural or at least more associate

270
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:37,321
culture.
That's exactly the opposite of what was 

271
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:38,590
found repeatedly that pseudo science.

272
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,580
It's like,
no,

273
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,870
that's mainstream psychology.
Those papers have thousands of citations

274
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,900
and right.
The average humanities paper has zero 

275
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:48,900
citations,
right?

276
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,410
And then the next most common one has 
one,

277
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,210
3000.
That's an.

278
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,490
That's an unbelievable classic.
And,

279
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,470
and here's the other bit of fruit.
Like you say,

280
00:13:56,471 --> 00:14:01,471
well,
how do you know that you can trust 

281
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,301
someone's judgment about a fact.
The fact emerges despite their 

282
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,230
ideological presuppositions.
Okay,

283
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:10,180
so it's well known that the social 
sciences and the humanities have a,

284
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,390
have a left tilt and a lot of that's 
temperamental and the tilt has become 

285
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,410
more pronounced.
But as Jonathan hightest pointed out,

286
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,670
there are no conservatives among social 
personality psychologist or,

287
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,970
or,
or none to speak of.

288
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,360
Very few,
vanishingly few.

289
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,600
And if the field has a bias,
it is definitely and indisputably a left

290
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,900
wing bias.
Okay,

291
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,180
so you have to fight that if you're,
if you're a scientist,

292
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,390
right?

293
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,390
Even if you're left wing scientists,
you have to fight that because you want 

294
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,941
to get to the facts.
It was these social scientists who 

295
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:45,181
generated the data that suggested that 
the gender differences not only were 

296
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:45,790
real,
but that were bigger and to Galitary and

297
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:50,791
societies.
They didn't do that to grind the 

298
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:50,890
radiological acts because they're 
ideological.

299
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,610
Presupposition was,
no,

300
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:57,611
no.
You make the society you get with 

301
00:14:57,611 --> 00:14:57,611
Terrian men and women get more of the 
same.

302
00:14:57,611 --> 00:14:57,650
It's like,
nope,

303
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,600
they get more different.
Oh,

304
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,950
isn't that something?
And so then there's a corollary there,

305
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,680
which is all right.
You could still say,

306
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,350
and they're kind of pushing in this 
direction in Scandinavia,

307
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,490
boys and girls are different.
Men and women are different.

308
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,780
It looks biological,
but because people are malleable,

309
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,110
you could push the sociocultural 
structure harder and harder to minimize 

310
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,800
the biological differences.
Okay,

311
00:15:24,801 --> 00:15:26,690
well first of all,
maybe and maybe not.

312
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,470
Maybe you get a rebound and they'd get 
even like the kids would rebel.

313
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,210
That could easily happen,
but let's say,

314
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,080
okay,
you could.

315
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,320
The problem with that is,
is that if you see that much power to 

316
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:43,691
the state,
like you're basically giving the state 

317
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:43,870
the right to socialize your kids,
right?

318
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,070
It's like you,
you really,

319
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,410
you really,
you really want to do that.

320
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,411
I mean,
the people in Israel couldn't do that 

321
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:53,411
with the cabooses,
right?

322
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,410
It didn't work.
So people aren't going to give up their 

323
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:56,410
children to the state and thank God for 
that.

324
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,810
Well,
I mean this is one of the big questions 

325
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,441
that we were discussing earlier is that 
we were talking about the polarization 

326
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:02,920
in politics between right and left and 
obviously you're,

327
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,810
you're a psychologist,
you're a philosopher,

328
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,740
but you've been dragged almost kicking 
and screaming into this political sphere

329
00:16:09,741 --> 00:16:11,600
because everything has been so 
politicized.

330
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And so when you say,
when you say social science statistics 

331
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
and they are scientifically based,
you're called a racist.

332
00:16:17,521 --> 00:16:20,230
You're called the sexist or called a 
homophobe and all my.

333
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,440
Exactly.
So it was a.

334
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:26,441
Why is it that?
So why do you think it is that so many 

335
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:29,711
folks on the left who purport to be all 
about reason and science and and 

336
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:31,940
objective factors,
so willing to throw those out the window

337
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,720
the minute that it becomes politically 
inconvenient because you imagine that 

338
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,770
cognitive system,
so an interpretation of the world has 

339
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,010
levels there.
Axiomatic levels,

340
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,160
some fundamental presuppositions are 
more fundamental than others and you 

341
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:49,340
could say,
well,

342
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:54,341
the leftists historically maybe because 
of their atheistic rationality are more 

343
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:58,340
on the side of science than say the 
fundamentalists of any sort,

344
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,610
but when push comes to shove,
you find out how the axioms or are 

345
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,860
nested.
There's deeper axioms underneath that 

346
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,130
which is that all hierarchies are based 
on power and all power plays are based 

347
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,410
on group identity,
tribal identity essentially,

348
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,680
and that the entire history of the world
is nothing but a power play between 

349
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,650
between these different identity groups.

350
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,250
It's like,
okay,

351
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,610
well if the science indicates that some 
of that's wrong,

352
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,300
then do you alter those beliefs or do 
you alter the science?

353
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,130
And the answer to that question is,
well,

354
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:33,500
it depends on how you've hierarchically 
arranged those.

355
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,190
If the science is at the bottom,
then you alter your beliefs,

356
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,550
right?
If it's the scientific facts or the 

357
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,910
axiomatic some structure,
then you then you altered your beliefs.

358
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,520
If your beliefs are the axiomatic 
substructure,

359
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,470
then you alter the science.
While we've seen how that plays out,

360
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,180
and one of the things I've tried to do 
so to speak is to diagnose the axiomatic

361
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:55,290
structure.
It's like,

362
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,220
okay,
what's the.

363
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,570
What's the metaphysical presumption 
structure of the radical left?

364
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,070
Well,
what what it is is your basically your 

365
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:08,571
group.
Your groups are basically engaged in 

366
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:08,571
warfare,
right,

367
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:12,240
and the warfare is arbitrary except in 
so far as it serves your group.

368
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,460
Okay.
I don't buy any of that.

369
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:19,461
I think that's.
I think that's a route to certain 

370
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:22,011
disaster.
I think it's a degeneration into 

371
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:22,620
tribalism and that we will seriously pay
for it,

372
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
not only because it returns us to 
tribalism and tribes fight as the 

373
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,910
anthropological evidence for that is 
overwhelming,

374
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,260
right?
Tribes spite.

375
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,660
It doesn't even matter if they're 
chimpanzee tribes.

376
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Even chimpanzee tribes fight.
So not only do you regress to a 

377
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:44,721
tribalism,
but you also invalidate the one 

378
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:47,010
proposition that's been able to help us 
rise above the tribal,

379
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,800
which is the idea that the individual 
should be sovereign.

380
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,130
And so I think the culture war is about 
what's the proper framework within which

381
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:01,161
to view human identity and what's the 
relationship between the individual and 

382
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,220
the group in relationship to that 
identity.

383
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,000
And the leftist answer is it's all group
and it's all powered like.

384
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,970
Okay.
So just a second.

385
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:13,520
I want to ask you a little bit about 
some of the,

386
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:18,550
some of the more enlightenment minded 
thinkers who are out there right now 

387
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,330
because it seems like we've been 
discussing the big gap in,

388
00:19:19,331 --> 00:19:24,331
in Western civilization right now,
which is between the collectivists and 

389
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:24,331
the individualist,
if you were to put it broadly,

390
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:28,990
but I want to talk about some of the 
divisions among the individualist in 

391
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:28,990
just a second.
First,

392
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,150
I want to say thanks to our sponsors 
over at Birch gold.

393
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:34,151
So with the uncertainty of the of the 
market right now with all of the 

394
00:19:34,151 --> 00:19:38,021
volatility,
a lot of Americans are increasingly 

395
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:38,021
concerned about the security of their 
savings.

396
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:39,830
And the Federal Reserve obviously has a 
loose monetary policy.

397
00:19:39,831 --> 00:19:44,831
It's been shoring up recently,
but there's a lot of volatility in the 

398
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:44,831
markets.
Well,

399
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:45,230
this is the reason why I need to talk to
my friends over at Birch gold,

400
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:46,910
so vertical Dicom is the place to go.

401
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,830
If you want to put some of your assets 
in precious metals.

402
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Now I'm not saying take all of your 
money out of the stock market and push 

403
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,000
it and precious metals,
that'd be stupid,

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,610
but you should have a little bit in 
precious metals to hedge against 

405
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,801
inflation and volatility in the markets.
Vertical sells physical precious metals 

406
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:03,911
for your own possession.
They'll ship metal right to your front 

407
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:03,911
door and right now,
thanks to an irs tax law,

408
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,751
you can even move your Ira.
Are Eligible for a one k into an IRA 

409
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:08,300
backed by physical gold or silver if you
so choose.

410
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,480
It's a good option for people who want 
to ensure that their retirement savings 

411
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,590
are protected from the possibility of 
inflation or stock market volatility.

412
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,700
Gold group,
they have a really good long standing 

413
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,811
track record of continued success.
They've been advertising with me for 

414
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:22,811
years,
thousands of satisfied clients,

415
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,410
countless five star reviews and a plus 
rating with the better business bureau.

416
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,570
Ask All your questions about precious 
metals investing,

417
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:31,571
get all your answers,
and then contact Birch Gold's group to 

418
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:31,640
request a free information kit on 
physical precious metals.

419
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,800
They're comprehensive 16 page get shows 
how gold and silver can protect your 

420
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,190
savings,
how you can legally move that IRA or 400

421
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,440
k out of stocks and bonds and into a 
precious metals IRA.

422
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:40,610
If that's something you're interested 
in.

423
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,590
They get a no cost,
no obligation kit.

424
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,480
Head over to [inaudible] dot com slash 
[inaudible].

425
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,630
That's [inaudible] dot com slash Ben.
That also wants to know that we sent 

426
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:49,630
you.
Okay,

427
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,711
so Jordan,
one of the things that we've been 

428
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,481
talking about obviously is the big gap 
that I think we certainly agree on 

429
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:56,730
between the collectivists identity 
politics and,

430
00:20:56,731 --> 00:21:01,731
and the sublimation of science in favor 
of subjective politics that favors a 

431
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,470
power group.
Uh,

432
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,490
but I,
I want to talk a little bit about a 

433
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,411
division that is also now breaking out 
among those of us who I think would 

434
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:12,040
consider yourselves friends of the 
enlightenment.

435
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,180
So you consider yourself a friend of the
enlightenment style thinking at least in

436
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:21,181
the essence that individuality matters.
And if the individual is sovereign 

437
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:22,660
scientific nf at the end that it 
matters,

438
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:24,070
right?
Data matters are useful.

439
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,310
Exactly.
And,

440
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:26,200
and in this group,
you know,

441
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:31,201
I consider myself as part of this group,
people have started to call it the 

442
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:31,201
intellectual dark web.
Sam Harris is part of this group.

443
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,890
Uh,
there,

444
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:36,900
there are a wide variety of folks with a
lot of broad political differences that 

445
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,680
are part of this group.
But there are some real differences that

446
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,920
are broken out even among people who 
consider themselves part of this group.

447
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:46,921
Right?
Steven pinker has a different 

448
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:46,921
perspective on the world then,
then you do a,

449
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,190
I have a different perspective than Sam 
Harris does.

450
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:51,610
You and I have our differences probably 
on some matters of philosophy.

451
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,360
So where do you think that the 
vulnerability lies in the,

452
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,600
in the possibility of vivifying 
enlightenment mentality?

453
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,580
Because it seems to me that one of the 
big problems that's,

454
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:05,581
that's popping its head up above the 
water now is the rejection of the 

455
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:08,611
enlightenment in favor of this old style
tribalism that you've been talking 

456
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:12,391
about.
That we're now going to repeat history 

457
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,221
because we benefited so much from the 
enlightenment and we forget that things 

458
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:14,920
don't have to be this way,
but we've got so much nice stuff.

459
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:19,921
We live in so much freedom that we 
forget that if we just tossed those 

460
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,770
enlightenment ideals out the window,
things get really ugly again.

461
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,810
I think that's what unites us

462
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,260
well,
that,

463
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,920
that's the question is what,
what,

464
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,280
what do you toss out the window before 
things get ugly,

465
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:31,790
right?
And the enlightenment proponents,

466
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,920
you could say Harris,
you could say pinker,

467
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,050
um,
Charles Taylor in Canada,

468
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,130
they trace back the development of the 
modern self.

469
00:22:40,131 --> 00:22:45,131
Let's say Taylor wrote a book called 
sources of the modern self to the 

470
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:49,211
enlightenment.
And it's quite interesting because like 

471
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:52,180
if you look at the typical academic 
psychologists say their historical 

472
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,720
knowledge generally runs back about 15 
years.

473
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,760
And so because they're all concerned 
with the,

474
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,890
with the modern literature and there's 
some utility in that.

475
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,070
But the downside is they don't have any 
historical context.

476
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,020
So you read someone like Taylor and you 
think,

477
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:05,540
wow,
he's stretching it back 500 years,

478
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,070
you know,
but there's,

479
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:12,100
there's reading that goes way beyond 
that to look at the sources of the self 

480
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,210
and the source of the modern ethos,
and this is a huge bone of contention 

481
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,081
between people like me saying people 
like Harris and I think between people 

482
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:24,521
like you and people like us is that my 
sense is that the enlightenment values 

483
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:29,411
themselves are grounded in an ethos 
that's much deeper and much less 

484
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:29,510
articulated.

485
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,290
And that would be an ethos of metaphor,
image,

486
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,820
drama,
ritual,

487
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,170
religion,
art,

488
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:39,620
music,
all of that dance even for that matter,

489
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,890
the nonverbal,
the pattern recognition.

490
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,160
Ian Mcgilchrist has written a book 
called Master and his emissary,

491
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:50,030
which lays that out quite nicely with 
regards to hemispheric specialization.

492
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,210
It's kind of predicated on Elk Conan 
Goldberg's observation that the left 

493
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,321
hemisphere is specialized for what we 
know and the right hemisphere is 

494
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,190
specialized for what we don't know if 
that's an order chaos dynamic.

495
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,610
And the rough idea would be that the 
left hemisphere generates paradigmatic 

496
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,231
systems.
So that would be like the enlightenment 

497
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:11,231
system,
axiom predicated,

498
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,470
right?
Even stainable axiom predicated,

499
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,680
but that that entire axiomatic system is
based in a nonverbal,

500
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,780
in the nonverbal domain that's 
associated with while it would be 

501
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,161
associated with the right hemisphere,
but it would also be associated with 

502
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:29,630
deep motivations,
biological motivations and emotions.

503
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,990
And so because here,
here's one way of looking at it.

504
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:33,800
You think,
well,

505
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,830
how do you validate an axiomatic system 
of ethics?

506
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,940
And the answer is quite straightforward.
John Psj figured this out is you play it

507
00:24:40,941 --> 00:24:44,240
out in the world,
literally you acted out in the world and

508
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:49,241
then you watch each other's emotional 
responses and if the thing that you're 

509
00:24:49,241 --> 00:24:53,261
playing out,
if the axiomatic system that you're 

510
00:24:53,261 --> 00:24:55,331
playing out satisfies the motivations 
and the emotions of the people who are 

511
00:24:55,941 --> 00:25:00,941
engaged in that system,
then the system is justified and then 

512
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:00,941
you say,
well,

513
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,990
it's not just that their motivations and
emotions are satisfied.

514
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,020
It's more complex.
It's that the motivations and emotions 

515
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,471
of each individual are satisfied,
but not only now but now next week,

516
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,650
next month and next year.
So you have to extend it across time.

517
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,590
And not only my emotions and 
motivations,

518
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,240
but yours as well.

519
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,250
Now,
next week,

520
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,510
next month,
and across time.

521
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,580
So this,
there's terribly tight constraints that 

522
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,590
are placed upon an act.
An axiomatic system is validity.

523
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,750
Now the way jump,
piaget thought of that,

524
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:33,140
he said,
well,

525
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:38,141
think about it like a child's game.
A bunch of kids get together and they 

526
00:25:38,141 --> 00:25:41,651
decided to play pretend okay and pretend
is let's mortal the world,

527
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,650
right?
And,

528
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,620
and as a place to act,
because to pretend you don't,

529
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,200
right?
So the kids get together and they assign

530
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:49,820
roles and they say,
well,

531
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,470
you're going to be mom,
you're going to be dead,

532
00:25:51,471 --> 00:25:53,810
you're going to be the dog and we're 
going to play house.

533
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,780
And then they,
they acted out and what they're doing is

534
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:03,810
seeing if they can regulate the manner 
in which they're constructing the game 

535
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,140
so that everyone's emotions and 
motivations are so well satisfied that 

536
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,170
they want to continue the game.

537
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,820
Okay?
And so that's so cool.

538
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,940
So what it shows you is,
that's how an ethical system is,

539
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,570
is tested and justified.
It's like you play it out and you see if

540
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,580
everyone wants to keep playing,
and so that's a whole different 

541
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,300
methodology than the scientific domain,
right?

542
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:28,301
So the axiomatic system isn't.
The ethical axiomatic system isn't 

543
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,590
justified by reference to the scientific
method.

544
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,770
It's justified by reference to the 
emotional and motivational wellbeing of 

545
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,300
all the players of the game.
Now that game me emerges,

546
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,570
this is the second part of this and this
is so cool.

547
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,980
Then the question is,
well,

548
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:48,981
how does that game emerge?
And the answer is the same way that 

549
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:53,510
children's games emerges.
So what Piaget noted is that kids would 

550
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,920
get together and they play marbles and 
if they were young kids,

551
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,960
they could all play marbles say six,
six years old,

552
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,830
they can all play marbles.

553
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,360
And,
and if they were in a group,

554
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:05,361
they were playing marbles and it all 
worked out fine squabbles and all the 

555
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:05,910
kids would keep playing,
right?

556
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,670
Validating the game.
But if you took the kids out of the game

557
00:27:08,671 --> 00:27:10,140
and you said,
what are the rules of the game,

558
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,390
they would give completely disparate 
accounts.

559
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,900
So they knew how to do.
It was like the,

560
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,960
the wisdom was in the group,
the wisdom was fragmented enough among 

561
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,210
the individuals,
so if you pull the individuals out,

562
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:23,170
they'd give disparate accounts,
but if you put them altogether,

563
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,250
they could play the game,
but then if you waited until they were 

564
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,250
11 or 12 and you pulled them out of the 
game,

565
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,440
then they can tell you the rules.
Then at 14 or 15 they would be willing 

566
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:36,660
to.
This is with more sophisticated games,

567
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:40,290
they would be more willing to regard 
themselves as makers of the rules.

568
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Okay,
so here's how it happens in an 

569
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,751
evolutionary sense.
People going all the way back to our 

570
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,760
primate forebears organize themselves 
into functional hierarchies.

571
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,070
Okay?
And the hierarchies are complex and 

572
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,190
they're not just based on power.
Despite what the idiot marks is,

573
00:27:56,191 --> 00:28:01,191
say,
even if the wall has noted that 

574
00:28:01,191 --> 00:28:02,790
chimpanzee hierarchies are unstable,
if they're only based on power,

575
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,100
they don't last.
They generate into violence.

576
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,300
So you have a hierarchy that's,
that works,

577
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,690
but it's acted out.
No one knows why it works.

578
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,510
It works because everyone seems to be 
happy with it.

579
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,020
Okay?
And so those hierarchies get more 

580
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,701
complex and more sophisticated and then 
people start to observe them and talk 

581
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:22,701
about them.
It's like,

582
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,760
oh,
we've got this hierarchy here,

583
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,880
what's it like?
And then they spin off dramas about the 

584
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,091
hierarchy.
Here's a hero who climbed up the 

585
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:32,091
hierarchy and here's what a hero looks 
like.

586
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:36,200
Okay,
so then you get the idea of hierarchy 

587
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,930
and then you get the idea of the hero as
the person who moves up the hierarchy 

588
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:38,930
and generates it.
Okay.

589
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,860
Then out of that you get the extraction 
of the idea of the hero and then you get

590
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,200
development of that idea and it's out of
that.

591
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,230
You get the monotheistic religions and 
so it's like the procedure and the 

592
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,030
hierarchy come first.
No one knows what the rules are.

593
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,270
It's all played out the same way that 
we'll just play it out in the pack or 

594
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,420
chimpanzees play it out in their troop.
Then we wake up and think,

595
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:02,100
oh,
we live in a structure.

596
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,930
Here's the structure.
That would be,

597
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:04,650
oh,
Cyrus,

598
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,810
in the Egyptian mythologies.
Here's the structure,

599
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,350
here's how the structure goes wrong.
Here's what the structure does.

600
00:29:10,351 --> 00:29:12,240
Here's its tyranny,
tyrannical aspect,

601
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,960
here's what you have to do to generate 
the structure and to thrive it.

602
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,700
Okay?
That's even more important.

603
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,910
The hierarchy is important enough,
but what we want to know is how to 

604
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:22,910
master the hierarchy.
Okay?

605
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,940
That's where you get the mythologies of 
the hero.

606
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,090
Okay,
and then so then there's generates all 

607
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,491
sorts of different heroes because 
there's different ways of being 

608
00:29:31,491 --> 00:29:32,010
successful.
Then you have a panoply of heroes.

609
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,120
Then you think,
okay,

610
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:38,121
well now we've got all those heroes.
That's a set we can move,

611
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,480
pull back and say,
okay,

612
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,630
something about all these heroes is what
makes them heroes.

613
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,320
That's when you extract out the 
monotheistic savior,

614
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,920
because that's why in Christianity,
Christ is the king of kings.

615
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,040
It's actually,
you can think about it as a literal 

616
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,320
statement for forget about the religious
overlay.

617
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,070
It's like,
okay,

618
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,800
you got a bunch of people.
Some of them are kind of king,

619
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:00,820
like,
okay,

620
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:05,821
so you admire them.
It's like for whatever reason that is 

621
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:05,821
right.

622
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:06,220
It's not easy to figure out why you 
admire someone,

623
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,240
right?
That's complicated,

624
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,940
but let's say you've got to admire 
admirable people.

625
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,060
You start telling stories about that's 
why you go to a movie,

626
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,620
right?
You want to go watch someone.

627
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:16,600
You don't care about your board by.
No,

628
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:20,290
you want to go watch someone admirable 
and interesting or maybe the opposite of

629
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,040
that.
It doesn't matter.

630
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:22,870
It's the same thing.
Then you think,

631
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:27,871
okay,
well we've got all these admirable 

632
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:27,871
people.
They're generating the world properly.

633
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:32,250
That's what makes them admirable.
There is a principle they embody and 

634
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,170
that principle is the process by which 
the admirable world is generated.

635
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,920
That's the logos.
Okay?

636
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,890
That's the thing that's operative at the
beginning of,

637
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,020
and here's my.
Here's my question about about all of 

638
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,291
this because now we're really not 
talking about 12 rules for life as much 

639
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:46,291
as naps.

640
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:49,680
Meaning which is your first book which 
you're doing need the audio recording 

641
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:49,680
audio.
It's,

642
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,080
it's,
it's definitely a harder book,

643
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:55,280
a then 12 rules for life and a much more
complex book and a lot of ways than the 

644
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,080
12 rules for life.
So how universal are these systems?

645
00:30:56,081 --> 00:31:01,081
Meaning,
why isn't that the enlightenment only 

646
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:01,081
arrives at one time in human history,
in one place,

647
00:31:01,081 --> 00:31:04,921
in human history as opposed to if human 
biology is essentially consistent 

648
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:04,921
across,
you know,

649
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:07,420
across humanity.
Then why is it that that you know,

650
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,600
if at the,
at the apex of the levels you adapt with

651
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,120
the enlightenment idea which started 
this particular question,

652
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:18,330
then why is it that it only arrives in 
one place at one time as opposed to 

653
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:21,660
arriving in a variety of places in a 
variety of different kinds of great 

654
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,470
culture and that's okay.
The first thing we would say is the 

655
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,531
process by which this,
the hierarchy itself and success within 

656
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:29,680
the hierarchy is generated.

657
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,950
That's to be accounted over millions of 
years,

658
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,650
at least hundreds,
thousands of thousands of years,

659
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:38,290
but I would push it back because you can
see analogs in the chimps,

660
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,330
so 20 million years,
let's say.

661
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,480
That's a long time on that timescale.
The fact that the enlightenment values 

662
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,750
of in Europe 500 years ago before 
anywhere else,

663
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,140
it's like,
well,

664
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:50,850
who cares?
It's.

665
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,710
It's five old men long,
right?

666
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:58,180
If you put five 100 mineral men in line,
it's like it's yesterday,

667
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,730
it's this morning,
so we've.

668
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:04,150
We've evolved these hierarchical 
structures.

669
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,900
That's our culture.
We've evolved ways of maneuvering within

670
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:12,901
the hierarchical structures that are 
successful and now we've started to 

671
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,220
evolve ways of mapping our,
our adaptation,

672
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,640
not just adapting but mapping it.
Okay,

673
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,730
so how does the mapping occur?
First,

674
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,240
admiration,
second,

675
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,900
invitation of admiration,
and that would be drama.

676
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,390
It's like you,
you dramatize Shakespeare,

677
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:34,990
extracts out what's admirable and 
interesting and plays it out,

678
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:38,650
so that's the use of the body as a 
representational structure of the body.

679
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,030
So we act out what's admirable.
You think,

680
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:42,700
okay,
now we've kind of got the drama down,

681
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,600
were all captured by this drama.
It's like,

682
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,130
well then the literary critics come 
along,

683
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,540
the philosophers and they say,
oh,

684
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,800
what are the principles by which the 
admirable people operate?

685
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,510
It's like chimps woke up and said,
oh,

686
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,340
well some chimps are more successful 
than others.

687
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,220
What are the rules of success?
It's like,

688
00:32:58,221 --> 00:32:59,900
well,
there were no rules because they weren't

689
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:04,901
running by rules.
There aren't rules until you described 

690
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:05,600
the patterns.
Then you have a rule.

691
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,520
That's what happens with Moses by the 
women,

692
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,290
right?
Moses has a revelation.

693
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,830
Here's the rules.
It's like,

694
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,850
yeah,
we'd been living out those rules 

695
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,291
forever,
but we didn't know what they were 

696
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:17,291
because they weren't rules.
They were customs.

697
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:17,291
Right?
Okay,

698
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:22,211
so you start by mapping your customs in 
drama and story and that way you can 

699
00:33:22,921 --> 00:33:24,570
represent them and you can transmit 
them.

700
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,960
Then once you have them in your grip,
say the representative now not just act 

701
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,860
it out,
well then you can move one step backward

702
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:35,130
from them and you can say,
well,

703
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,860
what's the commonalities among these?
What are the general principles?

704
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,980
That would be the development of 
something like the code of Hammurabi,

705
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,210
right?
It's like,

706
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,650
well,
we've got all these customs.

707
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,510
What are they?
Right.

708
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,560
Revelation.
It's like,

709
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,080
Oh,
here's how you map the customs.

710
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,370
That's the decalogue.
It's the same idea.

711
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:55,790
So I took human beings are very long 
time to evolve their hierarchies,

712
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,280
to evolve their structures of success,
and then to have enough people around 

713
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,171
with enough spare time to engage in the 
cultural process of the artistic 

714
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:10,900
cultural process of mapping the adaptive
structure,

715
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:16,170
not only merges in mythology and drama,
then that lays the groundwork for 

716
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,470
philosophy.
Then the philosophers could come in,

717
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:20,560
especially once it's written,
like in the Judeo Christian Pantheon.

718
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:20,980
It's like,
oh,

719
00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:25,270
now we've got it written down.
Oh well we don't have to remember it.

720
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,840
We can read it and while we're reading 
we can think about it.

721
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,650
And so then out of that starts to come 
the semantic codes.

722
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,870
Well then you get the enlightenment.
It's like,

723
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,850
okay,
well here's a bunch of semantic codes.

724
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,390
It's like,
yeah,

725
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:38,100
yeah,
those are great.

726
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,570
So this is really interesting because 
you know,

727
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,050
if you read pinker or if regional 
Goldberg's new book,

728
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,150
essentially they attribute the 
enlightenment to Jonah.

729
00:34:45,151 --> 00:34:50,151
Colbert calls it the miracle it.
It's almost as though it accidentally 

730
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:50,151
occurred in a certain place at a certain
time.

731
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:52,220
Joan doesn't quite go quite that far.
I think to be fair to him,

732
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:57,221
but uh,
I think that that philosophy that this 

733
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:57,440
sort of sprang up randomly here,
uh,

734
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:02,441
is,
is very much embedded in a lot of Sam 

735
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:04,850
Harris is thinking a lot of thinking and
you're taking it further back.

736
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,760
But I do wonder if this may be an area 
of actual disagreements.

737
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:08,690
We have two of us.
It should be fun.

738
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,170
Are you attributing the growth of the 
Judaeo Christian ethic that emerges into

739
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:18,680
the enlightenment as also accidentally 
just pushing timeline further back?

740
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,830
You think it's accidental?
Okay.

741
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,100
I'm not making a reduction to start.
So the first thing is I'm going to say 

742
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,500
this is how religion evolved,
but I'm not saying,

743
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:33,710
I'm not saying that this explanation 
exhausts the phenomena because it's a 

744
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,520
very strange phenomenon.
It's very,

745
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:36,720
very strange,
but,

746
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,840
but that doesn't mean we can't generate 
a plausible evolutionary account.

747
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:45,350
So like if you have a bunch of motivated
emotional limited beings occupying the 

748
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:50,220
same territory and competing and 
cooperating for the same resources,

749
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,200
including the resource of cooperation 
which can generate more resources,

750
00:35:55,201 --> 00:36:00,201
is not a zero sum game.
There are going to be patterns of 

751
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,670
adaptation that emerged from that,
that are similar.

752
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,360
So here's a way of thinking about it.
If you put a bunch of kids together,

753
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,980
they're gonna evolve games,
right?

754
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,170
Well which games?
Well,

755
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,560
a bunch of different games.
Yeah,

756
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,590
but they're all games,
right?

757
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,380
So even though.
So that's the moral relativist element.

758
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,460
A bunch of different games.
But the moral absolute establishment is,

759
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:20,820
yeah.
Yeah,

760
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:24,480
but they're all games and the games have
to be playable,

761
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,930
which means they have to continue in an 
iterative way.

762
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,400
Right?
So that's a big constraint.

763
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,810
People have to want to play them.
So not only did they have to be games,

764
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,400
no,
and comprehensible to everybody hand 

765
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:39,400
enjoyable,
but people,

766
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,640
but they have to be self maintaining and
everyone has to want to play with them.

767
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,700
Okay.
That's the answer to the postmodern 

768
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,881
conundrum.
A plethora of potential ethical 

769
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,180
implications of the world and infinite 
variety.

770
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,200
Yeah.
Okay.

771
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:57,060
Fine.
Not an infinite variety of pragmatically

772
00:36:57,061 --> 00:37:02,061
applicable interpretations.
You instantly constrained the universe 

773
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:02,061
to while too,
to what?

774
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:07,370
Well,
this is why there's commonalities in 

775
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,511
mythologies.
It's like if you put enough people 

776
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:11,991
together in enough different places,
the commonality of the groups of people 

777
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,110
there because of the grounding in common
motivation and emotion and embodiment,

778
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,140
because we're embodied,
means that they're gonna generate 

779
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,470
hierarchies that are broadly similar 
with strategies of success within those 

780
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:28,500
hierarchies that are broadly similar 
with descriptions of the strategies that

781
00:37:28,501 --> 00:37:31,380
are broadly similar,
and so you could say in some sense,

782
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:36,650
the ethic that gave rise to the 
enlightenment is in place more or less 

783
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:36,660
everywhere.

784
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:41,990
Now.
It's tricky because not every 

785
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,230
hierarchical system is as functional as 
every other hierarchical system.

786
00:37:43,231 --> 00:37:45,210
Some of them can degenerate into 
tyranny.

787
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,390
We're talking about the set of all 
voluntarily playable games or something 

788
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,690
like that,
and that can degenerate out of that.

789
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:56,691
You're going to get common myths.
You have to and then that and that lays 

790
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,580
the groundwork that lays the groundwork 
for even our ability to communicate.

791
00:37:59,581 --> 00:38:00,160
Right?
Right.

792
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,170
So,
and this is,

793
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:02,640
the enlightenment dies.
They just,

794
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,190
they're not getting that.
So,

795
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,340
and this gets to,
I think,

796
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,550
the broader question that I know you and
Sam went on for three hours about,

797
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:11,370
about the nature of truth.
He has a particularly truth in the moral

798
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:12,000
sphere.
I think that.

799
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,540
Yeah.
Um,

800
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,770
and what would it be fair to say that 
you guys agree on the idea of truth in 

801
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:17,770
the scientific sphere that did you know 
if,

802
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,580
if something is that there is such a 
thing as objective truth or are you 

803
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,120
going to say we agree on a lot of that.

804
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,480
The question is to some degree,
why do scientists accept the idea that 

805
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,171
objective truth is true?
And then I would say we probably don't 

806
00:38:33,171 --> 00:38:37,401
agree about that because I would ground 
that in and Sam would ground out in the 

807
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:40,570
idea of an independently existing 
objective world,

808
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,040
right?
Which is a leap of faith,

809
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,930
more like my own actually than the 
pragmatist view.

810
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Right?
And if you believe that there's a god 

811
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:48,960
who's out there in the universe who 
created the structures and in particular

812
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,860
certain way than what he created is the 
truth.

813
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:55,861
And it is apart from you.
And if human beings didn't exist and 

814
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:55,861
they weren't able to utilize the truth,
that truth would still exist out there,

815
00:38:55,861 --> 00:38:59,810
whereas the pragmatists might say it's 
truth is in the use that it has for him.

816
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,210
That's the thing is that,
you know,

817
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,880
I don't know if we would consider a 
scientific truth true unless we are also

818
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:11,470
simultaneously accepting the idea that 
scientific truth is good for people.

819
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,950
So there's one other thing I wanted to 
bring up that's relevant because you 

820
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,820
brought up the idea of God.
So here's a way of thinking about it.

821
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,400
And,
and I don't know what to make of this 

822
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
because this is stretching me.
This is stretching my thoughts out 

823
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:26,560
beyond where I've been able to develop 
them.

824
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:30,130
So this is the intuition that I have 
based on a variety of things,

825
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:35,131
experiences I've had.
So imagine that there's a very wide 

826
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:36,310
range of human behaviors,
okay?

827
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,140
And some subset of those are both 
admirable and not admirable.

828
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,270
So let's call them good and evil at 
this,

829
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:44,590
at the extreme.
So okay.

830
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,780
Then we might say,
well,

831
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:52,170
there's a pattern that characterizes all
the actions that are good and a pattern 

832
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,770
that characterizes all the actions that 
are evil,

833
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,300
and that's a transpersonal pattern 
because it's,

834
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,810
it's not just about me,
it's about everyone.

835
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,760
Okay?
And so then that gets persona fund.

836
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,500
That's Christ and Satan,
let's say,

837
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:03,430
or Cain and Abel,
right?

838
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:05,770
That gets personified.
And that's a bad guy,

839
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,920
a good guy in a movie,
like it's personified all the time.

840
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,500
It's thor and Loki.
And then the marvel movies,

841
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:13,880
you know,
so now you have the,

842
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,150
let's say you take the idea of Christ 
and you think,

843
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:21,151
okay,
so that's the abstraction of everything 

844
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:23,971
that's,
that's admirably good about the set of 

845
00:40:23,971 --> 00:40:25,030
all human behaviors.
Okay?

846
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:25,870
And then you think,
well,

847
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,990
what sort of reality does that have?
And this pulls back into the reality of 

848
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,330
the idea of the logo.
Send the idea that it was the logos that

849
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:38,410
God used at the beginning of time to 
extract order out of chaos.

850
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,090
So you think,
well,

851
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,400
it's transpersonal,
the goodness,

852
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,600
because it's not just characterized 
stick of any one person.

853
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,980
It's more like something that inhabits a
person other than that a person is.

854
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,900
You can really see this,
for example,

855
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,700
on the other end too,
with the satanic end,

856
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,470
because if you read the writings of 
people who do absolutely horrific things

857
00:40:59,471 --> 00:41:04,471
like the shooters,
you can see that possession 

858
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:04,630
extraordinarily clearly.
If your eyes are open,

859
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,130
it's like an.
It's shocking,

860
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,760
so people don't usually look at it and 
they even say that themselves,

861
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:12,640
like the columbine kids,
their writings or hair raising,

862
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,700
you know,
and they were called clearly possessed 

863
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,951
by an evil that you only encounter if 
you sit in a dark place and brood on 

864
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:24,510
your hatred for months and years,
right?

865
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,320
You go places that you go places where 
all the dark people go,

866
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:30,070
right?
Right.

867
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,830
And then that it,
that takes you over.

868
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,960
Okay.
So the good and can take you over as 

869
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:37,960
well.
Okay.

870
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,600
So there's this,
there's this spirit of good,

871
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,840
let's say,
and what the spirit of good does is act 

872
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,991
in the world on the potential of the 
world to generate the actuality of the 

873
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:49,670
world.
And the Judeo Christian proposition is,

874
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:53,540
is that if you confront the potential of
the world with good in mind,

875
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,960
using truth,
truthful communication,

876
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:02,110
then the order that you extract is good.
And then that's echoed in genesis when 

877
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:06,110
God is using the word and he creates 
cosmos audit potential.

878
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,870
And every time he does that he says,
and it was good.

879
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Which is,
I think it's so interesting because 

880
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,660
there's a proposition there and the 
proposition there is that if you 

881
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,890
encounter potential with truth,
the cosmos you create is actually good.

882
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,720
Well,
that's,

883
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:22,550
that's just an absolutely overwhelming 
idea.

884
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:24,830
It's like if it's true,
if it's true,

885
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:26,400
it's the greatest idea that river 
watson.

886
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:26,530
Yeah,

887
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,750
like your,
your,

888
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,760
your thoughts on this.
Actually from maps of meeting help 

889
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,450
generate what we in a injuries and 
called Barataria and Hebrew leading into

890
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,950
a thought about the,
about the,

891
00:42:35,951 --> 00:42:36,520
uh,
the Bible.

892
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,910
But this merged with a little diversity 
alien thought led me to the idea that 

893
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,460
when it comes to the mystical notion of 
the tree of good and evil in,

894
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,410
in Eden,
what does that supposed to be?

895
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,440
What did,
what did people do wrong by eating from 

896
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,421
the tree of good and evil,
and my feeling is that what they did 

897
00:42:54,421 --> 00:42:57,511
wrong is that God created a universe in 
which the value was embedded in the 

898
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:58,330
object right there in the same way that 
you in your,

899
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:03,331
in your book,
talk about if you're teaching a child 

900
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,820
about an object,
the rules of the object are embedded in 

901
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,240
the teaching about the object.
So you use the example of the vase.

902
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,440
We were discussing this earlier,
um,

903
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:10,180
but you used the example of a vase where
you teach your child,

904
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:13,330
don't touch the base because the base 
will break so that the rules embedded in

905
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:15,850
the object in the same way in 
Aristotelian thought,

906
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,850
the rules for behavior are embedded in 
the nature of the universe.

907
00:43:18,851 --> 00:43:21,430
Meaning what makes a man good is what 
makes them unique,

908
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:24,580
which is the reason they ideas.
The reason is what makes me unique.

909
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:29,581
So acting in accordance with right 
reason is what makes something is what 

910
00:43:29,581 --> 00:43:32,671
makes an action good.
So if you believe that God created the 

911
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:34,831
universe along these lines and what 
natural law is just a human attempt to 

912
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,630
understand the lines along which created
God created the universe,

913
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:43,050
then we're human beings went wrong is 
when they decided to separate values 

914
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,160
from the universe.
When we decided to take values and say,

915
00:43:45,161 --> 00:43:48,250
this is a completely separate thing,
so this base has no rules attached to it

916
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:53,251
anymore.
It's just a vase and we can construct 

917
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:55,741
the rules,
arbitrarily is to what to do with this 

918
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:55,741
vase,
and so eating from the tree of knowledge

919
00:43:55,741 --> 00:44:00,541
of good and evil changes the nature of 
good and evil from the universe comes 

920
00:44:00,541 --> 00:44:03,010
along with a set of rules to human 
beings.

921
00:44:03,011 --> 00:44:08,011
Think that they can use their own 
intuition to supplant God's rules and 

922
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,461
discipline universal rules with their 
own particular vision of what the 

923
00:44:11,461 --> 00:44:11,570
universe ought to be and at that point 
they have to be expelled for.

924
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:12,420
Okay,
okay.

925
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:14,490
So that's also associated to some 
degree,

926
00:44:14,491 --> 00:44:19,491
I would say with Milton's warning and 
paradise lost because Milton basically 

927
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:21,630
portrays Lucifer,
who's the bringer of light.

928
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:25,230
Weirdly enough,
as the spirit of unbridled rationality,

929
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:28,700
which accounts for the say the Catholic 
Church antagonism,

930
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,560
the Catholic churches,
antagonism towards rationality,

931
00:44:31,561 --> 00:44:36,561
the idea was same idea and the Tower of 
Babel that human beings have a 

932
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:39,480
proclivity to direct their own dogmatic,
um,

933
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:44,810
ethical systems and then to expand them 
into a grandiosity that challenges the 

934
00:44:45,031 --> 00:44:48,390
transcendent and that that's a 
totalitarian catastrophe.

935
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,650
And for Milton,
Satan was the spirit that eternally does

936
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:53,370
that,
right?

937
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,710
Who says everything I know is enough.
That's the plants.

938
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,720
What I don't know,
that supplants that transcendent and 

939
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:02,940
that that's a catastrophe.
How that's tangled up with the,

940
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,120
with the knowledge of good and evil,
while you're making some headway 

941
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,120
towards,
towards sorting that out.

942
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,160
I mean there is a cataclysm that's,
it's explained in,

943
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,380
in,
in the story of Adam and Eve,

944
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:14,100
right?

945
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:19,100
The cataclysm is the coming two to 
wakefulness and its associated partly 

946
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:24,381
with recognition of nakedness,
which is recognition of vulnerability 

947
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:24,600
and Mortel and ham,
the discovery of death.

948
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,720
And then also the discovery of good and 
evil that goes along with that.

949
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,860
So you said,
well,

950
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:33,861
that's partly that.
The cognitive division of ethics from 

951
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:35,970
the facts of the object,
so I have to think that through.

952
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,520
I would also recommend to people,
I think I mentioned this before,

953
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:43,521
is Ian mcgilchrist spoken,
the master and his emissary because he 

954
00:45:43,521 --> 00:45:46,760
looks at this neuropsychologically right
and and looks at the left hemisphere as 

955
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:51,440
the hemisphere that's dealing with the 
explicitly axiomotic systems and the 

956
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,440
right hemisphere that's dealing with 
what those systems are embodied in.

957
00:45:55,980 --> 00:46:00,980
Okay,
so part of what happens with the 

958
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:00,980
emergence of good and evil,
it's as far as I could tell,

959
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,290
it took me a long time to think about 
this is the w,

960
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:07,170
and this is different than the than the 
hypothesis that you laid forward,

961
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:10,410
which is why I can't reconcile that 
exactly as you recognize,

962
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:10,980
you're naked.

963
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,880
You know you can be hurt.
You know you're vulnerable and 

964
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,361
insufficient.
You hide from God because that's what 

965
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,110
happens next,
and the reason you hide from God say God

966
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:27,111
is your destiny or God is the.
You're walking with God is a 

967
00:46:27,111 --> 00:46:27,660
manifestation of your ultimate,
proper destiny.

968
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,360
You,
you doubt whether you're capable of that

969
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:35,361
because now you realize you're embodied 
finitude your nakedness and 

970
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:36,390
insufficiency,
so you hide in your ashamed.

971
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:41,750
So there's that.
You also realize that you can be hurt 

972
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:42,810
and suffer and that Kinda goes along 
with God's command,

973
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:47,811
that you're going to work in the sweat 
of your brow and that you're going to 

974
00:46:47,811 --> 00:46:48,030
die and that women are going to be 
subjugated to men,

975
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:51,090
which has put on as a curse,
not as a moral imperative,

976
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,200
right?
Um,

977
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,590
but then what emerges out of that is 
that as soon as you,

978
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,620
you know that you can be hurt,
and this is what differentiates us from 

979
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,130
other animals,
and you really think that through,

980
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:04,020
here's all the myriad ways I can be 
hurt.

981
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:06,390
Then you're angry about that because you
can be heard,

982
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,600
but even worse,
you can figure out how to hurt other 

983
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:11,600
people.
And,

984
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:11,940
and so that's part of that knowledge of 
good and evil.

985
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:14,730
You associated with this dissociation of
the,

986
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,790
of the object from its ethical can 
obtain the right of the universe has 

987
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:23,721
created by God from our interpretation 
of the universe that there is a gap 

988
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:27,171
between the two and that once human 
beings begin to supplant their own 

989
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:30,201
rationality for a telus right in,
in the diversity here and that geology 

990
00:47:30,201 --> 00:47:35,200
well we end up doing is creating all 
sorts of awful systems that end up 

991
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,030
destroying us in the show.
But something about that.

992
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:37,960
That's right.
I mean,

993
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,140
part of what happens in the new 
testament as far as I can tell is that 

994
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:46,800
what Christ says,
so he's trying to transcend the rule 

995
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,160
structure might be not because there's 
anything wrong with the rule.

996
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,140
If they're necessary precondition for 
discipline,

997
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:52,010
which is actually white wrote 12 rooms,
right?

998
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:55,990
It's like you need rules but there,
but rules conflict and they don't always

999
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:59,590
apply and so there has to be an ethic 
underlying the rules and you should have

1000
00:47:59,591 --> 00:48:01,630
more respect for the ethic than for the 
rule.

1001
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,680
Right?
Okay.

1002
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Christ's idea,
and this is part of the idea of the 

1003
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,141
reestablishment of paradise,
is that you should orient yourself 

1004
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:13,951
towards the good and that's something 
like an alliance with God and then that 

1005
00:48:13,951 --> 00:48:18,291
you should tell the truth and that's the
ethic that generated the rules to begin 

1006
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:18,310
with.
Okay,

1007
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:20,380
and then we can be serious about this,
you know,

1008
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,340
and we can say,
well,

1009
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,160
how do you adjudicate the reality of 
that claim?

1010
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,840
Right?
So then we might think,

1011
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:31,290
well,
we already walked through the fact that 

1012
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:33,570
the heroes of the past acted on 
potential to extract out the world of 

1013
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:38,431
actuality and if they did that properly,
then the world they extracted was good 

1014
00:48:38,431 --> 00:48:38,980
and that that is a divine principle.

1015
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,690
And then we might say,
well,

1016
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,170
he hasn't been defined principles and 
you might say,

1017
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,410
well what is it that's acting through 
people in the good,

1018
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,130
like the Christian theological answer to
that would be the logos,

1019
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,480
right?
That's the idea.

1020
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,640
That's the idea of the Holy Spirit,
roughly speaking,

1021
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:55,270
right?
Might think,

1022
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:56,620
well,
is that a real thing?

1023
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:57,460
It's like,
well,

1024
00:48:57,461 --> 00:49:02,461
to me it's real the same way that 
consciousness is real and we don't know 

1025
00:49:03,131 --> 00:49:06,280
the role of consciousness in determining
reality even,

1026
00:49:06,281 --> 00:49:08,470
but even if you're an evolutionary 
biologist,

1027
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:14,070
and this is so interesting because the 
evolutionary biologists actually 

1028
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,370
discriminate,
differentiated themselves from Darwin on

1029
00:49:15,371 --> 00:49:17,290
this point,
like Darwin was very,

1030
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:22,291
very forthright in his claim that sexual
selection was as powerful as natural 

1031
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:27,271
selection or even more so and so that,
so here's where this that goes in and 

1032
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:31,500
because that was because that brought 
consciousness into the world as an 

1033
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,980
active player,
the materialistic evolutionary biologist

1034
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,981
ignored that,
so like 150 years and only concentrated 

1035
00:49:37,981 --> 00:49:37,981
on natural selection where they could 
play.

1036
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,990
While this is all chance,
it's like sexual selection is not 

1037
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:43,090
chance.
Okay,

1038
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:48,091
so here's a hypothesis.
Human being separated themselves from 

1039
00:49:48,091 --> 00:49:51,631
chimpanzees.
One of the reasons they did that was 

1040
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:52,300
because human females are sexually 
selective.

1041
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,750
Chimps aren't.
Chimps will female chimps in estrus will

1042
00:49:55,751 --> 00:50:00,751
mate with any chimp.
The main chimps that dominant ones 

1043
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:03,580
chased the subordinate males away so 
they're more likely to have offspring,

1044
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:05,980
but it's not because of female choice 
right now.

1045
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:09,430
Female human females have done this 
whole different things that they've,

1046
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,660
they've,
they,

1047
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,690
they have hidden fertility and they're 
much more likely to go after guys who 

1048
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:22,111
have climbed up the hierarchy.
So let's say heroes will give the 

1049
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:23,050
women's some credit for intelligence,
right?

1050
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:28,051
And say that that's what they're after,
even if they are using wealth and so 

1051
00:50:28,051 --> 00:50:29,930
forth and status as a marker,
they're actually using those as a marker

1052
00:50:29,931 --> 00:50:30,570
for competence.

1053
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,330
And,
and I think that's,

1054
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:34,520
I think the evidence think the evidence 
for that is clear.

1055
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,510
Okay.
So you might say,

1056
00:50:35,511 --> 00:50:40,511
oh well it was human female conscious 
choice that selected us.

1057
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:41,870
Okay.
And you think,

1058
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:44,750
well that's not random,
that's not random at all.

1059
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:46,550
It's the farthest thing from random that
there is.

1060
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:51,551
And that means consciousness is making 
it's choices with regards to what 

1061
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,551
propagates,
but then it's even more complex than 

1062
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:54,830
that.
So here's what happens among men.

1063
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,530
The man all get together in their 
hierarchy,

1064
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,330
they pause a valued goal.
They all accept that as the goal because

1065
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,950
otherwise they wouldn't be cooperating,
right?

1066
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,980
Then they arrange themselves into a 
hierarchy and they let the most 

1067
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,230
competent guys lead because they want to
get to.

1068
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:14,350
They want to get to the promised land.
They want to get the most competent 

1069
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:14,830
leaders leaning,
right?

1070
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,760
Competent defined by that value.

1071
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,860
Okay,
so here's what happens.

1072
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:23,861
Essentially the men all get together and
vote on the good man and the good men 

1073
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:30,010
are then chosen by the women and those 
are the people who propagate and so it's

1074
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:35,441
like men are voting on which men get to 
reproduce and women are going along with

1075
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,150
the vote and and being even more 
stringent in their,

1076
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:39,230
in their choices,
let's say.

1077
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,380
And so then what you get is that the 
consciousness that through its active 

1078
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,881
expression transforms the potential of 
the world into actuality also selects 

1079
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:53,120
the direction of evolution.
Right?

1080
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:58,121
And that's where the meme darkens term 
turns into the biological reality.

1081
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,050
It's not interested in.
So yeah,

1082
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:01,910
this is something that's so cool about 
darkens.

1083
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:05,810
It's like I've often thought this about 
Dawkins is if he would push his thinking

1084
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:08,710
to the limits,
he would fall right into young.

1085
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,940
The men,
he'd be lost because that's a whole 

1086
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,390
other universe,
but if you take that mean seriously,

1087
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,890
like and I mean really seriously think,
yeah,

1088
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:22,130
there's some ways of conceptualizing 
that becomes so all encompassing,

1089
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:24,650
right?

1090
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,350
They start to become an actual force of 
evolution itself,

1091
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,520
and so then here's the case.
You could make consciousness extracts 

1092
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,230
the proper world of being from potential
through truth and then it's good.

1093
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,820
It's like,
okay,

1094
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,640
that's a hard one,
man.

1095
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,120
That manifests itself in human beings at
the individual level of individual 

1096
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,210
consciousness.
That's the logos with it.

1097
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:52,550
That's the metaphysical foundation of 
the idea of natural right and 

1098
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:52,820
responsibility.
Hey,

1099
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:57,050
that's a bloody killer idea.
That's expressed in the hero of heroes.

1100
00:52:57,051 --> 00:53:01,280
That idea,
that hero of heroes is the driving force

1101
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:05,180
behind human evolution,
so not only do you get the action of the

1102
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:10,181
logos metaphysically as the process that
extracts order out of chaos at the 

1103
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:14,531
beginning of time.
You also get it as the major driver of 

1104
00:53:14,531 --> 00:53:14,531
evolution,
and so then you ask,

1105
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:20,290
okay,
then what kind of reality does that 

1106
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:20,290
have?
Because you chase consciousness back and

1107
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:24,740
like it disappears into the mystery of 
our past and we have no idea what it's 

1108
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,631
relationship is with matter,
but it's the forest that gives rise to 

1109
00:53:28,631 --> 00:53:29,430
the cosmos and drives evolution.

1110
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,260
It's like you're getting pretty close to
God.

1111
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:33,450
They're even just pragmatically 
speaking.

1112
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:36,420
You're certainly not close to you,
but in the midst of it,

1113
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,650
an argument about free will because 
obviously if you.

1114
00:53:38,651 --> 00:53:40,590
If you make the hard determinist 
argument,

1115
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:45,591
that free will doesn't exist and the 
consciousness is merely a sort of trick 

1116
00:53:45,591 --> 00:53:47,340
that your brain is playing itself.
Then how exactly does.

1117
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,530
How does culture propagate?
How do,

1118
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:52,620
how do these means propagate?
How are people choosing sexual selection

1119
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:57,621
and natural selection become one of the 
same as soon as you boil sexual 

1120
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,081
selection down to natural selection.
And also I think that the freewill 

1121
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:04,640
argument,
I mean I see why Harris gets tangled up 

1122
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:04,640
in that,
you know,

1123
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,820
because well first of all,
deterministic arguments are unbelievably

1124
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:09,300
powerful and when we use deterministic 
models for many things,

1125
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,250
they really were right.
So you could say,

1126
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,880
well,
we're going to use that by default.

1127
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:13,680
It's like,
fair enough.

1128
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:18,681
We're gonna deviate from that with care,
but I don't see people as driven like 

1129
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:22,170
clocks winding down.
First of all,

1130
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:27,171
we don't wind down in any simple way.
We're dissipative structures to use.

1131
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:32,681
Um,
he wrote Schrodinger what is life a 

1132
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:32,880
human being as a dissipative structure?
We're not,

1133
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,090
we're not an entropic structure like a 
clock running down.

1134
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,880
We are in some sense,
but as living beings,

1135
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:43,881
we pull energy in and so we're not 
winding down like a deterministic 

1136
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:47,721
structure where something other than 
that and the way we treat each other is 

1137
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,810
as logos,
as far as I can tell,

1138
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,450
the way I treat myself,
if I'm going to be good to myself in the

1139
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:59,451
proper sense,
is that I'm an active agent of choice 

1140
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:03,201
confronting and infinite landscape of 
potential and casting that potential 

1141
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:04,380
into a reality for good or for evil.

1142
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,860
Okay?
And if I treat myself that way,

1143
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:12,861
then I have proper respect for myself 
and proper fear of myself because I can 

1144
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:15,300
make bad decisions and work the 
structure of reality.

1145
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,420
And I think if you read Frankel through 
example or Solzhenitsyn and you see how 

1146
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,110
your bad decisions can work,
the structure of reality,

1147
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,880
then that wakes you up,
right?

1148
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,890
Okay.
So there's that.

1149
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,260
If you don't treat yourself like a,
an active agent imbued with logos,

1150
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,490
then your life doesn't go away,
but more if you don't treat other people

1151
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:37,530
that way,
they do not want to play with you.

1152
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:43,010
If we set up societies that aren't 
predicated on the idea that people are 

1153
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,070
like that,
then the society's become,

1154
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,400
they'd dissolve or they become 
totalitarian almost instantly.

1155
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,170
So then I would say,
well,

1156
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,840
you've got the problem of determinism 
was like,

1157
00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:52,710
fair enough,
man.

1158
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,220
How do you reconcile the fact that if 
you lay out a society at every level of 

1159
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,290
the analysis on strict deterministic 
grounds,

1160
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,230
it fails.
So it doesn't,

1161
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,630
doesn't have any in your hypothesis has 
a flaw.

1162
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:08,070
I mean,
maybe not.

1163
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:10,650
Maybe you can say no,
the facts are independent of the ethical

1164
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,540
concepts.
This is what are the truth.

1165
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,520
This is where the truth pragmatism 
question back into being right?

1166
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,290
Because Sam say,
well,

1167
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,880
it's true.
Regardless of what the effect is.

1168
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:19,050
And you would say,
well,

1169
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:24,140
it's obviously not true if morals are 
constructed for pragmatic reason and if 

1170
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:24,140
this pragmatism

1171
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,450
doesn't work,
if it falls into nothingness,

1172
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,750
but also it also depends to some degree 
on what you're willing to,

1173
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,790
how you're willing to test your 
hypothesis.

1174
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,930
Because I might say,
well,

1175
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,240
if your hypothesis is factually correct,
wouldn't you assume that if people base 

1176
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:37,940
their,
their,

1177
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:43,300
their,
their behaviors individually and 

1178
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:43,640
familial and socially on that set of 
facts,

1179
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,160
which is basically what Sam claims about
facts to begin bandwidth.

1180
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,280
If you base your ethos or not those 
facts,

1181
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,040
wouldn't it work?
Right?

1182
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:56,110
Well,
he claims that that's a test and I'd 

1183
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:56,110
say,
well then it fails that test.

1184
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,240
It doesn't work.
We have to treat each other like divine 

1185
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,060
centers of consciousness in order for 
society to work.

1186
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:02,930
Yes.
I think,

1187
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:03,680
wow,
that's.

1188
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:05,390
I can't see anything

1189
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,560
way out of those arguments.
I,

1190
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:12,610
I can't say they're obviously,
which is why you and I agree on so much 

1191
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:15,181
about this kind of stuff and I think 
that it's also the reason why people 

1192
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,821
find your work really inspiring and 
while the left wants to claim that you 

1193
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:19,970
are an angry person or they'll claim 
similarly than I'm a deeply angry to.

1194
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,910
I don't think there's been quite an 
angry conversation.

1195
00:57:21,911 --> 00:57:23,580
I'm pretty sure it has not been,
um,

1196
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,130
but I feel horrified by what the radical
left is capable of,

1197
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:29,350
but that doesn't make me angry.
Exactly.

1198
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:30,610
And,
and I think that it's,

1199
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:33,820
it's demonstrative of why so many people
find what you're doing inspiring because

1200
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:39,270
unlike the radical left which is 
consumed with the idea of victim hood 

1201
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,980
and victimology and were victims of the 
system like Marxism makes the claim that

1202
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:44,800
the only way that peoplesoft is the 
Clinton mark is a makes,

1203
00:57:44,801 --> 00:57:49,801
but the only way to cure people of 
sucking is by changing the entire 

1204
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:52,411
system,
which will in some magical fashion 

1205
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:52,510
transform the nature of humanity in the 
proper direction.

1206
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,790
Right color.
Exactly the claim that you're making.

1207
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,940
And I hope that I'm making as well,
is that human beings do soc unless they 

1208
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:00,840
decide to stop sucking,
right?

1209
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:01,240
And,
and,

1210
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:05,350
and your whole goal is to tell people 
exactly how it is the bacon and clean up

1211
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:06,460
their rooms.
You're a famous phrase.

1212
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,210
Guts.
Yeah.

1213
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:08,190
Well they might as well start.
Start

1214
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,190
with what's right in front of them.
It's a lot harder than it looks because 

1215
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:16,431
to clean up your room means to accept 
that it's actually necessary for you to 

1216
00:58:16,431 --> 00:58:18,120
take that little bit of chaos that's in 
front of you,

1217
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,540
that chaotic potential and cast it into 
habitable order.

1218
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,910
And then you have to develop the right 
attitude towards that.

1219
00:58:23,911 --> 00:58:24,390
It's like,
okay,

1220
00:58:24,391 --> 00:58:29,391
well I'm going to put my room in order.
Well what do you mean order is in 

1221
00:58:29,391 --> 00:58:32,220
relationship to something you know,
like if your desk is ordered,

1222
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:37,490
it means you've ordered it because 
you're going to work there and you're 

1223
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,191
working there on something valuable.
And so the order is conceived of in 

1224
00:58:40,191 --> 00:58:40,900
relationship to a tee loss.
It's like,

1225
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:42,180
okay,
you're going to order your room.

1226
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,930
Well what are you going to do in it?
Like what's your room for,

1227
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:47,610
what's the purpose,
what's the purpose?

1228
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:51,510
You can't order your room without 
falling into purpose.

1229
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:52,530
And I would say,
well,

1230
00:58:52,531 --> 00:58:57,531
if you're going to fall into purpose,
it's like try it out on a local scale 

1231
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:57,531
first,
right?

1232
00:58:57,531 --> 00:58:59,100
You don't want to go out there and 
change the system.

1233
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:00,810
It's like,
what the hell do you know?

1234
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:04,530
Leave the system alone,
see what you can do locally,

1235
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,860
see if you can put yourself together,
see if you can put your immediate 

1236
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,471
environment together and you'll find if 
you're in a chaotic household and a 

1237
00:59:12,471 --> 00:59:15,660
chaotic household would be one where no 
one has any discipline.

1238
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,780
No one has any ames and there's a 
terrible battle between Cain and Abel 

1239
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:21,350
going on all the time.
Right?

1240
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:26,351
So,
so life socks and everything is 

1241
00:59:26,351 --> 00:59:26,900
miserable and more cynical and that's 
what wisdom is.

1242
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,920
It's like,
and there's no point in trying anything 

1243
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,841
because everything's meaningless than 
who the hell is going to care in a 

1244
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:34,841
million years and you're a full to move 
forward.

1245
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:36,950
In any case,
it's like there's your household.

1246
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,840
Okay?
And so now you decide.

1247
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,150
No,
despite all that,

1248
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:46,151
I'm going to put my room in order.
It was like you will have a war on your 

1249
00:59:46,151 --> 00:59:47,690
hands because the first thing that 
people around you who are aiming down,

1250
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,800
we'll do is think,
oh,

1251
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:49,710
you,
you really,

1252
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,250
you think you're so much better than we 
are?

1253
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,000
Do you really think that you and your 
fancy God damn plans?

1254
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:01,120
It's like we're going to put every 
psychological obstacle we can possibly 

1255
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,340
think of in your way because if you 
succeed even in something that trivial,

1256
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,570
you shed a very dim light on our 
existence and so we're going to put,

1257
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,880
we're going to do everything we can to 
take you out,

1258
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:12,680
and so this people think,
oh,

1259
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:13,670
well,
it's cleaning your room.

1260
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:14,900
That's just a cliche.
It's like,

1261
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:15,560
yeah,
really?

1262
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:17,180
I just go ahead and try it.

1263
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:20,670
You see how much of a cliche that is and
if you've got your room in order,

1264
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:22,770
then put your office in order.
See,

1265
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,400
and then you're going to encounter.
The soon as you do that,

1266
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:29,000
you step out into the social world.
You're going to encounter that antipathy

1267
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:34,001
between men and women.
You're going to encounter the identity 

1268
01:00:34,001 --> 01:00:36,581
politics in the workplace.
You're going to encounter how you 

1269
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:39,971
regulate your sexual morality while 
you're working with people of the 

1270
01:00:39,971 --> 01:00:43,211
opposite sex.
You're going to encounter the ethics 

1271
01:00:43,211 --> 01:00:43,340
that are necessary to move your business
forward.

1272
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:45,710
It's like the whole.
It's a microcosm.

1273
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:50,711
It really is.
And so to take those microcosmic caused 

1274
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:51,080
him seriously.
Well,

1275
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,420
that's what I'm asking people to do and 
I'm saying,

1276
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:57,260
look,
it isn't only about you being happy.

1277
01:00:57,610 --> 01:00:58,220
It's like,
yeah,

1278
01:00:58,610 --> 01:00:59,510
whatever,
pap.

1279
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,910
There's lots of times in your life 
you're not going to be happy,

1280
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,110
and so that's not gonna work.

1281
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:08,350
You want to have something meaningful 
that's the boat that will take you 

1282
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:09,740
through the storm,
right when you batten down the hatches,

1283
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:13,070
but there's more ads isn't even that.
It isn't even me.

1284
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,440
A meaningful,
engaged life.

1285
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:18,590
We'll see you through the catastrophes 
even though that's a big deal,

1286
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:19,990
right?
That's a great proposition.

1287
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:22,310
And I really believe it's true because 
you can say to yourself,

1288
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,660
yeah,
it's worth it.

1289
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:25,100
Right,
right and great.

1290
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,350
And,
but there's the other part of it too,

1291
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:32,351
which is don't be thinking that your 
errors aren't linked to hell because 

1292
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:35,570
they are.
If you look at what happened in the 20th

1293
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:38,250
century,
the brilliant commentators on the,

1294
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:43,430
on the 20th century,
totalitarian states and all of their 

1295
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,060
atrocities said the same thing over and 
over.

1296
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:48,770
It isn't top down evil leader 
manipulating innocent masses.

1297
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,920
That's not it.
It's the moral failings of every single 

1298
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,811
individual unwilling to say their truth,
unwilling to act out what they know to 

1299
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:02,510
be right that accumulate and produce the
catastrophic state.

1300
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,720
And so when you're fussing about with 
your life,

1301
01:02:05,721 --> 01:02:08,030
when you're not manifesting your 
potential,

1302
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:13,150
when you're falsifying your speech and 
your auctions in the service of short 

1303
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:16,541
term expedience,
you are working to bring about hell on 

1304
01:02:16,541 --> 01:02:16,790
earth.
And that's true.

1305
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,350
It's true.
Literally.

1306
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:19,600
And then it's true.
It's.

1307
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,790
I suspect it's also true metaphorically.
And that's a real truth man.

1308
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,580
When you get the literal and 
metaphorical working at the same time,

1309
01:02:26,581 --> 01:02:29,220
it's like that's,
that's real.

1310
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,970
So it isn't just that you have to fix up
yourself so that you know you can have a

1311
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:33,840
better life.
It's like,

1312
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:36,300
who cares about you for a moment?
You know,

1313
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:41,301
it's,
you have to fix up your life because if 

1314
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:43,371
you don't,
every time you make a mistake that you 

1315
01:02:43,371 --> 01:02:44,010
know to be a mistake,
you are leading the world toward hell.

1316
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,260
And I believe that.
I think it's true.

1317
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Well,
Jordan Peterson's book is 12 rules for 

1318
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:51,500
life.
Uh,

1319
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:51,500
honestly,
I,

1320
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,860
we could do this all day long and will 
certainly have you back.

1321
01:02:52,861 --> 01:02:57,861
I really appreciate the time.
