1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,960
All right,

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,500
so if there's anybody,
is there anybody here who's new?

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,950
So everybody knows where to find the
website.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,700
Okay,
well that's good to know.

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,920
Someone doesn't.
Who is that saying?

6
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:27,754
No.

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,570
Ah,
there you are.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,160
Just look up my name on Google and
you'll find my website and then you can

9
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:40,590
find the course.
Okay.

10
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,810
And all the readings and so forth are
there.

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,770
Unfortunately some of the links were
outdated and if you tried to get ahold

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,710
of a Ta,
you probably got a hold of last year's

13
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,290
tea,
but because I didn't update all the

14
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:54,600
links blindly,
so anyways,

15
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:55,620
that's fixed,
I hope.

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,250
And with any luck the website is fully
functional.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,630
So.
All right,

18
00:01:00,631 --> 00:01:05,631
so last time I was trying to give you a
brief introduction to,

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,690
to a way of looking at symbolic
representations.

20
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,590
And maybe I should tell you a little bit
about symbolic representations.

21
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,424
First.
Um,

22
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,030
it's a bit confusing because Freud was
in some sense the first of the modern

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,340
psychologist to talk about symbolism.
And Freud believed that symbols were

24
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:33,990
often used by the unconscious to
represent things that the conscious mind

25
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,920
did not want to become conscious of.
So in some sense,

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
Freud believed that the things that you
repressed were things that you knew and

27
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:49,071
understood but didn't want to attend to
or believe or understand or integrate or

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:56,361
developer or even allowed to exist.
And so the unconscious was reduced to

29
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,090
using subterfuge in some sense to get
its point across.

30
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,970
Now it's a powerful argument.
It's one we're going to return to when

31
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:07,920
we talk about Freud,
but I don't think it's right.

32
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,880
I think,
I think,

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,240
I think young's explanation of symbols
is,

34
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,530
is,
is better.

35
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:16,650
I think it's right.
Although there may be times when Freud's

36
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,230
correct,
but I think that would be a subset of

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,290
the times when symbolism is used.
Um,

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,100
imagine that there are different forms
of knowledge first.

39
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,310
And it's important to understand.
It's important to recognize that before

40
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,790
you can really think about something
like the use of symbolism,

41
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,130
the unconscious,
the use of symbolism by the unconscious.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
I mean,
first of all,

43
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,050
there's the form of knowledge that
everyone knows as knowledge,

44
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:45,210
which is articulated knowledge,
right?

45
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,190
And so articulated knowledges,
often factual or it can be procedural

46
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:55,191
because you can tell someone how to do
something but and everyone thinks of and

47
00:02:55,531 --> 00:03:00,160
and then there's knowledge about facts
of various forms which which may or may

48
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,710
not be true,
but that's really irrelevant that and

49
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:07,060
that's often this sort of knowledge that
you learn in a classroom.

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,040
Procedural knowledge is a different
issue because you can learn that by

51
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,240
doing or by imitating and it and even in
science,

52
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:20,890
which is a,
which is a process and an an a method as

53
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,740
well as a body of knowledge.
Even in science,

54
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:28,070
a lot of the knowledge isn't explicit
and articulated.

55
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,640
It's actually procedural.
This is something Thomas Kuhn talked

56
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,391
about,
for example,

57
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,370
in his famous book on scientific
revolutions,

58
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,180
which because partly when you're a
graduate student for example,

59
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:39,880
or to a lesser degree and undergraduate,
it's,

60
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,340
it's more relevant when you actually
start practicing science.

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,610
A lot of the knowledge that you bring to
bear on the,

62
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,700
on,
on the subject is actually implicit.

63
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,520
You can't really.
You can't really explain it.

64
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:55,000
And so some examples of that might be
like learning how to look through a

65
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,040
microscope,
which turns out to be a very difficult

66
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,220
thing.

67
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,890
You have to practice for many hours
before you get good at looking through a

68
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,610
microscope or maybe if you're a
radiologist you have to read x rays or

69
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,760
fm rise of that sort of thing.
You can build up a body of knowledge

70
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,420
that makes you a perceptual expert,
but he can't really get that kind of

71
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,310
knowledge without practice.
You know,

72
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,960
it's sort of like learning how to play
the piano,

73
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,370
say,
or learning how to walk or,

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,880
or any complex act of perception or
action is seldom fully articulated.

75
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,200
And so,
so that's another kind of knowledge you

76
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:29,530
might call that embodied knowledge and
there is a memory for them that goes

77
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,390
along with that,
which is procedural memory,

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,330
right?
And a lot of what you know is procedural

79
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,164
memory.
And then

80
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,240
there's another kind of knowledge which
is I suppose,

81
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:44,130
autobiographical.
And that's often referred to as say

82
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,170
episodic memory and autobiographical
knowledge would be your memory of

83
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,300
yourself as an actor in the world.
You know.

84
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:56,290
So I suspect for many of you,
well let's find out for how many this is

85
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:58,780
true.
When you remember an episode in the past

86
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:03,310
or when your mind is wandering and
episodes of the past come up,

87
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,490
how would you describe the forum in
which they emerge?

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,680
Are they like hot for how many people
are they?

89
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,760
Like little movies.

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,520
Okay.
Is there anyone for whom that's not

91
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,354
true?

92
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,021
Yeah.
Okay.

93
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,030
So,
so when you think about the past or when

94
00:05:18,031 --> 00:05:20,580
the past comes to mind,
in what form does it come to mind?

95
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,560
Stills.
Stills.

96
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:23,850
Okay.
But it's still images.

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,650
Is there anybody?
Okay.

98
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,660
Okay,
fine,

99
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,240
fine.
There's also knowledge about the past

100
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:33,480
that semantic knowledge articulated
knowledge and that would be factual

101
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:34,980
knowledge about what you did in the
past,

102
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:38,070
but that seems to be.
That seems to be a more thoroughly

103
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,310
processed form of memory because in some
sense what you've done,

104
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:46,850
if you're extracting out articulated
knowledge from past experiences is that

105
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:49,350
you have to,
you have to pull out the gist.

106
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,240
You reduce it,
you know,

107
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,440
it's sort of like imagine that you have
a conversation with someone and last two

108
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,550
hours and someone says,
well,

109
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,480
what did you about?
Why you don't repeat the entire

110
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:00,980
conversation verbatim,
right?

111
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,760
You do some weird job of compressing the
information into something like a

112
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,550
summary and you do that more or less
automatically,

113
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:10,400
you know,
it's quite a remarkable process actually

114
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:12,200
because you get the gist or you get the
point,

115
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,660
whatever the point is,
it's not like it's that easy to extract

116
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:17,750
from a conversation and that's another
form of knowledge that you can,

117
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,370
that you can formulate.

118
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,250
But then there's sort of borderline
forms of knowledge,

119
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,530
you know,
and those are the ones that seem to be

120
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:27,650
expressed as far as I can tell in
something that's more like symbolic

121
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,510
representation.
So,

122
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
um,
we talked last time a little bit about a

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,580
parent say apparent acting the role of a
father.

124
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,390
So the parent is embodying whatever
father means and the child is prepared

125
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:46,370
for that because children generally have
a father.

126
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,760
And of course children are prepared to
interact with men like they're prepared

127
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,940
to interact with women.
They understand men and they understand

128
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,150
women and a lot of that knowledge comes
like hardwired in,

129
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,850
so the child might be observing the
farther across multiple context,

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,400
trying to understand precisely who this
creature is,

131
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:09,401
but then also learning how to embody
that in so far as she might be learning

132
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,250
how to interact with males or he might
be learning how to imitate a male.

133
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,000
Of course there's some of that that's
going on with both genders and then a

134
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:21,380
lot of what summarized in the in the
acting out in the pretending also seems

135
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:26,381
to be like just because when a child
imitates his father and is pretending to

136
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,220
be a father,
for example,

137
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,600
he isn't on just duplicating exactly
what he seen,

138
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,140
what he's doing.
In some sense,

139
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:37,490
you might think of as extracting out the
commonalities of behavior across

140
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:42,260
different contexts that the farther
manifests in order to get a handle on

141
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:45,560
the spirit of the father.
And then it's the spirit of the father

142
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:47,780
in some sense that the child's trying to
embody.

143
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,100
And that would be whatever makes a
father different from a man.

144
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,440
And so you know,
you can certainly.

145
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:58,100
I'm sure you know perfectly well when
you go home to visit your parents or

146
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,670
when you interact with them on a day to
day basis when your father is being a

147
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,120
father and when he's just being a man,
there'd be voice tone and,

148
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:05,954
and,
and,

149
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,000
and stance and gays and,
and all sorts of like articulated

150
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,510
phrases that you're familiar with that
are part of the role of father and you

151
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:19,511
could see other people's fathers acting
like fathers to now it seems to be that

152
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,190
a lot of symbolic representation has to
do with the extraction of the just.

153
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,300
It's like exactly what is,
it's a categorization process is exactly

154
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,420
what it is that these various behaviors
have in common and what they have,

155
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,330
if they're embodied behaviors.
What they have in common is something

156
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,650
like a spirit.
So I think it was hegel who talked about

157
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:45,260
the spirit of the times and you knew
how,

158
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,060
uh,
if you look at photographs that are like

159
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,160
20 years old,
all of a sudden they're dated,

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,410
you know,
for awhile,

161
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,250
photographs look like they're current.
Then all of a sudden,

162
00:08:52,251 --> 00:08:53,001
poof,
they're dated.

163
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,650
And you think,
how in the world did people think they

164
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,400
were normal when they were dressed like
that?

165
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,090
You know,
and there there are are frequently

166
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,530
occurrences in culture where there's an
emergence of a style that seems

167
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:07,900
consistent across the entire culture.
Like the art deco movement was like

168
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,350
that.
And what seems to be the case in those

169
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,470
situations is that there are novel ideas
being generated,

170
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,040
but everyone is imitating everyone else
as rapidly as they possibly can because

171
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,930
they're communicating in an articulated
way in.

172
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,340
They're copying each other and out of
that you get something like a spirit or

173
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:27,270
ethos of the time.
And so a lot of what symbolism is trying

174
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:32,160
to do is to extract out commonalities
across context and often commonalities

175
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,800
that you really don't understand,
like their categories.

176
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,500
They're,
they're almost like pre categories or

177
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,360
their levels of representation that are
trying to represent something that's

178
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,680
actually too complex for you to
articulate.

179
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,860
So for example,
many of you will act out being a mother,

180
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:50,580
being a father when you have children,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that

181
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:54,930
you could fully articulate the knowledge
that you have about what it is to be a

182
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:59,910
mother or father,
and so you have the knowledge because

183
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:01,980
you can act it out and it's somewhat it
you,

184
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,650
you actually,
you have some form of representation of

185
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:08,040
the knowledge too because you can
understand that when it happens,

186
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,920
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
you can fully articulate it.

187
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,220
So you could say for example,
that you have an image of what a mother

188
00:10:14,221 --> 00:10:16,500
is and the image wouldn't be just a
still,

189
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,870
it would be maybe a sequence of stills
or something like that,

190
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,240
but it's more like a pattern of
behavior,

191
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,470
your image of the pattern of behavior
that characterizes a given role.

192
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,920
And so.
So that's a good way to think about

193
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:29,671
symbols,
I think.

194
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,680
And that was sort of the union way of
thinking about them.

195
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,681
You unbelief that assemble was nature's
attempt nature within,

196
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:41,691
you say nature's attempt to express a
relatively unknown idea in the clearest

197
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:45,420
possible manner.
Even though that wasn't necessarily

198
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:49,710
clear and well,
we use symbols all the time for that

199
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,720
sort of purpose.
You see them all the time when you go to

200
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:52,710
movies,
for example,

201
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,210
movies are full of symbolism.
I was just interpreting the dream of one

202
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,920
of my clients the other day and he
dreamt that he was following a spirit

203
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,970
around in the basement of a house that
was like a maze and the spirit kept

204
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,660
disappearing and reappearing and he
gathered some people around him that was

205
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,070
sort of like a,
I would say,

206
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,130
a social network because he's been
working on developing a social network

207
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,140
and as that social network are
developed,

208
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,680
he felt more and more confident to
search out this spirit and to chase it

209
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,514
around the basement.

210
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,480
Finally,
the spirit manifested itself a ghost.

211
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:26,430
It was a blue ghost,
ghostly thing.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,770
It came out of a box that was in one of
the basement rooms that had a toilet

213
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:35,010
seat on it,
so it was like a toilet that was on a.

214
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,100
It was like a toilet that was on a box,
which is just what I said,

215
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,620
and then the,
the,

216
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,500
the spirit disappeared down into the
toilet and he looked in there along with

217
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:47,910
some other people and there was a huge,
massive maze like structure of many,

218
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:52,080
many rooms underneath and I thought,
well that's actually quite a common

219
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:55,420
representation and dreams,
but does that remind anyone of anything?

220
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,800
Anything that's not unbelievably
pathological.

221
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,180
It's like this.
It's like the story in the second part

222
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,890
of Harry Potter,
right?

223
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,700
Do you remember that?
So you have morning myrtle.

224
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,900
She inhabits the bathroom.
She's always diving into toilets and

225
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:15,010
don't they find the,
the understructure of hogwarts by going

226
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,230
through that bathroom in,
into the,

227
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,150
into the subterranean elements.
Yeah.

228
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:21,160
So,
so that's a good that,

229
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,190
that realm of symbolism is something
like underneath this is exactly what the

230
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:31,870
case is with the second Harry Potter
stories that underneath the edifice of

231
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,640
culture,
and that would be hard word sit.

232
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:36,970
In that particular story,
there is a subterranean realm,

233
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,410
and in that subterranean realm learn
things that can paralyze you.

234
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,470
If you look at them.
That's the [inaudible].

235
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,270
Now,
what do you think happens if a rabbit

236
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:49,180
sees a Fox,
what does it do?

237
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,270
It phrases.
Why

238
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,520
are absolutely right?
They had rabbit assumes that it's

239
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,940
camouflaged and so as long as it doesn't
move,

240
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,760
then maybe there's some chance that the
Predator won't see it,

241
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,880
and so the idea that you turned to
stone,

242
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,730
when you look at something that's
predatory and Reptilian,

243
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,590
I've been.
That's an old idea.

244
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,600
You know,
God only knows how old that is.

245
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,500
It's probably about as old as mammals.
I suspect it's something in the

246
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:21,190
neighborhood of 60 million years old,
maybe even older than that because it

247
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:25,450
was at that point that our primitive
ancestors were living in trees and being

248
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,540
preyed upon by by snakes.
Mostly because our ancestors back six,

249
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:33,370
2 billion years ago,
got eaten by snakes quite a lot.

250
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,770
They seem to have coevolved with us.
In fact,

251
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,260
there's some evidence from a woman named
Lynn Isabelle,

252
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:42,520
who's quite an interesting scholar that
the reason that we can see so well is

253
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,170
actually because we learned,
we developed our vision to detect

254
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:49,450
predatory reptiles,
most particularly snakes,

255
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,450
and the way she found that out.

256
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,540
It was by because human beings have
amazing eyes.

257
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,360
Hey,
we can see like no other animal except

258
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:58,000
for raptors,
except for birds of prey.

259
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,700
They can see better than us,
but as far as primates go,

260
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:02,050
man,
we knock it out of the park.

261
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:04,870
And mammals too.
We've got amazing vision and what

262
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,330
Isabelle did was look around the world
to see,

263
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,280
um,
what predicted,

264
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,960
how accurate the eyesight of primates.
We're in different locales.

265
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,170
And what she found was there's a
powerful relationship with the presence

266
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:20,450
of predatory snakes.
That's an extraordinarily cool thing.

267
00:14:20,451 --> 00:14:21,670
And you know,
it gives you some,

268
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,590
it gives you some insight into the level
of depth that might be involved in the

269
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:29,260
analysis of the symbolic realm,
you know,

270
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,760
in the,
in the Harry Potter,

271
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,740
the Harry Potter story.
The second,

272
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,690
the second story is almost a precise
duplicate of the story of St George.

273
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,230
And if you look up St George on the net,
if you Google St George,

274
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:44,020
you'll see that St George is usually on
a horse.

275
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,560
And what he's doing is slaying a dragon.
Usually it's not a very big dragon

276
00:14:47,561 --> 00:14:49,270
usually,
but it's bigger than his horse.

277
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:54,271
But it's particularly nasty looking and
it comes out of a cave and he frees a

278
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:58,340
virgin from its grasp.
That's exactly what happens in Harry

279
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:58,551
Potter,
right?

280
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:03,380
Because it's jenny that's down there.
And remember Harry gets eaten by the are

281
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,790
bitten by the bass list.
Great.

282
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,560
And it's kind of poisoned,
right?

283
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:08,240
And so he's going to die.
And then what happens?

284
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,890
Yeah.
Phoenix comes.

285
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,510
And so what's a phoenix?
It's,

286
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,740
yeah,
it's a symbol of death and rebirth.

287
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,880
Exactly,
exactly.

288
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:23,881
And so what the story that Harry Potter
story says is that if you're fighting a

289
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:25,540
dragon,
a snake,

290
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,330
something terrible,
something that will paralyze you if you

291
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:32,920
look at it and you're doing that in
order to redeem something that redeemed

292
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:36,640
something from that encounter,
because you often learn things when you

293
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,470
do something that you're afraid of.
In fact,

294
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,140
almost all learning occurs in spite of
fear,

295
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,500
right?
Because to,

296
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,970
to learn something,
you have to explore something new and

297
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:47,530
that's usually something that's
frightening.

298
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,560
And so what that means is that if you're
willing to face something that's

299
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:52,990
frightening,
you can garner something of value.

300
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,730
Now I'd also meat.
It also may well mean in the context of

301
00:15:57,731 --> 00:16:01,120
that story and you see this in the
romance that underlies the first part of

302
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:05,350
Harry Potter is that you know,
the man who's capable of standing up to

303
00:16:05,351 --> 00:16:09,130
predatory reptiles is also the one who
is most likely to attract women.

304
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,910
And I think that that's been a truth
since God only knows when to.

305
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,240
We have no idea,
but human beings are definitely hunters,

306
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,130
right?
And men are bigger than women.

307
00:16:18,131 --> 00:16:21,160
And one of the things that that suggest
is that you know,

308
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,910
a lot of the predatory like activities
that are characteristic human beings

309
00:16:24,911 --> 00:16:27,640
were undertaken by males and some
usually males that hunt.

310
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,870
But anyways,
we can.

311
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,960
We can put all that.
We can put all that aside.

312
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,940
Harry gets bitten by this Basler can.
Part of the reason that this story shows

313
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:40,420
that is because it wants to tell you,
the story wants to tell you,

314
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:44,200
so to speak,
that the danger that you faced when you

315
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,940
voluntarily confront something you're
afraid of in order to learn is actually

316
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,650
a danger.
It's a real.

317
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,560
You see it in example like that too in
the avengers.

318
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,320
Um,
I don't remember the guy's name.

319
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:58,390
He's the black guy with the patch over
his eye.

320
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,853
Who is that?

321
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,111
Yeah.
Yeah.

322
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:03,820
Well,
you know,

323
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,653
that,
that,

324
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,980
that,
the representation of the,

325
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,610
of the one eyed hero is also quite
common.

326
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:11,960
And you see this,
for example,

327
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,290
in ancient Egyptian mythology,
there's a god named horace who all

328
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,310
talked to you about.
In fact,

329
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:17,780
I'm going to see.
There's a picture of horace,

330
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:21,620
actually horses.
The God on the left there on the picture

331
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:23,540
of the left,
he's got a face like a,

332
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,580
uh,
like a falcon.

333
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,810
And that's because Falcons can see.
And the reason the Egyptians turned

334
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,390
horse into a falcon is because horace is
the eye.

335
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,490
You've seen all seen the famous Egyptian
I,

336
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,140
horace can see one of the things he sees
is evil and that actually he has an

337
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,030
encounter with evil.
And as a consequence,

338
00:17:41,031 --> 00:17:43,910
one of his eyes gets torn out.
An idea there is that,

339
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,610
you know,
you have to face evil.

340
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,190
It will just like you have to confront
fear.

341
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,970
It's fear can paralyze you in.
And the things that make you afraid can

342
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:53,340
kill you and in a confrontation with
evil,

343
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:57,600
the same thing can happen is that it can
be so overpowering and traumatic that it

344
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,420
damages your consciousness and like
these things are,

345
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:02,010
these things are real.
They are real.

346
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:03,680
I mean that,
that happened to a,

347
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,850
what's the general's name?
A Canadian general who was there during

348
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:12,900
the Rwandan massacre.
He developed post traumatic stress

349
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:17,250
disorder and he entitled the book he
wrote about the development of his

350
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:20,820
posttraumatic stress disorder was called
shake hands with the devil.

351
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,450
And that's really what he meant because
he,

352
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:25,080
he met one of the guys who led the
massacre,

353
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,100
you know,
and anyways,

354
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:28,980
he never really recovered from that.
He has posttraumatic stress disorder.

355
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,130
And so these things are extraordinary.

356
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,060
Real.
Now,

357
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,060
back to the basilisk.
Well,

358
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,380
if you're going to confront something
that's dangerous enough and informative

359
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:44,700
enough to like virtually kill you and
you're going to survive,

360
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,020
what does that mean?
It means that your capacity for death

361
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:52,590
and renewal is what saves you.
And so you know,

362
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,180
giving you think,
you think about this.

363
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:59,181
Partly what it means is that like
there you are,

364
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,490
but you learn something,
okay,

365
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,020
well,
once you learn something,

366
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,910
you're not the same as you were before
you learned it,

367
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,410
right?
There's a transformation,

368
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,460
so that means you're the same as you are
because you're still there,

369
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,610
but you're also different and then you
might also ask yourself,

370
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,900
well,
what do you give up when you learn

371
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,180
something,
and that's an interesting question

372
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:23,181
because you very seldom learn something
that's completely without precedent.

373
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,010
Now if you do,
that's really shocking January,

374
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:26,970
but you generally don't.

375
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,720
What happens is that you already have a
framework of evaluation that you're

376
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:34,560
using to interpret the world and you
know it's good enough to get you from

377
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:37,680
place to place,
but it's not 100 percent accurate and

378
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:40,860
when you encounter something you didn't
expect or something that's frightening

379
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,200
so that you have to transform your
knowledge.

380
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:47,040
Generally what happens is you have to
lose some of what you already presumed

381
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,620
before you can learn something new.
You know,

382
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,000
it's like a prejudice or an
oversimplification or an element of your

383
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:57,930
ignorance has to be allowed to die
before you can incorporate the

384
00:19:57,931 --> 00:20:00,480
information and then grow.
And so you might say,

385
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:02,760
well,
death is the precondition for learning

386
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,030
at least symbolically speaking,
and that's exactly what the Phoenix is

387
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,300
attempting to represent in the Harry
Potter story.

388
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,480
Now,
who owns the Phoenix Dumbledore,

389
00:20:12,481 --> 00:20:14,430
right?
And he's sort of God of hogwarts,

390
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,120
so to speak.

391
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,953
You know,
so.

392
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,150
So the,
the Phoenix stands in the same

393
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,560
relationship to Dumbledore that Christ
stands in relationship to God,

394
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,860
the father in Christianity.
It's exactly the same kind of idea.

395
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,200
While it's not exactly the same
obviously,

396
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:31,110
but the underlying structure of the idea
is very similar.

397
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,830
And if you remember maybe what happens
to Harry Potter at the very end of the,

398
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,100
of the series,
what,

399
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,210
what,
what process does he have to go through?

400
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:41,670
He dies,
right?

401
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:43,500
And then he comes back to life,
right?

402
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:47,010
And he has to die and come back to life
in order to defeat.

403
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,230
It's pretty funny because you know,
a lot of people especially

404
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:54,700
fundamentalist in the US where all over
Harry Potter for it's hypothetically

405
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,170
Antichristian oh cultism.
But you know,

406
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,700
the fundamental story,
I wouldn't say it's Christian exactly

407
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,460
because it's actually older than
Christianity itself,

408
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,820
but the main themes in Harry Potter are
like Christian symbolism in the main

409
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,440
themes to a great degree.

410
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,450
You know,
and it's funny because most of the time

411
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,240
when you go see this sort of thing,
how many of you watched all the Harry

412
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,070
Potter movies?
Yeah.

413
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:19,900
Like what the hell's up with that?
You know,

414
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,190
this woman got people reading 700 page
books and when they were 10 years old,

415
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:25,810
I,
I suspect a lot of you were those

416
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,100
people,
you know,

417
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,230
so why were you so interested in that
stuff?

418
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,270
God's sake.
It's about a magic orphan.

419
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,680
What's wrong with you people,
you know,

420
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,500
magic orphans,
you know,

421
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:39,910
but for some reason why an orphan,
well superman's an orphan to.

422
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,450
And if you go on Wikipedia,
it's kind of an interesting thing to do.

423
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,960
Look up superhero orphans.
It's like 500 of them,

424
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,090
you know?
And it's,

425
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,500
that's a very comp goes along.
It also goes along with the idea of

426
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:56,620
having two sets of parents,
which is also characteristic both of

427
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:58,780
superman and of Harry Potter,
right?

428
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,650
Because Harry has his daily day to day,
you know,

429
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:06,610
parents that aren't as real parents and
then he has his heavenly parents who are

430
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:10,510
as magic parents and you know,
this representation here that I've got

431
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:13,780
up in front of you and I was telling you
a little bit about that in the last

432
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:17,920
lecture you could say in some sense
those are representations of your magic

433
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,440
parents and so you can think about it
this way.

434
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:24,640
It's like you have a mother and a father
and those are your local mothers and

435
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,790
fathers and whether or not you get along
with them or whether or not they were

436
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,120
any good for you or whether you
understand them or anything like that in

437
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:34,390
some sense is irrelevant because they're
not your real parents,

438
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,230
your real parents or something.
More like nature biology,

439
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,970
the unknown.
Something like that.

440
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,080
And culture.

441
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,360
We kind of think of that as nature and
nurture,

442
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,460
you know,
which is also a symbolic idea,

443
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,420
and so one of the things that young
thought Freud thought you couldn't be a

444
00:22:49,421 --> 00:22:53,500
man until your father died suddenly kind
of an interesting idea and young said,

445
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:55,360
yeah,
but the death could be symbolic,

446
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,410
and partly what he meant by that was
that you know in so far as you're still

447
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:03,880
the son of your father or the daughter
of your father or the son of your mother

448
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,790
or the daughter of your mother,
you still haven't grown up.

449
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,830
You haven't taken the projections,
and those will be Friday and projections

450
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,490
that make you subordinate to your
parents because you might ask yourself,

451
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:17,230
why the hell do you care what your
parents think?

452
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,080
You don't care what any random set of
50,

453
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,800
60 year old people think about you.
Why do you care what your parents think?

454
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,040
Well,
the reason for that I would say is

455
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:32,041
because you're suffering or benefiting
as a consequence of a projection.

456
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:36,910
You project something onto your parents.
It's like a quasi identity status and

457
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,640
they're the people who know what's going
on and they're,

458
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,490
you know,
they're entitled to evaluate you and

459
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,520
maybe you're working to achieve things
to impress them and make them happy.

460
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:47,031
It's like,
well,

461
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:49,100
why them?
Why them?

462
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,620
You don't care what their parents,
friends think.

463
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:54,920
I don't imagine you probably don't
really care what the parents of your

464
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,620
friends think.
So why do you care what your parents

465
00:23:57,621 --> 00:23:59,120
think?
Well,

466
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,380
understanding that is part of coming to
understand the dynamics.

467
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,620
Freud would say,
of the personal unconscious because your

468
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:10,760
relationship with your parents as part
of your personal unconscious and young's

469
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:11,511
idea was,
well,

470
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:14,510
you have to replace.
It's interesting because Freud thought

471
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,540
that the reason there were patriarchal
religions was because people projected

472
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:23,180
the figure of their father onto the
cosmos in some sense.

473
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,300
They sort of personified the cosmos.
You know,

474
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:27,590
it's like God is an old man with a
beard,

475
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,560
which by the way isn't a stupid theory
as it sounds like.

476
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,480
But anyways.
Um,

477
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,730
so you know,
Freud thought that religion sort of

478
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:38,660
emerged out of the familial dynamic,
but young thought that that wasn't

479
00:24:38,661 --> 00:24:42,140
exactly right because the religious
symbols like say the one on the right

480
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:45,680
there where you have God,
the father was representing something

481
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:49,400
like a metta father,
you know the sum total of all fathers,

482
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,580
which would be something like the
Patriarchy and you need a representation

483
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,690
of that because you are a child of
culture and if you're not a child of

484
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:59,480
culture,
then you're an incomplete being and you

485
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:02,300
also don't want to confuse your parents
or your father.

486
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,760
Let's say.
I mean there's masculine and feminine

487
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:07,580
elements in both parents,
but for the sake of simplification,

488
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,320
I'm going to lay it out the way I am
laying.

489
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:11,360
You know,
you don't want to confuse your father

490
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,530
with culture or history.
It gives the embodiment of both those

491
00:25:15,531 --> 00:25:17,240
things,
but he certainly doesn't embody it in

492
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:20,270
total and your primary relationship in
some sense,

493
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,070
your personal relationship is to your
father,

494
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:26,420
but your primary existential
relationship is actually to culture

495
00:25:26,421 --> 00:25:27,254
itself.

496
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,963
Now,

497
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,360
I can give you an example of that to a
quick example.

498
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,600
How many have you Seen Poor Pinocchio?
Yeah,

499
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,690
so anybody not.
Well you,

500
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,940
you should watch it.
It's a great movie.

501
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,300
It's a bit dated and in some of its bit
preachy,

502
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:51,060
but fundamentally they knocked it out of
the park.

503
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,760
So Pinocchio is this fake thing,
right?

504
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,010
He's like this artificial boys made by
Japan,

505
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:58,800
who's was a pretty good guy.
What's Pinocchio trying to do?

506
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,991
Right,
right.

507
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,210
Well hopefully that's part of what
you're trying to do and hopefully that's

508
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:06,900
a process that this class could
conceivably further.

509
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,210
So what is Pinocchio have to do in
relationship to his father in order to

510
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:13,050
become real?

511
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,480
He rescues him,
right?

512
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,490
What does he do?
He goes down to the bottom of the ocean.

513
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,230
Was He fine?
They're a whale.

514
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,140
Weirdly enough.
And really weirdly enough,

515
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:23,760
you know,
I don't know what a puppet is doing on

516
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:25,350
the bottom of the ocean looking for a
whale,

517
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,370
but apparently it swallowed his father,
which also none of that makes any sense

518
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,350
at all.
You realize it makes no sense,

519
00:26:31,351 --> 00:26:34,470
but of course you're in there like
following it and thinking,

520
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,190
yeah,
well I can.

521
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,520
You know I can suspend disbelief.
You know,

522
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,510
it's just a puppet,
wouldn't pop it and it's looking for his

523
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:44,310
father at bottom of the ocean in a
whale.

524
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,710
Oil makes it doesn't make any sense at
all,

525
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:48,660
right?
It makes no sense whatsoever,

526
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,350
but it's a mythological motif and part
of that motif.

527
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,250
It's a death and rebirth motif that
going down to the bottom of the ocean

528
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:57,300
and being devoured by something and then
coming back up,

529
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,300
so that's a death and rebirth Motif,
but even more importantly,

530
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:05,301
the motif there suggests that you can't
stop being a puppet Marionette,

531
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,650
somebody else's pulling your strings.

532
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,510
Something else is pulling your
strengths.

533
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,410
You're a Marionette till you rescue your
father from the bottom of the ocean,

534
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,270
and what does that mean?
Well,

535
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:18,930
it means that you're a puppet of forces.
You do not understand probably

536
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,470
prevailing political attitudes or
radiologists or something pathetic like

537
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:27,471
that until you make the attempt to dive
down into the depths and reclaim your

538
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:31,980
identity with history as a phenomena.
You know,

539
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,080
because you might say,
well why should you study history?

540
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:34,914
It's like,
well,

541
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,230
history is you,
you know,

542
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:39,900
if you're,
if you're not studying history with the

543
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,670
understanding that you're studying
yourself,

544
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:45,360
then you don't know what the hell you're
doing and you can't be a complete person

545
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:49,320
because we're culture where cultural
people were cultural creatures.

546
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,800
You can't be a full person until you
catalyze your identity with your culture

547
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,140
and it's,
it's like an existential obligation.

548
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,950
So,
and if you don't do it then you're going

549
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:04,440
to feel all nihilistic and weak or
you're going to be old totalitarian and

550
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,720
self righteous and oppressive and you
know,

551
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:08,430
maybe genocidal and deadly.

552
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,380
So it's,
it's not something that you can just

553
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,670
brush off,
you have to do it.

554
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,220
It's part of an initiation motif by the
way,

555
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,710
which we're also going to talk about.
So.

556
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,630
So that's some,
it's hard to talk about symbolism and

557
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:23,940
you'll notice,
especially in the first part of the

558
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,180
lecture,
is that my lectures are,

559
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,620
well,
I like to think about them as

560
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:31,180
impressionist.
And there's a reason for this.

561
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:34,050
Like I started reading young about 30
years ago,

562
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:35,790
I would say,
and I pretty much read everything he

563
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,520
wrote,
which is an awful lot and it's very

564
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:43,410
difficult to read you because there's
not precisely a linear narrative,

565
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,030
but the reason for that is that it's
very difficult to construct a linear

566
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:53,031
narrative about information that's been
primarily transmitted in images and so

567
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:58,120
in order to to impart the knowledge,
you have to give people like some

568
00:28:58,121 --> 00:28:59,790
pictures of the whole picture.

569
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,350
It's almost like like laying them out in
space in a sense and so that if you get

570
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:07,650
enough of those little sub pictures,
the whole thing will click into focus

571
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:08,484
and you'll think,
Aha,

572
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:11,940
I get that.
But wandering through it in a linear

573
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:14,310
manner is extraordinarily difficult.
In fact,

574
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:17,700
I don't think it's possible.
I also think that's why the kind of

575
00:29:17,701 --> 00:29:22,701
information that's embodied in symbols
is generally not transmitted as linear

576
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,200
articulated knowledge.
You can't transmit it that way.

577
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,710
And so it remains in forums like this.
You look at those pictures,

578
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:33,480
you know,
so think about those pictures for a

579
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,830
minute.
Okay.

580
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:37,560
Is the picture on the left?
So that's ancient Egypt,

581
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,840
ancient Egypt law lasted for longer than
Western,

582
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,870
said if you don't include Egypt as part
of Western civilization,

583
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,520
it's certainly lasted longer than what
we generally consider Western

584
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,980
civilization.
It lasted for thousands and thousands of

585
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,370
years.

586
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:54,460
Right?
And those images are representations of

587
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,340
the fundamental assumptions of Egyptian
culture.

588
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:01,240
And so those images had foundational
power for eons,

589
00:30:01,241 --> 00:30:03,700
for thousands and thousands of years.
You know,

590
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,690
when you can just look at them and
nothing happens to you,

591
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,610
you,
you know,

592
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,040
you look at them like they're
photographs or,

593
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,660
or blow our flat images,
but they had the kind of motive power

594
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:17,770
that drove an entire culture for
thousands and thousands of years.

595
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,960
You know,
they had more motive power than

596
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:24,310
communist ideology for example,
which only managed to motivate people

597
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:28,660
for about 50 years and you know,
but it's certainly possible that they

598
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,990
had more motive power than Christian
ideas which have only been around for

599
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,600
roughly 2000 years.
You know.

600
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,610
So when you're looking at something like
that,

601
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:40,780
you're looking at something with power
and the idea that you know that that

602
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,530
symbolic representations or religious
represented representations are,

603
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,850
what do you call a unsophisticated
empirical theories,

604
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:51,010
like that's an idiotic theory,
you know?

605
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,720
No,
I don't think that anybody who's

606
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:57,040
educated should be,
should be proposing such a thing after

607
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:01,210
more than 100 years of psychoanalytic
and anthropological investigation.

608
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,570
It's just not a tenable theory anymore.
So.

609
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,970
So what are the other people up to?
Well,

610
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:08,650
let's look.
Let's look at the left hand side.

611
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:11,620
I can tell you a little bit about what
the Egyptians were trying to figure out.

612
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,530
So on the right hand side of the
picture,

613
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,180
you have isis,
okay?

614
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:19,990
And now isis is goddess of the
underworld and she's also a goddess of

615
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:23,080
chaos.
And so she's the goddess of the place

616
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,300
that you go when things fall apart
around you.

617
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,270
And it's worthwhile thinking of that as
a domain.

618
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,310
And you know what that's like.
So okay,

619
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,400
so a dream falls apart or revision falls
apart,

620
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:36,970
or you get dumped by someone you love or
you get betrayed or you fail.

621
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,070
Or maybe you just have,
you know,

622
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,980
maybe you have a,
Ah,

623
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,780
maybe you have clinical depression or
you're hyper anxious,

624
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,370
or you know,
you have some negative emotion

625
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,630
pathology.
Well,

626
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:51,040
that's a state of being right.
You can think about it as a place and

627
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:54,100
that place is the underworld.
The underworld is where you go when

628
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:57,880
things fall apart.
And the representation for the Egyptians

629
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,030
of the underworld was primarily isis.
She was the persona find figure that

630
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:08,971
represented the domain that was
underneath normative knowledge and the

631
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:12,330
reason she was female.
It's very complicated and I'd really,

632
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,680
like I said last time,
I really don't have time to explain it

633
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,200
in depth unfortunately,
but part of the reason that the

634
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:20,410
underworld is given feminine qualities.
There's,

635
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,210
there's lots of reasons,
but one of them is,

636
00:32:22,211 --> 00:32:26,440
is that
that kind of the defining feature of the

637
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:29,410
feminine is that from which new forms
emerge,

638
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,440
that's almost,
that's almost like there's other ways of

639
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:34,120
defining female,
but that's our feminine.

640
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,880
But that's a pretty good one.
It's pretty universal one.

641
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,330
And the unknown is feminine because the
unknown is the place from which all new

642
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:43,220
forms emerge.
Right?

643
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,040
So when you interact with the unknown on
a voluntary basis,

644
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,420
which can be symbolized sexually,
which often happened with Freud's

645
00:32:50,421 --> 00:32:54,260
thinking and with his clients,
you bring forth something new and so

646
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:59,120
it's a terrifying place to descend into.
It can be hellish because hale is

647
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:03,860
actually like the worst suburb of the
unknown and I'm sure some of you have

648
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:06,290
been there too,
so,

649
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,780
or maybe you're there now or maybe you
know,

650
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:11,390
people who were there.
So it's a very,

651
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:14,570
very rough place to visit,
especially if you do it accidentally,

652
00:33:14,571 --> 00:33:16,820
but you,
if you go there,

653
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,130
especially accidentally,
you might never come out.

654
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:22,850
But if you do come out,
maybe you've learned something,

655
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,000
maybe you're new in some way.
And that's another reason in some sense

656
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:32,540
why the feminine is a symbolic
representation of the unknown because

657
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,940
there is a death and rebirth motif
there.

658
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,610
And birth has always associated with the
feminine.

659
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,490
So,
um,

660
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,260
can I remember the word?

661
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,073
No,
I can't.

662
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,060
The Baptismal Fountain Inn in Christian
ceremony.

663
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:55,061
So baptism ceremonies has a Latin word
that is basically equivalent to uterus.

664
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,390
So you can look that up if you want.
I can't,

665
00:33:57,391 --> 00:33:59,350
unfortunately,
I can't exactly remember the word,

666
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,810
but it's the same idea.
You're being plunged back into

667
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:07,360
the feminine underpinnings of everything
and then pulled back up and.

668
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,400
Well,
that's what a baptism is supposed to be.

669
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,910
You're supposed to be born into this
spirit instead of into matter.

670
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,840
And that means that you've emerged as a,
as a,

671
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:19,060
um,
articulated being that isn't merely a

672
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:21,370
biological product.
It's something like that.

673
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,780
So,
all right,

674
00:34:22,781 --> 00:34:24,370
so that's,
that's isis.

675
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,590
And Isis is the,
the wife of Ho of ocirus or Cyrus who's

676
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,090
in the middle,
standing on a pillar there.

677
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,650
He's the father and he's a pillar
because culture is like the pillars that

678
00:34:35,651 --> 00:34:39,310
hold things up.
And so in the Egyptian story or Cyrus

679
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,070
was an old king and he was kind of
willfully blind.

680
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:45,310
He didn't really know what was going on
anymore and he didn't pay sufficient

681
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:47,320
attention.
And he had an evil brother by the way,

682
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:50,620
whose name was seth and seth average
eventually chops them up,

683
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,300
wants to take over the kingdom and
scattered them all over the kingdom.

684
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:58,720
He can't kill him because he's a god and
isis comes up from the underworld and

685
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,940
fines.
Those Cyrus's salice and makes herself

686
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:05,710
pregnant and she gives birth to horace.
Who's the guy on the left and horace is

687
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:08,710
sort of like King Arthur were any number
of orphans.

688
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,940
He grows up or or like a lion and the
lion king,

689
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,780
Simba.
Simba grows up basically outside of the

690
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,610
damage kingdom,
right?

691
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,760
It's taken over by scar.
It's exactly the same story.

692
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:25,090
It's a really.
It's exactly the same story and

693
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,650
horace grows up outside the kingdom and
when he grows up,

694
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,110
he can really see horus.

695
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:35,170
That's why the symbol is the eye.
He goes back and he can see evil.

696
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:38,910
He's not blind like his father,
which is the difference between you guys

697
00:35:38,911 --> 00:35:40,200
and dead culture,
right?

698
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,630
So your cultural organisms,
but you're not dead.

699
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:47,070
You can see and you can update yourself.
So you're like the living embodiments of

700
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:51,330
history and the living embodiments of
history have to know what history is and

701
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:55,250
incorporated into themselves,
but also be awake enough to alternate

702
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,040
where that alteration is necessary,
especially when they're doing that to

703
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:04,230
further their knowledge of the unknown
and also to triumph over evil.

704
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,220
So anyways,
horace grows up outside,

705
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,800
but like he can see he's different than,
oh,

706
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,230
Cyrus.
Partly because he's young and he knows

707
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:16,860
that his uncle is evil and he goes back
and has a terrible fight with them.

708
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:19,890
And during the fight,
seth,

709
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,610
his uncle terrorists out one of his eyes
because it's no joke to confront evil.

710
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,980
It's no joke.
It can damage your consciousness.

711
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,940
Anyways,
horse wins and he gets his id back and

712
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:34,800
then he banishes seth to the Nether
regions of the kingdom because he can't

713
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,370
get rid of him either.
You can't kill him.

714
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,420
He's the potential for corruption in an
institution is always there.

715
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:44,940
So there's no permanently get rid of it.
There's only controlling it from time to

716
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:49,560
time anyways.
So he gets his id back and then instead

717
00:36:49,561 --> 00:36:51,570
of putting it back in his head and be in
king,

718
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,080
which you'd expect them to do,
he goes back down to the underworld and

719
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:58,740
he finds his father there because his
father chopped up is also a spirit who

720
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:03,720
inhabits the underworld and he gives his
father the eye

721
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,280
and then the two of them go back and
rule the kingdom together.

722
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,170
I tell you,
it's one of the world's most brilliant

723
00:37:10,171 --> 00:37:12,960
stories.
It's a staggeringly brilliant story

724
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,430
because it says

725
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,780
the act,
that act of youth should be the guiding

726
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:23,010
property of the state because the
horace.

727
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:27,850
So Cyrus combination was actually what
the Pharaoh imitated when he was being a

728
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:30,970
good feral.
It's dynamic vision.

729
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:33,070
That should be the guiding principle of
the state,

730
00:37:33,071 --> 00:37:36,670
but it should be allied with tradition.
It's brilliant.

731
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,310
You know,
it's one of the things that the radical

732
00:37:39,311 --> 00:37:42,160
revolutionaries of the 19 sixties never
figured out.

733
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,331
It's like,
well,

734
00:37:43,331 --> 00:37:46,540
don't trust anybody over 30.
Well that's a really stupid idea,

735
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:51,100
especially since you're going to spend
half two thirds of your life over 30 the

736
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:52,060
hell good.
Is that.

737
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,210
So the idea is that you're supposed to
embody your tradition,

738
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:58,060
men be awake at the same time,
and then if you do that,

739
00:37:58,061 --> 00:37:59,890
then you'd be a good ruler of,
you know,

740
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,750
of yourself,
of your little family,

741
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:04,780
and if you have an opportunity to,
beyond that then of whatever

742
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:07,060
organizations you have to be happened to
be involved in,

743
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,000
that's exactly what should be happening
to you university.

744
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,250
It's the whole point of going to
university,

745
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,230
you know,
it's not a trade school.

746
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,700
Not,
not that there's anything wrong with

747
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,740
trade schools,
quite the contrary,

748
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,150
but that's not what university is for.
It's to turn you into creatures that

749
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:25,210
aren't marionettes.
And to do that you have to follow a

750
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:28,420
mythological path or you can be chaotic
and random.

751
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,330
Those are or sub,
like I said,

752
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:33,820
subject to so many idiotic totalitarian
ideology.

753
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:36,850
But you know,
I wouldn't it either of those paths

754
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:39,190
because they're not going to get you
very far for very long.

755
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,770
So that's the Egyptians.
Brilliant.

756
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,930
And it's not like they understood that
story.

757
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,350
They told it.
That's different.

758
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:51,280
It's just like,
can you think,

759
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:52,660
well,
how can you tell something you don't

760
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,510
understand?
It's just like you can watch Harry

761
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,070
Potter and not have a clue what's going
on.

762
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,820
It's exactly the same thing.
And part of it is,

763
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:04,240
is that there are,
you have levels of understanding that

764
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,960
make you up,
but you don't simultaneously understand.

765
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:10,950
You can't articulate them.
So you're a multi levered,

766
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:15,940
multilevel creature and the part of you
that's conscious and articulate is

767
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:19,930
floating on a massive substructure
that's neither conscious nor articulate,

768
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,900
you know,
that's in some sense striving to become

769
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:27,490
conscious and articulate,
but that can never be completely either

770
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:31,990
of those things.
So it's part of the pain of being half

771
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:33,460
spirit and half matter.

772
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,923
And

773
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,490
so then on the right,
you know,

774
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:39,800
you have another set of symbols which
are quite similar.

775
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,960
Um,
although,

776
00:39:41,961 --> 00:39:43,280
you know,
they come about the story in a

777
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:46,040
completely different way.
So I told you a little bit about them

778
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,270
before you have Mary at the top and
she's regardless,

779
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,800
she's,
she's represented here is that which

780
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:54,020
encloses everything,
right?

781
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:55,580
And so in that representation,

782
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,550
culture is the child of nature.
That's one way of looking at the

783
00:40:00,551 --> 00:40:03,430
statute.
There are many ways of looking at this

784
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:05,410
statue.
That's the other thing that's strange

785
00:40:05,411 --> 00:40:09,640
about symbolic representations because
in some sense you can't exhaust them

786
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,730
with words.
There's always something more you can

787
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:15,690
say about them and that's partly because
they're,

788
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:19,510
they're associated with everything.
And so if something is associated with

789
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:22,870
everything,
then you can talk about it forever and

790
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:25,660
you'll never run out of things to say
there are inexhaustible.

791
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,740
So,
and you have God the father who we

792
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:31,090
already talked about.
And then if you notice in that image,

793
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:35,170
I hope you can see that the figure is
open and there's a crowd of people

794
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:36,250
gathered around,
right?

795
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,100
And they're all looking at the central
symbol,

796
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:40,510
which is the crucifix.
And you know,

797
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,600
you might be thinking that,
you know,

798
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:47,440
billions of people over the last 2000
years have spent a substantial amount of

799
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,230
time doing nothing but gazing at the
crucifix.

800
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,370
It's like why,

801
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,330
you know,
in one answer as well,

802
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:57,150
those people are all superstitious.
They believe in stupid things like,

803
00:40:57,151 --> 00:40:59,370
you know,
death and resurrection and you know the

804
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:02,010
Virgin birth and all those things that
make no empirical sense.

805
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:03,060
It's like,
yeah,

806
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,070
well think again.
You know,

807
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,850
it's not a matter of simplistic belief.
It's a matter of belief structures that

808
00:41:08,851 --> 00:41:11,130
are so profound that you can't
articulate them.

809
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,090
You don't know what they mean,
and so to gaze on the figure of the

810
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,510
dying and resurrecting hero is to
understand that a huge part of what

811
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,570
redeems you in life from evil and from
the things that terrify you is your

812
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:29,571
capacity to let go of things that are
outmoded in dad and to revitalize them

813
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:34,430
as a consequence of new learning.
And that's the very soul.

814
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,070
It's your very soul.
It's a very.

815
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,270
It's the,
it's the living part of you.

816
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,150
And that's the part.
The thing that's so interesting about

817
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:45,230
this is according to the wisdom
traditions of mankind,

818
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:50,150
that's the part of your spirit that
protects you against fear and pain.

819
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:51,650
Because you might say,
well,

820
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:52,790
you know,
if you don't want fear,

821
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,800
you don't want pain.
You should build a big wall around

822
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:58,400
yourself and wrap yourself up in
Styrofoam and sit right in the middle

823
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,460
where nothing bad is ever going to
happen to you,

824
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,930
but you know,
first of all,

825
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:04,820
that's obviously ridiculous and second
of all,

826
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:07,850
you die of boredom in no time flat.
If you did that,

827
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,080
you cannot be protected from the things
that frighten you and hurt you.

828
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,090
But if you identify with the part of
your being that has the capacity for

829
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:18,860
transformation,
then you're always.

830
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,580
You're always.
You're always the equal of what it is

831
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:27,200
that's opposing you or maybe more than
the equal of it so you can either depend

832
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:29,330
on the walls that protect you from
things.

833
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:34,160
And so those could be like actual walls
or cultural walls or totalitarian

834
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:37,370
beliefs are rigid thought patterns or
anything like that.

835
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:42,680
Or you can rely instead on the part of
you that's voluntarily able to confront

836
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:46,100
things that are frightening and painful
and triumph.

837
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:51,370
And the deepest story of,
of humankind is that that's the part of

838
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:54,710
us that's the most powerful.
You know,

839
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,700
weak as we are and subject as we are to
all sorts of terrible things.

840
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,210
What do you need for protection?
That's what you need.

841
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,160
You have to be willing to let go and
come back and let go and come back and

842
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:11,630
then you can stay dynamic through your,
through the ups and downs of your life

843
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,020
and makes you incredibly strong.
And so,

844
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,970
you know,
one of the things that you could think

845
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:19,940
about in relationship to this,
and we'll talk about this more when we

846
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,230
talk about Carl Rogers.

847
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,560
Rogers talked a lot about the importance
of listening.

848
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,140
You know,
he said most people can't listen because

849
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,260
what they want to do instead is imposed
their viewpoint on the other person.

850
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,450
Because if you listen to people,
they're going to tell you all sorts of

851
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:35,090
weird nonsense about their own lives and
about what they think.

852
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,770
And you know,
some of it's gonna be.

853
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:40,400
It'll say it'll set you back.
You don't want to hear that.

854
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:43,490
People have gone through that until I
actually understand their opinions.

855
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,740
If you can listen to them,
well then you can open up an exchange of

856
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:52,340
information and that can transform both
of you and Rogers regarded that as an

857
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:55,970
absolute necessity in the therapeutic
context and even in the context of

858
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:58,040
profound relationships.
But he said,

859
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,600
you know,
most people won't do that because they

860
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,310
want to cling to what they already have.

861
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,830
And so one of the things you can think
of,

862
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:06,140
and this is,
this is worth thinking about for five

863
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:07,940
years here.
Here's something to think about.

864
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,800
What's your friend?
The things you know or the things you

865
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:15,410
don't know.
First of all,

866
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:17,270
there's a lot more things you don't
know.

867
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,530
And second the things you don't know are
the bar is the birthplace of all your

868
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:24,530
new knowledge.
And so if you make the things you don't

869
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:27,470
know your friend,
instead of the things that you know,

870
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,740
well then you're always on a quest.
In a sense,

871
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,810
you're always looking for new
information on the off chance that

872
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:36,360
somebody that doesn't agree with you
will tell you something.

873
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:39,510
You couldn't figure it out on your own.
It's a completely different way of

874
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:44,160
looking at the world,
so it's the antithesis of opinionated,

875
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,110
so.
Okay,

876
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,470
so
here's some

877
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,720
you can think of these terms.

878
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,770
Let me give you an example.
So I was just reading this research

879
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:02,310
paper by one of the people in our
department and he was looking at.

880
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,760
He's found out that people are better
than chance at determining sexual

881
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:12,891
orientation when they look at cropped
faces that are gray scaled with no hair

882
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,730
for 50 to 100 milliseconds.
That's pretty fast a,

883
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:20,550
it's like you're not thinking about it
at that speed.

884
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,630
It takes you half a second to think
about something maybe a little less,

885
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,090
but 50 milliseconds to 100 milliseconds.
Man,

886
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,610
that's automatic processing.
Okay,

887
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,190
so he found that if you show people
faces,

888
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:37,191
then they can predict with better than
chance levels of accurately accuracy

889
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,630
what the sexual orientation of the
person next.

890
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,940
Now we don't know exactly how they do
that,

891
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:46,170
do that,
but the other thing he found is that if

892
00:45:46,171 --> 00:45:51,171
you're exposed to say to a face that you
judge as a homosexual,

893
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:53,970
let's say,
and then you're given a bunch of

894
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:58,971
cognitive tasks where if you stare,
if you use the articulated stereotypes

895
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:04,380
of homosexual people,
you'll perform better that you do

896
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:07,980
perform better,
so you see a face that you instantly

897
00:46:07,981 --> 00:46:09,450
categorize as homosexual.

898
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,150
Then you're given a cognitive test that
you can do better at.

899
00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:16,140
If you rely on cognitive stereotypes and
you do do better on it.

900
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,560
So what that means is the brief
perceptual exposure activates a whole

901
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:27,471
complex of associated ideas and it's not
exactly obvious why those things are

902
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:29,580
associated it.
You might say,

903
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:32,820
well,
what does it mean to be gay or for that

904
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:34,260
matter?
What does it mean to be straight?

905
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:35,790
Well,
it means a whole bunch of things and you

906
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:38,460
probably couldn't tell me all of the
things that it means in some of the.

907
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,970
Some of them are things that you
perceive rather than fake.

908
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,630
No matter when you're exposed to that
particular image.

909
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:49,530
That entire complex of associations,
which is like a map,

910
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,270
the mapping of a personality,
right?

911
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:55,020
Because to be gay is to be a personality
of a certain sort.

912
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:00,030
It's to embody a certain mode of being
and so you have a picture of that

913
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:03,690
personality that's partly made out of
all your cognitive assumptions and that

914
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:08,691
can be activated at 50 milliseconds by
exposure to just a black and white

915
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:09,714
picture.

916
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,670
Okay,
so that's like a complex.

917
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,100
Just so you know,
you'll hear about the idea of complex

918
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:17,280
when you read,
when you read you and a complex is a set

919
00:47:17,281 --> 00:47:22,281
of associated ideas that tend to take on
embodied form and you might ask,

920
00:47:22,891 --> 00:47:26,700
well why would ideas tend to take on
embodied form?

921
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,700
And then answer to that is what the hell
is an idea if it doesn't take on

922
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,701
embodied form your embodied.
So to say that it ideas useful and you

923
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:37,810
make that judgment.
By the way,

924
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:41,770
when you find an idea interesting
because like why is it interesting?

925
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,410
You don't know.
Which is also something that's really

926
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,520
worth thinking about.
Right?

927
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,900
Because to be interested in something is
to be in the grip of a particular mode

928
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:52,450
of being and you don't have any
voluntary control over that.

929
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,860
Some things you find interesting and
some things you don't and you know,

930
00:47:56,861 --> 00:47:59,020
you might say,
well I'm going to concentrate on this

931
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:01,660
boring thing as hard as I can because I
have to master it.

932
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,850
Maybe after passing an exam or
something,

933
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,720
it's like good luck trying to get your
unconscious to cooperate because usually

934
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:08,411
it won't.
You know,

935
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:10,990
you'll be thinking about,
oh God only knows what you'll be

936
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:14,470
thinking about doing the dishes,
vacuuming up under the bed,

937
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:19,000
like anything not to concentrate on that
particular boring piece of information.

938
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,840
So back to the back to the complex and
the idea that ideas are embodied.

939
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,280
If an idea can't be embodied,
you have to ask yourself if it has any

940
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:33,100
utility because there's a trillion
facts,

941
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:34,330
right?
I mean you could go,

942
00:48:34,331 --> 00:48:35,980
right,
you can go on Google and write down

943
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:39,910
facts until you died and then you still
wouldn't have got anywhere near the

944
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:42,730
whole number of facts there are.
So then you might ask,

945
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:43,720
well,
what good are Fox?

946
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:47,200
If there's an infinite number of them
and the answered that is there actually

947
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:51,130
not much good at all,
unless you have a purpose for them and

948
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:54,220
if you have a purpose for them,
then the fact becomes embodied because

949
00:48:54,221 --> 00:48:57,730
you either use it to change your
perception or you use it to guide your

950
00:48:57,731 --> 00:49:00,310
actions and that's when it becomes
meaningful.

951
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,630
And so you might say in part that a
complex is the tendency of a group of

952
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:09,280
associated ideas to manifest themselves
in something approximating a

953
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:12,220
personality.
And then that also gives you a real key

954
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:15,400
to what the psychoanalysts were up to
because as far as they're concerned,

955
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,920
you're just chalked full of complexes.
And you know,

956
00:49:18,921 --> 00:49:19,391
we,
you know,

957
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:23,560
you think about yourself is one thing
which is foolish because you know,

958
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:27,190
you're obviously,
you're kind of like a loose collection

959
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:29,050
of microorganisms,
something like that.

960
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:31,750
And there's a certain amount of unity
because he moved the same way.

961
00:49:31,751 --> 00:49:32,680
And there's,
you know,

962
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:37,600
there's continuity of memory,
but the representational space that you

963
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:38,980
occupy,
you know,

964
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:41,150
what you can do with your body and what
you can imagine,

965
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:43,000
what you can think is,
is very,

966
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:47,620
very large and it's not necessarily
coherent or consistent and it switches

967
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:49,850
from moment to moment,
you know,

968
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,920
so you'll know that some of you
undoubtedly have already experienced

969
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,400
what it's like to be possessed by a
particularly stupid idea.

970
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,130
You know,
so maybe you've grown out of one or two

971
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:03,580
of the stupid ideas that possessed you
or maybe you're possessed by an

972
00:50:03,581 --> 00:50:06,700
attraction to someone you can't control
or you can't control your eating

973
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,110
behavior or you,
you know,

974
00:50:08,111 --> 00:50:10,860
you're a pushover when it comes to
interpersonal interactions because

975
00:50:10,861 --> 00:50:14,560
you're too agreeable or you fly off the
handle and fight and you know,

976
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,660
none of this is really under your
control.

977
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:23,450
And so all of those things that manifest
themselves not only in your behaviors

978
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:27,070
but in your perceptions,
your perceptions of themselves,

979
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:29,390
you know,
they tend to take on embodied form and

980
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:31,880
use you as the vehicle for their
activity.

981
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,440
So you know,
when you're thinking about something

982
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,990
like anger for example,
think about how it works because it's

983
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:43,991
quite peculiar.
What must someone generally do?

984
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,590
How much someone generally act if you're
going to be angry at them,

985
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:54,790
they have to be irritating,
right?

986
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:57,410
You know they have to provoke you in
some way.

987
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,630
Well,
the mere fact that you perceive what

988
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:01,490
they're doing is irritating or
provoking,

989
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:05,310
doesn't ensure that anyone else would
have thought about it as irritating,

990
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:09,680
are provoking or that that's what they
meant or that that's what's happening.

991
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:13,910
And my point is,
my point is it's very important to think

992
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:17,390
about these complexes of ideas as
subpersonalities because otherwise you

993
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:20,210
really don't get what they're like.
If you're angry,

994
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,300
if you have a proclivity towards anger,
especially if it's an unthinking

995
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:26,420
proclivity.
Anything that someone says might

996
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:30,650
irritate you and it isn't like they say
something and you think about it and

997
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:34,070
then you get irritated.
It's like you perceive the person as

998
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:35,480
irritating.
You know,

999
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:38,030
maybe it's just the way they hold their
mouth or something,

1000
00:51:38,031 --> 00:51:38,520
it,
it.

1001
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,100
It can be very,
very subtle.

1002
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,241
And you might say,
well,

1003
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:41,750
it's not me.

1004
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:44,510
It's you,
it's not that I'm irritated by you,

1005
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,620
it's the you're irritating and that you
know that's a very difficult thing to

1006
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:52,640
settle because the reality is somewhere
between the subjective and the

1007
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:53,580
objective,
right?

1008
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,140
A lot of arguments that you'll have with
people throughout your life are about

1009
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,000
exactly that.
Am I,

1010
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:01,100
are you irritating or am I over
sensitive?

1011
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,731
It's like,
well,

1012
00:52:01,731 --> 00:52:03,230
you know what?
We're going to hash that out for a good

1013
00:52:03,231 --> 00:52:06,160
long time before we figure it out,
but the point is is that if you're

1014
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:10,460
possessed by an emotional state or a
motivational state or an idea or some

1015
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,490
kind of complex,
you'll see the world through its eyes

1016
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,940
and then the facts reveal themselves to
you through the lens of that particular

1017
00:52:18,951 --> 00:52:22,490
set of ideas.
So it's very frightening idea because

1018
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:24,350
you know,
we like to think of ourselves as masters

1019
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:26,540
of our own house,
which is completely clueless because

1020
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:30,620
it's obvious if you watch yourself for
like a month that you hardly ever do

1021
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,890
what you tell yourself to do,
when you're liable to do all sorts of

1022
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,720
other things that you don't even want to
do.

1023
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,920
You know,
because you say,

1024
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:38,450
well,
I'm going to go to the gym three times a

1025
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:41,330
week and I'm not going to drink,
you know,

1026
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,210
and maybe there's this person I'm not
going to associate with and then you

1027
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:46,970
know,
you don't go to the gym and you find

1028
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:49,160
that person and you go out and drink
with them and you think,

1029
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:50,810
what the hell is going on?
You know?

1030
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,691
Um,
but it's,

1031
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:52,580
it's,
it's you,

1032
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:55,310
you're not the sort of person that will
do what you say.

1033
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,520
And so like,
what sort of person are you?

1034
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,780
Well,
that's a psychoanalytic question and

1035
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,360
it's a deep one because you're a
peculiar thing and there's parts of you

1036
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:06,260
that are really,
really,

1037
00:53:06,261 --> 00:53:09,590
really old and you know,
that sort of naive view,

1038
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:13,670
the naive young you that you think of
yourself as is like a little piece of

1039
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:16,520
flotsam in an ocean of complexity.

1040
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:21,720
And the ocean of complexity is you.
And part of diving down into the depths

1041
00:53:21,721 --> 00:53:25,000
is to start to understand what it means
to be human and all right,

1042
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,350
whatever that means.
It's the one thing you can say about it

1043
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:33,351
for sure is that it's bloody peculiar.
So here are some associations have ideas

1044
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:36,450
that go along with these symbolic
representations that I was describing.

1045
00:53:36,451 --> 00:53:40,710
So the feminine is off the nature,
and here's some associations.

1046
00:53:40,711 --> 00:53:44,910
They're not necessary associations.
There are common associations,

1047
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,900
so if you see these sorts of things,
they would make a narrative sense.

1048
00:53:48,901 --> 00:53:52,530
So for example,
if you see an old and somewhat evil

1049
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:56,430
woman in an animated movie and she lives
in the swamp,

1050
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,440
that makes sense.
Now,

1051
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,120
why does it make sense?
Well,

1052
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,140
I can't explain that at the moment,
but.

1053
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,820
Well,
it's partly because of the swamp is

1054
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:10,850
outside of the standard boat borders of
civilization and it's also a place of

1055
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,710
death,
decay and rebirth.

1056
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:15,480
So that's part of it.
Anyways.

1057
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,930
Some associations nature,
the is the unconscious.

1058
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:20,940
Why is the unconscious nature?
Well,

1059
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:24,420
because you can't control it.
It just manifests itself within you.

1060
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,880
That's the Friday and the.
It's like dreams.

1061
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,850
They happen.
You don't know what they mean.

1062
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,240
They just happen and so that's nature
operating inside of you.

1063
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:35,880
The terrors of the darkness.
Why?

1064
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,560
Well,
remember when you were a little kid,

1065
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:41,400
you're three and you're afraid of the
dark because kids at three are afraid of

1066
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:43,170
the dark.
What's in the dark?

1067
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,840
What are you looking for in your closet?
Monsters,

1068
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:52,090
right?
Where are the monsters?

1069
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,920
Well,
they're not in your closet.

1070
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:59,100
Hopefully so.
But that's not to say that there

1071
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:02,850
couldn't be a monster in your closet and
it's also not to say that when you look

1072
00:55:02,851 --> 00:55:04,620
at your closet,
when you're a little kid that you're

1073
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:09,150
looking at your closet,
maybe you're looking at the darkness and

1074
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:11,790
then the question of whether or not
there are monsters in the darkness gets

1075
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:16,170
a lot more complicated.
I had a client once who was agoraphobic

1076
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,500
and she didn't like to take elevators,
which is quite a common phenomena for

1077
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,040
people who are agoraphobic and so I was
doing standard exposure which is

1078
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:27,780
voluntary exposure to the unknown,
which is a prime curative process in

1079
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:30,900
psychotherapy.
It's like find out what you're afraid

1080
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,550
of.
It's interfering with your movement

1081
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:36,180
forward.
Break it into small pieces and expose

1082
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,740
yourself to it.
That works.

1083
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,520
So we go to the elevator and you know,
I say,

1084
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:44,040
well how close can you get to the
elevator without being nervous?

1085
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,630
So she stands like 10 feet away.
I said,

1086
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,210
okay,
well stand there until your board and

1087
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,740
then go three steps forward so she could
do that and you know,

1088
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,250
made her a little nervous.
And then I said,

1089
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:55,890
well,
I'll stand there until your board and

1090
00:55:55,891 --> 00:55:59,490
make sure you're looking at the elevator
and not avoiding it and then take

1091
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:02,960
another three steps forward and okay,
we keep doing that until she's like at

1092
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,220
the elevator.
So then I say,

1093
00:56:05,221 --> 00:56:08,700
well here's the deal,
we're just going to let the elevator

1094
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:11,330
doors open.
You don't have to get on.

1095
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,700
We'll let them close and then that's it
for,

1096
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,660
for today,
you know.

1097
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,630
And I always tell people when I'm doing
that sort of thing that I'm not going to

1098
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:19,351
trick them,
you know,

1099
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:21,210
there's no tricks.
It's like you don't have to do anything

1100
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,800
you don't want to do and I'm not going
to play any games on you.

1101
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,170
So okay,
so the door's open and she goes,

1102
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:28,930
that's a tube and then it closes.
And you think,

1103
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,110
well,
was that an elevator or a tube?

1104
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,740
And you might think,
well obviously it's an elevator.

1105
00:56:35,741 --> 00:56:39,850
It's like things are not so obvious,
you know,

1106
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:43,900
because there are many ways of
perceiving something and a given entity

1107
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:47,200
can be a member of multiple categories
at the same time and you say,

1108
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:48,130
okay,
well yeah,

1109
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:52,240
the elevator's not a tube,
but it's an enclosed dark place that

1110
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:56,740
contains the unknown and when you see an
elevator you just see like a conveyance

1111
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:58,930
that moves you up and down.
But that isn't what she saw.

1112
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,200
And you might say,
well what she saw is wrong.

1113
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:04,570
It's like not exactly,
but it's not functional,

1114
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:06,940
right?
Decide if you want to take an elevator

1115
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:11,380
then perceiving it as your tomb is
probably inappropriate,

1116
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:16,200
but the point is is that it has a lot of
associations like it's.

1117
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,390
It's a place of constriction and
privation and isolation and separation.

1118
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,640
And so it has elements of their elements
of its being that overlap with other

1119
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:30,940
things that are frightening and so
agoraphobic are often afraid to have.

1120
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:32,950
Being in a subway,
being a crowded in the subway,

1121
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,560
it's partly because they can't get out
and make it to the hospital.

1122
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:39,870
So when closed places are crowded,
places are places where they encountered

1123
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:42,850
their mortality because they get afraid
they're going to die and then they can't

1124
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:45,840
get to the hospital.
So you know,

1125
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,340
they come into a room like this and sit
in the middle and they,

1126
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,181
you,
you think,

1127
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:50,140
Hey,
crowd of students,

1128
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:50,860
they think,
ah,

1129
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,110
place of death.
And it's like,

1130
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,891
well,
you might say,

1131
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,600
well no,
this is a crowd of students.

1132
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:56,590
And I might say,
well,

1133
00:57:56,591 --> 00:57:58,390
what are,
how come you're so damn sure.

1134
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,680
It's not a place of death.

1135
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,470
Like generally it isn't,
but any of you could drop dead of a

1136
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:06,550
heart attack in the next five minutes.
So why aren't you terrified out of your

1137
00:58:06,551 --> 00:58:07,750
skulls?
Because of that?

1138
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:12,870
And the answer to that is you don't know
that's the answer because as far as I've

1139
00:58:13,871 --> 00:58:17,290
been able to tell,
most of the things agoraphobic or afraid

1140
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:21,490
of like that they might die at any
moment actually happens to be true.

1141
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,560
And so the fact that they're afraid of
that,

1142
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:24,550
it's like,
yeah,

1143
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:26,770
no kidding.
You're afraid of that.

1144
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,730
How are other people not afraid of it
while that?

1145
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:34,660
That's a good question.
So that's nature.

1146
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,880
That's nature.
I can tell you another reason.

1147
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:41,630
I think
why the feminine is nature.

1148
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,130
I don't know what you guys think about
this,

1149
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:46,640
but I was pretty happy when I thought
this up and it took me a long time.

1150
00:58:46,641 --> 00:58:51,641
So.
So if you think about the world in

1151
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,860
Darwinian terms,
right?

1152
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,140
It's a struggle for survival and
reproduction,

1153
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,560
which are basically the same thing.
Survival is you,

1154
00:59:00,561 --> 00:59:02,840
but reproduction is the survival of your
genes.

1155
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,240
So it's a,
it's a survival issue over very long

1156
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,800
spans of time.
Okay.

1157
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:11,140
What do we call the selection mechanism,

1158
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,550
right?
Natural selection,

1159
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,540
right?
It's nature.

1160
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,670
Who does the selection.
Okay.

1161
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:21,920
So let me tell you something that makes
female humans different than female

1162
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,840
chimps.
I mean,

1163
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:25,570
there's lots of things that they do,
but.

1164
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,310
So.
But here,

1165
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:33,310
here's an important one.
If you look at which male and a female

1166
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:37,160
in a chimp troop fathers,
most of the offspring,

1167
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:41,060
it's the dominant male.
But the reason for that isn't because

1168
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,970
the female chimps sort of flock around
the dominant male.

1169
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,300
Now that happens in other species,
but it doesn't happen with chimps.

1170
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:51,920
What happens is the dominant male chases
all the subordinate males away and will

1171
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,530
interfere with any sexual behavior they
manifest.

1172
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:57,800
They'll chase them away.
The females though are perfectly happy

1173
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:00,800
to meet with a subordinate male if
they're in heat and they get the

1174
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:02,630
opportunity.
So they go into heat,

1175
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:05,000
which is something that doesn't happen
with female humans.

1176
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:07,160
And they really don't care who they meet
with.

1177
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,850
Okay.
Female humans are much different than

1178
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:11,870
that.
They're picky.

1179
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,120
So there,
there are really,

1180
01:00:14,121 --> 01:00:15,800
they're choosy.
It's a big deal.

1181
01:00:15,801 --> 01:00:19,070
It's a big deal that they're choosing.
So there's this famous psychology

1182
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,910
experiments you've probably heard about.
These were undergraduate mail goes out

1183
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,460
and you know,
asks random women if they'll go home and

1184
01:00:25,461 --> 01:00:27,530
sleep with him,
have sex with him,

1185
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:28,730
and you know,
what are they,

1186
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,330
what happens?
I mean generally they say get away from

1187
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:33,680
me,
creep or something like that.

1188
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:35,990
Right?
Are they certainly indicate no,

1189
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:40,460
but then they do the reverse experiment
where they have a female undergraduate

1190
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:41,294
goal,
you know,

1191
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,260
proposition essentially males and.
Well,

1192
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,410
what happens then?
Well,

1193
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:51,590
the males say yes much more often than
the females to.

1194
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:53,510
Okay.
I'm sure that doesn't come as a surprise

1195
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:56,150
to any of you and you know,
part of the reason for that,

1196
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,523
who knows?

1197
01:00:57,710 --> 01:01:01,010
But part of the reason is that sex is
much more dangerous proposition for

1198
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:04,490
women than it is for men because they
have to bear the consequences.

1199
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,020
Literally if something,
if the logically appropriate thing

1200
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,060
happens,
which is they get pregnant.

1201
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:14,390
So at least in principle,
women recognize that and you know,

1202
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:17,300
they're a bit more cautious,
although there's more to it too because

1203
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:20,690
women also seem to evaluate men for
their fitness.

1204
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,430
Now.
So lots of men have no sexual partners

1205
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:29,030
and they have no children.
That's not the case with women.

1206
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,420
Almost all women have one child or more
and it's a rare woman indeed who cannot

1207
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,230
find a sexual partner.
Now,

1208
01:01:36,231 --> 01:01:38,720
Roy balmeister indicated,
and you're going to have to think this

1209
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:40,880
through because it doesn't make sense on
first encounter.

1210
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:45,110
You have twice as many female ancestors
as male ancestors,

1211
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,520
so what that essentially means is that
the success rate,

1212
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:53,270
the average success rate for propagation
for the typical woman is very high,

1213
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:58,220
and the average success rate for the
typical man is very low,

1214
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,850
but some men are hyper procreative.

1215
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:05,570
Okay?
So men are subject to selection pressure

1216
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:07,180
and many of them fail.
Here's a,

1217
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:11,320
here's an interesting statistic.
I think this came from Dataclysm,

1218
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:15,320
which is a book that was recently
written about one of those online dating

1219
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:16,630
sites.
Um,

1220
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,070
the big one,
can't remember its name,

1221
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:24,720
but he was looking at things like how
the typical woman on the dating site

1222
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:28,830
rates the typical man.
It's pretty funny because women are men

1223
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:31,320
actually rate women on a normal
distribution.

1224
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:35,640
So the typical woman's scores at the
50th percentile and half of them are

1225
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:37,500
above average and half of them are
below.

1226
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,710
What do you think the equivalent is for
women rating men?

1227
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,350
And everyone laughs,
especially the women.

1228
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,610
So what do you think it is?
It's 85,

1229
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,250
15,
85 percent of men are below average.

1230
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,490
Yeah,
it's annoying.

1231
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:56,340
You know,
unless you happen to be one of the 15

1232
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:57,990
percent who isn't,
you know,

1233
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:00,750
and those are the 15 percent of the guys
who are having all these sexual

1234
01:03:00,751 --> 01:03:03,660
encounters in a relatively sexually
liberated environment to,

1235
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,460
okay,
so why am I telling you all this?

1236
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:13,190
Women select men that makes them nature
because nature is what select.

1237
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,700
And so you know,
you can say,

1238
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,680
well,
it's only symbolic that women are

1239
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:19,461
nature.
It's like,

1240
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:20,810
no,
it's not just symbolic.

1241
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:23,770
It's not just symbolic.
You know,

1242
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:28,870
when the woman in some senses the
gatekeeper to rep is not in some sense

1243
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,970
is the gatekeeper to reproductive
success and you can't get more like

1244
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:34,650
nature than that.
In fact,

1245
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:39,360
it's the very definition of nature.
So as I said,

1246
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:42,750
there are lots of reasons why these
symbolic representations are setup the

1247
01:03:42,751 --> 01:03:44,340
way they are.
All right?

1248
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:47,970
So that's the great mother nature,
the Queen,

1249
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:50,310
the Matrix.
The Matrix is something from which all

1250
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:53,370
things form same root word as matter,
mother,

1251
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,410
all the same root word,
the matriarch,

1252
01:03:55,411 --> 01:03:56,910
the container,
the Cornucopia,

1253
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,790
the object to be fertilized,
the source of all things,

1254
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,020
the on the pregnant,

1255
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,500
there are more parts of the association
network,

1256
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:08,300
the strange,
the emotional,

1257
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,000
the foreigner,
the place of returning and rest,

1258
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,320
the deep,
the valley,

1259
01:04:12,321 --> 01:04:15,770
the Clef,
the cave hell death and the grave,

1260
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:20,360
the moon ruler of the night,
and the mysterious dark and matter in

1261
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,840
the earth.
So those aren't necessarily associated

1262
01:04:23,841 --> 01:04:26,990
with femininity,
but they're typically associated with

1263
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:29,810
femininity from a symbolic perspective,
you know,

1264
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:33,170
so like generally like a witch and a
movie doesn't come riding out of the

1265
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:35,030
full bright sun at noon.
Right?

1266
01:04:35,031 --> 01:04:37,160
That just doesn't happen because it
doesn't make sense.

1267
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:41,090
It's a dark thing.
And so if you saw that occurring in the

1268
01:04:41,091 --> 01:04:42,320
light and a movie,
you'd think,

1269
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:46,020
you know,
what the hell is going on here?

1270
01:04:46,021 --> 01:04:48,920
That doesn't make sense.
And the reason it doesn't make sense

1271
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,790
because it's,
it violates the,

1272
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:53,580
it violates the complex and the symbolic
complex.

1273
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:58,570
So
who is there sort of.

1274
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,330
Those are sort of female,
those are female denizens of the

1275
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:03,880
underworld and hell very pleasant
creatures.

1276
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,980
It's like Medusa with the head of
snakes,

1277
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:07,150
you know,
and if you might,

1278
01:05:07,151 --> 01:05:12,151
if you ask why would a woman have a head
of snakes in reference to a man?

1279
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:14,770
And that's really simple.
I bet there are men here who knew the

1280
01:05:14,771 --> 01:05:15,604
answer to that.

1281
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,260
Come on Jesus.
Think about it.

1282
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,860
What emotion do you feel when you're
going to approach someone you're very

1283
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:30,180
attracted to and there's an extremely
high probability that she's going to

1284
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,900
tell you to disappear,
right?

1285
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:35,730
Exactly.
Absolutely.

1286
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,350
Because it's a real judgment,
right?

1287
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:40,920
We're going to see a movie called crumb
where you'll see this in great detail,

1288
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,380
but it's a real judgment.
It's like the best judgment is,

1289
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,720
well,
I don't mind your physical presence,

1290
01:05:45,721 --> 01:05:49,650
but your genes should definitely not
survive another generation.

1291
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:52,530
Right?
And that's sort of generally translated

1292
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:54,750
into,
I think we should just be friends,

1293
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,070
right?
You know when you can blow that off and

1294
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:02,130
people do and you have to because it's
part of being polite and civilized,

1295
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:04,710
but you know,
let's make no mistake about it.

1296
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:08,340
There is no more fundamental judgment
than that,

1297
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:12,330
so paralysis and there's no shortage of
man.

1298
01:06:12,331 --> 01:06:15,030
I mean,
who are absolutely terrified of women.

1299
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:16,980
I mean,
I've had many of them in my practice.

1300
01:06:16,981 --> 01:06:18,360
You know,
I had one guy,

1301
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:20,670
he was so terrified of women.
He couldn't even talk to them on the

1302
01:06:20,671 --> 01:06:24,420
phone.
It's more common than you think so,

1303
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,200
but it's generally manifested by men who
do,

1304
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,460
who no one cares about.
So it's generally irrelevant.

1305
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,860
So.
Well,

1306
01:06:31,861 --> 01:06:34,080
that's the guts of the case.
It really is the case.

1307
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,540
I'm not kidding.
They're low status man.

1308
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,610
You know,
there are people that are generally

1309
01:06:38,611 --> 01:06:43,080
regarded as losers and there isn't
anybody who really gives a damn about

1310
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:45,690
what happens to them one way or another
and there's a lot more men in that

1311
01:06:45,691 --> 01:06:46,890
category.
Then there are women.

1312
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,910
Women are in all sorts of,
you know,

1313
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:51,810
social categories that caused the misery
in distress.

1314
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:54,930
But that one seems to be predominantly
male.

1315
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:58,050
One of the things I'm going to do when
we talk about Freud is I'm going to show

1316
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:00,290
you this movie crumb,
which I just told you about and hitch.

1317
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:03,180
It's actually,
it's very rare thing because it shows

1318
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:07,920
you the world from the perspective of
very intelligent mail losers and that's

1319
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:11,550
just not a perspective you ever see
because it's the winners that tell the

1320
01:07:11,551 --> 01:07:13,260
stories about their life.
It's like,

1321
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:15,000
who the hell cares about the life of a
loser?

1322
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:19,140
But this movie is about a loser who
became a winner and you know,

1323
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:23,610
almost as an act of revenge.
And it's great.

1324
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,541
Great,
great,

1325
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,060
great.
Thai examination of the eatable complex.

1326
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,040
Remarkable.
So

1327
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,500
those are Hindu representations of
Kelly.

1328
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:40,030
I can tell you a little bit about Kelly
here in the middle.

1329
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:41,470
Representational use.
So,

1330
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,630
um,
she has eight legs,

1331
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:48,820
spider spiders spin a web.
The web is fate,

1332
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,470
the web of fate traps.
The unwary nature does that.

1333
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:57,010
She's in a web of fire.
The,

1334
01:07:57,011 --> 01:08:01,270
a little fire arch there,
which is Amanda Carrillo.

1335
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,300
You can look that up if you want,
is also made out of skulls.

1336
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:08,260
That's what's on the inside of it.
So it's skulls on fire,

1337
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,080
roughly speaking.
Um,

1338
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,700
her hair is on fire and she has a
headdress of skulls.

1339
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,190
And uh,
this guy she's standing on,

1340
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,090
she just gave birth to him,
which is why her belly is hollow and

1341
01:08:20,091 --> 01:08:23,600
she's eating his intestines.
So,

1342
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,030
you know,
and that's a daddy.

1343
01:08:25,031 --> 01:08:25,581
You might think,
well,

1344
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,290
why would something like that be a day
it?

1345
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:32,291
And it's something like a wall.
It's the sum total of all fears and you

1346
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:33,011
know,
you might think,

1347
01:08:33,011 --> 01:08:34,420
well,
you don't believe in that sort of thing.

1348
01:08:34,421 --> 01:08:34,931
It's like,
yeah,

1349
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:36,190
you do,
you just don't know.

1350
01:08:36,191 --> 01:08:38,050
You do.
Of course you do.

1351
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,350
You can't not believe in it.
You know,

1352
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:45,880
you're the manner in which you allow it
to be represented and what you do with

1353
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:48,190
those representations,
that's a whole different matter.

1354
01:08:48,850 --> 01:08:50,830
But you know,
you're not watching vampire movies for

1355
01:08:50,831 --> 01:08:52,540
nothing,
right?

1356
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:53,171
You say,
well,

1357
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:54,730
you don't believe in vampires.
It's like,

1358
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,270
that's actually not true.
You believe in them enough to go watch

1359
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:02,770
them on movies.
So like w,

1360
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,620
w,
where are you going to define belief?

1361
01:09:04,621 --> 01:09:06,570
Exactly.
If someone comes up to you and says,

1362
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:08,490
do you believe in vampires?
You know,

1363
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:09,720
you're going to say,
well no.

1364
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:11,520
And then they'll ask you,
well,

1365
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:14,520
would you spend like two hours this
month watching them?

1366
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,980
And the answer would be yes.
And so you might think,

1367
01:09:16,981 --> 01:09:18,600
well,
which is the better indicator of what

1368
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:21,060
you believe.
Like what do you know about what you're

1369
01:09:21,061 --> 01:09:23,040
like,
who cares about your statements about

1370
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,630
yourself,
you know,

1371
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,940
you think you have privileged access to
what you're like.

1372
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,310
You don't.
You've only been around for 18 years.

1373
01:09:29,730 --> 01:09:34,380
You know when you inhabit this body
that's been built up over 400 million

1374
01:09:34,381 --> 01:09:36,600
years of life,
something like that.

1375
01:09:36,601 --> 01:09:39,090
It might be longer than that.
So it is longer.

1376
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,290
I mean that's when crustaceans emerged.
Life itself is much older than that.

1377
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:46,620
So you know,
the people who made this representation

1378
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:48,630
of Kelly,
assuming they made it,

1379
01:09:48,631 --> 01:09:52,260
which they really didn't cause it
manifested itself in their imagination,

1380
01:09:52,261 --> 01:09:55,710
which is a completely different thing.
They're trying to come to terms with

1381
01:09:55,711 --> 01:09:58,980
something pretty awful.
Or you might say they're trying to come

1382
01:09:58,981 --> 01:10:02,520
to terms with the category of all awful
things.

1383
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,150
Or You could even be more sophisticated
than that.

1384
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:09,300
And you could say they're trying to come
to terms with the category of all awful

1385
01:10:09,301 --> 01:10:14,301
things that also reveals new life.
That's a terribly paradoxical thing

1386
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:17,220
because Kelly can be transformed into
something positive.

1387
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:18,860
It's like,
you know,

1388
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:21,120
logical people think,
well,

1389
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:24,870
something can either be a,
it can be a and not a at the same time.

1390
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,750
Right?
That's a fundamental logical

1391
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:29,640
proposition.
But then,

1392
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,790
so let's say you have a boyfriend or a
girlfriend,

1393
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,950
you don't,
you can't hate them and love them at the

1394
01:10:34,951 --> 01:10:38,310
same time.
I mean half your life or three quarters

1395
01:10:38,311 --> 01:10:40,110
of your life will be in that state.
You know,

1396
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,430
families.
It's like,

1397
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:45,880
what is it?
Fifty slash 50 love and hate.

1398
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:50,080
What defines a familiar relationship
might be intensity rather than,

1399
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,940
you know,
whether it's love or hate,

1400
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:54,520
it's intense.
And so you can certainly have a

1401
01:10:54,521 --> 01:10:57,730
completely paradoxical relationship to
yourself or to another person.

1402
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:02,350
And so part of what happens with these
symbolic representations is that there

1403
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:09,210
they're more accurate than mere logic
because life is one of those life is

1404
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:16,290
composed of oppositions in conjunction
and oppositions in conjunction

1405
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:19,950
simultaneously.
So there's very little about it.

1406
01:11:19,951 --> 01:11:22,050
It's logical at all,
but that doesn't matter because you

1407
01:11:22,051 --> 01:11:24,390
still have to deal with it.
You have to deal with at a very

1408
01:11:24,391 --> 01:11:26,460
fundamental level,
so

1409
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,210
you could think of that,
that that representation there as

1410
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,740
walk through it.
Again,

1411
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,320
let's take about things you should be
afraid of.

1412
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,420
It's a funny category.
Well,

1413
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,720
an animal wouldn't really have a
category of things to be afraid of.

1414
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,870
What an animal would have,
his specific things they're afraid of.

1415
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,630
Okay,
and so then the animal would have to

1416
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:58,590
learn what do you do in the face of all
those specific things that you're afraid

1417
01:11:58,591 --> 01:11:59,880
of?
So you know,

1418
01:11:59,881 --> 01:12:01,020
maybe you,
I don't know you,

1419
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,770
you climb a tree if it's.
If you're a monkey on it to Jaguar maybe

1420
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:08,340
and you go under the underbrush.
If you're a monkey on it's a predatory

1421
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,450
hawk,
something like that.

1422
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:13,140
You've got these individual escape
mechanisms that are tied to the specific

1423
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:15,150
stimulus,
but then there's human beings who are

1424
01:12:15,151 --> 01:12:17,760
capable of abstraction and so you might
say,

1425
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,060
well,
there's a class of things to be afraid

1426
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:23,340
of.
It's those things that you should be

1427
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:23,760
afraid of.

1428
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,500
Those are the things that go bump in the
night,

1429
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:26,970
right?
You're always exposed to them when you

1430
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:30,270
go to horror movies,
especially if they're not the Gore type

1431
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:32,700
of horror movie.
They're always hinting at something

1432
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:37,560
going on outside of your perceptual
sphere and they frighten you because you

1433
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:41,100
don't know what's out there.
And so the Blair witch project was a

1434
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:43,680
really good example of that because
nothing ever happens in that movie,

1435
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:44,341
but it's,
you know,

1436
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:44,890
it's,
it's,

1437
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,780
it's frightening and not gory.
So it's,

1438
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:48,270
it's kind of an interesting horror
movie.

1439
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:53,690
It plays upon the fact that you do have
a category of those things to which you

1440
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:58,650
should be those things about which you
should be afraid.

1441
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:03,660
So it's a category frightening things
and then and only something capable of

1442
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:07,020
abstraction could come up with the
category of frightening things.

1443
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:11,100
And so Kelly is like an embodied
representation of the category of

1444
01:13:11,101 --> 01:13:12,090
frightening things.

1445
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,030
And then you might ask yourself,
well,

1446
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:19,020
once you come up with the concept of the
category of frightening things,

1447
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,100
maybe you could come up with the concept
of what to do in the face of frightening

1448
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:25,650
things,
which is not the same as what do you do

1449
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,490
when you encounter a lion or what do you
do when you encounter someone angry?

1450
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:32,070
It's a medical question,
right?

1451
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,670
You could say,
you may encounter a frightening thing.

1452
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:38,370
What's the thing?
What you should do,

1453
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,140
what should you do about it?
But then you could say,

1454
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:44,310
at a philosophical level,
you will encounter elements of the

1455
01:13:44,311 --> 01:13:48,570
category of all those things that can
frighten and undermine you during your

1456
01:13:48,571 --> 01:13:51,660
life.
Is there something that you can do as a

1457
01:13:51,661 --> 01:13:55,890
category that would help you deal with
that?

1458
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,900
Well,
the answer is yeah,

1459
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:00,720
there there are in fact,
and that's a lot of what religious

1460
01:14:00,721 --> 01:14:05,160
stories and symbolic stories are trying
to propose to you is the solution to

1461
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:06,060
that.
One is

1462
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,290
approach it voluntarily,
carefully,

1463
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,360
but voluntarily don't freeze and runaway
explore.

1464
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:16,270
Instead,
you expose yourself to risk,

1465
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:19,600
but you gain knowledge and you wouldn't
have a cortex that you know is

1466
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:25,120
ridiculously disproportionate.
If as a species we hadn't decided that

1467
01:14:25,121 --> 01:14:27,430
exploration,
trump's escape or freezing,

1468
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:31,780
it's like we explore that can make you
the master of the situation so you can

1469
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:34,960
be the master of something like fire
instead of just being terrified about.

1470
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:40,480
So in one of the things that's
absolutely phenomenally fascinating,

1471
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:45,220
I think is that one of the things that
the Hindus do in relationship to Kelly

1472
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,440
is offer sacrifices.

1473
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:49,161
Say,
well,

1474
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:51,710
why would you offer sacrifice to what
you're afraid of?

1475
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,390
Well,
it's because that is what you do.

1476
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:58,550
That's always what you do is you offer
up sacrifices to the unknown in the hope

1477
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,310
that good things will happen to you.
So in a sense,

1478
01:15:01,311 --> 01:15:02,840
you know,
you're faced with something terrible.

1479
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:07,580
The uncertain future that faces all of
you write something you're afraid of.

1480
01:15:07,581 --> 01:15:08,510
No doubt.
I mean,

1481
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:10,220
how many of you are worried about your
future?

1482
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:12,560
Yeah,
why?

1483
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:14,330
You're all young.
You're smart.

1484
01:15:14,331 --> 01:15:16,100
You're relatively good looking.
It's like,

1485
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,850
what the hell are you worried for?
What are you worried about?

1486
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:26,780
Yeah,
right in this classroom,

1487
01:15:26,781 --> 01:15:28,550
right?
Well maybe you're worried about what

1488
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:31,200
you're going to do or who you're gonna
marry or what your job's going to be,

1489
01:15:31,201 --> 01:15:33,530
or you know,
your health or your family or there's a

1490
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:35,390
whole category of things to be worried
about.

1491
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,490
So then you think,
well,

1492
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,570
you're worried about the future,
so what are you doing in university?

1493
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,530
Well,
I would say you're sacrificing your free

1494
01:15:46,531 --> 01:15:50,160
time in the present to the cosmos,
so to speak,

1495
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:52,890
in the hope that if you offer up that
sacrifice properly,

1496
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:57,810
the future will smile on you.
And that's another fundamental discovery

1497
01:15:57,811 --> 01:15:59,280
of the human race.
It's a big deal.

1498
01:15:59,281 --> 01:16:00,270
That discovery.
It's like,

1499
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:04,260
think about it this way,
by changing what you cling to in the

1500
01:16:04,261 --> 01:16:06,960
present,
you can alter the future.

1501
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,880
Wow.
You know,

1502
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:11,730
I don't know when we discovered that
maybe when we first started to store

1503
01:16:11,731 --> 01:16:14,370
food or something like that,
but it's a mind boggling.

1504
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,580
It's mind boggling discovery,
you know,

1505
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,230
it's,
it's again,

1506
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:21,330
it's one of the prime discoveries of
human beings.

1507
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:25,490
So you represent the thing you're afraid
of,

1508
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:26,691
then you think,
okay,

1509
01:16:26,691 --> 01:16:29,120
there's a class of things that I'm
afraid of that are unknown.

1510
01:16:29,121 --> 01:16:32,120
What can I do about?
Well that's a really good question.

1511
01:16:32,121 --> 01:16:35,870
It's a sophisticated and complicated
question and we do know the answer to

1512
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:38,300
some of it.
It's like approach cautiously,

1513
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,580
voluntarily when necessary,
don't run.

1514
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,920
Especially if the thing that's in your
way,

1515
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:47,210
if the thing that frightens you is
opposing your movement towards a valued

1516
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:50,270
goal,
do not freeze and runaway because the

1517
01:16:50,271 --> 01:16:53,120
thing will grow if you do that and
you'll shrink.

1518
01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:55,730
So that's a bad strategy.
So

1519
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:12,520
I'll just give you a bit of a preview
about what I'm going to talk to you

1520
01:17:12,521 --> 01:17:16,970
about
the next time we meet.

1521
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:25,710
Oh yes.
I want to talk to you a little bit about

1522
01:17:34,531 --> 01:17:39,030
initiation rites and I touched on them
in a little bit today when I was talking

1523
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:41,970
about things like rescuing the father
from the depths.

1524
01:17:41,971 --> 01:17:43,920
So,
but Pinocchio does is essentially an

1525
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:44,880
initiation,
right?

1526
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:48,330
And there are elements of that that are
also embedded in the Harry Potter

1527
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:51,990
stories because for example,
his descent into the unknown underneath

1528
01:17:51,991 --> 01:17:56,991
the school and his encounter with the
Phoenix are all parts of a very complex

1529
01:17:58,621 --> 01:17:59,540
initiation.
Right?

1530
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:00,690
Right.
And he basically,

1531
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:06,100
his adventures set him on a path that
makes him the savior of his kingdom.

1532
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:08,890
That's fundamentally the entire story of
Harry Potter.

1533
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:11,963
There are,

1534
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:18,390
there are ways of catalyzing that
identity and some of them have to do

1535
01:18:18,391 --> 01:18:22,020
with the fact that you're a multilevel
creature.

1536
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,690
So this is a tough thing to grasp too.
You know,

1537
01:18:24,691 --> 01:18:27,060
when you look at someone you think,
well that's what they look like,

1538
01:18:27,061 --> 01:18:29,500
but you know,
it's really not the case in,

1539
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:34,020
in very many important ways because they
have molecular and micro sub structures

1540
01:18:34,021 --> 01:18:36,320
that you can't see.
You don't see the back of them,

1541
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:38,870
you don't see their family,
you don't see the political systems that

1542
01:18:38,871 --> 01:18:41,430
are embedded in and you don't see them
across time.

1543
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,070
Right.
So the thing that's there is way more

1544
01:18:44,071 --> 01:18:49,071
complicated than the thing you see.
And one of the ways of starting to pull

1545
01:18:49,171 --> 01:18:53,910
your pull your conceptions past your
senses is to understand that human being

1546
01:18:53,911 --> 01:18:58,830
exists at multiple levels simultaneously
and that part of psychologically

1547
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:02,850
expansion of psychological knowledge is
to become aware of those levels and to

1548
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:06,420
in some sense of move up and down them
so that you become conscious of them.

1549
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:11,610
And I would say in part the initiations
that we're going to talk about

1550
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,970
are,
are

1551
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:18,480
embodied dramatizations of the process
and move of moving up and down the

1552
01:19:18,481 --> 01:19:21,330
multiple levels of being a human being
exists upon.

1553
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:26,630
And that the psychoanalytic process is a
subset of that process.

1554
01:19:26,731 --> 01:19:29,300
So the Freud,
Ian's the unions,

1555
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:32,280
the people who are interested in
symbolism and the unconscious and depth

1556
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:35,490
psychology.
We're interested in expanding your

1557
01:19:35,491 --> 01:19:39,960
conception of who you are,
beyond what you can articulate.

1558
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,880
And then you have to ask yourself,
well,

1559
01:19:41,881 --> 01:19:44,490
do you believe that there's more to you
than what you can articulate?

1560
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:46,920
And if the answer to that is yes,
then you might think,

1561
01:19:46,921 --> 01:19:48,300
well,
is that worth exploring?

1562
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:52,050
And that's,
that's really what we're doing for the

1563
01:19:52,051 --> 01:19:57,051
next five lectures or so.
So we'll see you next Tuesday.

1564
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,090
No Thursday.
