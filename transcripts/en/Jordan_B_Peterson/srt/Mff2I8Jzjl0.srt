1
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,183
Okay,
so I'm talking today with Dr Michael 

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,303
Shermer and darker Schermer is among 
other things the publisher of skeptic 

3
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,054
magazine,
but more importantly for our purposes 

4
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,170
today,
he is also the author of this book,

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,063
New Book and were heaven on Earth.
We're going to talk about this today in 

6
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:33,764
some detail and so I'm going to turn 
this over to Dr Sherman who's going to 

7
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,500
tell you some things about himself and 
then we're going to have a discussion,

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,353
is going to outline this book and then 
we're going to have a discussion about 

9
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,900
well,
why he wrote it and what it contains and

10
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,760
what the implications are and all of 
that.

11
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:50,230
So over to you Michael Jordan.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,180
Thank you for having me on the show.
It's.

13
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,943
Well,
the book is kind of an extension of my 

14
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,690
previous work.
Most of my books when I write them,

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,690
they kind of push off from the previous 
book,

16
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,740
so going all the way back to my first 
book,

17
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,574
white people believe were things which 
was about the supernatural and 

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,300
paranormal and and all that.
Then then that led to how we believe,

19
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:11,134
which was white people believe in God,
and then if you don't believe in the 

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,510
supernatural and you don't believe in a 
deity,

21
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:19,120
what about morality?
So I wrote two books on math and science

22
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,340
of good and evil and the moral,
our last book,

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,810
uh,
so then,

24
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:25,270
you know,
kind of covering all the big subjects,

25
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,490
uh,
from a skeptical,

26
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,443
scientific perspective.
The afterlife is obviously a huge one 

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,940
and I haven't really dealt with that too
much in my previous books.

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,980
And you know,
now that I'm in my sixties,

29
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:37,750
I guess you could say I'm cramming for 
the final

30
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,623
thinking about these big issues.
This is not something that I obsess 

31
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,480
about it.
I'm not terrorized by death like,

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,413
like some people are,
but I think it's a super interesting 

33
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,780
subject because it's obviously a part of
the human condition.

34
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:53,614
It's something people do think about.
And apparently we're the only species 

35
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:57,994
that can do this.
Although I have a chapter in heavens on 

36
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,560
earth,
on animals that grieve clearly.

37
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,550
Quite a few mammals do grieve and they 
have some sense of loss,

38
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,320
death and grief,
you know,

39
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:11,650
for fellow group members or family 
members that die,

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,410
but it's not clear that they understand 
that their moral.

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,070
Um,
and then I,

42
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:16,963
you know,
I had covered the possibility that 

43
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,204
neanderthals were self aware of their 
mortality because of grave goods that 

44
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,463
have been found,
although that's hard to fossil fossil 

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,270
fossilization of bots is difficult to 
interpret,

46
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,030
but it seems reasonable that they had 
some sense of that.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,420
But in any case,
uh,

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
so I,
I deal with the,

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,540
you know,
the,

50
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,030
the monotheisms versions of the 
afterlife,

51
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,370
Heaven and mortality,
a Judaism,

52
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,204
Christianity,
Islam that mainly because you sort of 

53
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,620
have to.
Although mine's a science book and those

54
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:48,454
are sort of low hanging fruit that 
atheists have already kind of picked 

55
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:53,380
that.
So I don't spend a lot of time on that.

56
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:58,090
I'm focused more on scientific attempts 
to achieve and mortality and science.

57
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,000
So actually start with what does it seem
like a scientist,

58
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,583
Deepak Chopra,
worldview of sort of western Buddhism 

59
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:09,130
that,
that there is the idea of birth,

60
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:09,964
death and afterlife.
Life before life is all kind of 

61
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,680
meaningless because it's all 
consciousness in a deep box worldview as

62
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,990
he puts it,
a,

63
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:19,824
you know,
consciousness is the ontological 

64
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,580
primitive.
You can't get underneath it a,

65
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,443
you know,
the scientific attempt to explain it by 

66
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,784
material means will always fail because 
that's not where consciousness wise 

67
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,210
anyway.
So I,

68
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,163
um,
thanks to my wife actually delved into 

69
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,000
his world view,
Deepak and I have class for 20 years and

70
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,380
I've called his worldview woo and 
pseudoscience and,

71
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,253
and you know,
we've been kind of at odds at each 

72
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,140
other.
So as it changes,

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,650
he's sort of the main,
you might say,

74
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:50,484
intellectual force.
I don't think it's unreasonable to say 

75
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:53,334
the main intellectual force behind the 
new age movement or associated with the 

76
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,300
new age movement.
Is that right?

77
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,633
Yeah,
certainly one of the most prominent 

78
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,090
ones.
He's got a huge following.

79
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,493
He goes on Oprah and talks about these 
things and Dr Oz or whoever and you 

80
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:08,310
know,
he has a lot of following.

81
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,500
So,
um,

82
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,370
so my wife and I actually went down to 
his center or center in Carlsbad,

83
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,410
California and spent some time there.
I get,

84
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,263
we delved into meditation and Yoga and 
the tea and the chanting and all that 

85
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:20,810
stuff just to kind of see what it's all 
about.

86
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,090
And uh,
you know,

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,933
I think there's something there in terms
of behavioral change that is how it 

88
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,710
affects your body and your mind and your
thinking.

89
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:30,670
And I could definitely see something to 
that and um,

90
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:31,821
and,
but,

91
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:34,940
but also the difficult part that,
that feedback and I have had is the same

92
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:39,941
problem that most scientists have with a
new age beliefs but not just that,

93
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:43,500
but,
but of non western traditions that,

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,510
what Deepak calls the eastern wisdom 
traditions that it's the language,

95
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:48,620
the difficulty of language.

96
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,800
We have to use words to communicate,
um,

97
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,710
and the words you use matter at some 
level.

98
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:58,340
You have to be able to be talking on the
same level with words.

99
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,470
So when Deepak says,
you know,

100
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,240
the ontological primitive or 
consciousness is the womb of creation,

101
00:05:05,241 --> 00:05:05,930
you know,
these are,

102
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,763
it sounds sort of metaphorical.
And he means something very specific by 

103
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,790
that.
If you can't get at that,

104
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,624
then you're wasting your time talking.
So I'm Deepak and I have kind of become 

105
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,973
friends and we were constantly 
communicating just to try to see if we 

106
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,730
can find some ground where we're talking
on the same plane.

107
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,530
And so I think I've a learned a lot from
him in that,

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,533
in that sense.
And so my chapters devoted to him on 

109
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:31,580
that and the general eastern wisdom 
traditions,

110
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,980
you know that when you die,
because I always ask them,

111
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:34,670
well where do you go?

112
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,500
And he says the wrong question.
I mean,

113
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,230
you've just returned to where you were 
before,

114
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,980
you know,
because when people ask me,

115
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,690
well,
what do you think happens after you die?

116
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,600
My standard kind of quip is the same 
thing.

117
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,760
You go to the same place you were before
you were born.

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,690
What are you talking about?
I wasn't anywhere before I was born.

119
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,640
Right?
And you'll be nowhere after you die,

120
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,500
but for Deepak,
time and consciousness kind of overrides

121
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:02,450
the concept of time at the beginning of
your consciousness just returns to where

122
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,284
it was and that the physical body and 
brain is just a temporary instantiation 

123
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,403
of consciousness into physical be.
But it just goes back to some other 

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,480
place and,
and near as I can figure,

125
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:17,330
we don't have the words to even conceive
of what that means.

126
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,940
Uh,
that is the western language,

127
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:24,380
the way scientists talk.
I can't really capture what he's talking

128
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:28,050
about in that sense.
And so that's why I think we kind of hit

129
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,070
an epistemological wall there where you 
have to actually get into introspection,

130
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,214
meditation,
and that the deeper parts of that 

131
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:40,040
tradition that I've never been able to 
really get into personally.

132
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,990
So I can't say I understand it,
although I kind of see where he's coming

133
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,830
from in that regard.

134
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,263
So,
so let me ask you some questions about 

135
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:49,304
that.
So the first might have to do with this 

136
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:55,130
idea of the ontological primacy of 
consciousness.

137
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,053
Say now,
one of the things I've learned from 

138
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,920
studying mythology is that the 
mythological worldview,

139
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,783
first of all,
I think the mythological worldview 

140
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,300
conceptualizes the world as a place to 
act rather than as a place of things.

141
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:09,134
So it's sort of like Steven g dot j Dot 
Gould's idea of two magistarium don't 

142
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:13,814
overlap.
There's a moral magistarium materialist 

143
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:19,250
magistarium say,
but it's been striking to me,

144
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,323
looking at the architect will 
foundations of mythological thinking 

145
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,354
that in the in the scientific worldview,
there seemed to be two fundamental 

146
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,920
causal elements.
You could say nature and nurture,

147
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,660
something like that or biology and 
society,

148
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,763
and then technically sophisticated 
western academics argue about the 

149
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:43,340
relative contribution of each to any 
given a existential phenomena.

150
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:46,400
But in the mythological worldview,
there's always three actors.

151
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,503
There's nature usually personified as 
female or experienced as female because 

152
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,370
personified isn't quite the right word.
There's culture,

153
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,600
but there's also the individual and the 
individual seems to be the same thing as

154
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,410
the conscious actor and that would be 
the hero,

155
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,150
the dragon slaying hero say,
and there's that.

156
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,910
There is a kind of primacy given to 
that.

157
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,893
So in the oldest creation myths,
you always see this interplay between 

158
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,333
the mother,
often mother earth and the father that 

159
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,573
the sky and then the hero who separates 
the two and somehow brings and 

160
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,433
perversely in some sense,
although being their product clearly as 

161
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:28,520
the offspring is also the thing that 
gives rise to them mouth the same.

162
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,923
At the same time,
and it seems to be something that's in 

163
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:33,524
keeping in some sense with our lived 
experiences that we confront the social 

164
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,900
world obviously,
and our beneficiaries and victims of it,

165
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,260
and we confront the natural world in the
same manner,

166
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,243
but we also seem to be a gentek actors 
and without us as a Gentek actor is the 

167
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,690
idea that there's a reality,
seems to,

168
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,590
it seems to be full of paradoxical holes
like reality without a conscious actor.

169
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,940
And I think that's the sort of statement
that,

170
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,000
that generates the thinking that you've 
referred to as characteristic of,

171
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,830
of Deepak Chopra and the people who,
who make those sorts of claims.

172
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,930
So,
I mean,

173
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,870
what,
what's your,

174
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,800
what's your take on,
on consciousness and its role in being.

175
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,620
Well,
the one hand,

176
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:24,230
it's everything because it's what I tell
what I tell Deepak,

177
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,950
what I write about in that chapter is 
that,

178
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,163
um,
you're familiar with the anthropic 

179
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,460
principle.
So I call this the,

180
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,200
that the week consciousness principle 
that without consciousness,

181
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,870
without consciousness,
nothing exists.

182
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:37,704
You know,
this is one of the points that he makes 

183
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,340
for me.
And you personally,

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,000
if we're dead or we're not conscious,
the world doesn't exist for our brains,

185
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,200
it's gone.
Nothing.

186
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,910
There's nothing,
uh,

187
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,620
but,
but he goes further than that.

188
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:50,454
He says,
this is what I call the strong 

189
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:52,740
consciousness principle,
that,

190
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,993
that consciousness has required.
Our consciousness is required for 

191
00:09:57,091 --> 00:10:01,660
material things to exist.
And so there I have a discussion of what

192
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,003
a Donald Hoffman,
the cognitive scientists at UC Irvine 

193
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,640
calls is,
um,

194
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,320
uh,
the interface perception theory.

195
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,600
Uh,
I dunno if you're familiar with this,

196
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:13,434
but his analogy is like your laptop 
screen here and you'd have these icons 

197
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:21,150
on the screen,
like the little trashcan icon looks like

198
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:21,750
a trash can.

199
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,400
But of course there's no trash.
Get the open,

200
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,680
the open your laptop.
There's no trash can.

201
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:26,430
And there,
you know,

202
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,263
these are just kind of icons that 
represent something that we think of as 

203
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,500
a trash can.
And,

204
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,880
um,
you know,

205
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,250
this is,
gets to the problem of,

206
00:10:34,251 --> 00:10:35,530
you know,
what it's like to be a bat,

207
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,120
a famous thought experiment,
you know,

208
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,860
if like bolted on some,
some huge years.

209
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:45,090
And I and I had an echolocation system 
and the neural processes to process that

210
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:45,924
information and so on.
I would have some sense of what it's 

211
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:48,924
like to be a vet,
but it had everything on to actually be 

212
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,670
a bet that I would just be a bat and I 
wouldn't even be,

213
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,630
I wouldn't even know I was a human 
wondering what it's like to be a bad.

214
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,850
Okay.
So at some level we can't actually know,

215
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,220
um,
you know,

216
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,340
what it's like to be something else.
And so you,

217
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,783
again,
with Deepak and I and these kinds of 

218
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,653
traditions like that,
we hit this system logical wall of 

219
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,194
language.
It's difficult to say what you mean by 

220
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,354
certain things.

221
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,513
Yes.
Especially when you get down to the 

222
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,300
fundamentals of things.
Well,

223
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,520
it's pretty clear that the things that.
So let.

224
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,373
Let's look at that user interface idea.
So obviously what happens when you're 

225
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:29,620
looking at a computer screen is that the
complexity of the screen is reduced to a

226
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,900
set of icons that can serve as tools.
Right?

227
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,903
And I think that that's a reasonable way
of thinking about how we look at the 

228
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:36,664
world.
Is

229
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,940
Theory is that natural selection didn't 
select our brains to,

230
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,110
to record an accurate representation of 
reality,

231
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,423
like a scientific model will attempts to
get ever closer to what reality is 

232
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:51,080
really like no natural selection just 
wants us to escape predators.

233
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:51,914
It doesn't matter what they look like,
what the icon in your brain of breads 

234
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,250
that spraying or whatever,
as long as you survive,

235
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,084
that's all that matters.
So this is why we're so easily deceived 

236
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,360
by illusions and magic tricks and things
like that that,

237
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,580
you know,
our brains aren't really wired to,

238
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:08,170
to,
to represent reality as it really is,

239
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,260
whatever that means.
And

240
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,613
Yeah,
you can say that without human 

241
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:16,760
consciousness,
the iconic reality that we inhabit would

242
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:18,150
not exist.
Right?

243
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay.
Slightly is that is I told them.

244
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,490
So let's say,
you know,

245
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,030
what's it like to be adults in it?
I don't know.

246
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,390
Okay.
So some kind of echolocation system.

247
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,750
So,
and his point is,

248
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,250
well,
they're,

249
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,640
you know,
sharks are dangerous.

250
00:12:32,641 --> 00:12:33,760
So,
uh,

251
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,340
his,
they avoid charts.

252
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,183
But the question is what does a shark 
look like in a Dolphin's brain versus 

253
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:41,440
what it looks like in our brain?
Um,

254
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,653
it's probably quite different and I 
really have no idea what a shark looks 

255
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:45,714
like,
two adults,

256
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,853
but I do know this,
there really are shirts and they really 

257
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,194
have sharp things on one end and a tail 
and the other and they're eating 

258
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,640
machines and you should avoid them.
So yeah,

259
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,400
that's awesome.

260
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,233
So that's actually a weakness of the 
icon claim I would say because it looks 

261
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,140
to me like here's the twist on it,

262
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,610
what we see in our conscious experience,
our functional icons,

263
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,773
but they were also low resolution 
representations of the things that are 

264
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:15,704
actually there.
And I don't think that computer icons 

265
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:22,370
are low resolution representations of 
the things that are there.

266
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,204
They're just functional icons.
I might be wrong about that because 

267
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,310
because it's hard to to conjure up that 
analysis on the fly.

268
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,900
But the trash can,
for example,

269
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:33,734
on your desktop is actually,
it's actually a low resolution 

270
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:37,814
representations of an actual trashcan,
not a computer trash even though it 

271
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:45,440
functions the same way.
So I like the icon idea,

272
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:46,274
but I think it misses some element of 
the actual relationship between the 

273
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,880
perception and the reality.
We definitely see in low resolution,

274
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,010
which is why we can stand animated 
pictures like say the simpsons,

275
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,993
you know,
where,

276
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,590
where everything is one extremely low 
resolution,

277
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:01,424
but that makes no functional difference 
to us whatsoever and we definitely see 

278
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:05,654
and hear in low resolution,
but the resolution like what we see or 

279
00:14:08,751 --> 00:14:09,584
something like instead of icons,
they're more like thumbnails that are 

280
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:14,750
functional.
That's a good analogy.

281
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:15,584
And then.
Well I like it because the thumbnail 

282
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,520
thumbnail actually is an unbiased 
sampling of the actual

283
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,750
object,
right?

284
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,710
Because a photograph is relatively 
unbiased sample of an object and you can

285
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,410
compress it,
you can,

286
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,740
you can,
you can tell it and what you're doing is

287
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:40,010
blurring out distinctions between,
you're blurring out distinctions between

288
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:40,884
different aspects of it without,
without losing the relationship between 

289
00:14:44,221 --> 00:14:45,750
the parks.
It's something like that.

290
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:47,370
That's right.
And all.

291
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
And,
and in a way much of science operates at

292
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,920
a metaphorical level that string,
you know,

293
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,833
have you ever seen a string theory 
documentary that didn't have violence 

294
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,220
featured in it?
You know that,

295
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,680
that the compute,
that brain is like a computer.

296
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,920
It's like a dual processor.
It's like quantum information,

297
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,523
you know,
we can't because we have to talk and we 

298
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,840
have to transfer the literal meaning of 
metaphors to move something from here to

299
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,060
there in the original Greek.
So,

300
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,880
you know,
we're trying to capture some idea that's

301
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,714
really hard to get that buy something.
We're very familiar with some part of 

302
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:22,774
the problem.
We had two that addresses some of the 

303
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,550
issues you've dealt with,
with,

304
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,413
uh,
with some of your recent conversations 

305
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,820
with people as we're operating at 
different levels.

306
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:34,040
So with Deepak,
for example,

307
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,560
pounds me with articles about quantum 
physics,

308
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,890
so you don't.

309
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,583
Material stuff is really just energy.
Atoms are mostly empty space and so 

310
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:44,810
forth.
And you know,

311
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,644
this,
this table is actually mostly empty 

312
00:15:47,631 --> 00:15:49,730
space.
This is all true,

313
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,564
but we don't live at the quantum level 
at the federal level where I'm sitting 

314
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,200
in a chair and I'm not passing through 
it because at that,

315
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,490
at this level,
you know,

316
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
it's not the same as the quantum level.
And I think making that distinction,

317
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,460
um,
you know,

318
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,300
helps clarify a lot of things.
So like when you talk about the truth to

319
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:13,210
be found in a biblical stories are,
or literary stories like dusty Eskie or,

320
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,750
or Shakespeare or whatever,
and a material scientist says,

321
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:18,501
well,
no,

322
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,770
I mean something different by truth.
It's not that one of you is right,

323
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:22,604
the other's wrong.
It's just that these are different 

324
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,680
levels or different ways of talking 
about.

325
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,450
Think about them as different tool kits.
You know that.

326
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,540
That's right.
Different toolkits.

327
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,403
That's right.
Yeah.

328
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,200
Classic American pragmatist is that I 
think of these things as tools.

329
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,820
There's a scientific tool kit and 
there's a,

330
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,350
there's a tool kit for action in the 
world and they overlap,

331
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:46,340
but they're not the same.

332
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,390
So for example,
I call this,

333
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,630
um,
elvis error,

334
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,900
alvie singer,
that character in woody Allen's film.

335
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,123
I'm Annie Hall.
And there's that funny scene where 

336
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,893
there's a flashback that where he's in 
childhood and he's refused to do his 

337
00:17:03,331 --> 00:17:04,164
homework and he's depressed and his 
mother takes him to the doctor or 

338
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,440
psychiatrist,
whoever he is.

339
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:08,360
And okay,
what,

340
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,510
what,
why are you depressed?

341
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:12,690
Alberice is because I found out that the
universe is expanding.

342
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,810
So what?
Because if the universe is expanding and

343
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:18,630
then eventually it's all gonna blow up 
and nothing means anything.

344
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,550
Other names,
Adam?

345
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,760
We live in Brooklyn.
Brooklyn's not expanding hallmark.

346
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:29,140
That's a nice observation I think too 
because.

347
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,250
So.
Okay.

348
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,520
Let's go back to the conceptualization 
issue.

349
00:17:32,521 --> 00:17:34,660
So one of the things that we've agreed 
on,

350
00:17:34,661 --> 00:17:35,494
and I don't want to lose track of that 
thread because I think it's useful is 

351
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,830
that we do see an iconic reality and the
icons have practical utility,

352
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:44,134
but they also bear some one to one 
correspondence with the thing in itself 

353
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,210
and it's low resolution is a nice way of
thinking about.

354
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,940
So they're low resolution icons with 
functional utility.

355
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,980
Now the question would be,
so then that makes clear is that without

356
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:02,420
human consciousness all that disappears.
Okay.

357
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,683
Then the question is partly what is 
there outside of that functional iconic 

358
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:09,414
representation and so that would be the 
old question of the thing in itself and 

359
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:13,283
you could say,
and I think you could say with some 

360
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:19,821
justification that the thing in itself 
is in potential something that collapses

361
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:24,300
across time and space so that it's 
everything and nothing at the same time,

362
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,850
which is I guess that's an eastern 
claim.

363
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,683
That's one way of thinking about it.
It's a Dallas claim and I like it 

364
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:34,160
because the problem with the or one of 
the issues that,

365
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,510
and this is associated with the idea of 
Brooklyn.

366
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,511
It's not only does lb lb or lv lv.
Not only does healthy live in Brooklyn,

367
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,620
he lives in Brooklyn now,
right?

368
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,493
And so it's spatially located and 
temporarily located and so his mother's 

369
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,920
objection is,
well,

370
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,660
don't pick a reference point that makes 
everything right now irrelevant,

371
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,953
which I.
which is really good practical 

372
00:18:58,831 --> 00:18:59,664
psychological advice because one of the 
things that leads people down the path 

373
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,684
of nihilism is this claim that this 
observation that you can pick a time 

374
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:10,680
frame of analysis that makes your 
current action useless.

375
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,050
Who's going to care in a million years?

376
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,310
Right?
So that argues it,

377
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,480
you know,
without God,

378
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,590
without some sort of external source for
morality and meaning nothing,

379
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,920
nothing we do matters because in $15,
million years,

380
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:26,754
you know,
the heat death of the universe or 

381
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,360
whatever,
we don't live 15 billion years from now,

382
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:33,720
we live now here.
And what we do does matter,

383
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,880
uh,
you know,

384
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,890
so thesis would argue,
you know,

385
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,470
the theodicy problem without God,
there's no right or wrong,

386
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,910
whatever Stalin did or Hitler did is 
perfectly fine because of the heat death

387
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,750
of the universe.
No,

388
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,584
it's not fine because the people that 
are suffering in the Gulag archipelago 

389
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,604
or in the gas chambers at Auschwitz,
they're not thinking about 15 billion 

390
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:55,074
years from now,
they're living right here and right now 

391
00:19:56,491 --> 00:20:00,060
the torture is really doing wrong by 
these standards.

392
00:20:00,061 --> 00:20:00,894
So again,
the level at which we're talking about 

393
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,473
is everything.
And this is why in the heavens on earth 

394
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,163
I,
I'm concerned about the obsession with 

395
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:11,340
the people obsessing too much about the 
afterlife.

396
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,770
Not just religious people,
but scientists.

397
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,390
So what I call it at the afterlife or 
atheist,

398
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,243
this is the core of my book,
is really about all the cryonics people 

399
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,980
in the transhumanists and the singular 
Tarion's and the extropians and the,

400
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,583
and the people that are gonna Upload 
your mind into a computer and turn it 

401
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,140
off.
You know,

402
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:32,850
ray Kurzweil and all these guys,
you know,

403
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:33,684
they're,
they're almost gurus when you go to 

404
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,820
these conferences,
you know,

405
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,654
it's like we get to live forever.
We are the generation that gets to live 

406
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:39,864
for

407
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,243
some of them think they're the,
they're the generation that's going to 

408
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:47,100
instantiate the daily in the form of 
computational entity as well.

409
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,210
That's right.
I mean,

410
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,320
Kurzweil even as a funny line about 
that,

411
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,380
is there a god?
Well,

412
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,940
if there's going to be pretty soon,
as soon as we hit the singularity

413
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,200
singularity assignments and it reminds 
me of what I was religious.

414
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,800
You know,
I used to be an evangelical.

415
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,210
I went to Pepperdine University,
which is a Church of Christ school.

416
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:10,690
I was really into it and uh,
and going to church and all that stuff,

417
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,470
and I,
I go to the singularity summit.

418
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,121
I was like,
wow,

419
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:13,954
I'm back in church.
Here's Ray Kurzweil grew up there 

420
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:21,770
telling us we are the first generation 
that will live forever and you know,

421
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,830
operate a gray,
this radical life extension.

422
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:24,621
The scientist,
you know,

423
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:25,454
he,
he's on record saying the first person 

424
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:30,370
to live a thousand years is born now.
Is this alive now?

425
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,283
Right?
So there's two elements to the heaven 

426
00:21:33,721 --> 00:21:34,554
issue that we can discuss them.
And one is the belief in the existence 

427
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:42,380
of heaven and the other is the positing 
of heaven as an Ame.

428
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,570
Yes,
those are interestingly related.

429
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:46,404
So from my perspective from.
So one of the things as far as I'd been 

430
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,843
able to tell,
one of the things that allows us to 

431
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:53,844
transform the reality that's too 
complicated to perceive into these 

432
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,913
functional low resolution icon.
So let's say is the name have to aim 

433
00:22:03,481 --> 00:22:05,220
right and you have to aim with your 
eyes.

434
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,063
In fact,
we're also extraordinarily good at 

435
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:10,140
detecting how other people aim with 
their eyes.

436
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,810
So the question is always,
well,

437
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,320
where should you a?
And then the answer to that archetype,

438
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,000
I would say biologically for that 
matter,

439
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:24,060
is that you should aim up because why 
the hell would you aim down?

440
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,030
Down is hell,
right down is where the suffering is,

441
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,983
down is where the malevolence is,
so you aim up and architecturally op is 

442
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,370
heaven.
And so one of the things that I can't,

443
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,573
it seems to me that there's some 
possibility that it was impossible for 

444
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:40,284
human beings to discover the future,
which is something that we seem to have 

445
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:43,944
done.
Maybe that was prefrontal extension 

446
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,210
ended.
That was the expansion of the prefrontal

447
00:22:48,211 --> 00:22:49,044
cortex and its deep wiring with the 
visual cortex that actually enabled us 

448
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:54,390
to foresee the future.
Something like that.

449
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,060
I don't know if you can foresee the 
future without,

450
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,523
without stumbling upon the idea of 
heaven at the same time because having 

451
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,460
that sense becomes the best possible 
future and you're aiming at,

452
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,563
you're aiming at a better future and 
because you're ending out a better 

453
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:12,834
future,
you're kind of compelled to also 

454
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:16,200
conceptualize,
at least in principle,

455
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,480
like the platonic ideal of the future.
And so then that future potential starts

456
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,360
to become a kind of a reality,
something like that.

457
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,590
Yeah.
I think that's a super good point.

458
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,241
My,
again,

459
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,074
my concern about obsessing too much 
about the next life is you're going to 

460
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:34,290
miss out on this life,
which is where you live right now.

461
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,670
Uh,
but,

462
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,830
but that's different from aiming at it.
I mean,

463
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,990
my,
I wrote a book on moral progress,

464
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:41,040
the moral arc,
you know,

465
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,850
aiming for incremental improvements in 
civil rights,

466
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,260
health and longevity and,
and,

467
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:50,100
and ridding ourselves of disease and 
war.

468
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,963
These are all admirable goals and we 
should keep doing that aiming for 

469
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,930
something.
And I do like the metaphor of it is,

470
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,130
maybe it's because we're a social 
hierarchical species.

471
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:01,731
Yeah.
Well,

472
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,370
I think that's why the pyramids.
I believe that.

473
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:06,500
I think that's what the pyramids 
represent with her,

474
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,000
with her gold cap,
right?

475
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:08,550
It's

476
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,770
right.
And uh,

477
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,280
and the Washington monument is the same 
thing,

478
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,123
right?

479
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,140
Or The pyramid of hierarchy of needs and
so on.

480
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,020
At the end of my chapter on,
on a model theisms versions of Heaven,

481
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:23,854
I float the idea.
I probably won't be accepted by 

482
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,920
evangelicals and fundamentalists,
but that was,

483
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,813
you know,
when Jesus talked about the kingdom is 

484
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:33,810
within,
you mentioned this,

485
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,653
not as not as often as I would've liked,
but I think he's referring to the fact 

486
00:24:38,141 --> 00:24:38,974
that heaven is within us in the sense 
that we should be aiming to improve 

487
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:43,640
ourselves.
And you know,

488
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,593
that Christians have an atheist of 
conflicted over this passage where he 

489
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,330
says,
uh,

490
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:50,440
you know,
Matthew Sixteen,

491
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:51,940
Twenty six,
I say unto you,

492
00:24:51,941 --> 00:24:52,774
there are some standing here which will 
not taste death until they see the son 

493
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,280
of man coming in his kingdom and,
you know,

494
00:24:57,281 --> 00:24:58,430
of course atheist,
ha,

495
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,100
he's still not here.
Uh,

496
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,610
but,
but what if he meant something else that

497
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:06,190
happened is not a place to go,
but a way to be here.

498
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:06,830
And now I'm

499
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,663
very,
I'm very,

500
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,573
what would you call?
I'm not so viewpoint that I think is 

501
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,690
very much worth pursuing.
I would also.

502
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:16,720
But I also think there's something 
deeply strange about that too,

503
00:25:16,721 --> 00:25:17,554
because
I think that if a psychological state 

504
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:25,120
becomes profound enough,
it starts to become a social state.

505
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,720
And so I would say that that,
that Kingdom of God that's within,

506
00:25:28,721 --> 00:25:30,430
which is something tolstoy wrote a lot 
about,

507
00:25:30,431 --> 00:25:33,190
by the way,
that was a book that he wrote,

508
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:36,550
a book called the Kingdom of God is 
within us and that profoundly influenced

509
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:37,384
Mahatma Gandhi by the way,
and they had lengthy correspondence 

510
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:41,640
which was part of the reason that Gandhi
became an unknown.

511
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,630
Use nonviolent resistance,
right in his fight against the English.

512
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,430
It's was quite interesting,
but I think that there is.

513
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,780
There is
there.

514
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,180
It's something like this.
Maybe when you go to a concert,

515
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,014
it's a great concert and you're having a
very profound psychological experience 

516
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,763
of unity and harmony,
which of course is what you get into 

517
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,330
concert,
but if the experience is profound enough

518
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:08,164
psychologically and individually,
it also starts to encompass and envelop 

519
00:26:11,681 --> 00:26:12,640
the people around you.

520
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,043
And so I think the Kingdom of God that 
Christ was talking about with something 

521
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:18,670
like this is why I like jumped piaget so
much.

522
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:19,504
It's something like the pig and 
equilibrated state where things are 

523
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:22,954
working out really well for you when 
you're deeply immersed in a meaningful 

524
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:27,460
experience.
But at the same time,

525
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,294
that meeting is structured so that it's 
maximally beneficial for the people who 

526
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:35,410
are immediately around you and for the 
people who are distantly related to you.

527
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,370
And so everything stacks up and some 
that's some.

528
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,273
That's something like the idea of the 
ladder to have under the stairway to 

529
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:44,400
heaven today.
Everything stacking up properly.

530
00:26:44,401 --> 00:26:46,530
And then there's a.
see,

531
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,364
I think when people experience that,
and this is where the metaphysics 

532
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,250
touches the material.
I think that when people.

533
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,750
Yes,
exactly that precisely dot yes,

534
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,643
precisely that.

535
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,803
Well,
did you notice that the demons are 

536
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,440
upside down going down,
right?

537
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,333
Which is exactly right.
That's exactly the right way to 

538
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,004
conceptualize it.
So I think that when people have an 

539
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:07,944
experience of that stacking of meaning,
that they also have an intimation of 

540
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:16,020
immortality that goes along with that,
that's embodied.

541
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,153
And that that's partly why the 
metaphysical speculations about the 

542
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,680
reality of the Kingdom of Heaven,
there'll be merged because it's not just

543
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:23,514
conceptual right there.
There is embodied experience and people 

544
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:28,254
report the same thing when they have 
transcendental experiences of various 

545
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,524
sorts and those.
And we know from a scientific 

546
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,284
perspective that those can be very 
reliably induced with the use of agents 

547
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:37,854
like psilocybin and you know,
I've been really fascinated by what's 

548
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:41,724
been happening at Johns Hopkins Hospital
with the Psilocybin experimenters 

549
00:27:44,791 --> 00:27:45,624
because one of the most recent things 
they showed was that if you take people 

550
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:49,884
dying of cancer and you give them 
psilocybin and they have a mystical 

551
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,530
experience,
which is something like an experience of

552
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,810
the Kingdom of God on earth,
but also eternally at the same time that

553
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,100
they lose their fear of death or that at
least it's much modified.

554
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,160
You know,
that's a hell of a finding.

555
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,050
That's really.
You can't just,

556
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,153
you can't just walk away from that 
easily because that's a hell of a thing 

557
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,334
to,
to treat.

558
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,043
Well,
I have a chapter on that in heavens on 

559
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,220
earth,
on near death experiences.

560
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,080
Um,
and so,

561
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,460
but we're talking about two different 
things.

562
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,560
Um,
you know,

563
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:22,394
the,
the transitioning from life to death in 

564
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:30,231
the most pain free or anxiety reduced 
state is more progress,

565
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,220
you know,
medical progress,

566
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:36,600
psychological progress or whatever.
And I'm all for Psilocybin,

567
00:28:36,601 --> 00:28:39,540
does it or whatever.
Then great,

568
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,374
we should do that,
but there's a lot of people that claim 

569
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,044
more than that,
that this is opening the doors of 

570
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:45,744
perception into another world.
It's actually out there and that those 

571
00:28:49,891 --> 00:28:53,760
of us who have not taken acid,
we just simply can't know.

572
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,600
So now we now we get at this question of
truth.

573
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,463
You know,
it's one of my columns and scientific 

574
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:03,240
American and I recently wrote called 
what is truth anyway?

575
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,553
I mean when I say like I prefer dark,
dark chocolate and you prefer milk 

576
00:29:08,161 --> 00:29:09,320
chocolate,
you know,

577
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,860
there is no truth.

578
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,220
That is to be discovered.
Years is true for you mind street for me

579
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:15,054
or I say stairway to heaven is the 
greatest rock song of all time and you 

580
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:17,911
say,
no,

581
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:18,744
no,
freebird is better than stairway to 

582
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,540
heaven.
And we argue about that,

583
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:22,374
but there's no,
there's no experiment we're going to 

584
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,204
run.
And so as we start to move along these 

585
00:29:26,521 --> 00:29:27,354
lines,
like when Deepak Chopra tells me 

586
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,720
meditation works,
okay,

587
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:34,110
so if it works for you or it doesn't 
work for me,

588
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:34,944
okay,
those are still in that state of 

589
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,624
internal truths.
But what we want to know in sciences 

590
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,723
doesn't work for everybody,
or 67 percent of people that do an hour 

591
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:43,834
of meditation a day under these 
conditions have reduced stress hormones 

592
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:48,754
and blood pressure and so on,
in some measurable way that's different 

593
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:53,560
than just an internal state.
So,

594
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,300
um,
when we're talking about,

595
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,313
again,
just working on Torque for striving to 

596
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:02,260
better ourselves or some kind of heaven,
if you mean just,

597
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,593
you know,
metaphorically so that I can better 

598
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:06,184
myself.
That's different than there's an actual 

599
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,920
place you can go to a that's going to be
there after we die.

600
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,210
And so I think this is where scientists 
go on way.

601
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,980
You also start messing about with the 
idea of place in a way that,

602
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,063
that that's the problem with having 
discussions about fundamental realities 

603
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:25,234
and know when you said another thing 
that Christ said was the Kingdom of 

604
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,430
Heaven is spread upon Earth.
But men do not see it and that's,

605
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,980
that's something that's akin to the idea
of the Kingdom of God is within you,

606
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,873
although it's.
It's a strange twist on it because it 

607
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
also adds an element of externality or 
physicality to it and an element of 

608
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,733
immediacy.
Not something that's forestalled into 

609
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:48,100
the future,
but I wonder,

610
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,800
see,
in my wild or moments of speculation,

611
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:55,600
I have this notion that if things stack 
up properly,

612
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,823
so imagine that you're immersed in a 
very deeply meaningful experience and 

613
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,290
and it's,
it's operating.

614
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,303
It's indicating that harmony has been 
established between multiple levels of 

615
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:08,470
being simultaneously.
I wonder if that can.

616
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,360
I wonder if that can put you in a place 
that's profound enough or deep enough so

617
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:17,050
that the structure of time and space,
it still starts to warp around that.

618
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,690
I mean,
I know that that's A.

619
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,160
I can't formulate that well,
but there's something.

620
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,053
There's something about it that seems to
me to be correct about that because 

621
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:31,660
people have intimations of immortality 
and they have intimations of,

622
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,750
of,
of heavenly and hellish abodes as well,

623
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,400
and they're not,
they're not.

624
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,190
They're not the simple kind of 
irrational,

625
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,403
even rational fundamentalist beliefs 
that often people talk about when 

626
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:43,774
they're discussing religious belief.
There are more reflected in direct 

627
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,370
experience and it's not easy to make 
sense of them.

628
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,133
Well,
when you delve into the literature on 

629
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,113
Judaism,
Christianity and Islam and their 

630
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:56,860
versions of the afterlife and heaven,
they're quite different and the Jews are

631
00:31:56,861 --> 00:32:00,160
far less obsessed with going some place 
after death.

632
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:01,670
In fact,
originally they had,

633
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,790
they were going,
no place at all.

634
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,803
Show was just nothing.
It was just he returned to where you 

635
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:09,310
were before you were alive,
just no place,

636
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,890
uh,
and so,

637
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,780
so that,
that religion is far more focused on the

638
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:16,780
here and now we have a moral duty to 
help people,

639
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,703
the poor and so on now and to live 
better lives and more lives of dignity 

640
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:26,851
and honor and now and Christianity 
really started off more like that.

641
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,384
Then kind of morphed over the centuries 
and particularly in fundamentalist and 

642
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,470
evangelicals in the 20th century toward 
this place we're to go

643
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,470
after we die.
Yeah.

644
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:39,304
You kind of had the schism in 
Christianity today between the kind of 

645
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,373
the fundamentalists that are constantly 
talking about the afterlife and 

646
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,760
accepting Jesus and they're focused on 
missionary,

647
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:50,594
working in diverting people versus say 
maybe the Rick Warren's of the world 

648
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:58,020
that want to put their money into a soup
kitchens and helping the poor and,

649
00:32:58,021 --> 00:32:58,530
and,
and,

650
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:03,530
and Christians have a moral duty to help
those in need and not so much focused on

651
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,360
the next life.

652
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,511
It's funny.
Yeah,

653
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,344
because there,
there are real dangers associated with 

654
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:11,744
both those kinds of conceptualizations 
mean you alluded to one danger that was 

655
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:16,604
associated with,
let's call those who are concerned more 

656
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,470
with the immediate present.
And that's the,

657
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,750
that's starting to manifest itself in 
these,

658
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,673
in these,
um,

659
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,680
technological,
immortal,

660
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,700
immortalists.
They're saying,

661
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:29,534
well,
we should transform the nature of being 

662
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,293
extraordinarily radically right here and
now so that we have heaven in the 

663
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,200
mortality here.
You think,

664
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,820
well,
what do we lose by doing that?

665
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,693
You know,
and that's a question that's worth 

666
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:43,850
asking because if we're trans human,
then we lose being human.

667
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,760
And it may be that we actually don't 
want to lose being human,

668
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:49,410
even though being human means suffering 
and malevolent,

669
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:51,800
something like that.
It's a very hard question.

670
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,130
But then the Christians,
this is what we're.

671
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:56,810
She went after the Christian since it's 
such an hour.

672
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,733
He said,
well,

673
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,783
if you despise the current world and you
leave everything to be rectified in the 

674
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,454
afterlife,
then you just abandoned life itself and 

675
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,460
you're really traders to life.
And so how,

676
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,160
how does steer through those to shoot 
two shows,

677
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,150
let's say is thing or to cliff's.
That's a very difficult proposition.

678
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,300
Well,
it's my message in the book to,

679
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,643
to the military and the cryonics and 
transhumanism and so on is I'm glad 

680
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:28,520
you're working on this problem,
you know,

681
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,653
because,
or don't you want to live to be a 

682
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,610
thousand years?
And my response is look,

683
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:38,611
just get me to 90 without cancer and 100
without Alzheimer's on 110 without being

684
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:41,500
plugged into machines and lying in a 
bed.

685
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,753
Because that's not a life.
And so and so I'm glad people are 

686
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:48,400
working on like,
what's the best diet?

687
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,900
How much?
What can we do to improve our memory and

688
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:53,734
so on.
That's all great and I'm glad and I'm 

689
00:34:57,101 --> 00:35:00,190
glad Kurzweil is now the chief engineer 
of all Google.

690
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:02,560
I mean he's got some resources to do 
something about this,

691
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:05,320
but that this focus on living a thousand
years,

692
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,193
your first one,
you may miss that little incremental 

693
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,350
things we can do,
but also you're missing out now.

694
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,850
There's this fell on my right about in 
the book I'm on Ray Kurzweil.

695
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,920
It's a little kind of biographical film 
of him.

696
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,120
I'll transcendent man and he's 
constantly talking about,

697
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,033
you know,
living forever and so on and he's 

698
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:28,120
obsessed with his father.
His father died when he was 51,

699
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,603
father was 50 ones and and ray was kind 
of missed out having a father figure 

700
00:35:33,581 --> 00:35:38,581
because the father was always working 
and Ray was a real entrepreneur achiever

701
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,103
from his teenage years,
so he was always working and the film 

702
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:43,854
kind of follows him around collecting 
everything he can about his father and 

703
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,110
he keeps it in the basement of his house
and he wants to resurrect his father and

704
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:50,810
a computer and it's like,
Whoa,

705
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,653
boy.
Freud would have a field day with this 

706
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,080
guy,
but there's something,

707
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,330
there's something going on there.
This sort of rose focus on.

708
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,703
I see this.
This is strange dichotomy and attitude 

709
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,393
that you just described.
Even characterizing use that in my own 

710
00:36:06,281 --> 00:36:11,020
life because I'm very interested in 
technologies that stave off aging,

711
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,003
dietary manipulations,
and I have this machine in my basement 

712
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:15,724
that's intense pulse light,
late intense pulse light machine that's 

713
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,810
unbelievable skin rejuvenator like it's 
an absolute miracle.

714
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:25,620
This machine.
And it'll take,

715
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,750
it'll take sun damage from your skin 
completely.

716
00:36:28,751 --> 00:36:30,400
And,
and force rejuvenation.

717
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,760
It's like,
it's like using photoshop on your skin.

718
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,500
It's amazing.
And,

719
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,070
but,
um,

720
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,330
but,
and so I think,

721
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,523
well,
isn't it interesting to do everything 

722
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:40,774
possible to prolong youth in life?
But at the same time there's another 

723
00:36:44,351 --> 00:36:47,380
part of me that's thinking,
well,

724
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,600
this is something I wrote about it in 
this new book that I'm publishing.

725
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,220
I'm just thinking about socrates and his
ability to accept his death.

726
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,723
Knowing what socrates seems to have 
revealed in his acceptance of his death 

727
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:05,550
was that if you live your life properly,
then you,

728
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,500
you've maybe you've lived your life in 
some sense,

729
00:37:08,501 --> 00:37:10,450
you've exhausted it in some sense.

730
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:14,530
The question is if you,
if you live the thousand years,

731
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,510
well,
what exactly what,

732
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,450
what exactly would you do?
You know,

733
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:22,300
like,
I've had kids and I loved having kids,

734
00:37:22,301 --> 00:37:24,910
but I wouldn't have them again.
Like I wouldn't do that again,

735
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,820
I don't think.
And I have a grandchild and that's fine,

736
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:31,110
but that's a new thing.
Like I've had a career and I,

737
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,263
as I get older,
the idea of having 10 more careers 

738
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,460
seems.
It's not like I'm not interested in it,

739
00:37:39,461 --> 00:37:42,580
but it doesn't grip me the same way that
it would have,

740
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,730
say 20 years ago.
And so I wonder,

741
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
like I wonder if it is the case that 
life is in some sense structured so that

742
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:54,640
its finitude as necessary and not 
something that should be

743
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,300
well casually transcended.
Let's say.

744
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,823
Well,
the transhumanists would respond to 

745
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,680
that,
uh,

746
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,220
that you're just used to this idea of 
only living 80,

747
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:07,170
90 years.
And then you're done,

748
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,760
uh,
that we would adjust to that.

749
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,623
Well,
maybe

750
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:15,000
the question would be who would be the 
weed that would adjust to that?

751
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,990
Yes,
he would no longer okay to get there.

752
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,343
We would no longer be human there.
The idea of the transhumanist 

753
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,800
singularitarian people is,
is truly,

754
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:26,690
you're not human anymore.
We have brain,

755
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,090
like the cochlear implant for hearing is
a kind of brain transplant device.

756
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:32,924
Well,
they want to ramp that up and put in 

757
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,600
your cortex and you'd hit,
sent centrally,

758
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:40,840
have wikipedia in your brain and for 
instant access and,

759
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,550
and that it would truly bring new 
meaning to what it means to be human.

760
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,293
You could also argue that that's a form 
of death because if you transform 

761
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,210
yourself so radically that you're 
unrecognizable,

762
00:38:54,211 --> 00:38:55,044
then what?
Where's the continuity with what you 

763
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:58,860
once were?
You know,

764
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,950
this was one of the reasons I have some 
real sympathy for many reasons.

765
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:02,784
I have many reasons for this,
but one of them that I have very much 

766
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:05,970
sympathy for.
The idea,

767
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,073
the Christian idea,
that's that's associated with the 

768
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:10,014
mortality of the resurrection of the 
body because the Christians insisted 

769
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:16,010
that this is not some sort of abstract 
lights like it's.

770
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,873
It's not uploaded into a computer.
It's not blowing out all of your 

771
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,980
limitations.
Now you know,

772
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:22,814
you might ask what the resurrected body 
would be and of course that's a 

773
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,330
particularity.
That's a perfectly fine question,

774
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,430
but it doesn't.
It doesn't.

775
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,310
It's
that doesn't move you around.

776
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:36,144
The fact that there was a question that 
was really to be grappled with there 

777
00:39:38,881 --> 00:39:39,714
because what the Christians were trying 
to do was to have their taken either to 

778
00:39:42,871 --> 00:39:44,340
in some sense and to say,
look,

779
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:49,341
there's some absolute utility to the 
limitation that is imposed upon you by a

780
00:39:49,831 --> 00:39:51,480
mortal frame.
Right?

781
00:39:51,481 --> 00:39:52,314
That's the characteristic element of 
being human and that perhaps there's a 

782
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:57,600
way of having that in transcending it.
At the same time.

783
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,870
Now what that would look like is 
obviously vitamins,

784
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,513
deal with that and heavens on earth to 
have a chapter on the soul and post 

785
00:40:04,771 --> 00:40:05,604
descartes.
Christians became more doulas before 

786
00:40:07,621 --> 00:40:08,454
that.
They were more focused on the physical 

787
00:40:09,331 --> 00:40:10,164
resurrection of the body.
There are still some Christians today 

788
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:14,880
who think that they'll physically be 
resurrected,

789
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:15,714
but most of them,
most of them are journalists and it's 

790
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,710
just,
it's just this kind of nonphysical thing

791
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:20,544
that goes and,
and be and is with God and Jesus and so 

792
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,560
on.
Uh,

793
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,310
but,
but,

794
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,990
you know,
they actually debate this

795
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,570
question of identity.
The problem with identity.

796
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,673
He said,
well,

797
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,840
if you're physically resurrected in 
heaven,

798
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,910
what's,
what's there?

799
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,223
How old are you get?
And some of them actually have an 

800
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:39,930
answer.
You're 30,

801
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:41,940
you know,
that's like the ideal age physically,

802
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:46,030
I suppose mentally and also Jesus was 30
and it's

803
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,870
maybe okay.
So,

804
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,680
but,
but then the question is,

805
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:51,514
is an,
I asked this question for the mindup 

806
00:40:53,821 --> 00:40:55,120
loaders,
the transhumanist,

807
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,490
it's like there is no fixed,
first of all,

808
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:02,460
all your cells in your.
And almost all of the atoms in your body

809
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,294
are recycled about every decade or so.
So there is no defined physical self of 

810
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:07,950
you.
You know,

811
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,570
the thesis ship,
you replace all the wood and the ship,

812
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,633
we still call it,

813
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,850
of structure.
That was Schrodinger's Turret,

814
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:16,400
right?
Yeah,

815
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,180
yeah.
Yeah.

816
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,681
So,
okay.

817
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:21,160
So it's the pattern of information that 
is your memories,

818
00:41:21,161 --> 00:41:22,690
your memory cells,
memory cells.

819
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:23,524
Okay.
Yeah,

820
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,401
yeah.
Okay.

821
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,220
That's better.
But at what age?

822
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,083
You know,
because I have memories now that I 

823
00:41:29,201 --> 00:41:30,034
didn't have when I was 30,
so what happens if I'm resurrected at 

824
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,340
age 30,
whereas all the memories of my last.

825
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:37,450
I'm 63 now,
so as 33 years of memories,

826
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,030
I want those too.
And so does the.

827
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,873
Okay.
You can have all those memories but 

828
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,524
wait,
the memories I have now at 63 of when I 

829
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,974
was 30 are very different than the 
memories when I was 30 of what I was 

830
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:52,910
like at that time.
And so there is no fixed set of memories

831
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:53,744
even that represents you because those 
are constantly edited and changed and 

832
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,670
it.
And it's like,

833
00:41:58,671 --> 00:41:59,504
okay,
now I understand when I had that 10 

834
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,830
years as a bike racer in the 19 
eighties,

835
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,731
I,
you know,

836
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:05,564
I was just sort of going through and 
doing my thing and now I see in context 

837
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,560
what that meant for my life.

838
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,860
But I didn't know it at the time.
That's true for everything we do.

839
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,113
That's why I was laughing.
People write memoirs in their twenties 

840
00:42:15,861 --> 00:42:16,694
or thirties.
It's like,

841
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,190
how can you write a memoir?
You don't have no idea what you're doing

842
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,820
now is going to be in 30 years.
And so in religious.

843
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:23,654
So both,
both scientific attempts at immortality 

844
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,070
or the afterlife or whatever.
And religious,

845
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,590
they have the same problem.
Uh,

846
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,390
you know,
what is up there that's been resurrected

847
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,253
because there is no fixed self.
It's a constantly dynamic changing 

848
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,090
system.
And then there's one more problem.

849
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,280
That idea with the point of view,
self appeal of these cells.

850
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,061
You know,
there's,

851
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:45,080
you and I looking out through your eyes 
and Jordan go to sleep tonight.

852
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:47,390
You wake up tomorrow morning and you're 
groggy for a few minutes,

853
00:42:47,391 --> 00:42:48,224
but,
but your,

854
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,340
your point of view returns and you know,
the singularity people,

855
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:52,791
they think,
well,

856
00:42:52,791 --> 00:42:53,624
we'll copy all your memories and put 
them in a computer and then we'll turn 

857
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:58,970
it on and you'll wake up and you'll,
you'll be looking out through the little

858
00:42:58,971 --> 00:42:59,600
camera hold.

859
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,460
They're like Johnny Depp in 
transcendence.

860
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:03,230
And you'll be in there.
No,

861
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:04,064
I don't think so.
Why would your point of view all of a 

862
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:07,634
sudden leap from your current body into 
the computer in the same sense that 

863
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:15,050
instead of sacrificing your brain and 
slicing it up and scanning,

864
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,230
this is the current thoughts scanning 
every synapse.

865
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,453
What if in a hundred years from now,
we had a sophisticated MRI machine that 

866
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:26,330
could scan your brain and scan every 
single synapse and reproduce it,

867
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,240
and we had a computer big enough with 
Moore's law doubling and so on.

868
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:30,074
It would be enough to just reproduced 
your entire connectome and turned it on 

869
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,120
you,
you,

870
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:35,953
Jordan Peterson.
He's still standing there right next to 

871
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:41,620
the computer and they turn it on.
You're not all of a sudden on computer.

872
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,770
Well,
there's other problems with that too,

873
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,613
is that,
you know,

874
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,103
if I remember correctly,
you have more neurons in your autonomic 

875
00:43:52,471 --> 00:43:55,020
nervous system then you have in your 
central nervous system.

876
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,033
Well,
the

877
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,280
brain isn't in your head,
not just your brain.

878
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,440
No.
So you haven't extended buddy,

879
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:08,530
so you to the chronic biotics people,
they love up the head.

880
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,730
We're just going to clone your butt.
Okay.

881
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,370
This is getting too complicated.
You really need the whole body.

882
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,423
Yes.
Well that's.

883
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:17,160
That's the physical resurrection issue 
is that the idea that,

884
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,700
and I think that you put your finger on 
the flaw in,

885
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,700
in the,
in the,

886
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,683
in the,
in the new way more tap in the new 

887
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,570
immortality crowd.
You know,

888
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:26,510
they think if they really are 
Cartesians,

889
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,710
they think of your consciousness is 
something that's.

890
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,023
Well,
they're confused about it in some 

891
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,600
because they think of it as a kind of 
soul,

892
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,643
which would be a pattern and that 
pattern is only instantiated in the 

893
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:37,740
brain.
It's like,

894
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:38,783
oh,
physiologically that's just not the 

895
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,720
case.
It's like,

896
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:42,720
what about the hormones?
What about.

897
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,063
There's a lot of things going on in the 
brain that aren't easily reducible to 

898
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:48,924
synaptic patterns,
especially when you consider also its 

899
00:44:50,851 --> 00:44:53,520
connection with the body and you have to
consider that.

900
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,893
It's so good.

901
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:55,853
Even worse than that,
because not only are we all of those 

902
00:44:57,751 --> 00:45:00,930
things,
we are also social beings and so there's

903
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:01,764
all the interactions we have and have 
had with all the other people in our 

904
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:07,230
lives or neighbors or strangers or 
whatever,

905
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:08,363
so you have all those binary digits that
have to be captured of all the 

906
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:13,020
interactions going back in your whole 
life,

907
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,750
not just your life,
but all of the social,

908
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:16,561
cultural,
political,

909
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:17,394
economic forces that have been grinding 
along for centuries that shape who we 

910
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,550
are and the kind of world we live in.
You know,

911
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,270
if you're going to create a virtual 
reality,

912
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:26,730
a holodeck that regrade saw that,
you know,

913
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,120
I mean this would be a huge computer.
Essentially.

914
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:32,190
It would be the universe is what you 
would need.

915
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,470
What we ended up with a map that's just 
as big as the territory.

916
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:36,540
That's right.
Yeah,

917
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,160
that's right.
It's a big problem.

918
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,690
You wrote a book about that.
That's going to fold it up.

919
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,190
Where are you going to put it?
That's the big

920
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,270
like that Steven Wright line about.
I got a map of the United States.

921
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:49,200
Actual size.

922
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,010
Yeah.
It's really hard to fold up.

923
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:54,140
Exactly.
Exactly.

924
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,100
So,
oh,

925
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,970
so let me ask you a couple more personal
questions if you don't mind.

926
00:45:58,971 --> 00:46:00,380
Now you,
you mentioned,

927
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,770
um,
briefly during our,

928
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,770
during our conversation that you know,
you,

929
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:05,690
you,
you were,

930
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,543
you're from a pretty fundamentalist 
Christian background and you became a 

931
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,660
skeptic and you've been pursuing that 
with,

932
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,330
with,
with well adamantly,

933
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:18,440
let's say for a very long time.
So two questions is what,

934
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:19,963
what put you on that path and what do 
you think your positive function as a 

935
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,550
skeptic is?

936
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,030
Yeah,
so first of all,

937
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:28,864
my family wasn't religious at all.
They weren't antireligious to just 

938
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:32,643
wasn't a thing.
I became interested in it in the early 

939
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,753
seventies when I was in high school,
which was sort of the early development 

940
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:41,830
of the Evangelical Movement,
the United States.

941
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:45,370
So I called born again movement and 
there was no affiliation with any church

942
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:48,520
or particular.
We all recognize that organized religion

943
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:52,210
was probably not great.
So just sort of a one on one.

944
00:46:52,211 --> 00:46:55,000
It's just you and Jesus and the Bible,
you and God and so on.

945
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,313
And uh,
that was that whole Jesus Christ 

946
00:46:58,841 --> 00:47:00,520
superstar.
Timing and all that,

947
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,440
but I took this really seriously and I 
went to pepperdine and I took courses in

948
00:47:05,441 --> 00:47:06,274
the Old Testament and New Testament.
I read everything cs Lewis wrote to the 

949
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:11,950
course in the writings of Cs Lewis,
but I was into it then.

950
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:14,500
You know,
at pepperdine you're in the bubble of,

951
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:15,603
you know,
the Christian worldview is totally 

952
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,830
consistent.
It's internally coherent,

953
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,780
uh,
until you're outside the bubble.

954
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:27,700
So when I went to a secular university 
and to study experimental psychology,

955
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,243
not only was that more of a grounding in
the scientific method of understanding 

956
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,480
reality,
but just for fun.

957
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:36,010
I took courses in,
first of all,

958
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:38,680
I took courses in evolutionary theory.
I was kind of a creationist.

959
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,810
I remember sitting there thinking,
Holy Shit,

960
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:41,950
this stuff is real.

961
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,213
But then I took a course in anthropology
and comparative mythology and that kind 

962
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:50,704
of opened up my eyes.
So I sort of went through my Joseph 

963
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:55,150
Campbell stage and,
and the myth of the hero.

964
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,120
I read the hero of a thousand faces and 
all that.

965
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:57,611
It's like,
okay,

966
00:47:57,611 --> 00:47:58,444
this is,
this is a different way of looking at 

967
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:02,590
things than,
than pure scientific way,

968
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:05,470
but it's also different from a lot of 
these religious traditions,

969
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:06,360
you know,
so that,

970
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,473
that's sort of told me that the 
particular religion I was in a wrong to 

971
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:14,260
ask is that,
is it right or wrong?

972
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:17,330
It's just,
it's a completely different thing and it

973
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,053
just wasn't working for me anymore.
So I enjoyed the scientific way of 

974
00:48:21,701 --> 00:48:22,534
thinking about the world and I was 
surrounded by people that it's not that 

975
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:28,570
they were atheists in graduate school 
and after that it's like,

976
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:30,640
remember,
this is now the late seventies.

977
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,590
And then when I went to graduate school 
in the second time for my phd in history

978
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,700
of science of late eighties,
um,

979
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,370
again,
the whole eighth science,

980
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,420
religion,
atheist,

981
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,920
atheism,
that wasn't a thing.

982
00:48:41,921 --> 00:48:42,754
No one really talked about it.
It wasn't like a big thing you have to 

983
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:45,550
decide.
Say,

984
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,510
are you at the eastern atheist?
No one really talked about that.

985
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:52,390
And so my focus is really on this 
science and understanding things.

986
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,224
Now the problem with being a sort of an 
intellectual historian of science 

987
00:48:56,861 --> 00:48:57,694
psychologists like I am,
and you're interested in study in 

988
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:02,080
beliefs like I do.
Um,

989
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,780
and then also being a public 
intellectual is the publisher of skeptic

990
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:05,614
magazine.
And I write this column for scientific 

991
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:07,504
American every month I got to 
essentially debunk something or analyze 

992
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:13,920
something is it kind of puts you in this
role of like,

993
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,790
well,
I got to say if this is right or wrong,

994
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:19,060
this is true or false or,
or something in between.

995
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:19,970
So I,
I'm,

996
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:20,803
I'm,
I'm constantly on this kind of razor 

997
00:49:21,821 --> 00:49:22,654
edge between,
I just am curious observer of people's 

998
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:28,510
beliefs.
And then on the other hand,

999
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,900
I have actually have to pass judgment 
and writing every month.

1000
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,150
Well,
is this one correct or not correct?

1001
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:36,070
Or something in between them.
Um,

1002
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,580
and uh,
some might,

1003
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,390
again,
it's at that different levels.

1004
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:41,224
You know,
sometimes I'm just talking about 

1005
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,220
people's beliefs.
Other Times I'm at,

1006
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,060
I'm actually kind of forced to say,
well,

1007
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,190
I think this is probably true.
We're probably not true.

1008
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:49,800
And,
uh,

1009
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,790
and I think this is,
you know,

1010
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,653
I listened to,
I tried to listen to that first podcast 

1011
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:58,711
you do with Sam,
so difficult to get through again to me,

1012
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:00,851
you know,
two hours,

1013
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:01,684
you were just talking past each other at
different levels of Sam's laser focused 

1014
00:50:05,441 --> 00:50:06,274
on,
you know,

1015
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,393
people behave,
they act on certain beliefs and the 

1016
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:11,824
obvious one flying planes into buildings
is because you have a certain belief 

1017
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,910
that leads to that,
yes,

1018
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:16,420
that's true.

1019
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,253
And it would be good if people didn't 
believe these things that lead them to 

1020
00:50:18,761 --> 00:50:20,750
do those kinds of violent acts.
Uh,

1021
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,723
but there's a whole nother level you can
talk about beliefs that have nothing to 

1022
00:50:24,401 --> 00:50:26,950
do with leading to violence or so on and
so to.

1023
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:27,943
It just depends on what's your goal when
you're talking about this particular 

1024
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:32,800
thing right now.
Uh,

1025
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,250
and,
and,

1026
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:35,810
you know,
so I,

1027
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,750
I'm good friends with Stephen Jay Gould 
and you know,

1028
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:43,751
I was sympathetic to his noma
in the sense that the world's already to

1029
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,550
tribal.
And so if we can calm everybody down,

1030
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,470
that's good.
On the other hand,

1031
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:49,304
I do think science and reason Kennan 
form and maybe even in some cases 

1032
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:55,190
determined human values and moral 
decisions,

1033
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:57,790
right and wrong and so on.
I've written quite a bit about that too,

1034
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,520
and so again,
that's sort of a different level of what

1035
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:05,120
you're talking about and what the goals 
are at that particular moment.

1036
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:06,601
Yeah,
well,

1037
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:08,530
I mean the skeptic when,
when,

1038
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:12,480
when I think of a skeptic,
this is a strange leap of course,

1039
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:17,481
but there's a scene in revelation where 
Christ comes back and he comes back with

1040
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:18,864
a sword coming out of his mouth and 
that's where he divides the damn didn't 

1041
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:24,420
save and that's a.
that's also an image of the logos,

1042
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:25,254
right?
The word that brings forth order out of 

1043
00:51:27,271 --> 00:51:30,090
chaos because hardly what you do as a 
skeptic.

1044
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,920
It isn't so much that you dam the untrue
is that you rescued the truth and that's

1045
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:38,250
really necessary for people because we 
need to stand on a rock.

1046
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:42,120
And now one of the big problems I have 
with new age movement,

1047
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,113
and I've kind of started this 
technically looking at the way that 

1048
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:45,774
creative people think because there are 
creative people who are critically 

1049
00:51:48,001 --> 00:51:48,834
minded and there are creative people who
are not critically minded and non 

1050
00:51:52,261 --> 00:51:53,094
critically minded.
Creativity seems more associated with 

1051
00:51:55,261 --> 00:51:56,094
mental illness and psychopathology or 
you have to be able to discriminate 

1052
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:02,040
between what's worth saving and what 
isn't so to speak.

1053
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,233
And that's what a good skeptic does.
Cause a skeptic isn't necessarily 

1054
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:06,780
someone who says,
oh,

1055
00:52:06,781 --> 00:52:10,200
this is all false.
A good skeptic is someone who says,

1056
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,140
oh look,
there's a kernel of truth here,

1057
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:15,770
but it's deeply buried under layers and 
layers of,

1058
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,933
of rust and nonsense that needs to be 
burned away or polished away so that we 

1059
00:52:20,341 --> 00:52:22,080
can get to what's absolutely essential.

1060
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,343
Yeah.
So back to where you were saying before 

1061
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:30,200
about striving upwards towards something
that heaven up there,

1062
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:31,700
whatever that is.
Um,

1063
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,830
you know,
of course we don't want to go for utopia

1064
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:38,720
because there's no such place to get to 
and that causes catastrophes in history.

1065
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,554
So.
But the idea of making the world a more 

1066
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,860
rational place,
this is a good goal and this is the kind

1067
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:48,310
of thing that we do at skeptic magazine.
I know,

1068
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,333
what do we do?
We promote science and reason and 

1069
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:51,584
critical thinking.
You write about critical thinking and 

1070
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,930
this is what you do.
Uh,

1071
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,320
so we're all working on that and that.
And that's good.

1072
00:52:57,710 --> 00:52:58,543
Um,

1073
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:01,803
sorry,
go ahead.

1074
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:03,360
So when,
um,

1075
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,370
when we talk about literature,
for example,

1076
00:53:05,371 --> 00:53:07,550
this return to the books of the Bible or
dusty,

1077
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,384
see,
or if we want to make our listeners' 

1078
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,340
heads explode,
Ian Rand and Atlas Shrug.

1079
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,190
Why have people by the tens of millions 
purchased her books?

1080
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,230
You know,
literary critics say they're awful,

1081
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,064
they're terrible.
Novels are not well written and her 

1082
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,070
fingers are black and white.
And her philosophy is wrong.

1083
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:27,870
Okay?
But ask yourself,

1084
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,330
why do tens of millions of people love 
those books?

1085
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,600
And it's because she's doing something 
else.

1086
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:36,480
She's not trying to spread the world the
way it actually is,

1087
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:37,343
but that the way it could be.
And these are the things we've done 

1088
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:40,680
wrong.
Communism,

1089
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,514
socialism.
Because she came out of that Russian 

1090
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:46,530
background and so you know,
her figures like John Golf,

1091
00:53:46,531 --> 00:53:49,150
these are kind of ideal things to strive
for.

1092
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,360
Yes,
exactly.

1093
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,253
Yeah.
Well that her fingers are archetypal 

1094
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:54,240
heroes have a certain form.

1095
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,650
If we could bring it back to some real 
world example.

1096
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,930
I just recently recently started 
following a Jocko willink.

1097
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,280
Now I'm never going to be Jocko willink,
but you know,

1098
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,790
I got his book and I read one page a day
and you know,

1099
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:10,990
it's kind of,
it's sort of like,

1100
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,471
oh yeah,
yeah,

1101
00:54:11,471 --> 00:54:14,110
come on,
you can get up at six in the morning and

1102
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:15,940
get out there on your bike riding with 
the guys.

1103
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:16,893
I don't want to do it.
But then I see tacos page and he's good 

1104
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,480
at it.
Okay.

1105
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,340
So in a way it's not describing the 
world in a scientific way of it's,

1106
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:30,100
it's sending a different message,
like you should strive to be this,

1107
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,170
even if you don't make it,
just do it,

1108
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,620
do something.
Anything.

1109
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,790
And that's a different sense of 
different goal.

1110
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,470
Yeah,
I think to that.

1111
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:40,670
Okay.
So first of all,

1112
00:54:40,671 --> 00:54:41,504
with regards to again round,
I think the criticism leveled at her 

1113
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:44,444
that her characters are too black and 
white is correct because I think that 

1114
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:51,620
one of the things that distinguishes 
great literature from propaganda is that

1115
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:55,700
in great literature most of the conflict
is within rather than between.

1116
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:57,471
Right?
And so,

1117
00:54:57,471 --> 00:54:58,304
and the problem with Ayn rand is all her
good characters are the same good 

1118
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,940
character and all her bad characters are
the same bad character and,

1119
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:07,650
and there's no overlap between them.
So there's a curiosity,

1120
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:08,603
there's an architectural purity,
but that compromises its utility as 

1121
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:13,280
literature.
I would say

1122
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,770
alternation makes his point in Gulag 
archipelago where he says,

1123
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,360
if,
if only the world,

1124
00:55:18,361 --> 00:55:21,100
we're simply black and white and we can 
take the bad people and,

1125
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,730
and isolate them somewhere.
But the problem is,

1126
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:26,270
is you know,
we all have darkness and evil

1127
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,953
last line between good and evil runs 
down every heart that says famous 

1128
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:33,340
sprays.
And it was something he experienced very

1129
00:55:33,341 --> 00:55:36,440
deeply and is also,
it's also pride,

1130
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,230
primordial true

1131
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,370
analyze literature.
And this as well.

1132
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:47,350
There's a body of literature,
evolutionary literary analysis in which,

1133
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,370
um,
you know,

1134
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,010
Pete pinker writes about this at the end
of the blank slate,

1135
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,710
which he talks about,
you know,

1136
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:54,544
what these novels,
these sophisticated novels in which the 

1137
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:59,050
characters are rich and deep,
you know,

1138
00:55:59,051 --> 00:55:59,884
they,
they have all these good characters and 

1139
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:03,070
bad characters,
characteristics and so on.

1140
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:04,660
And,
uh,

1141
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:05,494
and we can,
we can glean from that in a sense that 

1142
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:09,160
the novelists were ahead of the 
cognitive.

1143
00:56:09,161 --> 00:56:10,700
This is his point,
the novelist.

1144
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,190
We're about a century ahead of 
excitement,

1145
00:56:12,191 --> 00:56:15,940
give scientists,
figuring out of human nature

1146
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,160
or maybe a thousand years ahead,

1147
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,150
modern literature anyway,
you know,

1148
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:23,363
so we can,
we can gain a lot from there and not 

1149
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,640
just the rich emotional experience of 
reading a good novel,

1150
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,793
uh,
but actually teasing out this is what 

1151
00:56:29,921 --> 00:56:32,350
some of these evolutionary literary 
people are trying to do.

1152
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:35,710
It's like there's certain themes that 
come up over and over and over again.

1153
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,810
Uh,
it's not totally random.

1154
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,560
You know,
unlike the postmodernists,

1155
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:45,220
there actually are a certain real 
meanings that the author intended.

1156
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,223
See,
I think the problem with the 

1157
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:50,970
postmodernists technically speaking,
and I thought a lot about this,

1158
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:53,910
is that they got their initial criticism
right,

1159
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:54,744
which is that there's an infinite number
of ways of interpreting a finite set of 

1160
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:59,850
phenomena,
but there isn't an,

1161
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:00,803
there isn't a,
there isn't an infinite number of valid 

1162
00:57:02,731 --> 00:57:07,731
ways of interpreting a finite set of 
phenomena and that's where you get right

1163
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:08,964
back into the issue of circulation of 
the interpretation around these great 

1164
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:15,830
underlying architectural themes that are
built in,

1165
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:16,693
in large part right into our biology.
I read a really interesting analysis of 

1166
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:21,470
the,
um,

1167
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,120
of the symbol of the dragon a while 
back,

1168
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:27,090
and I can't conjure up the name of the 
book unfortunately,

1169
00:57:27,091 --> 00:57:30,510
but his hypothesis,
which I thought was a very good one,

1170
00:57:30,511 --> 00:57:35,511
was that a dragon is a Metta Predator.
So it's the symbol for Predator and,

1171
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:39,720
but it's more than that.

1172
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,553
But the Predator is tree snake bird.
Because the fundamental predators have 

1173
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:49,920
treatwell in primates were cats,
snakes and birds.

1174
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,340
And so what it is,
is an amalgam of all those things.

1175
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,413
And so it's real.
Just like the category of creditor is 

1176
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:57,774
real,
even though snakes and cats are both in 

1177
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,200
the category of Predator and no one 
says,

1178
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:03,000
well,
there's no such thing as a Predator,

1179
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:06,270
and then you can add fire to that for a 
variety of reasons,

1180
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:09,990
not least being a being I'm sure that 
fire white belt,

1181
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:13,440
many of our ancestors as well,
and then the additional twist,

1182
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:17,670
which is the dragons also hoard gold,
so human beings,

1183
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:18,504
because we're not just prey.
Animals learned that if we confronted 

1184
00:58:20,491 --> 00:58:23,160
the Metta Predator,
we would gain as a consequence.

1185
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,960
So there are certain channels down which
good stories go based on our,

1186
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:29,823
our biological nature or evolved nature.
It's not that it's completely 

1187
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:33,810
deterministic in that sense.
No,

1188
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,170
no.

1189
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,890
It's variations on a theme I would say.
Yeah,

1190
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,103
so that was interesting.
There was an interesting article 

1191
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:42,120
published,
I think it was a nature a few months ago

1192
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,703
showing that it was very,
very high resolution brain scan and so 

1193
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,073
you know,
there's the idea of course that in the 

1194
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,774
cortex that neurons that fire together 
wire together and then we learned that 

1195
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,830
the neurons are actually in cortical 
columns.

1196
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,570
So they actually have their structure,
their unit structure,

1197
00:58:57,571 --> 00:59:00,870
so they're not just randomly connecting 
with neurons everywhere in the brain,

1198
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,093
but what his scan showed was an 
underlying super highway of building 

1199
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,653
connections so that the columns 
themselves could wire into the already 

1200
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:10,974
existing super highways.
So it was like there was an underlying 

1201
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:14,874
architecture that was highly probable,
was highly probable that it would 

1202
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:18,444
manifest itself and I thought,
well that looks like the neural 

1203
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:22,370
architecture of something like an 
archetype

1204
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:29,150
arguments
for crown is that it would be really fun

1205
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,984
to come back and say a thousand years 
from now just to see what scientists or 

1206
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,930
scholars or talking about like of how 
the brain works.

1207
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,500
You know,
what,

1208
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,020
what's the metaphor they're using then 
that.

1209
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,840
And they'll look back on us and go,
oh,

1210
00:59:41,841 --> 00:59:44,060
they thought the brain is a computer.
How

1211
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:50,510
are the time we come up with a fully 
material account of consciousness.

1212
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:51,344
Our notion of what constitutes material 
will have undergone substantial 

1213
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:54,674
revision.
So I do wonder if sometimes I toy with 

1214
00:59:58,551 --> 01:00:00,560
the idea of the mysterians dino and the 
mysterians.

1215
01:00:00,561 --> 01:00:03,380
There's certain mysteries of the 
universe we will never solve.

1216
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,273
We just,
because of the limitations that this 

1217
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,890
structure of our brain and so God free 
will and determinism,

1218
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,900
the nature of consciousness,
you know,

1219
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:15,210
there's a few of these core deep 
question.

1220
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:16,044
So my friend,
the late great Martin Gardner called 

1221
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:22,160
himself a Deist,
you're probably familiar with the DSM.

1222
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,900
It's kind of like,
well,

1223
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:25,520
it's based on,
uh,

1224
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:27,110
William James and,
and,

1225
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,120
uh,
uh,

1226
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:33,150
manual mumo pragmatist.
It's sort of a pragmatist philosophy.

1227
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:34,964
So anyway,
Martin Martin was his longtime column 

1228
01:00:36,601 --> 01:00:37,520
district,
Scientific American,

1229
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:38,453
well,
one of the founders of the modern 

1230
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:42,020
skeptical movement.
He was as skeptical as I am,

1231
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:42,913
maybe more on almost everything,
but he believed in God and he believed 

1232
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:47,144
in prayer and the afterlife and so on.
Even though he would say to fellow 

1233
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:52,610
skeptics,
I'm,

1234
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,830
yes,
I think the atheist have slightly better

1235
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:56,570
arguments than the theater just 
slightly,

1236
01:00:56,930 --> 01:00:57,763
but you know,
because you can't determine one way or 

1237
01:00:59,331 --> 01:01:00,164
the other for sure,
whether there's a god or not with 

1238
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,090
determinism,
it's okay to just practically speaking,

1239
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,890
to just do whatever works for you.
This is the pregnancies and things.

1240
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:10,550
So he said,
he says,

1241
01:01:10,551 --> 01:01:11,384
he prays.
He believes that there is some kind of 

1242
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:14,690
afterlife and that there's something out
there,

1243
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,550
not an anthropomorphic God or anything 
like that.

1244
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,210
So he called this fideism anyway,
so I kind of respected that because he,

1245
01:01:21,211 --> 01:01:25,280
he didn't make any truth claims like I 
can prove this or I'm sure I'm right.

1246
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,530
He said it's just true for me.
And you know,

1247
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,530
that gets back to that question of what 
is true,

1248
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:33,440
what is truth anyway,
if that's all you're saying,

1249
01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,500
it's just true for me psychologically 
true works for me.

1250
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:38,210
It's really kind of the end of the 
conversation,

1251
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,900
but you know,
so when I deal with creationists,

1252
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,460
I think the earth is 10,000 years old.
Okay.

1253
01:01:43,461 --> 01:01:45,470
So we have a problem.
There is a conflict,

1254
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:46,890
you know,
Steve Gould,

1255
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,220
non overlapping magisterial doesn't 
apply there.

1256
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:53,180
One side is wrong and one side is right 
when you're talking about say the age of

1257
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:56,270
the universe or the world,
but if you say,

1258
01:01:56,271 --> 01:01:56,780
look,
this,

1259
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,330
this is what works for me.
Having this particular,

1260
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,760
I'm not claiming I can prove it,
it just works for me.

1261
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:04,070
Really.
Was there to say after that,

1262
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:09,130
it's kind of the end of the conversation
and I do think sometimes that when we're

1263
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,740
talking about free will and determinism,
you know,

1264
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,603
what do you mean by these words and how 
well the devil's always in the details 

1265
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:21,500
in hit an epistemological while we keep 
kicking past.

1266
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:23,940
I'm a compatiblist.
I think,

1267
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:24,870
you know,
Dan Dennett,

1268
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,230
I'm not a philosopher,
but now those kinds of arguments I think

1269
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:30,570
make more sense to me.
In any case,

1270
01:02:30,571 --> 01:02:33,630
I have what I call the behavioral 
compatible ism.

1271
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:34,973
That is whatever your position is 
intellectually on free will and 

1272
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:37,884
determinism.
It doesn't really matter because when 

1273
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,130
you walk out the door,
you're,

1274
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:40,720
uh,
you,

1275
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,480
you believed you were making choices.

1276
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,073
This is the argument that I tried to 
level at Sam Harris with regards to the 

1277
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,640
metaphysical foundations of his ethics.
It's like,

1278
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,003
it's the same sort of thing is,
and I think Ben Shapiro just went after 

1279
01:02:54,381 --> 01:02:55,214
him on the same grounds,
is that I don't care what you say about 

1280
01:02:57,201 --> 01:02:58,850
whether or not you're an atheist,
atheist,

1281
01:02:58,851 --> 01:03:01,610
you act like you're part of the Judeo 
Christian tradition.

1282
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,730
And so you think you don't believe,
but I think you do,

1283
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:07,970
but we have different definitions of 
what the word believe means.

1284
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:09,493
So now I'm not saying that that's 
necessary the argument and all 

1285
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:12,554
arguments,
but it's one that needs to be taken 

1286
01:03:13,551 --> 01:03:14,384
seriously,
especially by the more rationalistic 

1287
01:03:16,161 --> 01:03:18,530
atheists because they don't give the 
devil his due.

1288
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:19,813
Now you're in a different category 
because you went through the whole 

1289
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:24,170
Christian thing in detail and you know,
the,

1290
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,030
you know,
the stories and you know,

1291
01:03:26,031 --> 01:03:28,940
the mythology and you know,
the psychology as well,

1292
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:29,774
you know,
we've talked about Joseph Campbell and 

1293
01:03:30,651 --> 01:03:32,150
people like him.
So,

1294
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,770
you know,
that puts you in the,

1295
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:36,010
in the,
in the realm of the,

1296
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:38,870
I would say,
what would you say biblically and,

1297
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:42,770
and on,
and a psychoanalytically informed.

1298
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:44,411
Well,
again,

1299
01:03:44,411 --> 01:03:47,050
it depends what your goals are.
What are you trying to do?

1300
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,740
I mean,
people like Sam and Richard know they're

1301
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:53,620
laser focused on one particular thing 
and they're working at so good.

1302
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,180
Um,
and I'm,

1303
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,580
I'm on board with that.
Uh,

1304
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:59,260
I think know certain belief systems are 
dangerous.

1305
01:03:59,290 --> 01:03:59,891
Uh,
okay.

1306
01:03:59,891 --> 01:04:01,870
So let it be good.
If we could correct those,

1307
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,770
but I'm also interested in other aspects
of beliefs and um,

1308
01:04:05,771 --> 01:04:06,280
you know,
that's,

1309
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,440
that's a slightly different goal.
So for example,

1310
01:04:08,441 --> 01:04:10,680
when I'm talking to Deepak,
no,

1311
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,420
it's true.
Quantum physics says what it says.

1312
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,240
Okay.
But at some level I say,

1313
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,760
what's the actionable take home?
Why not?

1314
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:19,683
Okay,
so let's say the world is completely 

1315
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:21,753
determined and you know,
right down to the last synaptic 

1316
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,660
connection that the particles,
whatever.

1317
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,760
And I really have no choice.
Yeah.

1318
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:28,594
But so what?
I still have to choose to go to work 

1319
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:32,830
tomorrow or as I tell Deepak,
you know,

1320
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:37,440
my mortgage is still due next Tuesday.
So even if none of this matters or,

1321
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:40,930
or it's all empty space or you know,
it's all consciousness.

1322
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:41,823
So what
act in the world in a way as if I'm 

1323
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,384
making choices,
as if I'm responsible for my actions 

1324
01:04:51,701 --> 01:04:52,534
because I am.

1325
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,190
That's good.
That's.

1326
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:55,053
Well,
I would also say in relationship to 

1327
01:04:56,591 --> 01:04:57,424
that,
there isn't any evidence to me that 

1328
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,613
we've been able to determine how to 
build a functional society without 

1329
01:05:01,841 --> 01:05:05,500
building those axioms into the,
into the substructure of the society,

1330
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:09,310
freewill and responsibility.
Maybe they don't exist,

1331
01:05:09,311 --> 01:05:12,520
but if we don't build societies that 
assume they exist,

1332
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:15,370
the society's become unstable 
unbelievably rapidly.

1333
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:18,250
And to me that's a kind of evidence they
do exist.

1334
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:19,563
I mean even knowing the say game 
theoretic model of a tilting the 

1335
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:27,210
incentives to get people to do this 
versus that,

1336
01:05:27,211 --> 01:05:29,040
you know,
a libertarian paternalism,

1337
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,640
Dick Taylor calls it,
you know,

1338
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:34,880
so if you give people a choice 
architecture where you put the desert,

1339
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:36,043
you know,
in the back and in the healthy fruit 

1340
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,753
foods in the front or you have different
kinds of structured menus to get to 

1341
01:05:42,031 --> 01:05:42,864
nudge people to choose healthier diets 
or better investment tools that 

1342
01:05:45,961 --> 01:05:47,010
companies,
things like that.

1343
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:49,680
We're already doing these sorts of 
things as if we can,

1344
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,920
if not determined people,
people's actions and choices,

1345
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:54,980
but at least shape them in a way.
But,

1346
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:58,230
but even doing that,
we're actively choosing to do that.

1347
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,120
So being self aware that I know that if 
I go shopping on an empty stomach,

1348
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:03,954
I'm very,
I'm much more likely to buy unhealthy 

1349
01:06:05,491 --> 01:06:07,590
foods,
cookies or ice cream or whatever.

1350
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:10,080
Then I would,
if I went shopping on a full stomach,

1351
01:06:10,081 --> 01:06:10,914
so I choose to alter my environment 
around me because I'm going to nudge 

1352
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,744
myself in another direction.
How is that not a kind of a choice and 

1353
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:23,240
if you're a determinist to determine 
determinants,

1354
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:25,020
I would say.
Um.

1355
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:28,050
Okay.
Do you recognize say that the addict who

1356
01:06:28,051 --> 01:06:28,884
is just totally hooked on heroin or acce
coat on or something is different from 

1357
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,110
Uni who are not addicted and yes,
there's a difference.

1358
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:38,380
Okay.
What's that difference?

1359
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:39,443
If it's all determinism,
it's tumors all the way down or 

1360
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,630
whatever.
Um,

1361
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,633
what is the difference then between the 
addict and the addict is more 

1362
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,310
determined?
No,

1363
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,680
but I to good objection.
That's what is that as a concept?

1364
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:54,300
Yeah.
What does that mean?

1365
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:55,350
More determined,
right?

1366
01:06:55,351 --> 01:06:56,460
Exactly.
Exactly.

1367
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,430
That's why I like Dan dead.
It's idea of the degrees of freedom.

1368
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,283
You and I have more degrees of freedom 
that our dogs are dogs more than the 

1369
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:06,110
cockroach,
whatever.

1370
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,223
Um,
there's just more variation and we have 

1371
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:09,894
one additional

1372
01:07:10,290 --> 01:07:13,850
we're aware of in terms of time as well,
you know,

1373
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,330
if you're,
if you're driving,

1374
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:16,253
here's a nice way of thinking about the 
relationship between free will and 

1375
01:07:18,271 --> 01:07:19,104
determinism.
Let's say you're driving down the road 

1376
01:07:20,641 --> 01:07:23,580
at 60 miles an hour.
Where do you look?

1377
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:25,493
And the answer isn't right in front of 
the car because you've already run over 

1378
01:07:28,501 --> 01:07:29,910
the thing that's right in front of the 
car.

1379
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,000
So you look about a quarter of a mile 
down the road.

1380
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:34,463
And what that means is that you can 
start to sequence your deterministic 

1381
01:07:37,311 --> 01:07:38,144
auctions.
And so there's this idea of a ballistic 

1382
01:07:40,051 --> 01:07:41,820
movement.
So if I do this,

1383
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:42,683
let's see.
So you see I didn't hit my hand when I 

1384
01:07:45,421 --> 01:07:46,710
came down like that.
Now,

1385
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,430
the truth of the matter is,
is that there isn't enough time.

1386
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,270
So when I released this movement 
quickly,

1387
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:59,580
there isn't enough time for the message 
to get from my hand to my brain and back

1388
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:02,310
to stop my hand as an element of free 
choice.

1389
01:08:02,670 --> 01:08:05,940
I have to plan and release the entire 
movement at once,

1390
01:08:05,941 --> 01:08:08,160
including the stopping.
That's ballistic.

1391
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,850
And so as soon as I implement that 
movement,

1392
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:12,684
there is no free will.
It's like the space that have choice 

1393
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:18,650
over has collapsed into a deterministic 
world,

1394
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:19,873
but I think what we do is we look out in
the future far enough so that we can 

1395
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:23,474
sequence our choices and they collapse 
into determinism as we implement 

1396
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,143
something like that.
And I think that works neurologically 

1397
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:31,100
to.
If you look at how,

1398
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:32,283
how,
how action patterns actually manifest 

1399
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:34,634
themselves in the brain,
it does seem to be something akin to 

1400
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:37,034
that.
Don't make much out of the liberty 

1401
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,810
limited experiments,
for example,

1402
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,320
well limited himself was a compatiblist 
he did not believe in,

1403
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,163
in,
in complete determinism that wears a 

1404
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:48,813
pink or put it this way in the blanks 
slate that you are part of the causal 

1405
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:52,814
net of the universe,
but you're part of it and you're making 

1406
01:08:55,411 --> 01:08:58,320
choices that further determined the 
universe,

1407
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:02,430
but they're still your choice so you are
morally accountable for them.

1408
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:06,330
I do think the law has evolved nicely 
along these lines along the,

1409
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,393
um,
sort of shades of grey or the to know 

1410
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,333
the law if you intended to kill somebody
versus doing it in an act of a rage 

1411
01:09:16,231 --> 01:09:18,570
because it was just on spur of the 
moment.

1412
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:21,420
You've got your spouse and you and you 
lose your temper.

1413
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:23,550
That's different from the.
If we,

1414
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,463
we find out that for weeks you were 
plotting this to kill your spouse or 

1415
01:09:27,871 --> 01:09:28,704
whatever,
you're going to get a different kind of 

1416
01:09:29,881 --> 01:09:31,590
penalty.
And that matches,

1417
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,000
you know,
neuroscience pretty well.

1418
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,841
Yeah,
I think so.

1419
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:36,870
I think so.
More or less control over.

1420
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:37,704
So again,
more deterministic versus less 

1421
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:40,860
deterministic.
What are you talking about?

1422
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,850
You're talking about degrees of freedom.
Determinist don't like the word freedom.

1423
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:46,140
Okay.
Call it something else.

1424
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:51,300
You have more degrees of something,
of options.

1425
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:52,853
Well,
whatever you end up with as a synonym 

1426
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:55,600
eventually ends up meaning freedom.

1427
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:57,680
Well,
I think so.

1428
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,930
Yeah.
The word I the word.

1429
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:00,890
I used the word.
So,

1430
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:04,080
so that's next return.
I'm going to show your book again here,

1431
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:09,260
just so that everybody remembers it and 
I would like to say what were you.

1432
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:10,463
Let's end with this.
What were you hoping or are you hoping 

1433
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:13,014
to accomplish with this book?
Apart from clarifying your own thoughts 

1434
01:10:15,391 --> 01:10:16,410
and communicating them?
What,

1435
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:17,610
what?
I mean,

1436
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:18,420
you,
you,

1437
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:19,253
you've put this message into a bottle 
and you've launched it out there in the 

1438
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:22,410
world.
What do you,

1439
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:23,430
what are you hoping for?

1440
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,000
Uh,
really to everybody,

1441
01:10:26,001 --> 01:10:28,730
both religious and nonreligious or 
scientists.

1442
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,380
The messages at really the here and now 
is what counts more than anything else.

1443
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:34,530
We don't,
again,

1444
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,100
we live in Brooklyn,
not in 15 billion years from now that,

1445
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:39,260
that,
that,

1446
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,770
whether or not there's an afterlife,
because clearly no one knows for sure.

1447
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,120
We don't live in the afterlife.
We live in this life and,

1448
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,073
and so what you do really matters how 
you are in relation with other people 

1449
01:10:52,071 --> 01:10:52,904
and your environment really matters.
It matters not just for the future but 

1450
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,800
the immediate future.
And even now,

1451
01:10:58,010 --> 01:11:00,110
whatever that means to you.
And uh,

1452
01:11:00,111 --> 01:11:00,761
so,
uh,

1453
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:01,594
again,
I'm glad people are working on this and 

1454
01:11:03,141 --> 01:11:04,630
thinking about it.
Um,

1455
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:05,603
and if we can improve society 
incrementally a little bit instead of 

1456
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:12,400
aiming for utopia,
aim for protopia.

1457
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,363
Yep.
Yeah,

1458
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,130
that's a great

1459
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,420
thing.
Incremental.

1460
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,260
And again,
instead of aiming for the mortality or a

1461
01:11:20,260 --> 01:11:21,093
thousand years,
let's just aim for getting more people 

1462
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:26,890
to 90 and 100 healthy and happy and 
living fulfilled lives.

1463
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:31,120
And I do talk about in the end about the
last chapter,

1464
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:35,980
less pages in fact about the importance 
of aiming to live a purposeful,

1465
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:37,930
meaningful life.
Not a happiness.

1466
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:39,073
You know,
I've

1467
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:43,870
just to see the literature develop in 
positive psychology about happiness.

1468
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,400
I've read all the books,
all great,

1469
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:49,660
but happiness in the sense of I'm going 
to plug into the morphine drip now.

1470
01:11:49,661 --> 01:11:50,494
That's not what life is about.
That isn't what gets people meaningful 

1471
01:11:52,721 --> 01:11:53,554
lives.
It's doing things that don't make you 

1472
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:55,990
happy,
you know,

1473
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,390
like again,
back to your workout every day.

1474
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:00,220
It's not fun.
I'm not happy working out.

1475
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:01,840
Uh,
and uh,

1476
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:04,510
or you know,
I was a caretaker for my parents.

1477
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:06,130
Um,
I had four parents,

1478
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,890
step parents and,
and so two of them I was a caretaker.

1479
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,890
It wasn't fun at all.
I didn't get joy,

1480
01:12:11,891 --> 01:12:14,980
I wasn't enjoying it.
It was a,

1481
01:12:14,981 --> 01:12:16,240
you know,
an uncomfortable experience,

1482
01:12:16,241 --> 01:12:19,240
but it made me feel better about myself,
about the world.

1483
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:22,000
Like this is what this is doing 
something more deeply meaningful.

1484
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:23,403
And,
and so I think that that's where it 

1485
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,360
counts actually working to make the 
world a better place,

1486
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:30,970
gives you a deeper,
more fulfilled life.

1487
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,890
That is an excellent place to end.
So I think like,

1488
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:37,570
I think amen to that red light for no 
afterlife.

1489
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,720
We should improve what we have right in 
front of us.

1490
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,980
Exactly.
Yep.

1491
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,140
And that's better than happiness.
I agree.

1492
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,093
I agree completely.
It's a much more profound orientation 

1493
01:12:47,191 --> 01:12:51,450
and it's a boat that will tap in a 
storm,

1494
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:54,870
so they see,
hey,

1495
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:56,940
my pleasure.
It was really nice talking with you.

1496
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,360
Hopefully we'll get a chance to talk 
again.

1497
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:04,590
Your book comes out the 12 steps.
We'll we'll talk about the 12 steps.

1498
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:08,670
Sounds like a fine plan yet,
but I saw your show with Dave Rubin.

1499
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:09,870
I thought that was really good.

1500
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,160
Thanks very much.
Was very good talking with you.

1501
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:14,653
Alright.
Right.

1502
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,473
Bye.
Bye.
