1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,523
Hi everyone,
I should really be editing my book 

2
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:05,390
today,
but,

3
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:06,224
um,
I thought I'd take a bit of time to 

4
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:08,664
respond to something that happened
in the media today in the aftermath of 

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,790
James Demaurice Google memo.
I know the coverage it's received.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,103
A journalist named Steve Kovak wrote a 
story for business insider called 

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,380
Silicon Valley's liberal bubble has 
burst and the culture war has arrived in

8
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:32,520
that article which discussed the memo.
He characterized myself and,

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,773
uh,
Stefan Molyneux a well known youtube 

10
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,774
personality as far right.
What is article said specifically was 

11
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,200
that,
and I quote Youtube,

12
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,034
which is ironically owned by Google and 
has become a hotspot for right wing v 

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,340
Loggers was they would let of choice for
Demora himself.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,473
His first public interviews were to 
Stefan Molyneux and Jordan b Peterson 

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,160
far right figures who have built up 
large followings on the video site.

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,530
And I felt that that was inappropriate,
let's say to say the least.

17
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:05,383
Um,
and so I tweeted that and emailed him 

18
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:09,684
and said that that was a 
mischaracterization and asked him to 

19
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:13,404
justify his claims.
And so what I'm going to do is to read 

20
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:18,920
our email exchange to,
okay,

21
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,893
um,
and you can draw your own conclusions 

22
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:21,864
from it.
So

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,440
the first email,
this is my email,

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,090
I said,
dear Mr Kovach,

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,210
you called me a far right figure in 
press.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,150
You don't have one iota of proof for 
that statement.

27
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,880
And it is patently untrue.
I've been lecturing,

28
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,714
for example,
about the dangers of national socialist 

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,413
ideology for decades.
Find a single thing I've said that 

30
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:45,714
places me on the far right in the 
absence of a smoking pistol is that 

31
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,560
grounds for a lawsuit for defamation of 
character.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,460
Inquiring minds want to know if you want
to talk,

33
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,220
I'm open to it,
but you should watch your words.

34
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,760
I'm seriously unhappy about you're 
careless and false characterization.

35
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Watch this,
for example,

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,600
and see if it's far right.
I link to a youtube video of a lecture I

37
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:13,110
gave on the temperamental basis of right
wing belief.

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,113
And so then Steve responded and he said,
how would you prefer to be 

39
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,520
characterized?
And then he said,

40
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,423
just saw your tweets.
Please let me know what you would 

41
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,330
prefer.
And so I said I would prefer the truth.

42
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,253
I would prefer that journalists such as 
yourself use absolute precision of 

43
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:34,734
language.
It's not up to me to tell you what that 

44
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,344
is.
It's up to you given your choice of 

45
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,160
profession.
And this is no laughing matter,

46
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,330
Mr Kovach as you seem to imply with 
quote,

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,233
please let me know what you prefer.
And I've been fighting an intellectual 

48
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:52,290
war against radicals on the right and 
left for three decades.

49
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,213
I've been very clear and public track 
record with regards to my attitude to 

50
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:59,860
the far right.
I spent a lot of time and for example,

51
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,694
in my first book,
maps of meaning outlining the 

52
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:07,000
psychopathology of national socialists 
and it made my opposition to such things

53
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,970
known in a manner both public and widely
distributed.

54
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,493
The fact that I'm equally unhappy with 
the gulag type leftists generally 

55
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,150
ignored by the modern postmodernists 
does not make me far right.

56
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,793
I'm seriously unhappy about being 
carelessly lumped in with people I 

57
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,240
despise and have spent my life fighting.

58
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,860
He wrote back and said,
thank you for your response.

59
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,110
So the article is truthful and accurate.

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,660
How would you like to be characterized?
I said,

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
I said very clearly you mischaracterized
me as far right on what grounds 

62
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:45,910
whatsoever can you make that claim and 
having made it,

63
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,973
it is your responsibility to either 
justify the characterization with some 

64
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:54,220
investigation or to withdraw it and 
apologize politically.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,370
I'm a classic British liberal.
Temperamentally.

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,890
I'm high in openness which tells me to 
the left,

67
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,070
although I am also conscientious which 
tells me to the right.

68
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,790
Philosophically,
I'm an individualist collectivist,

69
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,160
have the right or the left 
metaphysically.

70
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:09,994
I'm an American pragmatist who has been 
strongly influenced by the 

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,553
psychoanalytic and clinical thinking of 
Freud young and the psycho therapists 

72
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:18,304
who have followed in their wake.
There is simply nothing I've said or 

73
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,670
done that makes me far right.
Quite the contrary.

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,533
I've warned thousands of students over 
the course of three decades that the 

75
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,954
spirit of Auschwitz concentration camp 
guards dwells in their heart and that 

76
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,850
they should do everything in their power
to recognize it's existence and overcome

77
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:37,684
it.
Every single lecture of my maps of 

78
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,414
meaning course,
various versions which have now been 

79
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:44,860
watched or listened to by millions of 
people,

80
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,903
make some variant of that point.
I've also produced a series of 

81
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,014
individual self development programs now
used by thousands of people to 

82
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,854
strengthen themselves as individuals 
determine their proper and honorable 

83
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,890
destinies and live productive,
meaningful lives.

84
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,173
You didn't do your homework.
You cast a serious dispersion on my 

85
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,790
character.
I don't deserve it in the least.

86
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,530
I want you to do something about it.

87
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,280
He responds.
Thank you for the clarification,

88
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,114
Jordan.
I will correct the story and identify 

89
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,870
you as a classic British liberal.

90
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,390
I responded.
I wrote this one before.

91
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:26,140
I received his response,
but I sent it after so I'm keeping it in

92
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,974
the order that it actually emerged 
rather than in the order that it makes 

93
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:33,300
precise sense.
Dear Mr. Colback,

94
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,430
do you really think that if I were far 
right,

95
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,593
I could have placed 200 university 
lectures online and taught for three 

96
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,584
decades at Harvard and at the University
of Toronto without someone making a 

97
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:48,070
devastating case for my ideological 
perversity?

98
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,070
In what universe could that possibly 
occur?

99
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,370
I'm a university professor,
clinical psychologists,

100
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,204
and a public intellectual whose primary 
goal is the psychological and 

101
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,830
metaphysical strength and fortification 
of the individual.

102
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,870
I was still trying to clarify,
um,

103
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,933
how I would like to be referred to 
literally nothing about that as far 

104
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,294
right.
I don't even care though that you've 

105
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,060
called me that name.
In the last year,

106
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,010
I've been called names by people who 
have made that kind of behavior,

107
00:06:14,011 --> 00:06:16,520
a well-practiced part of their 
professional specialty.

108
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,520
What I care about is the fact that the 
name is wrong,

109
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,383
seriously wrong.
You're engaged in a very important 

110
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,590
public debate,
handled incorrectly.

111
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,440
That debate will degenerate into 
conflict.

112
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,590
When you make an error,
willful or otherwise,

113
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,720
you increase the possibility of 
catastrophe.

114
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm calling your attention to such an 
error.

115
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,773
To put it bluntly,
you are contributing to the dangerous 

116
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,110
political polarization,
increasingly typifying public discourse.

117
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,003
By vilifying my views and my character,
it appears that you have done so either 

118
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,790
carelessly or to add some narrative 
punch to your story.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,833
Neither of these reasons are in the 
least justifiable post our email 

120
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:55,574
dialogue publicly if you'd like.
Let the readers sorted out for 

121
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,530
themselves.
If you want to stick to your guns,

122
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,670
and then I thought and replied,
that's okay.

123
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:07,670
All Post the dialogue.
Screenshots to twitter,

124
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,760
which I've done.
Steve Kovak responded,

125
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,440
thanks for your help.
The story has been corrected and without

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,070
Mr.

127
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,903
Kovak went online and changed his 
description of both Stefan Molyneux and 

128
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,610
from,
as I had mentioned previously,

129
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,730
far right to the current description,
which is right leaning,

130
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,420
Stefan Molyneux and classic British 
liberal Jordan b Peterson,

131
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,613
which I might point out is quite a 
substantial departure from the initial 

132
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,783
thought.
Right.

133
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,630
You might think I'd be pleased about the
change and I suppose it's better the way

134
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,350
it is then the way it was,
but I'm not pleased at all with the fact

135
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,130
that it happened or really with the fact
that it was changed so easily.

136
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:56,120
It's like it's not a straightforward 
matter.

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,340
It's not a matter of no import to 
mischaracterize someone as far right,

138
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,383
especially in today's political climate 
and it's indicative of what I would 

139
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:08,710
describe as loose journalistic ethics,
uh,

140
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,673
to put it mildly.
To then be so willing to transform your 

141
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:18,120
terminology with no explanation to your 
reader and no apparent.

142
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,103
Let's call it crisis of conscience or
or serious consideration of the meaning 

143
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,870
of your options.
Well,

144
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,170
that's not good.
Let's put it that way

145
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,620
anyways.
You guys can,

146
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,543
apart from that commentary,
which I couldn't stop myself from 

147
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,054
making.
You guys can draw your own conclusions 

148
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,110
and then one last thing.
I'm not exactly sure what to make of the

149
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,520
alt right and

150
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,083
yeah,

151
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,010
and then one last thing.
I'm not sure

152
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:56,883
what,

153
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,823
and then one last thing.
I'm not sure how to understand the old 

154
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:07,540
right or to characterize it or even to 
know what to think about.

155
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:12,580
It's hypothetical existence or my 
association with it,

156
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,923
but I can tell you that I'm not in favor
of people banding together in 

157
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,104
ideological groups and instead would 
much rather see people live 

158
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,233
fundamentally productive and meaningful 
and honest individual lives and in that 

159
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:32,590
manner be a light unto their neighbors,
so to speak,

160
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,770
to show the way to live in the world 
without undue ideological possession and

161
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:41,950
to move forward things productively in 
that manner.

162
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,873
I don't know of any pathway forward 
through this increasingly polarized 

163
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,034
political landscape that we find 
ourselves in that isn't absolutely rife 

164
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:55,480
with the possibility of conflict.
And if I haven't made that clear so far,

165
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,330
I would certainly like to make it clear 
now.

166
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,553
So I would encourage those of you who 
are considering yourself say on the old 

167
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,260
right for that matter as well as on the 
radical left too,

168
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,993
transcend your
dangerous and impersonal ideological 

169
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:18,880
identification and start to live is true
individuals in the world.

170
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
Um,
that's what I think and I hope that I've

171
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,340
been communicating that.
And if I haven't,

172
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:27,250
well I apologize because that's what 
I've been trying to do.
