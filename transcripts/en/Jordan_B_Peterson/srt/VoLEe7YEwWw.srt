1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,180
Okay.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,590
Hi everyone.
Back on February 20th I announced that I

3
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:06,424
was going to go to 12 different cities 
in North America and talk about my new 

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,330
book,
12 rules for life and a variety of other

5
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,164
things,
and so we arranged theaters and put 

6
00:00:17,411 --> 00:00:21,340
those tickets up for sale and they've 
proved very popular.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,233
I did the first one this week on Sunday 
in New York at the beacon theater to an 

8
00:00:27,581 --> 00:00:31,570
audience of about 3000 people and it 
seemed to go very well.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,960
The consequence of that is that I'm now 
announcing another 20 cities and this is

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,134
the video to make that announcement.
I'm also appearing as a guest with 

11
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:44,290
several other speakers,
including Matt Dillahunty,

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,870
Sam Harris,
a number of times,

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,390
and also Sam Harrison,
Douglas Murray,

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,763
and so the announcements for those who 
will be included in the description of 

15
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,034
this video as well.
All these talks are going to occur from 

16
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:00,820
may through June,

00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:04,090
to psychological development with an 
enthusiastic and involved crowd.

41
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,410
And I hope that the lectures are useful 
and,

42
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:12,280
and
that there is useful for the people that

43
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:16,870
I'm speaking with as they are engaging 
and worthwhile for me.
