1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,833
Okay,
so

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,340
we're actually going to take a step 
back.

3
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,510
Historically
talked about Carl Rogers last time

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:15,803
as a phenomenologist.
So we started our brief foray into the 

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,034
ideas behind phenomenology,
but now we're going to go back in time 

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,163
the up and we're going to talk about the
end of the 19th century and we're going 

7
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,571
to discuss Nietzsche and Dostoevsky and 
Kierkegaard in some detail.

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,150
And the reason we're going to do that is
because those three men,

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,450
I s I would say more than anyone else in
the 19th century laid the groundwork not

10
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:42,384
only for what would become 
psychoanalysis and then later 

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,910
personality psychology and clinical 
psychology,

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,620
but they also describe the broader 
social,

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,830
political and cultural situation that 
modern people find themselves in now

14
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,743
and their thought is exceedingly 
sophisticated and it's really worth 

15
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:09,330
grasping because if you can get it,
you know,

16
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,164
we're going through these personality 
theories one of the time and we're 

17
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:13,794
making,
going to make for reason to biology and 

18
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:20,130
neuro psychology,
you need a structure underneath that.

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,963
You need to understand a structure 
that's underneath all of that to slot 

20
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,354
everything into.
Because that way you can understand it 

21
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:28,290
in more detail.
And so

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,653
partly because ideas develop 
historically and also an idea as a seed 

23
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:36,970
and out of the seed,
other plants grow and,

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,933
and so forth,
the plant grows and so forth and 

25
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,494
branches off.
If you can get back down to the origin 

26
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,480
point,
then you can often understand the entire

27
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,314
structure more straightforwardly.
And also these three men are so 

28
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:52,584
brilliant that it's,
it's a joy to encounter their thinking 

29
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,630
even though it's,
it's very,

30
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,560
very,
uh,

31
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,890
some verses seriously subversive.

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,660
So we're going to start with this 
diagram,

33
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,910
which you'll remember.
So,

34
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,301
okay.
You're,

35
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,780
so think about this from the Piaget of 
perspective.

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,500
Like we made the point that as the child
puts itself,

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
let's say together,
it starts by practicing micro routines,

38
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,154
micro motor routines,
and those are accompanied by perceptual 

39
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:26,820
frameworks.
And,

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,833
and also they're incorporated into a 
motivational value system because 

41
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,174
they're motivated actions.
And then the child practice is 

42
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:40,251
sequencing those micro personalities,
we'll say together to make ever more and

43
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,760
more complex and ever more and more 
integrated macro personalities.

44
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,760
And so that's basically what this 
diagram describes.

45
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,333
Um,
we were looking at it from an adult 

46
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,040
perspective.
So you know,

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,073
if you're going to be a good person,
you can decompose being a good person 

48
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:01,450
into sub of being a good person and you 
can decode it.

49
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,090
So being a good person as an abstract 
ideal,

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,133
but as you move closer and closer to the
point where the goodness is manifested 

51
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,924
in action,
you move closer and closer to actual 

52
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,780
movements in the world.

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,250
And so the abstract category good person
is actually made out of,

54
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,383
you could think about it as a very 
complex melody of motor motor actions 

55
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,424
and perceptions.
Perception is very tightly linked to 

56
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:28,450
motor action because whenever you 
perceive anything,

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,553
you're doing it in part by actively 
investigating world's partly why your 

58
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:33,740
eyes are moving around all the time.
And if,

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,560
if you're listening,
you move your head,

60
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,000
you know,
to touch something,

61
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:37,834
you have to actively investigate it.
So it's always an activity of 

62
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,870
exploration.
Now in some ways

63
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,560
when you think about the child piecing,
it's,

64
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,440
it's being together from the bottom up.
You can think about that as a biological

65
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,020
process unfolding.
You know,

66
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,883
and you could take up the child is 
crawling and then learning to walk as a 

67
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:03,190
biological process unfolding.
But that's an oversimplification because

68
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,060
human beings exist from day one in a 
very,

69
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:08,380
very social world.

70
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,633
And so what that means is the way that 
those behaviors are sub micro 

71
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:18,670
personalities start to organize 
themselves is always under the influence

72
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:19,504
of,
of the society in which they're 

73
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:23,500
embedded.
And so,

74
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,950
you know,
Piaget talked about the child has as,

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,630
as being,
uh,

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,333
as,
as having reflex basic builtin reflexes 

77
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,980
at birth,
and that,

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,833
that those reflexes are that elaborate 
it up into more and more complex 

79
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:41,734
structures.
But you can think that even the 

80
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:45,730
elaboration of those basic reflexes,
even right from the beginning,

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,890
like there's a routing and sucking 
reflex,

82
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:48,724
which you can,
you can listen from a child by tapping 

83
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,330
on the side of it's cheap when it's very
new,

84
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:53,164
newly born,
and it'll search to try to put what's 

85
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,710
happening in its mouth.
And that's,

86
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,603
that's,
uh,

87
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,623
that's part of the reflexive process,
the builtin perceptual motor unit that 

88
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:05,740
allows the child to begin to suckle.

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,390
Now,
the thing is though,

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,170
what it suckling isn't a static and 
objective entity.

91
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:12,004
It's a person.
And part of breastfeeding is the 

92
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:17,140
establishment of a relationship,
a complex relationship.

93
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:19,240
Because it's also not only a feeding 
relationship,

94
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:20,074
it's a caring relationship.
It's a relationship that's based on 

95
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,583
tactile interaction.
There could be nervousness associated 

96
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,640
with it.
Uh,

97
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,870
and,
and often is,

98
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,740
especially for a new mother,
it's a very complex dynamics social act.

99
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,440
And so what that means is that right 
from the beginning,

100
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:39,760
in order for the baby to engage in that 
process properly,

101
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,103
it has to allow its initial reflects of 
movements to be modified by social 

102
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:50,440
necessity immediately.
So for example,

103
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,740
if a baby is breastfeeding,
it can't bite.

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,350
And you know,
it doesn't have any teeth.

105
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,120
So being bitten isn't necessarily a 
catastrophe,

106
00:05:59,121 --> 00:05:59,954
but it's not pleasant.
And so what will happen if the baby 

107
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,810
bites the mother is that the mother will
pull away and startled the baby and then

108
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,630
the baby will cry.

109
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,463
And you know,
the mother will be at least startled by 

110
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,470
the,
by the error.

111
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:13,304
And so the baby has to learn to,
it has to learn to be civilized in some 

112
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:19,310
sense right off the bat.
Now,

113
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:22,730
you know Freud was talking about the 
process of socialization.

114
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,240
He tended to concentrate more on toilet 
training.

115
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,493
No,
because he thought of that as the first 

116
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:32,270
place where the first major place where 
the ID of the child,

117
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:32,781
which,
which,

118
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,614
or which Rogers would regard as an 
organismic as the organismic 

119
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,490
experiential domain is brought under 
control of the superego.

120
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
Right?
Because at the baby,

121
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:50,150
obviously it's fundamental biological 
function is to relieve itself,

122
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,630
but that has to come under very,
very strict social control.

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,300
And it's a,
it's a complex form of learning.

124
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,134
You know,
what's basically the acquisition of 

125
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:03,311
voluntary control over what was here too
for an involuntary reflex essentially.

126
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,550
And so that can go well or it can go 
badly and it can vary,

127
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,090
go very badly.
So I,

128
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,273
I knew a family who had a daughter at 
one point and that daughter would only 

129
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,340
defecate in her diaper when she was 
three.

130
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,340
So that meant she had full of voluntary 
control of her bowel function,

131
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,174
but there was no way she was going to 
participate in the social ritual that 

132
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,034
surrounded proper toilet.
There was a war going on like a serious 

133
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,580
war.
And that sort of thing happens while not

134
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:32,414
infrequently.
And of course you remember in the crumb 

135
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,170
movie,
the mother,

136
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
uh,
the boys accusing the mother of giving 

137
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:42,770
them enemas and her of course denying 
that any such thing happened,

138
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,020
which was something that made both of 
them roll their eyes,

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,760
you know?
And they all laughed,

140
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,770
but it's really not particularly 
amusing.

141
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,590
So anyways,
my point is,

142
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:52,424
is that even at the micro level,
the manifestation of what we'll call 

143
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:58,064
micro personalities expands and 
organizes into an environment that's 

144
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,580
conditioned by social expectation.

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay.
So then,

146
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:08,503
then,
and this is something we haven't talked 

147
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:13,010
about before.
One thing you might ask is,

148
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,873
okay,
where does the social expectation come 

149
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,114
from?
Now that's a very complex question 

150
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,340
because in some sense that's the same 
question is that as,

151
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,293
where does culture come from?
And that's partly a complex question 

152
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:26,984
because you have to take into account 
evolutionary history which provides the 

153
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:34,250
substrata for the development of 
culture.

154
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:37,010
So that would be human biology.
I've take that into account and then you

155
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,350
have to take human history into account 
and,

156
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,320
and we're,
what you don't have to take into account

157
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,940
is not clear.
Right?

158
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:44,774
Because it's very difficult to,
to track the origins of the social 

159
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,770
routines that make up the fundamental 
social contract.

160
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,963
You know,
we know how to behave properly roughly 

161
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,823
speaking.
We have a set of expectations in a set 

162
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,494
of wants for about the way that other 
people are going to behave with regards 

163
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,844
to us and they return the favor and 
everyone is participating in this and 

164
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,510
everybody basically knows it unless 
they're very poorly socialized.

165
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,220
And you can usually tell that right 
away.

166
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,323
You know,
kids can tell that because if a three 

167
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,844
year old is playing with another three 
year old and one of them is poorly 

168
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:17,904
socialized and so maybe has the 
behavioral repertoire of a fairly badly 

169
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,744
behaved two year old,
the other three year old being socially 

170
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:27,240
sophisticated will say will not play 
with the first.

171
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:28,943
So even though they might be perfectly 
happy to play for a time with an actual 

172
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,970
two year old,
so it doesn't take very long,

173
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,373
it's really hard about the age of three.
The children are already sophisticated 

174
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:45,081
enough to have embodied the rules that 
constitute appropriate cultural behavior

175
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,500
and those rules or their patterns 
actually for the,

176
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,393
they're not exactly rules for the child 
because the child couldn't explicitly 

177
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,500
state them,
but they can act them out.

178
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,380
Now you remember now,
Piaget talked about this a fair bit,

179
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:58,590
right?

180
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,423
Because he said that part of the way 
that the slightly larger micro 

181
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:10,791
personality say of a two year old are 
integrated into the broader social world

182
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,090
is through games that are played with 
peers and with older children.

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
And the Games are ways that like a game 
is fundamentally a negotiated.

184
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,033
It's a negotiated sphere of action and 
perception that has a particular goal 

185
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,950
and the goal is defined by the players 
and the sphere of interaction as defined

186
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,050
by the players.
And so then if you're a good player,

187
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:34,884
what happens is that you become part of 
a higher order structure and the higher 

188
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:41,070
order structure is the game.
So if you're playing soccer,

189
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,083
all of a sudden if you're civilized,
what you do is you manifest those 

190
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:45,534
behaviors that are appropriate to 
playing soccer and you subordinate your 

191
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:50,334
voluntarily subordinate,
your individuality at that point to the 

192
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,230
higher order structure of the game.

193
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,590
That's a communal agreement.
So it's a basic social contract.

194
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,950
And so you practice being part of basic 
social contracts by playing games.

195
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:04,944
And you can do that with games that are 
in some sense relatively straight 

196
00:11:09,221 --> 00:11:14,221
forward and regulated by strict 
conventions and articulated rules.

197
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:15,084
And so that would be like a soccer game 
or you can do it in a more complex way 

198
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,010
and on the less,
uh,

199
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,910
less,
uh,

200
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,090
less structured and less articulated 
manner by engaging in dramatic play.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,433
And so what children usually do when 
they're doing that is that they'll 

202
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:34,260
gather round little group and they'll,
they'll lay out the drama.

203
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:38,910
So the drama would be we're going to 
simulate x,

204
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:43,110
we're going to send you like a family.
And then everybody is assigned a role.

205
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,570
And so you're supposed to act out your 
role,

206
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,433
but exactly how you're supposed to act 
it out is left open during the gate so 

207
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:52,680
you can riff and,
and improvise.

208
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,973
And basically what children are doing 
when they're doing that is acting out 

209
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,893
the family and you know,
because they need to get the family in 

210
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,984
their bones.
Because being a parent isn't a set of 

211
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,140
ideas about parenting.
It's a set of behaviors.

212
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:12,370
It's a dance that you learn to have with
your children and with your partner.

213
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,353
And it's very complicated and the rules 
go far beyond what you could ever 

214
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,100
articulate.
You know,

215
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:19,720
cause you can ask yourself a question 
like,

216
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,750
well how should you discipline a child?
Well first of all,

217
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,690
you can argue about that forever.
But second of all,

218
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,090
you cannot actually elaborate a set of 
principles that will guide your behavior

219
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,924
in every situation where a child is 
likely to disrupt the social 

220
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,584
circumstance.
So you have to be smarter than you can 

221
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,890
say in order to be good at doing 
something as complicated as disciplining

222
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:42,724
a child.

223
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,583
No,
because discipline also means 

224
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,100
encouraging,
right?

225
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,700
Cause it part of discipline it as well.
You shouldn't do those things.

226
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:52,480
But another part of it is you should 
definitely do more of those things.

227
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,420
And so it's the inculcation of a moral 
code.

228
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:59,950
And a lot of that's done through um,
nonverbal behavior and through,

229
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,143
uh,
providing a role model for spontaneous 

230
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,400
imitation and all sorts of things that 
aren't verbal.

231
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,923
Okay.
Now,

232
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,090
so,
so piaget talked about the game and then

233
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:13,924
you can take that game's become more and
more complex and more and more abstract 

234
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,033
and more and more like real life as you 
mature until they may be the games 

235
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:26,050
transform into what sociologists would 
refer to as roles.

236
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,600
So the role you're playing at the 
moment,

237
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,434
at least in principle,
is student and you know it's a game and 

238
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,640
it's a game because it's a fiction in 
some sense,

239
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,540
you know,
it's a fiction,

240
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,700
it's a dramatic fiction in some sense.

241
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,700
The only reason that it exists as a role
is because society is structured in such

242
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:46,234
a way that enables,
this too enables you to do what you're 

243
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,954
doing and to live at the same time.
So it's not exactly adaptation to the 

244
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:53,830
normal,
you know,

245
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,260
to the natural world and in a sense of 
the in,

246
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,760
in,
in any sense of the word.

247
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,260
But it's also,
it's also real life or maybe it's almost

248
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,094
as close to real life as you ever get 
because almost everything that modern 

249
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:06,274
people do,
and maybe this is true for a long time 

250
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,870
into the past is game like in its 
structure.

251
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,300
So the game's just get more and more and
more.

252
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,270
They're more and more and more 
encompassing in some sense.

253
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,650
But you can,
you can,

254
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,963
it's almost,
you can almost say that it never comes 

255
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:23,980
to the point where what you're doing is 
no longer playing a game.

256
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,900
Now that's a bit of an 
oversimplification,

257
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,480
but because there are games and medic 
games,

258
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,850
but we won't talk about the [inaudible] 
games at the moment.

259
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,523
Okay.
So now you can understand sort of some 

260
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,890
of the lower order games and you can 
even understand some of the higher order

261
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,724
roles like you,
you could basically articulate in some 

262
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,880
sense what it means to be a student.
But if you go up the hierarchy,

263
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,290
you know,
cause good person,

264
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,750
a subset of good person could be good 
student.

265
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,430
You can kind of articulate what it means
to be a good student,

266
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,460
although you can't fully articulate it.
But if you go at levels above that,

267
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,650
like be a good citizen or be a good 
person,

268
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,803
but it gets more and more difficult to 
fully articulate because of course it's 

269
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,653
more and more abstract and in 
encompasses more and more territory and 

270
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,990
so by the time you're at the top of the 
hierarchy,

271
00:15:11,991 --> 00:15:14,090
so to speak,
be a good person.

272
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,523
Well it's much,
it's a much more complex phenomena then 

273
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:20,570
you can articulate it,
can't be fully articulate it.

274
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,360
Now I want to read you something that 
needs,

275
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,194
you said,

276
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,173
now you have to listen to this carefully
because there's some very interesting 

277
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:56,990
things about the way Nietzsche writes.
He writes a floristic Lee and I need for

278
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,260
Islam is a short statement,
often only a sentence,

279
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:03,290
but more typically a paragraph.
Next,

280
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,870
very,
very densely packed with ideas.

281
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,190
And I think you could say in some sense 
that if you read Nietzsche,

282
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,063
the stuff that I'm going to read right 
now is from beyond good and evil that 

283
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:19,061
every single sentence has an idea in it.
And it's often an original idea.

284
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:21,200
And that's a remarkable accomplishment.
I mean,

285
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,450
I've often gone through books and 
marked,

286
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,310
I usually fold the top of the page over 
mark where I think there's an idea worth

287
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,860
keeping.
It's an idea I haven't run into before.

288
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:31,694
So it's an original idea.
And I would say in a typical book I 

289
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:36,260
read,
there's none of them.

290
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,730
There might be one or two,
but with nature there's probably 20 on a

291
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,510
page.
And so it makes it,

292
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,673
if it's,
he's packed a tremendous amount of 

293
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:49,640
information into a very,
very small space.

294
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,474
And one of the things,
and he tried to do that and there was a 

295
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:55,280
bunch of reasons.
One was his health wasn't very good,

296
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,820
although he was an early stage genius.
He was a full professor in Germany,

297
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:03,080
I think when he was 22 or 23 which is 
impossible because if you don't become a

298
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:08,081
full professor,
especially 130 years ago,

299
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,750
140 years ago in a German University at 
the age of 23 it just isn't possible.

300
00:17:14,031 --> 00:17:16,880
But he was a spectacular genius.
But his health failed him.

301
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:19,760
And so he had a very difficult time 
writing.

302
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,163
And so what he did was spend an awful 
lot of time thinking and a very short 

303
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:25,190
period of time writing.

304
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,910
And so what that meant was that he would
take a tremendous amount of thought,

305
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,773
genius level thought,
and then compress it into like a single 

306
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,344
sentence or a single paragraph.
And he said that he liked to fuck 

307
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:39,200
philosophize with a hammer.
And in some sense,

308
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,150
you know,
not,

309
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,170
you know about hierarchy did I just 
showed you,

310
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,980
you know,
we talked about the idea that if you hit

311
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,814
something disruptive in your life that 
the magnitude of your response is 

312
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:55,830
proportionate to the,
to the elevation of the level,

313
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,130
right?
It's much more damaging to be accused of

314
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:00,720
being a bad person,
you know,

315
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,600
seriously than it is for someone to 
complain about,

316
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,583
you know,
which side of the plate you happen to 

317
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,500
put the forecourt.
So,

318
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,370
and I think you can say that you can 
sort of think of those uh,

319
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,290
nasty hierarchies of value as nested 
hierarchies of,

320
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,560
they're almost like maps in the sense 
there,

321
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,403
their little units of they ways that you
know how to maneuver in the world and 

322
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,660
not in.

323
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,240
What that means is that as you go up the
hierarchy,

324
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,330
the map is larger and larger and more 
comprehensive.

325
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:33,720
And so if you blow out someone's map of 
like which fork to put on the table,

326
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,590
that's not so bad,
they can rectify that no time flat.

327
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,850
It leaves 99.99% of their personality 
and tech.

328
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,170
But if you fail a crucial exam for it,
for example,

329
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,004
and part of the reason that you're going
to fit you're a student is because you 

330
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:50,760
want to go to medical school.
You know,

331
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,120
that'll blow out like 50 or 60% of your 
personality.

332
00:18:54,121 --> 00:18:54,954
Or at least it'll feel that way.
And that's because what's happening is 

333
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,374
that the structure that you use to 
regulate the relationship between you 

334
00:19:02,161 --> 00:19:05,340
and the world has become damaged at a 
high level.

335
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:08,460
And that invalidates,
like if you're not a student,

336
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,990
if you're not a good student anymore,
then all of the sub factors that make up

337
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,300
being a good student might be invalid.

338
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,133
And you know,
you might've put a lot of effort into 

339
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:18,414
being a good student.
And so if all of a sudden you're not 

340
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:21,810
that,
you have to ask yourself,

341
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:26,550
well what exactly am I and where are all
the errors?

342
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,110
And that's a very,
that can be,

343
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,053
well that's an extraordinary difficult 
cognitive problem because you've built 

344
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:34,140
that structure.
Who knows,

345
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,033
you know,
over what period of time it might be 15 

346
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,040
years or something like that.
And you've been practicing building that

347
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,760
structure and it's a huge part of your 
identity because someone might say,

348
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,400
well what are you even,
and you'd say a student,

349
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,170
you know,
they might say,

350
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,910
what do you do?
But they could easily say,

351
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,470
what are you,
I'm a student.

352
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,453
While if you're not a student,
at least in so far as you deserve to 

353
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,730
find student,
then just exactly what are you

354
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,383
all right.

355
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,540
So nature,
you know,

356
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,960
when he packed a lot of information into
a sentence or a paragraph,

357
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,630
you have to be very careful reading him.
And young is like this too,

358
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:10,464
because he'll throw some information if 
you that's packed into a paragraph and 

359
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:17,550
it'll be the kind of information that 
disrupts high level structures.

360
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,050
You won't even notice it.
But that,

361
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,060
and it's because he's so subversive and 
he,

362
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,550
he wanted to do that.
It was an aim of his,

363
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,563
he had his reasons to do it.
He would say that you have to be broken 

364
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:29,970
down to nothing before you can be 
rebuilt.

365
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:31,770
So it's like a trip to the underworld 
thing.

366
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,873
So,
and I suppose in many ways that's what 

367
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,450
philosophy is.
You know,

368
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,231
it's,
it's,

369
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,064
you don't learn a new principal without 
allowing old principles to disappear 

370
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,740
because you can't have the new principal
and the old principal at the same time.

371
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,793
So almost always any radical learning 
involves the destruction of old habits 

372
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,970
and of action and perception.
And that's,

373
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:56,860
that's a kind of death.
Like it's a,

374
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,220
it's a,
it's an abstract death,

375
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,250
you know,
but that doesn't make it not painful.

376
00:21:03,251 --> 00:21:04,084
And the thing is,
if the abstract death is of sufficient 

377
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,084
intensity,
it can drive people to suicide because 

378
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,780
they regard killing themselves as easier
than making the reparation,

379
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:14,614
you know,
facing the anxiety and the suffering 

380
00:21:16,631 --> 00:21:17,464
and,
and going through the intolerably 

381
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:19,984
difficult task of retooling.
They may well regard that as more 

382
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:26,680
emotionally threatening then death.
And so,

383
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,090
and that,
that's not that rare.

384
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,240
I mean suicide is rare,
but it's not that rare.

385
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,613
So you know,
and it's certainly a behavior that 

386
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:34,804
everyone is,
I suspect everyone here has known 

387
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,930
someone who was touched by suicide in 
some way.

388
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,793
You know,
it might not be your family member or 

389
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:46,240
even your extended family member,
but the probability that you know,

390
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:49,150
someone who knows someone who committed 
suicide is extremely,

391
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,590
extremely likely.

392
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,670
So Nietzsche is a very dangerous,
dangerous thinker.

393
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,543
I'm the only person I know who kind of 
approaches him in that regard is young 

394
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:04,321
and young is actually less troublesome 
because a lot of what Dostoyevsky offers

395
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,300
is,
is destruction.

396
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,540
It's intelligent,
brilliant destruction,

397
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,374
but he doesn't really offer a solution.
He sort of sketches out the 

398
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:15,784
possibilities of a solution.
And he died young and then in many ways 

399
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:19,894
what happened was that young picked up 
where [inaudible] left off and tried to 

400
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,370
solve the problems that need your left 
unsolved.

401
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:28,810
So it was nature for example,
in some sense along with Dostoyevsky who

402
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:33,730
really definitively announced the death 
of God at the end of the 19th century.

403
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:34,564
In that left people in some ways bereft 
of belief and we're going to talk about 

404
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:41,920
why that's so important in a moment.
What union was doing was trying to,

405
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,250
while he was trying to rescue the 
farther from the underworld in the sense

406
00:22:45,251 --> 00:22:46,084
he was trying,
he tried to go back to the religious 

407
00:22:47,591 --> 00:22:48,424
traditions that Nietzsche had had 
described as fatally anachronistic and 

408
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:55,240
demolished by the claims of science.

409
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,073
He attempted to go back to those 
religious traditions and reassess them 

410
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,184
from a psychological perspective to pull
back the necessary meaning that was 

411
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,714
embedded in them so that people could 
reunite with their culture and and in 

412
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:08,794
principle not be so prone to 
pathological belief systems like 

413
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:15,100
ideology that tend to rush in where 
there's a gap.

414
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,840
You know when he just said very clearly 
and Dostoyevsky knew this as well by the

415
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:23,890
end of the 19th century,
is that that the death of God would mean

416
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:24,724
that people would turn on mosques to 
rationalistic ideologies and that would 

417
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:29,704
be murderous.
They knew that was coming and that's an 

418
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,390
amazing prediction.
It really is amazing prediction.

419
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,690
It just shows you how thoroughly they 
understood the structure.

420
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:38,763
Okay,
so I'm going to read you something by 

421
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,204
nature and then we're going to return to
the hierarchy so that you can kind of 

422
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,990
understand something deeper about the 
way the hierarchy is structured.

423
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,913
Okay?
Now he's talking about philosophical 

424
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:54,710
ideas here and he's actually talking 
about articulated efforts.

425
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,963
So one way that you might think about 
philosophy is that philosophers or 

426
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:00,344
originate articulated moral principles 
and that is often the way that people 

427
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:07,040
think about,
especially in moral philosophy.

428
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,070
It's like it's the philosophers who come
up with the ideas,

429
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,970
but that isn't what needs you believe.
Here's what he said in step.

430
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,163
Okay?

431
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,210
Separate philosophical ideas are not 
anything optional or a tournament.

432
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:23,494
So evolving.

433
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,580
They grow up in connection and 
relationship with each other.

434
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,640
However,
suddenly an arbitrarily,

435
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,190
they seem to appear in the history of 
thought.

436
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:38,460
They nevertheless belong just as much to
assist them as the collective members of

437
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:40,600
the fauna of a continent.
Okay.

438
00:24:40,601 --> 00:24:41,434
So it's a very interesting idea.
So the first idea that he's putting 

439
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:44,584
forward is that you could,
the best way to think about a 

440
00:24:47,711 --> 00:24:48,544
philosophical system,
say a philosophical system of ethics is 

441
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,323
as if it's different statements are 
animals related to one another in an 

442
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:57,934
ecosystem.
So he has a biological metaphor in some 

443
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:02,050
sense for,
for,

444
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,300
for the emergence of a philosophical 
system.

445
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,950
It's quite an interesting way of 
thinking,

446
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:06,784
of course.
And it makes sense because if a 

447
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:10,324
philosophical system of ethics,
which is a philosophical system that 

448
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,253
tells you how and why you should behave 
a certain way is about how you should 

449
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:20,680
act and you're a biological being,
then of course,

450
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:23,470
it only makes sense that the concepts 
themselves,

451
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:26,440
which are guides to actions,
can logically be,

452
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,720
uh,
considered,

453
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,760
uh,
biological entities.

454
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,653
They're abstracted biological entities,
but they still have the same nature as 

455
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,350
biological entities.
And that means according to Nietzsche,

456
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,460
that they're subject to the same rules.
Now,

457
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:42,850
this is the sort of place where he 
foreshadows floyd deeply,

458
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,343
so

459
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,393
nature says

460
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,380
they never last belong just as much to 
assist them as the collective members of

461
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:54,214
the forerunner of a continent.
This is betrayed in the end by the 

462
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,540
circumstance.
However,

463
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,374
unfailingly,
the most diverse philosophers always 

464
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:04,090
fill in.
Again,

465
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:09,091
a definite fundamental scheme of 
possible philosophies under an invisible

466
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:10,084
spell.
They always resolve once more in the 

467
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:14,260
same orbit,
however independent of each other,

468
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:17,530
they may feel themselves with their 
critical or systematic wheels.

469
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,120
Something within them leads them 
something impels them indefinite order,

470
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,983
the one after the other to wit the 
innate methodology in relationship of 

471
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,334
their ideas.
Their thinking is in fact far less a 

472
00:26:30,641 --> 00:26:32,130
discovery.
Then erect,

473
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,993
then a re recognizing or remembering a 
return and a homecoming to a far off 

474
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,133
ancient common household of the soul out
of which these ideas formerly group 

475
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,233
philosophizing so far,
it kind of activism of the highest 

476
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:47,400
order.
Okay,

477
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,280
so here,
here's the idea.

478
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,973
There's,
there's two fundamental ideas that are 

479
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,890
embedded in this which actually need you
differentiates.

480
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,783
All right,
I'm going to read you another section 

481
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,600
that illuminates the first one.

482
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,863
Gradually it became clear to me what 
every great philosophy up till now his 

483
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:25,174
consisted of namely the confession of 
its originator and a species of 

484
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:30,994
involuntary and unconscious 
autobiography and moreover that the 

485
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:35,614
moral or immoral purpose in every 
philosophy has constituted the true 

486
00:27:38,651 --> 00:27:41,710
vital germ out of which the entire plant
has always grown.

487
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:42,843
Okay,
so this is a very radical statement so 

488
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:45,034
because what needs you to saying is that
philosophy is even when they declared 

489
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:48,844
themselves a rational are deeply 
personal and they're also necessarily 

490
00:27:53,261 --> 00:27:58,261
embedded within a motivational structure
that is either pro life or anti life,

491
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,590
something like that.
So there's no value free philosophizing.

492
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:03,963
What there is is the expression of 
biologically and culturally conditioned 

493
00:28:07,391 --> 00:28:12,391
being which is conditioned by let's say 
the same sort of fundamental forces that

494
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:13,924
Freud described in the,
in the in the biological realm and then 

495
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:18,963
that's conditioned by the cultural 
processes that you just discussed in 

496
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:25,930
relationship to Pha and then what the 
philosopher does is observed that all of

497
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:27,400
those things are happening.

498
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,530
Allow that to be articulated and 
confused that with his own thought,

499
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,110
oh,
it's a brilliant idea.

500
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,780
Now here's a way of thinking about it.
Now,

501
00:28:37,781 --> 00:28:42,520
one of the things Piaget said was that 
once children start to play games,

502
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,354
when they're young collective games,
you can watch the children play the 

503
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,094
collective games,
like maybe eight kids are playing 

504
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:53,170
marbles or something like that.
And then you can take the young kids out

505
00:28:53,171 --> 00:28:56,080
of the game and you can ask them what 
the rules are.

506
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,183
And what'll happen is you'll get a 
diverse set I diverse and paradoxical 

507
00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:06,451
set of articulated rules.
And what that means is that the children

508
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,713
can play the game when they're in the 
game and we're in the or in the context 

509
00:29:10,451 --> 00:29:11,284
of all the other people.
Because in some sense the game is 

510
00:29:13,421 --> 00:29:17,350
embedded in pieces in all of them.
And as long as they're all there,

511
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,130
that all works.

512
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,963
But if you pull the child the way they 
don't have the intellectual wherewithal 

513
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,923
to do,
describe the patterns of behavior that 

514
00:29:25,091 --> 00:29:25,924
make up the game.
And that's only to say that they know 

515
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,670
things that they can't say.
Because you might say,

516
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:31,570
well,
the game,

517
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,110
the rules of the game come first and 
then the game emergence.

518
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,950
But that's wrong.
It's the game comes first and only after

519
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,950
that do the rules emerged.
And of course there's that,

520
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,063
you know,
there's a reciprocal relationship 

521
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:46,270
between them because once the rules are 
somewhat articulated,

522
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,610
then the game becomes more structured,
you know,

523
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,300
and,
and,

524
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,400
and the rules can become more structured
and so on.

525
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:52,234
So the articulation changes the rules.
What needs she is saying the same thing 

526
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:56,374
applies to societies.
You says like as in so far as you can 

527
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,174
consider society a collective game 
played by millions of people over vast 

528
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:07,450
spans of time.

529
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,430
It's a game of games in some sense.
And it emerged from the bottom up.

530
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:13,563
It emerged out of biological impulses 
and an interpersonal and social 

531
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,770
interactions,
conditioning and,

532
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,683
and,
and shaping everyone's behavior and 

533
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,243
perception.
And that happened way before anyone 

534
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,354
could articulate what those rules were.
Now you remember when nature was 

535
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,024
writing,
there was no real sense of how old the 

536
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:39,000
earth was or how will the universe was.
I mean,

537
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,843
people thought,
even the radical people talk thought 

538
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,140
maybe in terms of hundreds of thousands 
of years,

539
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,403
you know,
and now we know that the universe is 14 

540
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,063
billion years old and that the earth is 
4 billion years old and that life has 

541
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:54,910
been plentiful on the earth for 3.5 
billion years.

542
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,773
You know,
so that the historical context within 

543
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,560
which we've originated has expanded,
uh,

544
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,613
by,
by orders of magnitude since the last 

545
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,750
19th century.
And so then what you think that means is

546
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,584
that the way that our games have been 
organized stretches impossibly back in 

547
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:14,980
time.

548
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,270
Now,
I already told you,

549
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,920
I believe the story about lobster 
dominant is higher,

550
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,953
right?
So even lobsters that's 400 million 

551
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:22,894
years ago,
lobsters arrayed themselves in a social 

552
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:25,954
space and they regulate each other.
And that means the lobsters essentially 

553
00:31:29,411 --> 00:31:32,230
have a lobster society.
And you know,

554
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:37,260
each lobster has biological pre 
dispositions that are quite determined.

555
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,170
There are quite,
uh,

556
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,670
the lobster is quite a deterministic 
creature.

557
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,803
But nonetheless,
the way that those biological 

558
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:45,994
predispositions manifest themselves is 
conditioned and shaped by the social 

559
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,390
surrounding.
And so you think,

560
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:55,960
well,
lobsters start to play games 400 million

561
00:31:55,961 --> 00:31:57,250
years ago.
And you know,

562
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:02,170
as we've taken the tremendously long 
evolutionary journey across that time,

563
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
we'd be playing social games the whole 
time.

564
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,570
And that means that the way that we 
interact with,

565
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,483
with each other has evolved and it's 
even shaped the way our bioenergy 

566
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,830
manifests itself because that's how 
we'll culturally,

567
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,200
and then out of that as we became more 
capable of abstraction.

568
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,810
And maybe that's,
you know,

569
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:26,010
that's something that really took off 
probably 7 million years ago.

570
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:29,470
And with modern human beings emerging 
about 150,000 years ago,

571
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:32,440
cause we,
we separated from the common ancestor of

572
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:35,320
peep of human beings in chimpanzees 
about 7 million years ago.

573
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,710
You can tell that by doing analysis of 
genetic differences.

574
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,913
So the brain expanded very rapidly after
that point and our culture became more 

575
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,594
and more conscious and articulated then 
complex and larger and more 

576
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,550
technological,
you know,

577
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,384
so it became in some ways more dependent
on social norms and less dependent on 

578
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:57,290
deterministic biological 
predispositions.

579
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,320
But we've still been doing that for a 
very long time.

580
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,390
There's,
there's good evidence that,

581
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,950
um,
you know,

582
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,590
we started using fire about 2 million 
years ago when,

583
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,110
uh,
forgive me if I told you this already,

584
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:11,170
but you know,
if you look at a human being and you,

585
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,033
and you look at a champion z,
there's a bunch of things you see that 

586
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:15,800
are very different morphologically.

587
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,260
Uh,
the chip is much shorter,

588
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,770
much,
much wider and way more powerful.

589
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,690
So like a normal mail champ is about six
times as strong as the strongest Olympic

590
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:29,420
athlete.
So don't mess with chimps.

591
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,010
They'll tear you apart.
They're really,

592
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,290
really strong and dangerous.
So,

593
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,990
but the chimp has shaped sort of like 
this,

594
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,483
you know,
they have a huge gastrointestinal 

595
00:33:39,621 --> 00:33:40,820
system,
roughly speaking.

596
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:43,640
And the reason for that is mostly what 
they eat is leaves and leaves,

597
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,474
have no color of content.
And so they have to eat immense numbers 

598
00:33:47,631 --> 00:33:51,620
of leaves and leaves are hard to digest,
so they have to choose them like mad.

599
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:52,454
So the typical chimps sits around eight 
hours a day chewing and then they have 

600
00:33:56,151 --> 00:33:56,984
this tremendously long gastrointestinal 
system because it takes that long to 

601
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:03,620
extract any nutrients out of out of 
leaves.

602
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:04,454
While we circumvented that man,
as soon as we invented fire and fire 

603
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:12,860
allowed us to outsource our digestion 
because if you cook most things,

604
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:15,230
vegetables,
but more importantly meet,

605
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:19,450
if you cook them,
they become much more bioavailable and,

606
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,830
and it takes much less energy to digest 
them.

607
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,560
So that way you can shrink your gut and 
grow your brain.

608
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,370
And so that's apparently what we did 
because here we are,

609
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,383
you know,
relatively slim at least compared to 

610
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,083
chimpanzees.
And so fire popped up 2 million years 

611
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,590
ago.
It's a real cultural revolution.

612
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,453
But you know,
that's so old that culture revolution 

613
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,733
content completely reshaped our bodies.
And so this interplay between biology 

614
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:45,674
and cultures can you going on for an 
unimaginably long period of time and it 

615
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:54,251
conditions everything we do.
Now here's a complicated idea.

616
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,260
Okay,
so imagine a wolf pack.

617
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,610
Now Wolf pack is a pretty calm,
complicated social group.

618
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,500
It's a fair bit like a primordial human 
group,

619
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:22,970
which is why dogs have been with us for 
25,000 years.

620
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,500
Maybe they were wolves that first 
started to follow us around and scavenge

621
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,290
or more likely,
I think someone went out some primordial

622
00:35:30,291 --> 00:35:31,820
hunter,
went out hunting,

623
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,013
killed a wolf female,
found the pops and brought one home for 

624
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:40,260
the children to play with,
you know,

625
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,660
and that was the origin,
the origin of the dog.

626
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,090
I think it was something like that.
Cause dorms are basically,

627
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,120
they're basically genetically identical 
with wolves.

628
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,283
Now the thing is is we can get along 
with dogs and the reason we can get 

629
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:55,140
lauren with dogs,
because dogs have a social organization,

630
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,363
you could call it a dominance hierarchy.
That's a fair bit like the human social 

631
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:00,180
organization.

632
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,340
And so you can see that part of what it 
means to be human is the same thing that

633
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:08,700
it means to be a pack animal,
like a dog or a pack animal.

634
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:11,910
Like our domesticated down flight 
courses and the cows for example,

635
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,460
which we can domesticate partly because 
their social.

636
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:15,803
So some of the structure of our social 
organization is the same sort of 

637
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:21,930
structure that an animal dominance 
hierarchy has,

638
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,150
like a chimpanzee dominance hierarchy,
for example.

639
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,810
And so we know that chimpanzees and 
other primates,

640
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,644
monkeys for example,
are acutely aware of the levels of 

641
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:34,620
hierarchy in their social structure.
And there are,

642
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,350
I think it's vervet monkeys.
This is a very funny experiment.

643
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:41,850
So imagine that the talk vervet monkeys 
are like celebrity monkeys,

644
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:44,490
you know,
and the bottom vervet monkeys are like,

645
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,320
you know,
dissolute street people.

646
00:36:46,321 --> 00:36:47,154
And so then you take some pictures of 
dissolute street people who are just at 

647
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,444
the bottom of the hierarchy and you take
some pictures of celebrities and you 

648
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:57,330
show pictures to a human audience and 
the human audience,

649
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,370
we'll look at the celebrities longer.

650
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,563
Well,
if you take the vervet monkeys and you 

651
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:02,214
take photographs of the top ranking 
vervet monkeys and the bottom vervet 

652
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,660
monkeys and you showed them to vervet 
monkeys,

653
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,420
then the vervet monkeys will look at the
top Reiki Verdun,

654
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,283
vervet monkey photographs more than the 
bottom ranking vervet monkey 

655
00:37:12,901 --> 00:37:16,620
photographs.
So in some sense there transfixed by the

656
00:37:16,621 --> 00:37:19,530
individuals who are higher up in the in 
the social order.

657
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,940
And that makes sense,
right?

658
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:21,774
Because what you should feel,
especially in a fairly aggressive 

659
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,230
dominance hierarchy,
what you should feel,

660
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,260
the closer you are to the bottom of the 
dominance hierarchy,

661
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,573
the closer what you should feel for 
whatever's at the top of the dominance 

662
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,230
hierarchy.
That should be,

663
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:42,330
it should be closer and closer to all.
Now when people feel off,

664
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,150
they get chills running up and down 
their back,

665
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,931
their neck.
Well,

666
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,764
why?
The reason that happens is because it's 

667
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:49,020
an,
it's an,

668
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,040
it's an activism.

669
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:50,873
It's a hangover from the time that when 
you were threatened by something awe 

670
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,104
inspiring,
let's say a snake or a banner or 

671
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:58,560
something like that,
your hair,

672
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,483
your for would stand up.
And the reason for that is so that you 

673
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,160
look bigger and you still see this 
happening all the time with cats,

674
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,820
right to capsule.
Normally cat's face each other this way,

675
00:38:08,821 --> 00:38:10,740
right?
But if they start to fight,

676
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:11,574
they turned sideways and that,
so they each look bigger than they puff 

677
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:14,784
up their fur and their tail.
And that's to show the other cat that 

678
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:19,770
they're really a lot bigger than the cat
first thought.

679
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:22,770
Now of course they're both doing that,
so it's a little bit pointless,

680
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:25,440
but they're just cat.
So you know you can give them a break.

681
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,573
But the point is,
is that they pile over erect and that's 

682
00:38:29,431 --> 00:38:30,630
the same thing that happens.

683
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,463
For example,
when you're listening to very powerful 

684
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:35,470
music and it deeply affects you and you 
get chills.

685
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,304
It's like the hair stands up on the back
of your neck and that's a signaling of 

686
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:39,934
all.
Now the reason you should feel odd to 

687
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,694
award something that's higher up in the 
dominick's heart he is because that 

688
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:47,960
thing has power,
like is there,

689
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,823
well,
there's more than one reason a that 

690
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:50,794
thing has power.
You better be careful of it because it 

691
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,284
will put you in your place and fast.
And part of the reason the dominance 

692
00:38:55,961 --> 00:39:00,961
hierarchy exists is so that everybody 
knows their place and they don't have to

693
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:05,320
be reminded of it by being half killed 
on a regular basis.

694
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,650
You know?
So maybe your nine on a scale of one,

695
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,670
one being the top,
maybe your number nine it's not so good,

696
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,720
but number nine and not hurting is a lot
better than number nine in line.

697
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,553
They're bleeding on the ground.
And so what happens with dominance 

698
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:23,740
hierarchies is they usually arrange 
themselves in part by power.

699
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:24,574
But by no means only in power.
Everybody knows where they are and 

700
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:28,474
pretty much everybody stays there and 
not even happens over multiple 

701
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,240
generations.
Same in complex primate dominance.

702
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:37,950
Troops status is heritable.
So,

703
00:39:37,951 --> 00:39:38,784
and you know that there's not much of a 
leap between that inheritable bonnet 

704
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:43,330
peace among human beings.
It's a reflection of,

705
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,403
you know,
it's much more complex among human 

706
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:48,010
beings because it's articulated and 
structure.

707
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:51,370
But it's the same basic thing.
Now,

708
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Nietzsche's point was so now imagine,
now here's another problem.

709
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,720
So
imagine that.

710
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,273
Okay.

711
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,340
Okay,
so you've got a garment,

712
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:13,350
it's art and it's fairly stable and one 
of the things you want to do is climb to

713
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:16,700
the top of the dominant Turkey.
And the reason you want to do that,

714
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:19,520
there's all sorts of reasons.
High quality mates.

715
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,310
That's the primary reason that's 
particular true in humans.

716
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,230
If you're male,
because males are much more differential

717
00:40:27,231 --> 00:40:28,064
reproducers that females,
which means a lot of males fail to 

718
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:33,500
reproduce completely and some reproduce 
a lot.

719
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:37,070
Where's the typical woman reproduces at 
least some.

720
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,890
So that means competition is more 
intense among men.

721
00:40:39,891 --> 00:40:40,724
And that's part of the reason why 
dominance hierarchies tend to be tilted 

722
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,070
towards male power because competition 
means more to them.

723
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,023
The outcome is more crucial.
So now part of what happens is that as 

724
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:54,020
people compete within the dominance 
hierarchy,

725
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,200
what they're doing is to try to figure 
out who it is that is fit to be on top.

726
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,960
Now you might think that that's a matter
of power,

727
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,700
you know,
in fact your basic social left,

728
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:09,534
the social constructionists would have 
you believe that that was all there is 

729
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:14,630
to it,
is that the whole dominance hierarchy is

730
00:41:14,631 --> 00:41:15,464
nothing but a power system.
And the people on top are there because 

731
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:21,440
they have power and what's there is 
power.

732
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:25,190
And by that they need the ability to 
enforce their will on other people.

733
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,420
While that's a,
that's a dopey theory and the reason for

734
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:31,670
that is,
is that if unit dimensional,

735
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,170
you know,
we,

736
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,003
that people are multifaceted,
there's no single motivation that's 

737
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:38,300
cake.
You know,

738
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,134
for Freud it was saks and aggression and
like if you're going to come up with a 

739
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:44,150
couple of potent candidates,
those are two.

740
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:48,110
But there's lots of other ones.
People are playful and play as a primary

741
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:50,090
biological circuit.
You know,

742
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,190
we suffer,
we're hungry,

743
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:54,170
we're thirsty,
we're affiliative.

744
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,000
Like there's a lot of biological 
necessity

745
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,393
driving the makeup of our personalities.
And there were biological 

746
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,980
subpersonalities to arbitrarily call one
of them.

747
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,640
The source of something as complex as 
social organization is,

748
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,600
it's,
it's,

749
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,830
it's,
it's a,

750
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:17,090
it's a false form of monotheism.
It's a crazy idea.

751
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,043
And it's,
it's the kind of idea that only people 

752
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:22,340
who really don't like to think would 
have.

753
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,610
Because once you come up with that idea,
it's all power.

754
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,730
You don't have to think anymore.
Someone can say to you,

755
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:29,564
well,
why is complex phenomena x the way it 

756
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:32,894
is?
Why is the economy arranged the way it 

757
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:35,031
is?
Well,

758
00:42:35,031 --> 00:42:37,940
it's so that the people at the top can 
maintain their power.

759
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,500
Well,
yeah,

760
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,873
sure.
But maybe that accounts for 10% of the 

761
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,144
reason it doesn't get close to 100%.
There's lots of reasons why hierarchies 

762
00:42:49,971 --> 00:42:54,530
are structured the way they are and 
sheer physical force is one of them,

763
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:56,390
but it's,
it's unstable.

764
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,090
So,
so Frans de Waal,

765
00:42:59,091 --> 00:42:59,924
who was watching chimps organize their 
dominance hierarchies in the art of Zoo 

766
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,364
in Holland,
noted quite quickly that it was fairly 

767
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,550
typical or recent possible for the 
meanest,

768
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:11,384
ugliest,
strongest mail chimp to be the dominant 

769
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:15,014
guide.
Sometimes it was the chimp who learned 

770
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:17,444
to pick up a garbage cabin who act the 
hell out of it with this stick because 

771
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,460
that intimidated his enemies.
You know?

772
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:23,294
So it's uh,
it's a bit of create three creativity 

773
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:25,940
there.
But what,

774
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,283
but what the wall found was that the 
stable hierarchies were never run by 

775
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:31,094
barbarian chimp dictators.
And the reason for that was that 

776
00:43:34,221 --> 00:43:36,500
coalitions of other males would take 
them out.

777
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,450
And it's because you know,
you think,

778
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,150
well if you're,
if you're one antisocial,

779
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:44,810
aggressive male in your tough,
it's like okay,

780
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:45,644
here are tough.
But three lesser friendlier males who 

781
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:54,881
are bound together in friendship pact 
which chimpanzees form quite intensely.

782
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,300
It's like as soon as that guy turns his 
back or it has a bad day or gets hurt,

783
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,430
they're going to jump in there and tear 
him to pieces.

784
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:05,870
And that's exactly what happened.
So what below found was that the stabler

785
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:06,763
chimpanzee dominance hierarchies were 
run usually by males who are affiliate 

786
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:15,130
of end gregarious who remembered their 
social obligations.

787
00:44:15,131 --> 00:44:17,870
So that meant with,
with regards to their friendship network

788
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,850
and who are also very good to the 
females and the infants in the true,

789
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,713
even if they weren't his.
And the idea there is that power is an 

790
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,350
unstable basis for the maintenance of a 
dominance hierarchy across time.

791
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,790
Because some sense,
even among chimps,

792
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,050
you have to have the consent of the 
governed because you'll get a revolution

793
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,884
otherwise.
And so you know you're going to get a 

794
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,134
revolution if you put people in or 
animals in a situation where they have 

795
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,760
nothing to lose.

796
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:50,090
And so what that means is there are 
constraints on how you can act well.

797
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,250
You try to move up the dominance 
hierarchy system.

798
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,084
Cause if you're too aggressive and 
selfish and you're not grooming anyone 

799
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:00,570
else and you're not communicating with 
the other creatures in the truth,

800
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,050
they're going to gang up on you and take
you down.

801
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,110
And so if you're going to maneuver your 
way up the truth,

802
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,333
you have to be do it in a manner that 
civilized enough so that you don't get 

803
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:16,050
everyone against you.
And so what it means is that to maneuver

804
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:19,560
up a power hierarchy,
especially a complex power art creek,

805
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,000
you have to be a lot more than powerful.
So,

806
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,470
okay,
now,

807
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,260
so now we've got this idea that there 
are principles governing the movement of

808
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,620
peep of creatures up a dominant tart 
even among the animals.

809
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,770
And one of the defining characteristics 
of the,

810
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:39,963
that that one of the characteristics 
that necessity makes the limit that 

811
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,534
process is that over time the troop 
can't let anybody climb the dominance 

812
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:53,460
hierarchy who will destabilize the whole
dominance heart.

813
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,510
Cause then that's it game over.
So at the very least,

814
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:58,344
you have to learn how to climb up the 
hierarchy so that you don't destabilize 

815
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:04,950
it while you climb because otherwise you
get to the top and there's nothing left.

816
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,340
While an animals know this,
they know this instinctively.

817
00:46:08,341 --> 00:46:10,740
So for example,
when wolves go at it,

818
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:11,574
you know,
first they puff up and they grow with 

819
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,434
each other and they put up their 
shoulders and like they get more and 

820
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:18,660
more aggressive until attack is 
imminent.

821
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:21,990
And often one of them will back off with
there's no fighting,

822
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,910
no one gets damaged and the,
and so that's the typical situation.

823
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:28,220
It's like one says,
yeah,

824
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,901
okay,
you know,

825
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:29,400
I'm,
I'm,

826
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,130
I'm out of here.
And God only knows why that is.

827
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,240
Often I suspect the wolf with the higher
serotonin level wins because it has less

828
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,080
negative emotion.

829
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,310
And Sarah Donin levels go up as you move
up the dominants heart now.

830
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:43,770
And then they'll go into,
they'll actually have a fight,

831
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,720
but the fight usually doesn't last very 
long.

832
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,070
And then the loser will rollover throw 
which show its throat to the winter,

833
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:52,590
which is quite a behavior cause wolves 
tear the throats out of,

834
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,190
of of their prey and the top woolful 
back off.

835
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,653
And you know,
you think about that's unbelievably 

836
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:00,660
sophisticated morality.
You know,

837
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:01,494
there,
there's echos in there of the New 

838
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,613
Testament injunction to love your enemy 
because that's exactly what the wolf is 

839
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,820
doing.
And you know,

840
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,880
it doesn't know this because it can't 
articulate the rule,

841
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:12,863
but what it's doing is acting as if even
the thing that attacked you is valuable 

842
00:47:17,971 --> 00:47:20,370
in its own right.
If it's part of your truth.

843
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,310
And you know,
you can see there the,

844
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:23,941
the,
the,

845
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:27,630
the ancient biological origins of the 
idea of the,

846
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,500
you know,
of the,

847
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,060
of the equality and value of each 
individual.

848
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,580
So these things have deep,
deep,

849
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,530
deep roots.
They're not arbitrary,

850
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,930
they're not arbitrary and no one 
invented them.

851
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:39,970
And that's exactly what Nietzsche is 
saying here.

852
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:45,070
To understand how the abstruse 
metaphysical assertions of a philosopher

853
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,350
have been arrived at.
It is always well,

854
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:48,184
and why is to first ask oneself what 
morality do they or does he a mat 

855
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:54,663
accordingly.
I do not believe that an impulse to 

856
00:47:57,131 --> 00:47:57,964
knowledge is the father of philosophy,
but that another impulse here as 

857
00:48:01,091 --> 00:48:06,091
elsewhere has only made use of knowledge
and mistaken knowledge as an instrument.

858
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,343
But whoever considers the fundamental 
impulses of man with a view to 

859
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:12,784
determining how far they may have here 
acted as inspiring genie or as demons 

860
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,293
will find that they have all practiced 
philosophy at one time or another and 

861
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,680
then each of them would have only been 
two.

862
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:28,240
Glad to look upon itself as the ultimate
end of existence and the legitimate lord

863
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,370
of over all of the other impulses.

864
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,980
So what is he saying there?
Well,

865
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,520
you know,
it makes you,

866
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:36,730
makes this explicit in passages that are
related to this one.

867
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,593
He viewed the human being as a 
collection of sub souls and the sub 

868
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:42,634
souls who are grounded in their 
existence in Boston biological 

869
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:45,814
underpinnings.
And that was the case for every human 

870
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,424
being in that made us roughly similar.
It certainly made our groups roughly 

871
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:54,340
similar.
And so these,

872
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,203
each of these biological subsystems 
conceptualized as a sub soul was 

873
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:01,780
something that had its own viewpoint,
had its own rules,

874
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:05,680
it had its own games and they would,
they jockey for precedence.

875
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,813
Now you know that because sometimes 
you're sitting there reading and you're 

876
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,380
trying to concentrate on a higher order 
goal,

877
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:13,210
like completing your classes and you 
know,

878
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,220
some biologically determined subsystem 
pops up and says,

879
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,054
you know,
this would be an excellent time to go 

880
00:49:20,231 --> 00:49:21,064
have a coffee.

881
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:22,473
You know,
and you might do everything you can to 

882
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,050
not allow that thing to take over.
But often it does.

883
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:33,910
And often that's despite what you think 
you might actually want to do.

884
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:37,990
And then later you're all upset about it
because you've procrastinated yet again.

885
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,303
But you know,
nature viewed the psyche as a place you 

886
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:46,390
could almost think of yourself as a set 
of apps.

887
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,720
It's like your brain is a set of animals
and the animals are all dependent on one

888
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:53,704
another.
But each animal needs to be boss from 

889
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:56,644
time to time.
And each animal wants to be boss more 

890
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:02,560
often than it should be.
And then you know,

891
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:03,394
the higher order cortical systems are 
there to figure out how to sequence all 

892
00:50:07,121 --> 00:50:07,954
of these other animals so that they all 
get what they need without interfering 

893
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,394
with each other across large spans of 
time in the presence of many other 

894
00:50:16,301 --> 00:50:18,700
people in a manner that sustain.

895
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,920
That's what very,
very complicated.

896
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,413
Okay,
now,

897
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:28,050
so let's go back to the hierarch.
So you have the hierarchy and overtime.

898
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:33,290
Now remember this hierarchy stays there 
for a very long period of time.

899
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:34,453
And remember as well that the people who
climb to the top of the hierarchy are 

900
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:41,690
much more likely to leave offspring than
the people who don't.

901
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,273
And so then what that means is that the 
hierarchy in park is one of the primary 

902
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:48,584
selection forces operating on humanity.
And what that means is that we evolve 

903
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:58,361
towards the thing that can most 
successfully climb the dominance heart.

904
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,223
And so that means that we evolved 
towards the thing that has the best 

905
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:08,560
probability of ruling properly.
And that that's not just cultural,

906
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,910
it's cultural because it's the continual
interplay between cultural and biology.

907
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:18,740
Going back,
we'll say 400 million years or more.

908
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,061
Okay,
now,

909
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,070
but it's even more complicated than 
that.

910
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:26,420
And this is one of the things that you 
have to understand if you really want to

911
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:29,390
understand what needs you meant by the 
death of God.

912
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:31,550
So cause that's his most famous 
pronouncement.

913
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:32,413
God is dead and we have killed them and 
we'll never find enough water to wash 

914
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:38,120
away the blood now.
So he wasn't announcing that in triumph.

915
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,820
He was announcing it in terror.
Okay,

916
00:51:40,821 --> 00:51:45,620
now imagine this.
So as human society becomes more complex

917
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,603
and as our brains become larger and 
larger so that we could track larger 

918
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:54,140
social organizations and we can organize
more complex communities,

919
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,413
what happens is that here to,
for isolated tribes of people come 

920
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:04,730
together and then they have to engage in
conflict and negotiation.

921
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:09,800
And partly what they're in conflict 
about is what is the way that you should

922
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:10,634
act and what should the values be?
Now there's an old mythological idea 

923
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:20,000
that the gods fight in heaven to see who
is the dominant God.

924
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,240
While you can imagine all of these 
individual tribes,

925
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:28,510
they had their ideals and those were 
creatures of their imagination.

926
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,280
But those were imagined representations 
of proper behavioral patterns.

927
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,510
And they saw there was this transcendent
10 super ordinate.

928
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,833
And so then try bay would come into 
contact with tried b and the guards 

929
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:43,154
would clash and out of that and,
and all the death and destruction that 

930
00:52:47,181 --> 00:52:49,100
went with it,
the two tribes would integrate.

931
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:51,440
And maybe that would take hundreds of 
years.

932
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,960
And the religious system that sat above 
that,

933
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:56,810
which was the representation of the 
dominance hierarchy,

934
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,090
would also transform.
So you take,

935
00:52:59,091 --> 00:52:59,924
try bay and you take try b and then 
you'd take tried c and then you'd take 

936
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:06,800
tribe d and they all accumulate across 
time and,

937
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,813
and,
and sort out and articulate and 

938
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,354
represent all of their beliefs.
And what happens is that this tribe has 

939
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:18,950
a game and this tribe has a game in this
tribe has a game.

940
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:21,020
And then if you put all those games 
together,

941
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,430
they,
they tilt.

942
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:25,210
So that a metagame emerges out of it.
It's,

943
00:53:25,211 --> 00:53:27,150
it's like if,
if it's,

944
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:27,984
if it's fortunate,
the best of all three games gets put 

945
00:53:30,091 --> 00:53:30,924
together in a larger game and it has to 
be the best because otherwise it won't 

946
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:36,510
work.
The thing will fall apart.

947
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,970
Right?
Because if,

948
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,470
if,
if your family unit isn't functional,

949
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:42,630
it'll disperse,
you know,

950
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:44,490
and,
and maybe people will die because of it.

951
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:45,743
It has to have the,
it has to be iterative and it has to be 

952
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:52,860
playable across time without falling 
apart from internal pressure and without

953
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:54,450
getting white belts from the health 
side.

954
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:57,630
So it's very tightly constrained.
So then I,

955
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,120
let's say this happens over tens of 
thousands of years,

956
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:02,820
we could say what would happen in the 
Middle East because we know that it has,

957
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,950
Mesopotamia came together,
for example,

958
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:05,993
it was the aggregation of multiple 
tribes and all of the Gods of those 

959
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,410
tribes.

960
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,280
And we know the Mesopotamians organized 
all those gods into one God,

961
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,143
his name was Marduk.
And that the story that they tell about 

962
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,044
the aggregation of the gods into one is 
the story of the gods getting together 

963
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:26,870
and voting on which of them should be at
the top.

964
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:28,643
And then we know that the Mesopotamian 
emperor was charged with the 

965
00:54:32,581 --> 00:54:37,581
responsibility of acting out that top 
God and that that's what made him a good

966
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:39,354
emperor.
And he got reminded of that every year 

967
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:41,994
at the new year's ceremony.
He had to tell all the ways that he 

968
00:54:44,041 --> 00:54:47,520
hadn't been a good Marduk and then he'd 
get punished for it,

969
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:48,653
and then they would reenact the battle 
of the gods and recreate this martech 

970
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:52,530
character.
Okay,

971
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:53,364
so,
so you can understand how that might 

972
00:54:54,641 --> 00:54:55,474
have come about.
Now you could say that the idea of that 

973
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:02,070
emergent ideal,
that was not,

974
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,240
that wasn't rational.

975
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,750
It was the consequence of conflict and 
cooperation in,

976
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,670
in the real world across times.
The representations of that were,

977
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,893
you know,
we might think about them as narrative 

978
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:15,690
representations or if they're deep 
enough,

979
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:18,420
even as an anthology,
you can take about those as the,

980
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,050
as the soil from which religious 
presuppositions emerge.

981
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:23,483
And so what happens is that what you 
have at the top of the dominance 

982
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:27,504
hierarchy as your representation of the 
good person is no different in its 

983
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:33,954
totality.
Then the idea of the sovereign God that 

984
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:40,710
has emerged across thousands and 
thousands of years of human history.

985
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:41,843
So the whole structure has this thing at
the top and it's regarded in 

986
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:47,370
imagination,
has divine,

987
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:48,683
it's the consequence of the represent.
It's the consequence of the battle of 

988
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,394
representations of morality in 
imagination across thousands and 

989
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,143
thousands of years.
And that's a reflection of the actual 

990
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,010
conflict and restructuring of societies 
across all of that time.

991
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,850
So then you have this thing at the top.
So we could say in the West,

992
00:56:08,851 --> 00:56:09,684
in western Europe,
that thing at the top is Christ and 

993
00:56:11,851 --> 00:56:16,851
that's the dying and re re the dying and
the diamond revivified and hero.

994
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,733
And we talked about reasons for that.
That's the thing that can go to the 

995
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:22,800
underworld and then come back up.
Okay,

996
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:26,800
that's the top.
What happens when it disappears?

997
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,170
What will turns Dostoyevsky for that?

998
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:37,923
This is from notes from underground.
So this is someone who's in the 

999
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:43,840
underground and that's where you go when
your value systems collapse.

1000
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:46,600
I'm a sick man.
I'm a spiteful man.

1001
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:51,760
I'm an unattractive man.
I believe my liver is diseased.

1002
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,623
However,
I know nothing at all about my disease 

1003
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,560
and do not know for certain what ails 
me.

1004
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,830
I don't consult the doctor for it and 
never have.

1005
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:03,060
Although I have a respect for medicine 
than doctors you,

1006
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:03,913
sorry.
It's I'm extremely superstitious 

1007
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,290
sufficiently so to respect medicine.
Anyway,

1008
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,380
I am well educated enough not to be 
superstitious,

1009
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:13,360
but I am superstitious.
No,

1010
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:18,361
I refuse to consult a doctor from spike 
that you will probably not understand.

1011
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,370
Well,
I understand that though.

1012
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:25,960
Of course.
I can't explain who it is precisely that

1013
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:28,420
I'm more declining in this case,
by my spite.

1014
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,943
I'm perfectly well aware that I cannot 
pay out the doctors and extract revenge 

1015
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:35,320
by not consulting them.

1016
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,220
I know better than anyone that by all of
this I'm only injuring myself and no one

1017
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,390
else,
but still,

1018
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:43,150
if I don't consult a doctor,
it's from spike.

1019
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,523
My liver is bad.
Well let it get worse and he's a civil 

1020
00:57:48,671 --> 00:57:49,504
servant.
I low ranking civil servant and he's 

1021
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:56,110
retired because he got a little bit of 
inheritance.

1022
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:57,723
He says,
when petitioners used to come for 

1023
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:00,604
information to the table at which I sat,
I used to grind my teeth at them and I 

1024
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:09,610
felt intense enjoyment when I succeeded 
in making anybody unhappy.

1025
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:13,720
I almost always succeeded.
For the most part.

1026
00:58:13,721 --> 00:58:17,020
They were all timid people.
Of course they were petitioners,

1027
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,880
but you know,
gentleman,

1028
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:22,810
what was the chief point about my spite?
Well,

1029
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,390
the whole point,
the real standard,

1030
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:26,273
lay it in the fact that continually,
even in the moment of the acutest 

1031
00:58:29,261 --> 00:58:32,740
spleen,
I was inwardly conscious with shame that

1032
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:33,574
I was not only not spiteful,
but not even embittered and that I was 

1033
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:41,200
simply scaring sparrows at random and 
amusing myself by it.

1034
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,840
I was lying when I just said,
now that I was a spiteful officials,

1035
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,793
I was lying from spike.
I was simply amusing myself with the 

1036
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:54,940
petitioners and with the officer and in 
reality I never could become spiteful.

1037
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,710
I was conscious every moment in myself 
of many very many elements,

1038
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:00,573
absolutely opposite to that.
I felt them positively swarming in me 

1039
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,140
these opposite elements.
I knew that they had been swarming in me

1040
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,810
my whole life and craving some outlet 
for me,

1041
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,460
but I would not let them out,
would not let them purposefully,

1042
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,200
purposefully would not let them out.
They tormented me until I was ashamed.

1043
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:25,070
They drove me to convulsions and sick 
and be at last at last.

1044
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:25,904
How are they sick of me now?
You're not fancying gentleman that I am 

1045
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,500
expressing remorse for something.
Now that I'm asking your forgiveness for

1046
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:34,334
something,
I'm sure you're fancying that however I 

1047
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:38,144
assure you I do not care if you are.
It was not only that I could not become 

1048
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:46,160
spiteful.
I did not know how to become anything,

1049
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,900
neither spiteful nor kind.
Neither a rascal nor an honest man,

1050
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,770
neither hero nor an insect.
Now I'm living my life out in my corner,

1051
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:58,674
taunting myself with the spike bliss and
useless constellation that an 

1052
01:00:02,191 --> 01:00:03,024
intelligent man can not become anything 
seriously and it's only the fool who 

1053
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:08,010
becomes anything.

1054
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,220
A direct person I regard as the real 
normal man

1055
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:24,650
as his tender mother nature wish to see 
him when she graciously brought him into

1056
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:25,484
being on the earth.
I envy such a man til I'm green in the 

1057
01:00:28,761 --> 01:00:30,680
face.
He's stupid.

1058
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,203
I'm not disputing that.
But perhaps the normal man should be 

1059
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:35,020
stupid.
How do,

1060
01:00:35,020 --> 01:00:38,390
how do you know?
Perhaps it's very beautiful in fact,

1061
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,020
and I am the more persuaded of that 
suspicion,

1062
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,213
if one can call it.
So by the fact that you take for 

1063
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:45,734
instance the antithesis of the normal 
man that is the man of acute 

1064
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,970
selfconsciousness who has come,
of course not out of the lap of nature,

1065
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,960
but out of a retort.
This,

1066
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:55,794
this is also almost mysticism gentlemen.
But I suspect this to this retort made 

1067
01:01:00,171 --> 01:01:03,920
man is sometimes so nonplussed in the 
presence of his intense assists,

1068
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,940
the normal man that with all his 
exaggerated selfconsciousness,

1069
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,570
he genuinely thinks of itself a mouse 
and not a man at all.

1070
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,980
It may be an acutely conscious miles,
yet it is a mouse.

1071
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:17,143
Well,
the other is a man and therefore et 

1072
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:20,450
Cetera,
et cetera.

1073
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:23,960
And the worst of it is he himself,
his very own self,

1074
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:27,980
looks on himself as a mouse.
No one asks him to do so.

1075
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:30,830
And that's an important point.
Now,

1076
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:31,664
let us look at this mouse in action.
Let us suppose for existence for 

1077
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:40,340
instance,
that feels insulted and it almost always

1078
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:43,790
feels insulted and it wants to revenge 
itself too.

1079
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,840
There may even be a greater of a 
cumulation of spite in it.

1080
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:48,913
Then in the man of nature and truth,
the base and nasty desire to vent that 

1081
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:54,374
spite on it's a sale.
It rankles perhaps even more nastily in 

1082
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:02,291
it than in the man of nature and truth 
for through his innate stupidity,

1083
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,930
the ladder,
the normal man looks upon his revenge is

1084
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,520
justice,
pure and simple.

1085
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:10,880
Well in consequences,
his acute self consciousness,

1086
01:02:10,881 --> 01:02:11,714
the mouse does not believe in any 
justice at all to come at last to the 

1087
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,570
deed itself,
to the very act of revenge.

1088
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,630
Apart from one the one fundamental 
nastiness,

1089
01:02:21,631 --> 01:02:23,910
the luck with smiles succeeds in 
creating around it.

1090
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:24,893
So many other nastiness is in the form 
of doubts and questions adds to the one 

1091
01:02:28,891 --> 01:02:29,724
question.
So many unsettled questions that there 

1092
01:02:31,891 --> 01:02:34,410
are inevitably works around it,
up around it,

1093
01:02:34,411 --> 01:02:38,880
a sort of fatal brew,
a stinking mess made up of it's doubts,

1094
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:39,714
emotions and of the contempt spat upon 
it by the direct men of action who 

1095
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:48,180
stands solemnly about it as judges and 
arbitrators laughing at it until they're

1096
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:49,014
healthy sides eight of course,
the only thing left forward is to 

1097
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:54,234
dismiss all that with a wave of it's 
Paul and with a smile of assumed 

1098
01:02:57,961 --> 01:02:58,794
contempt in which it does not even 
itself believe and creep ignominiously 

1099
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,200
into its mousehole.

1100
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,910
There in its nasty,
stinking underground home are insulted,

1101
01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:13,920
crushed and ridiculed.
Mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold,

1102
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:14,963
malignant and above all everlasting 
spite for 40 years together it will 

1103
01:03:21,181 --> 01:03:22,014
remember it's injury down to the 
smallest most ignominious details and 

1104
01:03:26,071 --> 01:03:28,240
every time we'll add,
I've itself detailed,

1105
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:32,490
still more in ignominious,
spitefully teasing and tormenting itself

1106
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:37,730
with its own imagination.
It will be ashamed of it's imaginings,

1107
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,920
yet it will recall it all.
It would go over and over every detail.

1108
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,470
It will invent unheard of things against
itself,

1109
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,550
pretending that those things might have 
happened and will forgive nothing.

1110
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,050
Maybe it will begin to revenge itself 
too.

1111
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,183
But as it were piecemeal in trivial ways
from behind the stove incognito without 

1112
01:03:59,101 --> 01:03:59,934
believing either in its own right to 
vengeance or in the success of its 

1113
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:03,684
revenge,
knowing that from all its efforts at 

1114
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:08,280
revenge,
it will suffer a hundred times more than

1115
01:04:08,281 --> 01:04:11,490
he on whom it revenge is itself.
While he,

1116
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:16,260
I daresay we'll not even scratch if self
on its deathbed,

1117
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:21,320
it will recall it all over again with 
interest accumulated over all the years

1118
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:38,963
now
the idea that needs your dog's Kioski 

1119
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:43,950
were developing was that

1120
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:51,350
the dawning consciousness in western 
society of the mythological substructure

1121
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:00,770
of the value system and the 
impossibility of conceptualizing that or

1122
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,613
proving the validity of it's structured 
from scientific means doomed it to doom 

1123
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,780
the people who were encapsulated in that
system to formal disbelief in it.

1124
01:05:16,890 --> 01:05:21,890
And what they concluded from that was 
exactly what dos Dsd just described,

1125
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,283
which is that someone with that level of
acute self consciousness and cultural 

1126
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:31,840
self knowledge would immediately come,
become fragmented to beyond belief,

1127
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:34,450
unable to act,
unhappy,

1128
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,523
resentful and dangerous.
And both the Osteus in nature and in 

1129
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:40,864
their works.
And Dostoyevsky develop this idea most 

1130
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:43,534
particularly in a novel called the 
Devil's said that once that you had got 

1131
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:47,614
to that point,
which was inevitable if you were smart 

1132
01:05:49,961 --> 01:05:52,210
enough to take seriously what was going 
on,

1133
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,373
it was only a tiny step to 
identification with a murderous 

1134
01:05:55,961 --> 01:05:56,794
ideology.

1135
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:00,680
Okay.

1136
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,513
Now,
some of the existentialists started to 

1137
01:06:03,891 --> 01:06:07,790
work up what you might regard as a 
solution to this problem

1138
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,780
and I'm going to read,

1139
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:16,773
okay,

1140
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:17,840
character guards

1141
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:20,603
solution.

1142
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:33,960
It is no cure.
Character Guard was a Danish existential

1143
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:38,961
philosopher and he lived earlier than 
nature and he was in some sense,

1144
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:44,010
you might think about him as the first 
modern psychologist he was.

1145
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,900
He was the first person to 
conceptualize,

1146
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:46,734
for example,
of the separate entity of anxiety and 

1147
01:06:49,681 --> 01:06:50,514
despair.
It is now about four years ago that I 

1148
01:06:54,921 --> 01:06:57,320
got the notion of wanting to try my luck
as an author.

1149
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,500
I remember it quite clearly.
It was on a Sunday.

1150
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:05,950
Yes,
that's it.

1151
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,783
This Sunday afternoon I was seated as 
usual out of doors at the cafe in the 

1152
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:12,533
Fredericksburg Garden.

1153
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,230
I'd been a student for half a score of 
years,

1154
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,180
although never lazy.
All my activity.

1155
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:20,400
Nevertheless was like a glittering 
inactivity,

1156
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:21,633
a kind of occupation for which I still 
have a great partiality and for which I 

1157
01:07:24,571 --> 01:07:25,404
perhaps even have a little genius.
I read much spent the remainder of the 

1158
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:32,520
day idling and thanking or or thinking 
and idling.

1159
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:33,773
But that was all it came to soy.
I sat there and smoke my cigar until I 

1160
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:39,840
lapsed into thought among other 
thoughts.

1161
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,860
I remember these
you are going on.

1162
01:07:43,861 --> 01:07:47,190
I said to myself to become an old man 
without being anything in,

1163
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:49,080
without really undertaking to do 
anything.

1164
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:54,060
On the other hand,
wherever you look around you in life and

1165
01:07:54,061 --> 01:07:54,894
in literature,
you see the celebrated names and 

1166
01:07:56,101 --> 01:07:56,934
figures,
the precious and much heralded men who 

1167
01:07:58,981 --> 01:07:59,814
were coming into prominence and who are 
much talked about the many benefactors 

1168
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:04,074
of the age,
who know how to benefit mankind by 

1169
01:08:06,181 --> 01:08:07,680
making life easier and easier.

1170
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:11,250
Some by railways,
others by omnibuses and steamboats,

1171
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:15,270
others by telegraph,
others by easily apprehended compendiums

1172
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,330
and shortly cycles of everything worth 
knowing.

1173
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,213
And finally the true benefactors of the 
age who make spiritual existence easier 

1174
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:25,460
and easier,
yet more and more significant.

1175
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,660
And what are you doing here?
Am I soloed?

1176
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:29,494
Khoi was interrupted for my cigar,
was smoke gout and a new one had to be 

1177
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:36,620
lit so I smoked again and then suddenly 
this thought flashed through my mind.

1178
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,053
You must do something,
but in as much with your limited 

1179
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:41,984
capacities,
it will be impossible to make anything 

1180
01:08:43,521 --> 01:08:44,354
easier than it has become.
You must with the same humanitarian 

1181
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:52,700
enthusiasm as the others undertake to 
make something harder.

1182
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,000
This notion please be immensely and at 
the same time,

1183
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:56,834
it flattered me to think that I like the
rest of them would be lovely and 

1184
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:01,370
esteemed by the whole community.

1185
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:03,590
Okay?

1186
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:06,200
For when all combined in every way to 
make everything easier,

1187
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,183
there remains only one possible danger,
namely that the ease become so great 

1188
01:09:12,501 --> 01:09:13,334
that it becomes altogether too great.
Then there is only one want left though 

1189
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:17,684
it is not yet felt want when people will
want difficulty out of love for mankind 

1190
01:09:22,511 --> 01:09:24,830
and out of disparate my embarrassing 
situation,

1191
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,843
seeing that I had accomplished nothing 
and was unable to make anything easier 

1192
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:33,911
than it already was,
and moved by a genuine interest in those

1193
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,354
who make everything easy.
I can see that as my task to create 

1194
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:41,510
difficulties everywhere.

1195
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:54,470
Same idea in different words,
a traveler,

1196
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:55,304
this is Nicha and this is part of the 
development of his answer to the 

1197
01:09:57,891 --> 01:09:58,724
conundrum that he raised.
A traveler who had seen many countries 

1198
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,044
and peoples and several continents was 
asked what human traits he had found 

1199
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,630
everywhere and he answered.
Men Are inclined to laziness.

1200
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:11,480
Some will feel that he might have said 
with greater justice,

1201
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,530
they were all timid.
They hide behind customs,

1202
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:17,780
end opinions
at bottom.

1203
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,673
However,
every human being knows very well that 

1204
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:25,460
he is in this world just once as 
something unique and no accident,

1205
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:30,230
however strange we'll throw together a 
second time into a unity,

1206
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:33,950
such a curious and diffuse plurality.
He knows it,

1207
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,930
but he hides it like a bad conscience.
Why?

1208
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:45,200
From fear of his neighbor who insists on
convention and veils himself with it.

1209
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:47,083
But what is it that compels the 
individual human being to fear his 

1210
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:53,120
neighbor and to think and act heard 
fashion and not to be glad of himself?

1211
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:57,710
A sense of shame perhaps in a few rare 
cases in the vast majority,

1212
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:02,711
it's the desire for comfort and inertia 
and short dot inclination to laziness of

1213
01:11:03,171 --> 01:11:05,990
which the traveler spoke.
He's right.

1214
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,213
Men are even lazier than they are 
timorous and what they fear most is the 

1215
01:11:10,161 --> 01:11:14,040
troubles with which any unconditional 
honesty and nudity would burden them.

1216
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,353
Only artists hate this slovenly life in 
borrowed manners and loosely fitting 

1217
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:23,790
opinions and unveiled the secret.
Everybody's bad conscience.

1218
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,330
The principle that every human being is 
a unique wonder.

1219
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,283
They dare to show us the human being as 
he is down to the last muscle himself 

1220
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,244
and himself alone.
Even more that in this rigorous 

1221
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:36,594
consistency of his uniqueness,
he is beautiful and worth contemplating 

1222
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,780
as novel and as incredible as any work 
of nature.

1223
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:48,050
And by no means dope.
When a great thinker despises man,

1224
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:52,310
it's their laziness that he despises for
it is on account of this.

1225
01:11:52,311 --> 01:11:53,144
That they have the periods of factory 
products and seeing indifferent and 

1226
01:11:56,121 --> 01:11:58,520
unworthy of companionship or 
instruction.

1227
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:01,443
The human being who does not wish to 
belong to the mass austerely seeds must 

1228
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:08,600
merely cease being comfortable with 
himself.

1229
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,920
Let him follow his conscience,
which shouts at them.

1230
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,000
Be Yourself,
what you are at present,

1231
01:12:17,001 --> 01:12:19,160
doing,
opining,

1232
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,510
and desiring.

1233
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,600
That's not really you.

1234
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:33,643
Yeah.

1235
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,683
That's neat.
Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky and 

1236
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:43,370
existentialism in,
that's the bare beginning of the thing.

1237
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:44,743
Yeah.
