1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,970
She said that she found out he almost 
had a higher tolerance

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,310
baseline and they had the same increase 
in production and sensitivity

3
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,410
and then they had lower,
it was lower.

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,810
What's critical is to find out how heart
rate

5
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,270
split,
which is also important.

6
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:50,271
It's not as important because there's a
response and some of the

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,800
more frequent,
more common

8
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,093
complex negative emotions like 
resentment and guilt and hatred and 

9
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,920
cruelty and the argument basically and 
stuff.

10
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,100
You know,
when animals are afraid of the unknown,

11
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,480
but for human beings,
that fear is,

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,433
is increased by the fact that we also 
abstractly understanding is since what 

13
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,570
the unknown means.
Well,

14
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,740
the mere fact that we can abstract out,
I know she liked the unknown as such,

15
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,293
certainly isn't indicative of the fact 
that our cognitive processes are 

16
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:50,100
somewhat different than the,
from those of animals and I,

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,360
I tried to show using examples drawn 
from both genesis and the story of the,

18
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,370
the fall of the Buddhists,
so to speak,

19
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:04,371
that mythology or some myths anyway,
present us with a story that says

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,073
that the development of self 
consciousness is tantamount to the 

21
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,184
contamination of existence with death.
I think the logic behind that basically 

22
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:21,261
is that the defining feature of self 
consciousness is knowledge of borders,

23
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,720
so to speak,
of our own personal borders and the most

24
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,530
tangible and horrifying of those borders
is our own knowledge of our mortality.

25
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:31,734
So in a sense,
it's the fact that we can see into the 

26
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,614
future and know what that future means.
And so you could say in a sentence if 

27
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,520
you want to get
mechanical about it,

28
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,354
that for human beings,
every aspect of existence serves as a 

29
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:46,230
cue for punishment.

30
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,603
Now,
someone commented last week that if you 

31
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:54,924
put an animal into an experimental 
situation where it's subjected 

32
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:03,321
constantly to unavoidable punishment,
that develops learned helplessness,

33
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,464
which is not alone,
that depression can also produce 

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,060
aggression as a consequence of the 
administration of such punishment.

35
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:11,894
So
we know already that the purpose of 

36
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,774
group identification is to
provide stability in an ocean of 

37
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,400
instability.
But what we've now added to this,

38
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,680
I think with this additional line of 
argumentation is

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,793
more clear understanding of how,
just how terrible the ocean of 

40
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,410
instability is for human beings in 
particular.

41
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,723
Because,

42
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,570
yeah,
as I said before,

43
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:46,404
I'm,
I'm not just interested in figuring out 

44
00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:50,970
why animals defend their territory,
human beings and animals,

45
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,463
at least in terms of that idea.
I'm interested in why we go that final 

46
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,153
extra date of distance,
which means that not only do we will we 

47
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,653
kill to protect our territory,
but we'll engage in all sorts of 

48
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:06,240
murderous torture along the way,
which seems gratuitous in a sense,

49
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,074
is that you like it's one thing to one,
eliminate your enemy and we understand 

50
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:11,700
some of the motivations for doing it.
I mean,

51
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,440
someone who's foreign disrupts your 
predictability.

52
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,070
Predictability is the essence of 
security.

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,110
It's another thing to

54
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,340
Choo Choo.

55
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,891
Well,
as I said,

56
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:24,724
to make you,
I guess to make it an aesthetic of his 

57
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,991
cruelty tend to pursue the opportunity 
to inflict suffering on someone else

58
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,400
justified by your express patriotism 
expressly,

59
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,010
but obviously motivated by something 
that's more twisted and perverse.

60
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,943
So,
and that's the core question that this 

61
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:51,550
course is trying to address this and 
what is it that makes people like that?

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,520
No,
just patriotic but totalitarian,

63
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,750
patriotic,
and not just willing to defend borders,

64
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:01,584
but also
motivated to enjoy that construction of 

65
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:08,334
cruelty for its own sake.
I want to read you a quote from 

66
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,204
Solzhenitsyn to just start this off.
So this is his description of the 

67
00:05:16,561 --> 00:05:17,394
degradation of the state,
the real version as opposed to the 

68
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:21,510
mythological version.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,420
Soldier,
Solzhenitsyn quotes and Arthur who says,

70
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,783
I was told how executions were carried 
out at a doc who was the camp on the 

71
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,124
mature river.
They would take the opposition members 

72
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,683
with their things out of the camp 
compound on a prisoner transport at 

73
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,450
night and outside the compound stood the
small house of the third section.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,553
The condemned men were taken into a room
one at a time and were the camp guards 

75
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:52,410
sprang on.
Their mouths were stuffed with something

76
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,320
soft and their arms were bound with the 
courts behind their backs.

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
They were led out into the where 
harnessed carts were waiting.

78
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,313
The bound prisoners were piled on the 
cards from five to seven at a time and 

79
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:07,220
driven off to the Gorkha,
which was the camp cemetery on arrival.

80
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:10,490
They were tipped into big pits that had 
already been prepared and buried alive.

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,390
No one out of brutality.
No,

82
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,110
it had been ascertained rationally.
Then when dragging and lifting them,

83
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:22,610
it was much easier to cope with living 
people.

84
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,444
Then with corpses,
the work land on for many nights at a 

85
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:26,594
deck and social and it's and says that 
is how the moral political unity of our 

86
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,120
party was achieved.

87
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:39,843
Helipad,
he's described the degradation of the 

88
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:42,394
state from the mythological perspective.
He says as well be known since the 

89
00:06:48,551 --> 00:06:53,350
compilation is made by our Andre h use 
ner and Jg Fraser,

90
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,250
the delusion is almost universally 
disseminated and is documented in all of

91
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:04,531
the continents of a rarely in Africa and
on various cultural levels.

92
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,560
A certain number of variants seemed to 
be the result of dissemination,

93
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,280
first from Mesopotamia and then from 
India.

94
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,593
It is equally possible that one or more 
one or several actual dilulio 

95
00:07:16,751 --> 00:07:19,420
catastrophes gave rise to fabulous 
narratives,

96
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,050
but it would be risky to explain.
So widespread myth by phenomena of which

97
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,450
know geologic and traces have been 
found.

98
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,580
The majority of the flood myth Siemens 
sends to form part of the cosmic rhythm.

99
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,133
The old world people by a fallen 
humanity is submerged under the waters 

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,170
and sometimes later a new world emerges 
from the aquatic chaos.

101
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,760
While you're all familiar with that 
general model,

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,153
you've seen that over,
over and over again and the diagrams 

103
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:55,090
that I've
presented to,

104
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,780
it's just basically this notion

105
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,580
people have fallen humanity down by the 
water who then reemerge.

106
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,420
That's the story of Noah for example,
but then he goes on to say,

107
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,463
this is very interesting.
It's really worth thinking about 

108
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:26,120
because,
well,

109
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,093
I think it's worth thinking about.
I guess this past and struck me because 

110
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,773
it echoed long after I thought up what 
I'm going to tell you today what I had 

111
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,584
in fact thought up,
which was that you can't say that a 

112
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:43,780
state gets rotten and corrupt all on its
own,

113
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:47,080
although that happens merely as a 
consequence of the passing of time,

114
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,910
which is to say that,
all right,

115
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,970
let's take the analogy of the 
individual.

116
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,290
We all have childhood at one point,
and those personalities,

117
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,310
theoretically or healthy,
given our status as children,

118
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,120
but as time passed,
which basically meant as changed,

119
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:06,954
continued to happen,
we transformed from children and 

120
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,140
adolescents.

121
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,483
And that meant that the childhood 
personality considered as something 

122
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:15,894
static would have turned pathological by
its own devices as we transformed into 

123
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,044
adolescence because the attitude of a 
child over were appropriate for a child 

124
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:25,794
is not appropriate for an adolescent.
One of the things that added points out 

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,240
says,
well,

126
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,910
that's an idea of the,
the,

127
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,740
the,
the aging and senility of the cake.

128
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,923
Is that an idea that's good at one point
in your life may become pathological at 

129
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:44,790
a later point.
So there's sort of,

130
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,040
it's just a consequence of entropy in a 
sense.

131
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,874
Things always change and as a 
consequence you have to run to keep up 

132
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,440
with them.
But then really had,

133
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,380
he takes the argument a bit farther and 
he says in a large number of variants,

134
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,270
the flood is a result of the sins or 
ritual faults of human beings.

135
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,943
Sometimes it results simply from the 
wish of a divine being to putting in to 

136
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:07,470
mankind will know his story is very much
like that.

137
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,283
Anyways,
the chief causes seem to lie at once in 

138
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,630
the sins of men and the decrepitude of 
the world.

139
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,310
So Elliot,
he says,

140
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,144
well,
it's not just a matter of the fact that 

141
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,440
things age and become decayed by 
themselves,

142
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:23,274
but there's an additional twist on it,
which is that there's some contribution 

143
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,233
according to the mythological mode,
thinking of the misbehavior of human 

144
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:30,534
beings,
but makes the guard so upset they can't 

145
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,264
stand the noise so to speak anymore.
They decided to do away with everything 

146
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,510
that's being created.
So there's an,

147
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,433
there's a sin of commission as well as 
an act of omission that leads to the 

148
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,560
decrepitude of things.
In the end,

149
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,800
he says,
by the mere fact that it exists,

150
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,783
that is that it lives in,
produces the cosmos gradually 

151
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,840
deteriorates and ends by falling into 
decay.

152
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,690
This is why it has to be recreated,
recreated.

153
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,453
In other words,
the flood realizes on the macrocosmic 

154
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,840
scale.
What is symbolic effected during the New

155
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,673
Year Festival?
The end of the world and the end of the 

156
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:11,070
sinful humanity in order to make a new 
creation possible.

157
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,363
Finally,
you might think about the myth that we 

158
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:19,910
discussed a long time ago,
the Egyptian myth that underlies the The

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,530
Sun God status of the Pharaoh.
That's the myth of Ocirus horrocks.

160
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,963
Remember ocirus ends up being sent to 
the underworld because of the treachery 

161
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:34,770
of his brother Seth,
who the Egyptian myth states.

162
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:35,604
Clearly he didn't understand.
So the Egyptian myth states was that 

163
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:43,950
first there was something fishy about 
seth.

164
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,053
And second of all that he had such great
impact on our stairs because well 

165
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:49,534
serious didn't understand what seth was 
and that meant basically is trying to 

166
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,910
point out,
so to speak to people that

167
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,260
if you don't understand what evil is,
that will defeat you.

168
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,953
And so what we're trying to do from at 
least in this lecture and more or less 

169
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:13,120
for the last three lectures,
is to come to some understanding of just

170
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:13,954
what evil consists of so that we can 
decrease the likelihood that it will in 

171
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:18,814
fact defeat us.
I was showing this manuscript to a 

172
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:23,794
friend of mine on the weekend and he 
found parts of the argument that I was 

173
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:30,251
making.
I should,

174
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,084
I'm outline I gave you last week,
kind of unsettling in a sense because I 

175
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:37,294
use a lot of terminology that's being 
classically associated with the 

176
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,910
religious thought I can,
can I,

177
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
you know this,
this disturbs me as well.

178
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:45,790
It's certainly,
at least it did.

179
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:47,320
As I was putting the manuscript 
together,

180
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,183
because I had never was inclined.
I thought of my own accord to gravitate 

181
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,304
towards religious language
and he asked me why I insisted upon 

182
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:00,394
using words like evil when they have 
this historical context that at least 

183
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:08,080
places that partially into the domain of
religious thinking.

184
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,930
Well,
you know,

185
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,063
it would certainly make,
if I changed the terminology and 

186
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,584
deemphasize the mythological language,
I could certainly make the sorts of 

187
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,360
theories that I'm trying to present more
palatable.

188
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,420
But the fact is,
as far as I'm concerned,

189
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,254
that
the mere fact that we know anything at 

190
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:40,781
all about evil is because of religious 
constructions of precisely what evil is.

191
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:43,264
And it would be a mistake as a 
consequence to abandon the historical 

192
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:47,554
roots of the development of the idea,
just to make discussion of it more 

193
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,350
palatable.
One thing that occurred to me when I was

194
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:54,184
reading is that you seem
to have changed their meanings somewhat 

195
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,330
from the traditional religious sense and
goes,

196
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,240
where's your actually discuss concretely
in there?

197
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:10,210
But the good and good general,
they refer us to

198
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,140
a specific moral code and evil to 
opposition to the Colu.

199
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,910
Yeah,
right,

200
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:19,763
and not as is when for instance needs to
finish his book beyond good and evil 

201
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,790
refers to propose to them in that sense.

202
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,920
In other words that you're beyond that,
that split,

203
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,754
but then what Derryn Brian curb as good 
and evil is sort of beyond the 

204
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,910
traditional grid enable these.
That's right.

205
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,763
It's description of good and evil as 
processes rather than as as things are 

206
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:39,760
estates.
Yeah.

207
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,900
I was reading a little bit about the 
French Revolution this morning because I

208
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,430
referred to it in this manuscript 
somewhere or said that the French during

209
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:52,430
the French revolution erected a statue 
to the goddess of Notradame Cathedral,

210
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,550
which I was thought was already telling 
historical then that's wrong by the way.

211
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,090
They actually a,
they actually dressed up an opera singer

212
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,193
at to represent the goddess of liberty 
and created her around inside the 

213
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,634
notradame cathedral,
which they had renamed the temple the 

214
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:08,564
temple of reason.
So I had my remembrance of the 

215
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,193
historical factors a little bit off,
but the basic notion is still remains 

216
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,910
absolutely solid.

217
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,930
I mean the people who ran the French 
revolution were in fact,

218
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:21,764
at least in the initial stages of the 
revolution were out to to replace 

219
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,300
Christianity,
Catholicism with,

220
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,520
with rational atheism and to enshrine 
reason.

221
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,723
And it was interesting to read some of 
the things that they have done because 

222
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,030
it's certainly the case,
for example,

223
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:38,864
that our notion of natural rights 
formally derives in large part from the 

224
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,564
work that was done by certain people 
around the time of the French 

225
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,493
revolution.
And what was really interesting about 

226
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,423
those authors is that having constructed
their explicit description of natural 

227
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,154
rights,
they immediately made the presumption 

228
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:57,734
that they had invented the concepts.
There was no historical basis for the 

229
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:07,481
idea in a sense that there was no 
lengthy process of religious development

230
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,000
that led up to the possibility of 
positing something like a natural.

231
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:13,110
Right.
So once having discovered it,

232
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:15,350
so to speak,
which is to say having made it explicit,

233
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:19,400
they were willing to dispense entirely 
with all of the historical prerequisites

234
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:20,690
for the development of that idea.

235
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,003
I mean that was the idea here is right.
Say you come up with a rational 

236
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,640
explication of the notion of a natural,
right.

237
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,880
Well that's based on on an immensely 
long and complex history of the movement

238
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,084
of the sorts of behavior patterns that 
are encoded in the idea of national 

239
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:46,250
rights up this hierarchy of abstraction.
So

240
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,123
anyways,
the point is is that as soon as the 

241
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,943
French thinkers,
we're able to make the notion of the 

242
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,014
national right explicit.
They were willing to dispense with the 

243
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:57,134
historical precursors.
And the reason I'm using that argument 

244
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:02,000
is because I'm trying to make the notion
of evil explicit and I'm,

245
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:04,880
but I'm not willing to dispense with the
historical precursors.

246
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:05,714
Cause it's absolutely obvious to me that
the only reason that I can say anything 

247
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,104
at all about evil is because all of the 
ideas that I'm describing how are 

248
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:17,120
already played out at all these more 
implicit levels of analysis.

249
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,890
And what I'm trying to do,
you see,

250
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:22,670
the thing is about mythological modes of
thinking.

251
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:25,430
These natural categories is that they do
have really,

252
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:30,431
really fuzzy boundaries.
And so when you consider this structure,

253
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,183
you know,
every one of these levels of analysis 

254
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:39,170
has a negative and a positive valence.
And it's very easy for us to,

255
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,753
it's very easy for us to make the 
presupposition that given that the 

256
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:47,990
devil,
so to speak,

257
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,980
is something negative.
That all of the things that we regard as

258
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:57,420
negatively vaillant emotionally belong 
in the category of the devil.

259
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,460
It's a very easy mistake to make.
So that's,

260
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:00,900
so it's easy for us to say,
well,

261
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,040
the foreigner like good is,
uh,

262
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,810
adherence to a particular creed.
Therefore,

263
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,853
and foreigners obviously presented a 
threat to the integrity of that creed 

264
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:15,803
that threatens negatively valence.
It's reasonable to lump everything 

265
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,420
natively valence into the same category.

266
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,403
The category that we lumped,
everything that's active and negatively 

267
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:29,250
valence into is equivalent to the devil,
so you get a perfectly reasonable

268
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,780
logical train that leads to the 
demonization of enemies.

269
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,670
Now,
Elaine Paige Mills who just wrote a book

270
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:39,360
on the on the Devil said that the 
actual,

271
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,650
she actually I think reversed the 
motivational change.

272
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,484
She said the reason that what 
Christianity has come up with what I 

273
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:50,010
think is the most well elaborated story 
of the devil and what,

274
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,383
although there are other religions that 
have done the same sort of thing and 

275
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:55,890
certainly the notion,
the nature of evil is a preoccupation of

276
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:56,724
all sorts of moral systems,
but in terms of elaborating up a 

277
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,200
dramatic figure,
Christianity has done a very good job of

278
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:02,034
that page will says the underground 
motivation for the construction of such 

279
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,250
a figure,
which is the personification of evil,

280
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,233
was to aid Christians in labeling their 
enemies as demonic and justifying their 

281
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,490
their annihilation.

282
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,593
Now,
I think,

283
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,890
you know,
this is a,

284
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,950
first of all,
it's plausible argument.

285
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,590
Second of all,
it's a potent argument.

286
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,280
Um,
and it,

287
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,114
it also seems fairly obvious that people
do use mythological figures that 

288
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:33,760
represent evil to and apply them to 
their enemies to justify their,

289
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,940
you're not alation.
So then you might think,

290
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,774
well,
maybe the whole idea of evil is just a 

291
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:42,150
rationalization that we use to pursue 
am's that we want to pursue.

292
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:43,260
But I would say,
well,

293
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,094
that's not exactly right.
Despite the fact that it's like Freud's 

294
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,830
comments about religion.
You can use religion as a,

295
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,460
as a neurotic defense against your 
anxiety.

296
00:19:52,461 --> 00:19:53,760
You've death.
Absolutely.

297
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,594
What that means is that you identify 
with a given creed in a dogmatic manner 

298
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,460
and that protects you from your neurotic
stairs.

299
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,070
Don't want from Freud's mistake as far 
as I was concerned,

300
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:05,904
was to take a perfectly reasonable 
observation and turn it into universal 

301
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:09,420
statement.

302
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,253
The statement being,
that's the only possible purpose of 

303
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,374
religion.
The fact that you could miss you 

304
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,673
something does not necessarily mean that
the misuse of the thing is the only use 

305
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:20,334
of it.
While I'm the same applies to the ideas 

306
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:22,914
of evil.
The fact that having a figure at your 

307
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,750
disposal like the devil so to speak,
makes it easier for you in some ways to,

308
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,913
to represent your,
your enemies as reprehensible does not 

309
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:35,394
necessarily mean that.
That's the only reason that such a 

310
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:38,784
figure developed and when I'm trying to 
do in this manuscript and this lecture 

311
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:46,731
today is to clarify,
is to bring some clarity to these fuzzy,

312
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,240
mythological categories so that we can 
draw a clear distinction between,

313
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,283
well what I would say our idols of evil,
which are necessarily false and the 

314
00:20:58,481 --> 00:20:59,314
process of evil itself,
which I think is actually clearly 

315
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:02,854
identifiable and stable across cultures.
Just like all these other things that 

316
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:09,770
we've discussed.
Okay.

317
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,550
Anyone?
Yes?

318
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,620
How could you talk about evil?

319
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,960
Well,
Oh,

320
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:17,794
you,
you can talk about it by all sorts of 

321
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:22,910
other names I guess like in humanity 
might be one or uh,

322
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,003
well,
we,

323
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,293
we do it in psychology all the time.
We talk about antisocial behavior where 

324
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,254
we talked about psychopathy,
psychopathy being the thing that's most 

325
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:35,560
closely related in the clinical 
literature to classical notions of evil.

326
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,394
But,
and then we say like standard theories 

327
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,360
of antisocial behavior.
For example,

328
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,550
and I know I know this literature 
relatively well,

329
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,830
they're usually motive.
They're based on,

330
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:45,664
uh,
on inference is drawn from analysis of 

331
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:50,644
lower level of motivations.
Like you might say that the typical 

332
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:53,824
antisocial person is someone who's very 
high in sensitivity to incentive reward 

333
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,960
and very low in sensitivity to threat.
That's a standard theory for anti social

334
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:05,110
motivation.
So that means that they're all goal,

335
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,003
all curiosity,
all novelty seeking and very little 

336
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,094
stock.

337
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,993
You can't make the managers so they 
don't have inhibitory control over the 

338
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,120
behavior.
But,

339
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,890
but that,
that's a pretty mechanistic notion of,

340
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,460
of,
of what underlies criminal behavior in a

341
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:21,190
lot of research has been being devoted 
towards that.

342
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,024
And you know,
the idea of being the standard 

343
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:23,884
antisocial personality,
someone who just doesn't feel anxiety 

344
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,274
very clearly,
who can't use cues of punishment to 

345
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,500
regulate their own behavior.
Now

346
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,033
there the problem,
I don't think there's any wrong with 

347
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,654
that line of theorizing.
I think there are probably underlying 

348
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,570
motivation reasons that might propel 
someone who's neurotically inclined,

349
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,413
so to speak,
towards criminality rather than towards 

350
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,544
agoraphobic or eating disorders or all 
the other things that can complicate up 

351
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:51,514
your life.
But what that's missing is any 

352
00:22:53,981 --> 00:22:54,814
appreciation for the fact that a lot of 
the activities that we regard as 

353
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:57,964
criminal deeply criminal have this 
aspect of almost an aesthetic aspect in 

354
00:23:03,001 --> 00:23:03,834
a sense,
which is obvious desire to wreak havoc 

355
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,594
and harm on someone else,
not merely for whatever gain might be 

356
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:10,864
caused by that,
but very often despite the fact that no 

357
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:19,060
gain whatsoever will be cost by just for
participating in the act itself.

358
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,800
Now,
there's some exceptions to this,

359
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:21,634
like Dan always who studies bullying in 
Scandinavian countries the most 

360
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,570
particularly,
he's always been interested in.

361
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,940
One of the things that motivated his 
lifetime's work on,

362
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,720
on bullying is understanding of the 
authoritarian personality because he's,

363
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,853
he makes the presupposition that bullies
in their henchmen or the juvenile 

364
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:42,340
versions of fascists,
fascists,

365
00:23:42,341 --> 00:23:43,174
and their louts,
which is a perfectly reasonable 

366
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,830
hypothesis as far as I'm concerned.
He's documented instances.

367
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,060
For example,
he has a video tape,

368
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:50,894
which I haven't seen him.
I just read this description of it that 

369
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:54,350
shows,
you know,

370
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,090
it's being taken in a public school in 
Norway showing a group of bullies,

371
00:23:59,091 --> 00:23:59,924
tormenting a whipping boy basically by 
tying a string around his neck and 

372
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:04,844
leading them through the hallways.
And the thing about that sort of thing 

373
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:10,160
is that it's fun and it's that aspect 
of,

374
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,323
of the attractiveness of engaging in 
that sort of behavior that we really 

375
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:16,880
haven't been able to get our finger on 
very clearly in psychology.

376
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,210
And I think as a rule we tend to,
we tend to sidestep it.

377
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,570
And it's also because we don't like to 
deal with issues like equal,

378
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,703
so to speak,
that have these sorts of religious 

379
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:26,624
overtones.
But when you're talking about the sorts 

380
00:24:27,921 --> 00:24:31,700
of things that happened in concentration
camps in the Soviet Union in Germany,

381
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,190
which are the sorts of things I'm really
interested in,

382
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,583
you have to use the strongest work you 
have at your disposal to describe those 

383
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:43,280
patterns of activity.
And it's also the case that,

384
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,470
well,
as I mentioned last week,

385
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:46,304
I think a lot of the prior order 
surviving Nazis were prosecuted after 

386
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,150
the Second World War for crimes against 
humanity,

387
00:24:53,151 --> 00:24:53,984
which is,
uh,

388
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,823
which is a category of moral violation,
which we recognize at a sort of super 

389
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,080
cultural level,
which is that we say,

390
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,580
well,
yes,

391
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,563
morality is culture bound,
which is to say that different cultures 

392
00:25:05,211 --> 00:25:06,070
have different rules.

393
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,640
If you follow those rules,
you're,

394
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,790
you're responsible within the confines 
of those cultures.

395
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,013
But despite that relativistic morality,
there are certain activities that you 

396
00:25:15,741 --> 00:25:19,460
can't engage in no matter what your 
excuses and basically what that,

397
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,383
that's,
that's the thesis of the Nuremberg 

398
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,184
trials basically in that thesis is 
predicated on implicit recognition at 

399
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:26,474
least that there's a form of morality 
that supersedes cultural identification 

400
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,463
and also one that a form of morality and
a form of immorality that transcends 

401
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,060
cultural identification.
And if you don't believe that,

402
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,900
then it's difficult to justify any 
belief that you might have.

403
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:44,240
That what happened in Germany,
for example,

404
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,253
did constitute a crime against humanity.
Then you have to regard the Nuremberg 

405
00:25:48,741 --> 00:25:50,870
trials as an act of revenge by the 
victors,

406
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:53,390
which is an arguable position

407
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,380
question.
I'm just wondering,

408
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,070
I'm trying to understand the context of 
mental health.

409
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,110
Um,
I'm wondering,

410
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,030
um,
first of all,

411
00:26:03,031 --> 00:26:03,864
like mental health itself can be defined
like the idea of mental health and need 

412
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,730
find this like survival or cooperation 
in society or whether it's like,

413
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,813
you know,
we can itself like can have disturbed 

414
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:20,240
person achieves to a high level of 
success.

415
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:22,650
I just,
Hitler did and still be considered.

416
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,880
Well that's,
that's the,

417
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,900
that's the question.
I mean,

418
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:28,890
I said one of the questions that I've 
been trying to answer all along here,

419
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,470
this neat,
she's in Peru,

420
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,030
which is,
are there pathologies of health,

421
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:33,903
which is,
can you be the exemplar of a given 

422
00:26:36,701 --> 00:26:37,534
society,
which means by the definition of that 

423
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:40,444
society normally average,
but in fact and still be considered 

424
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,343
corrupt at a higher level of analysis 
whose existence can actually be 

425
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:53,190
justified in some manner.
And that is the issue.

426
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,470
And that's what we're trying to,
that's what we're trying to find out.

427
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,903
Okay.
So I read you the little story that 

428
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,093
[inaudible] told about the elimination 
of anomalous information in the form of 

429
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:09,120
other people,
which is not social instance argument.

430
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,360
The social and political unity of the 
Communist Party says,

431
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,194
how was it a tank you just eliminate,
you eliminate all anomalous information 

432
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,100
that's actually still embodied in,
right,

433
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,473
so an idea log doesn't like contrary 
rational arguments because they present 

434
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,400
information that violates the of the 
logs,

435
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,243
precept positions,
but it's also the case that the mere 

436
00:27:29,821 --> 00:27:30,654
existence of certain types of people,
regardless of whether they're making 

437
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:37,971
their arguments in any abstract form,
those people indicate by their behavior,

438
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,820
their objection to our existence in 
spite of your particular precept.

439
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,653
So they're mere fact.
The mere fact of their existence is 

440
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,330
individuals and sufficient threat to 
justify their,

441
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,940
their repression and annihilation.
I would say,

442
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:55,941
well totalitarians are doing to people 
exactly what abstract authoritarians due

443
00:27:57,451 --> 00:27:58,284
to ideas that don't agree with them.
If you present me with information that 

444
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,330
doesn't fit my frame of reference,
I'll just

445
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,373
eliminated

446
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:10,783
you.
Eliade talks about the notion of the 

447
00:28:12,281 --> 00:28:14,680
flood and this University of 
disseminated myth that says

448
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,630
states of being are annihilated by the 
gods periodically,

449
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,520
not only because they are decrepit
as a constant,

450
00:28:24,521 --> 00:28:26,560
just as a consequence of their manner of
being,

451
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:30,670
but also because people add unnecessary 
decrepitude to them by their,

452
00:28:30,671 --> 00:28:32,140
by their sins,
so to speak.

453
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,420
That's a mythological idea and we don't 
know what it means.

454
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:35,763
Now,
I'm going to read you a little section 

455
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:37,894
that describes the authoritarianism of 
an individual who I think came to 

456
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:45,280
realize that many of his so called moral
precepts,

457
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,114
the things that he held as as 
ideological ideals were in fact leading 

458
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:54,310
him down in extraordinarily totalitarian
path.

459
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,823
MMM,

460
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,693
today is Christmas Day and I have just 
come home from Julie's while I was 

461
00:29:01,881 --> 00:29:02,714
there.
It struck me as I sat on the couch 

462
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,120
between two girls,
just how foolish and idiotic I have been

463
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,570
in this smile and we life.
I hope you want to have patients while I

464
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:12,404
own burden myself on you because I need 
desperately to confess my sins to 

465
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:16,634
someone.
And I know that if I were sitting in a 

466
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,630
little cubicle talking to an unseen 
clergymen,

467
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:21,464
I wouldn't do a proper job of it.
You fit the definition of a religious 

468
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:25,664
man as someone who gives careful 
consideration to the demonic and 

469
00:29:27,771 --> 00:29:31,040
irrational and humanity.
So I think you will find my confession.

470
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:31,874
Interesting.
Imagine if you can a grown man who 

471
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:39,650
harbors in his heart the most vicious 
resentment for his fellow man,

472
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,550
his neighbor who is actually

473
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,383
guilty of nothing,
more than embodying a superior 

474
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,020
consciousness of what it means to be a 
man.

475
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,353
When I think of all the black scathing 
thoughts I have directed at those who I 

476
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:55,300
could not look in the eye,
it is almost unbearable.

477
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,003
All of my lofty disdain for the common 
man who so I thought it was guilty of 

478
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:02,434
the sin of,
of unconsciousness was I now realize 

479
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,734
founded on nothing more than jealousy in
spite I hated unload anyone who had 

480
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:11,854
wrestled with their fear of leaving the 
maternal confines of a childish 

481
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:17,470
mentality and won their battle only 
because I had not done so.

482
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,770
I equated independence and success with 
ego,

483
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:25,330
tism and selfishness,
and it was my fondest hope,

484
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,253
my highest ambition to witness and 
participate in the destruction of 

485
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:29,944
everything that's successful,
independent people had built for 

486
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:33,340
themselves.
This,

487
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:34,174
I consider it a duty fact.
There was a decidedly fanatical element 

488
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:42,040
in my urge to cleanse the world of what 
I perceived to be selfishness.

489
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:43,960
Okay.

490
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,793
I think of what would have happened if I
had been in a position to realize my 

491
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:51,460
fine feelings.
The memory makes me fear that any moment

492
00:30:51,461 --> 00:30:52,294
the earth,
we'll crack open and swallow me up 

493
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,543
because if there was any justice,
it would I who have not the faintest 

494
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,104
inkling of a capacity for moral judgment
traipsing around passing judgment on 

495
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:03,154
anyone who Derek Cross my path.
It makes me wonder that I have even one 

496
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:10,120
friend in this world,
but of course I had friends before,

497
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,170
anyone with enough self contempt that 
they could forgive me.

498
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:15,004
Mine.
It is fortunate for humanity that there 

499
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,870
are a few saviors of the caliber of 
myself.

500
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,870
If you know that I use to identify with 
Christ,

501
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:28,150
I considered myself entirely 
immaculately free of aggression in every

502
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:28,984
other form of antisocial feeling,
but what about the hatred I have just 

503
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,840
now confessed you ask.

504
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,963
That didn't count.
Those feelings were based on sound 

505
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,840
common sense,
uc.

506
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,913
After all,
there are sons of bitches in the world 

507
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:47,830
and one needs to be ready for them.
Do I smell ozone?

508
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,420
They say you get a tingling sensation 
just before the lightning bolt strikes.

509
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,080
That is a very apt phrase,
son of a bitch.

510
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,513
There's a passage in young's 
phenomenology of the self which runs 

511
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,563
often.
A mother appears beside him who 

512
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,204
apparently shows not the slightest 
concern that her little son should 

513
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:06,934
become a man,
but who was tireless in self emulating 

514
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,170
effort,
neglect,

515
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,670
nothing that might hinder him from 
growing up in marrying you.

516
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:16,504
Now,
behold the secret conspiracy between 

517
00:32:17,591 --> 00:32:20,890
mother and son and how each helps the 
other to be trade life.

518
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,183
This insight would be useful for me as 
an excuse being a perfectly accurate 

519
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,384
description of my situation.
We're not for the fact that I'm almost 

520
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:34,510
daily presented with a residual bit of 
undeleted evil and myself.

521
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,783
For example,
when I am faced with a frustrating 

522
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,793
situation,
I do not ask myself what I am going to 

523
00:32:41,391 --> 00:32:42,224
do about it.
I asked myself who's responsible for it 

524
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,590
and I'm always ready to conclude that if
the other person were to ag property,

525
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,600
then the problem will not exist.
What is evil,

526
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:54,340
the boat that you ask?
Well,

527
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:58,820
obviously if I am determined to overlook
my own part in the failure to resolve my

528
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:00,210
own frustrations,
I,

529
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,630
if I'm determined to find a scapegoat 
for my problems,

530
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:03,464
then I'm just a stone's throw away from 
the mentality that was responsible for 

531
00:33:05,721 --> 00:33:06,554
Hitler's final solution or for the 
Spanish inquisition or for Lennon's 

532
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,850
cultural cleansing.

533
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,903
Okay.

534
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,420
What was it you told me when I 
complained about the flaws in capitalism

535
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:23,200
about the fact that so many people take 
advantage of the capitalist system,

536
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,143
something like the fact that people go 
on consolidating their financial 

537
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,314
position ad nauseum is another problem,
but it is no reason to conclude that 

538
00:33:32,831 --> 00:33:33,664
there anything virtuous in even refusing
to try to cut consolidates one's 

539
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:41,800
position in the first place,
but it is much easier to crown ones,

540
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,350
cowardice and laziness with the accolade
of virtue.

541
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,580
Just ask Lens Henchman.
He swaggered around the countryside,

542
00:33:48,581 --> 00:33:53,581
robbing every farmer who had managed any
success whatsoever and called themselves

543
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:55,024
friends of the common people and patted 
each other on the back for their moral 

544
00:33:57,761 --> 00:33:58,594
uprightness.
I wonder if I've actually changed so 

545
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:05,880
much that I would not join them if I was
put to the test.

546
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,243
The idea that morality stems from a lack
of personal interest is thoroughly 

547
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:12,294
ingrained in my mind.
Good people are those who don't want 

548
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,590
anything for themselves is the way I 
think,

549
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,143
but I never asked myself why is such a 
person shouldn't put any effort into 

550
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:23,774
disciplining himself or take any pains 
to keep his motives clear in his own 

551
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,500
mind because there's nothing of value to
him in this world,

552
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,040
in his essay relations between the ego 
and the unconscious,

553
00:34:35,041 --> 00:34:37,250
he don't says that in an unconscious 
state,

554
00:34:37,251 --> 00:34:38,084
the individual's torn by the conflict of
opposites and that achieving 

555
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:45,050
consciousness involves resolving that 
conflict on a higher level.

556
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,903
Right.
I understand that this particular 

557
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,323
statement,
Cha a Dalton consciousness is different 

558
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,464
from the original state of childlike and
consciousness in which there is no long 

559
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:54,754
term conflict.
Just last week I was stuck in that dead 

560
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:58,454
end again.
I was sitting and thinking about what 

561
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:00,824
course my life should be taking and had 
every imagined scenario of a fulfilling 

562
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:05,024
or meaningful activity.
I was met by a counterpoint coming from 

563
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:07,934
somewhere in my head showing me how this
or that aspect of my scenario was wrong 

564
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,270
because it wouldn't result in this or 
that problem.

565
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,660
Yeah.

566
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,493
To the point where it was unacceptable.
Consider any career at all because just 

567
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:21,900
by being alive,
I would contribute to the destruction of

568
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:26,310
the planet
and as badly as I want it to refute this

569
00:35:26,311 --> 00:35:30,030
echo of wrong to my every emotion,
right as an irrational Kymera.

570
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,103
The fact is,
so I told myself that we see daily in 

571
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:34,800
the newspapers how the activities of 
humanity,

572
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,550
which are also the activities of men and
women are causing and Calkin will farm.

573
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,123
It is of course,
due to my being influenced by yourself 

574
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:48,350
that I do not remain stuck in that 
particular blog too long these days.

575
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,960
If our industrialism was causing 
problems,

576
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:51,794
I know Lawrence for myself than I should
hope that there are people out there 

577
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:54,854
working to solve those problems,
or perhaps I should try to do something 

578
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:01,160
about them myself,
but sitting idly by,

579
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,260
I do know what it's all the thing.
Of course,

580
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,094
what is most daunting and also most 
sniffily about being stuck in that Bhag 

581
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:08,684
is the fact that the rational wide wants
to be absolutely sure about the 

582
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:13,600
successful outcome of its life plan.
I know,

583
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:16,330
obviously there's another part of the 
mind that knows that such certainties,

584
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:20,830
impossible when has been faced with the 
need to accept on faith that things will

585
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:23,260
turn out for the better and with some 
luck and perseverance.

586
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,300
Okay,

587
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,133
and being a fine,
upstanding modern mouse with an 

588
00:36:27,361 --> 00:36:28,194
enlightened rational mind.
I have no use for faith and other such 

589
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:30,954
religious Santa clap trap and nonsense 
or faith is obviously your rational and 

590
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:39,210
all not have any here rationality 
influencing my behavior previously.

591
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,493
My solution to this problem was to allow
a chance to make my career choices for 

592
00:36:43,261 --> 00:36:44,094
me,
letting my own interests influenced my 

593
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,164
decisions as little as possible.
And then I believe that I had somehow 

594
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:49,914
avoided personal responsibility for the 
state of the modern world because I was 

595
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:53,874
not really responsible for the state of 
my life and that eight escape from the 

596
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,120
possibility that my plans wouldn't work 
out because I had no plans.

597
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,163
It was on this rock solid foundation 
that I looked out at the world and saw 

598
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:05,974
all around me,
people who were stupid enough to add 

599
00:37:07,451 --> 00:37:08,284
their own selves into the equation,
put this kind of faith in oneself to 

600
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:15,940
believe that there exists inside of one 
a motive force,

601
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,043
call it an interest which will respond 
to life and carry one through 

602
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:23,590
uncertainty and adversity is an 
irrational attitude without equal,

603
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,443
and it is with this irrational approach 
to life that the conflict of opposites 

604
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:29,290
is resolved,
it seems to me,

605
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,063
but the problem now is this.
In order to have this faith in one's 

606
00:37:34,351 --> 00:37:35,184
irrational nature,
one needs proof that personal interests 

607
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:37,914
and passions are capable of sustaining 
one through the uncertainties and 

608
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:43,620
adversities of life with the rational 
mind foresee so clearly,

609
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,490
and the only way to get that proof is to
risk one self and just see the result.

610
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,950
Okay.

611
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,560
It is a very exceptional person you can 
take such under taking on their own.

612
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,800
Most of us need guidance and support 
from others,

613
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,020
from believers,
so to speak.

614
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,551
Strange,
isn't it?

615
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:01,980
That religious terms should become 
useful for this discussion.

616
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,713
As I wrote that last paragraph,
I was suddenly reminded of your idea 

617
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:06,894
that the devil has,
he has represented Milton's paradise 

618
00:38:08,551 --> 00:38:09,384
lost is a metaphor for the rational 
intellect just being placed in the 

619
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:14,280
position of the highest psychic 
authority.

620
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,280
Okay.

621
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,440
Better to rule and how then to serve in 
heaven.

622
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,130
Hell,
Dan is a condition in which the rational

623
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:21,964
mind with its acute consciousness of the
many perils of life hold sway over the 

624
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:28,630
individual and the fact of Lee prevents 
him from engaging in life,

625
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,033
which results in the morally degenerate 
state of weakness that I described in 

626
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:33,850
the first pages of his letter.

627
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,010
Okay?

628
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,980
And Heaven,
I presume,

629
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:36,814
would be a condition in which the 
rational mind subordinates itself to 

630
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:42,370
faith in God.
What is God?

631
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,643
You have a chapter in the manuscript of 
your book towel titled The Divinity 

632
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:50,050
Interest.
Your ideas are starting to make sense to

633
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:50,884
me now at least I think they are.
Faith in God means faith in that which 

634
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:54,874
Kendall's one's interest and leads one 
away from the parental sphere out into 

635
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:58,804
the world.
To deny those interests is to deny God 

636
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,280
fall from having it land squarely in 
hell where one's passions burn eternally

637
00:39:06,281 --> 00:39:10,420
and frustration was it God said when he 
cast out amount of Eden,

638
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,323
so I'm thinking about working in the 
dust at the end of his days with the 

639
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,480
specter of death always looming in the 
future.

640
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,243
I can certainly relate to that.
One of the most vivid impressions I get 

641
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:21,964
from recalling all those years I spent 
moving from one job to the next is the 

642
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:25,954
pointlessness of my daily life back then
and the glaring knowledge that the end 

643
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:30,124
was drawing near,
but when I'm doing something that has 

644
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,304
meaning for me,
something that interests me as I am 

645
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,334
right now,
death seems far away and work seems 

646
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:41,800
quite agreeable,
even joy us.

647
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,320
Well,
there's two things or more about that.

648
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,213
I guess the first is that the writer of 
this letter points out that the only 

649
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:54,994
thing that stopped him from,
from being Hitler or Stalin for that 

650
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:00,670
matter,
or perhaps on where you want to,

651
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:03,640
Hitler or stale intention was lack of 
opportunity.

652
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,893
It's not lack of will and that it's easy
for us to make the presupposition that 

653
00:40:08,801 --> 00:40:09,634
there's a qualitative difference between
someone like Hitler and it's our Ed of 

654
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:14,920
men or stolen and someone like 
ourselves.

655
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,263
Partly because we're never in the 
position to do any of the sorts of 

656
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:21,930
things that those bands did and as a 
consequence it's,

657
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,013
we can use our difference in position to
support our notion that there's a 

658
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,920
qualitative difference,
but he points out,

659
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,473
I think this is interesting also in 
terms of more current news about the 

660
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:37,834
unabomber because the unabomber was a 
person who had this sort of attitude 

661
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,980
that's described in this letter,
which is that he made the presupposition

662
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:45,814
that industrial society,
him excluded was evil and the 

663
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,074
appropriate thing to do was to 
disassociate oneself entirely from all 

664
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:59,161
contact with that society and having 
done so presume and begin to fix it from

665
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:02,770
an outside all on his own.

666
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,490
And I know in terms of psychological 
profiles,

667
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:09,610
I mean I know what the unabomber is like
is on the outside.

668
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:14,611
He would appear as someone who was 
absolutely could we essence who would do

669
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:15,934
anything you told him to do.
They would never cause any trouble 

670
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:18,724
whatsoever.
Who would appear as someone who was 

671
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:25,540
actually composed almost entirely of low
self esteem and doubt,

672
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,703
but who deep inside believed that he was
far superior to anyone that he'd ever 

673
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:31,744
encountered on the earth.
That's how I mean it's from a position 

674
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:35,654
like that that you can then move rapidly
towards justification of doing things 

675
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:40,274
like blowing up in innocent people who 
theoretically partake in what you 

676
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:49,571
consider inappropriate from a distance 
having severed for moral reasons.

677
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:50,744
All possible contact with with a real 
members of humanity supported in his 

678
00:41:56,061 --> 00:41:56,894
endeavors theoretically from pity and 
care by both his mother and his brother 

679
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,770
who sent him money to sustain is 
completely abnormal,

680
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:07,430
exist as long beyond the point that it 
would have been sustainable on its own.

681
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,103
I also wanted to read you another 
section from social [inaudible] and on 

682
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,700
the authoritarianism of the individual.
This is the ideological,

683
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,543
logical version.
So we have the first story that 

684
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:34,980
describes the consequences of a 
totalitarian ideology,

685
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:35,823
put it to action,
which is the necessary pursuit and 

686
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,260
destruction of people who don't share 
the ideological view.

687
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,423
And then we have the mythological notion
that things go from bad to worse on 

688
00:42:45,221 --> 00:42:46,054
their own,
but people tend to help that process 

689
00:42:47,741 --> 00:42:49,990
along.
But as a consequence now and man,

690
00:42:49,991 --> 00:42:50,824
God decides to obliterate the world.
And then we have an individual story in 

691
00:42:55,061 --> 00:42:55,894
which one person who confesses that 
given his presuppositions about the 

692
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:02,830
state of the world,
had he been in any position of authority

693
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,900
whatsoever,
he would've been a very terrible person.

694
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,840
And in fact that he was a very terrible 
person,

695
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,003
but he was also powerless.
So he didn't look terrible because he 

696
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:13,990
couldn't put any of his fantasies into 
action.

697
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,030
And this is,
I do thing,

698
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:16,893
this is what separates most of us from 
the position that someone like Hitler 

699
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:20,344
found himself.
Because I do actually believe that that 

700
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:27,751
Hitler was not
a particularly pathological individual.

701
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,733
MMM.

702
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:35,410
He had a decent first world war record,
his sort of aimless wandering throughout

703
00:43:36,861 --> 00:43:37,694
Europe.
At the close of world war one or that 

704
00:43:39,711 --> 00:43:40,544
much different from the aimless 
wandering of any number of hundreds of 

705
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,013
thousands of men who'd be unbelievably 
brutalized in trench warfare during 

706
00:43:48,321 --> 00:43:49,190
World War One.

707
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,033
MMM.

708
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,861
See,
the thing is,

709
00:43:51,861 --> 00:43:52,694
it's not to say that a man in that 
position was without faults because he 

710
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:57,800
certainly had as many faults as the next
person did.

711
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,130
But the problem is is that no,
if you,

712
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,130
if you put yourself into a position of 
power,

713
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,550
what you forego is the sort of social 
feedback that keeps most people in line.

714
00:44:09,571 --> 00:44:10,610
So you can say,
well,

715
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,070
you know,
if the average individual is composed of

716
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:13,904
a certain amount,
positive qualities and a certain amount 

717
00:44:15,501 --> 00:44:18,950
of negative qualities,
but being relatively powerless,

718
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:19,863
the average person has always kept in 
mind by the social pressure of his or 

719
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:24,680
her peers.
So for any of us,

720
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,693
theoretically,
if we start to move too far in our 

721
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:32,280
naturally pathological direction,
we receive instant.

722
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,553
We receive instant feedback from our 
surrounding environment suggesting that 

723
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:39,480
it might be better if we want a fire 
behavior,

724
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:43,800
which is to say that people have enough 
courage to be irritated by us and let us

725
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:44,634
know that,
or people have enough courage or aren't 

726
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:47,064
sufficiently terrified of us,
which is the same thing in a sense to 

727
00:44:49,831 --> 00:44:53,910
tell us when we've gone too far out of 
wine by gesture and look and interaction

728
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:54,780
and all sorts of things.

729
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,980
So you know,
we all,

730
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:56,903
we all,
that's part of the security that the 

731
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,170
social group provides.
You know,

732
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,810
a social group makes everyone else 
predictable,

733
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,644
but it also keeps us predictable to 
ourself to by ensuring that we told the 

734
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:08,364
line the problem with accruing power in 
the manner of someone like Hitler is 

735
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:14,070
that you forego all that social 
corrective feedback.

736
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,353
And then because you surround yourself 
by people and it's a process that feeds 

737
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:19,284
back onto itself,
you surround yourself by people who are 

738
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,600
essentially cowardly,
who want to hide behind your charisma,

739
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:25,434
so to speak,
so that they don't have to face the 

740
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,744
world and they're willing because you 
protect them from the things they don't 

741
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,850
want to look at to exceed to your every 
wish.

742
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,130
Now in some ways that can be perfectly 
positive.

743
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,983
I read a good biography of Hitler,
I thought that claimed that had he quit 

744
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,920
or being killed or died in the mid 
thirties that the judgment of the German

745
00:45:46,921 --> 00:45:47,754
people and perhaps of history overall 
would he'd be in the pain of being a 

746
00:45:50,341 --> 00:45:51,420
very effective leader.

747
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,920
You know,
you might debate,

748
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,690
perhaps it's debatable.
I haven't read every biography of Hitler

749
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,533
that's out there,
but the problem was that as things 

750
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,220
continue to,
as his power continued to grow,

751
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:07,860
his pathology had a wider and wider,
wider,

752
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:10,470
wider latitude for expression.
And then,

753
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,030
you know,
the question really becomes,

754
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,073
so you can say,
because it's comforting that there's a 

755
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:17,700
qualitative difference between someone 
like Hitler and the person who's sitting

756
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:20,730
next to you.
But then you also have to think when the

757
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:25,731
whole country of people think that 
you're the answer to all their problems,

758
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,820
what sort of character and what it take 
to,

759
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,213
to tell yourself that all those people 
are wrong given especially in say 

760
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:33,534
inhibitors case.
The exceptional odds against him have 

761
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:38,940
ever him having ever gone to the 
position that he got to.

762
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:42,000
He was a pretty,
he was trivial person from a,

763
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,150
from a socioeconomic and military 
perspective.

764
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,313
He didn't come from a powerful family.
He had no influential friends to speak 

765
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:50,004
of.
And he climbed up the ranks of the 

766
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,030
hierarchy unit,
remarkable manner and you know,

767
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:54,923
gain the gain,
the democratic acceptance of the vast 

768
00:46:57,301 --> 00:46:58,134
majority of the German population.
And he also viewed himself as someone 

769
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:04,410
who was,
Germany's only hope,

770
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,250
partly as a bolt.
Like he viewed himself as a bulwark from

771
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:10,080
the encroachment of communism from the 
East,

772
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:10,914
which was a real threat.
And also someone who could conceivably 

773
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:18,060
restored Germany to some of the power 
that had been stripped from,

774
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:20,940
from the country by diverse side 
trading,

775
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,774
which I think is reading.
It's reasonable to comment on that 

776
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:28,971
training that it was blatantly vengeful.
So you'll have to ask yourself,

777
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,610
well,
under those conditions,

778
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:31,444
given,
given that much admiration carried out 

779
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,613
over such a lengthy period of time,
how many people wouldn't fall prey to 

780
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:40,060
their own pathologies?

781
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,740
That's one of the things.
Blending very interesting.

782
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,590
Sort of enjoyed as much personal powers 
anymore.

783
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,900
You have to seem to have a discipline to
survive.

784
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,760
Right?
Right.

785
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,593
Some degree.
I mean it makes it because the hip or 

786
00:47:57,781 --> 00:48:00,090
pattern is much more common.
Right.

787
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,673
Then the wake on these,
I'm just curious when you think about 

788
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:07,134
that.

789
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,840
Well,
I mean it's,

790
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,840
I don't know exactly what to think about
it.

791
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:11,674
I mean,
perhaps here it's just surprisingly 

792
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:16,660
lacking anthropologist.
Well that's one possibility.

793
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:20,380
I mean he was also,
he was also explicitly religious.

794
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,960
He had engaged in also,
I've always thought personal incentives.

795
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

796
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,860
I think that,
I think that was part of it.

797
00:48:29,861 --> 00:48:32,740
I mean he was willing voluntarily to 
four gold,

798
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,440
many of the,
the rewards that he might've otherwise,

799
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,453
I guess basically what he did was to,
to try to discipline himself so that he 

800
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,320
as a matter of habit would reject any 
temptation that was offered to him.

801
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:45,670
I mean,
he did some strange things,

802
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:46,360
you know,
like,

803
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,770
or things that seem strange,
I think like I remember that Gandhi used

804
00:48:50,771 --> 00:48:55,771
to sleep with young women in order to,
to attempt to suppress his sexual desire

805
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:57,971
grow.
Right,

806
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:58,900
exactly.
And you think,

807
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:00,490
well that's kind of a strange thing to 
do.

808
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,301
And then you think,
well,

809
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:02,051
you know,
this guy,

810
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:06,160
here's someone who is like absolutely 
surrounded by temptations of every sort,

811
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,893
you know,
in any direction that he would have 

812
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:12,110
chosen to pursue whatever he wanted,
he would have been granted it.

813
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:13,323
And perhaps the only way he could keep 
himself vaguely on course was to forego 

814
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,693
all of the,
all the temporal attractions of his 

815
00:49:20,381 --> 00:49:23,940
power as powerful position.
I also think again,

816
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,640
the perhaps had prepared himself for the
sorts of things that he might encounter,

817
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,060
um,
beforehand.

818
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:30,903
And he engaged in a lengthy letter 
writing correspondence with tolstoy 

819
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,940
before he started his,
his nonviolent movement in India.

820
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,050
I also suspect that maybe as his power 
grew,

821
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:41,884
his character grew too because he was 
making the right decisions all the way 

822
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:46,430
along.
So you know,

823
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,273
when,
when he was offered a small temptation 

824
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:51,250
so to speak,
perhaps he was able to say no.

825
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,960
And then the next time when the 
temptation,

826
00:49:52,961 --> 00:49:54,000
the slight be bigger,
he,

827
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,690
you know,
it got easier.

828
00:49:55,691 --> 00:49:57,740
That's right.
It was something that was practice.

829
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:02,220
Maybe it's a good question.
We may be confusing situations here.

830
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,573
I think you can apply the same analysis 
that you used for Hitler in terms of 

831
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,813
Gandhi.
His,

832
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,743
the reason why he was powerful is 
because you enable to resist these 

833
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:11,044
temptations.
So as you accumulated power and 

834
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:17,170
accumulated power as a saint,
not as a political leader in a sense,

835
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,860
is there a lot of political leaders in 
Indian?

836
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,133
So you're suggesting too that there was 
social pressure on him to keep him on 

837
00:50:23,471 --> 00:50:25,630
the positive?
In the positive direction as well.

838
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:26,530
I said,
yeah,

839
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:27,800
well I think that's right.
I mean,

840
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:28,634
if everyone expects you to act like a 
saint as well then and you're going to 

841
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,250
have to have a moral,
right?

842
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,011
Absolutely.
Well,

843
00:50:34,011 --> 00:50:36,230
yeah,
I mean certainly these sorts of feedback

844
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,580
processes exist.
I mean,

845
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,833
that's why I said there's this statement
in the new testament run something like 

846
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,840
to those who have everything more shall 
be given to those who have nothing.

847
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,320
Everything will be taken away.
What do I think that is?

848
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,173
His description of this sort of feedback
process is that one good decision 

849
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,340
heightens the likelihood of the next 
good decision and so on and so forth.

850
00:50:55,341 --> 00:50:57,620
So invent,
as you make your decisions,

851
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,390
events conspire,
so to speak,

852
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:00,224
to reinforce them.
You can see this with paranoids like 

853
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,070
Stella.
I mean,

854
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,340
if you're paranoid,
you think everyone's out to get you well

855
00:51:07,341 --> 00:51:09,520
as,
which means that you're very hostile and

856
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:10,354
suspicious towards people,
which means that you see their dark 

857
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:13,004
side.
It also makes them very afraid and 

858
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:17,340
suspicious of you so you can see you 
very [inaudible].

859
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,081
So,
you know,

860
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:20,120
that sort of thing could spiral out of 
control very,

861
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,220
very rapidly.
I dealt with that.

862
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:25,710
Well,
just one of the really intriguing things

863
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:30,050
about God
as well as the same,

864
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,660
which is sort of an unusual combination.
And there are many who,

865
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,820
uh,
as far as his sainthood,

866
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,500
we turn out not to be,
I mean witness Ben tollerene evangelists

867
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:41,334
and all that specific claim to authority
is being holier than the rest of us who 

868
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:46,244
then ultimately turn out to be that.
So there's still something very 

869
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:53,060
extraordinary about this personal 
discipline or whatever it was

870
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,840
what,

871
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,020
yeah,
you had sex with young women,

872
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,610
you're not calling that?

873
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:01,970
No,
no.

874
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,820
He just slept beside that.
Beside that.

875
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:05,940
Okay.
Yeah.

876
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,100
Yes.
Um,

877
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,370
and then to heighten his ability to 
resist,

878
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,610
that was his theory.
I mean,

879
00:52:11,611 --> 00:52:12,444
who knows.

880
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,393
Um,
what do you think of the difference 

881
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,174
between like,
the sort of second process of denying 

882
00:52:17,521 --> 00:52:18,354
the temptation versus like sort of 
denying other people's idea of like in 

883
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:23,880
both the same sort of,
similar in like you're saying,

884
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,323
um,
I'm acknowledging some part of me and 

885
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:28,794
they,
I mean,

886
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:29,790
they're both thing.
Um,

887
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,400
not acknowledging some,
pardon me,

888
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,253
like

889
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,330
no,
there's a difference between refusing to

890
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:35,164
acknowledge something and technology,
but picking a particular course of 

891
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:39,574
action,
like I may say say we're in involved in 

892
00:52:41,651 --> 00:52:44,320
a heated discussion and you make me 
angry.

893
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,573
I mean the appropriate response on my 
part is to recognize the fact that I am 

894
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:49,824
in,
that I am angry and north to pretend 

895
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:53,770
that I'm knowing because good people 
don't get angry.

896
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,990
But then once having recognized the 
fact,

897
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:56,824
choose that pattern of behavior that I 
feel is appropriate under those 

898
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:00,940
circumstances,
which might be to say,

899
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:01,983
you know,
we'd better stop having this discussion 

900
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:07,000
because I am in fact getting angry or,
or you might say something like,

901
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:08,403
um,
for reasons I don't understand entirely 

902
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:12,580
what you're saying is really irritating 
me.

903
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,150
I don't know necessarily where the ducks
up an appropriate reaction or not,

904
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,100
but it's really the one that I have.
That's the sort of thing it was actually

905
00:53:21,101 --> 00:53:22,200
put to some therapeutic can

906
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,840
you just fight people like Carl Rogers 
cause he used to do that sort of thing.

907
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:26,993
So it's not a matter of like,
it's not the pretense that the 

908
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:30,744
uncomfortable fact doesn't exist.
It's choosing to deal with it in some 

909
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:36,414
conscious man,
which means planned manner once it's 

910
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:39,700
actually manifest.

911
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,633
One other thing that you mentioned 
before we hit like most of the leaders 

912
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,313
seem to charismatic because they seem 
like they were unified in that like 

913
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:52,410
different president personality all sort
of fit together well.

914
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:53,953
Sure.
I would say now that you've been about 

915
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:55,244
someone like Hitler.

916
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:57,680
Yeah.
I mean if somebody's

917
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,890
in that way to differently,
depending on whether you follow all your

918
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:02,724
temptations and death,
like all your names of set as satisfied 

919
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,513
or

920
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,440
he just said when nature discuss 
morality,

921
00:54:08,441 --> 00:54:10,420
he said that most morality was 
cowardice,

922
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,700
which basically meant that it wasn't 
that people were good,

923
00:54:12,701 --> 00:54:13,534
it was just that they were far too 
afraid to act on those motivations but 

924
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:16,774
actually propelled them.
But at the motivations were there and 

925
00:54:19,781 --> 00:54:23,230
that given the opportunity with no with 
no chance of

926
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:25,363
Oh

927
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:27,570
punishment,
people would act them out.

928
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:29,490
And you see this sort of behavior in 
riots,

929
00:54:29,491 --> 00:54:32,550
for instance,
where the likelihood of being caught for

930
00:54:32,551 --> 00:54:35,550
committing a criminal act decreases to 
basically zero and you know,

931
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,120
anti anti social behavior,
so to speak,

932
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,040
spreads through the population like a 
play.

933
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,633
Oh,

934
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,193
I think the reason that people like 
hibbler are attractive from a 

935
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,494
charismatic perspective.
And this also goes from gangster 

936
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:52,680
figures,
for example,

937
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:53,514
in American movies.
So there's an absolute plethora is that 

938
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,830
people do tend to admire.

939
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:01,963
Okay.

940
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,933
People do tend to admire those 
individuals who may see as courageous 

941
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,860
enough so to speak,
to act on their darker impulses.

942
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,573
And I think the positive and the 
negative reason for that is pure desire 

943
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:16,104
to imitate.
But the positive aspect of that is that 

944
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,830
we know what some mythological level,
so to speak,

945
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:27,540
that
the movement from conventional cowardice

946
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,393
driven morality to a higher order 
morality involves necessarily taking 

947
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:32,694
into account a whole plethora of 
motivational states that are normally 

948
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,073
regarded as unacceptable,
like regression and the potential for 

949
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:42,480
cruelty.
And,

950
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:43,200
uh,
I'm,

951
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,020
I'm inhibited sexual desire and so on 
and so forth.

952
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,750
And
anyways,

953
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:49,584
that's part of the reason why I think 
we're attracted to people like gangster 

954
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:53,423
fingers.
Do you think it's also because we're 

955
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,910
witnessing someone with an effective 
strategy for accomplishing their goals?

956
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:03,860
I mean regardless of what the content of
that strategy is,

957
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,210
that's an overall construction.
It is.

958
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,880
Well they get,
sure you could do that.

959
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:12,090
And I would say that that's,
I would say that's more the negative end

960
00:56:12,091 --> 00:56:13,710
of the aberration.
I mean the point is,

961
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:16,140
is that,
did you ever see the movie goodfellas?

962
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:17,803
Yeah,
I hated that movie anyways cause I 

963
00:56:20,821 --> 00:56:24,280
actually thought it glorified the mom's 
terms under the guise of

964
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,940
showing how despicable they weren't.
But that's okay.

965
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,570
It's a debatable,
debatable proposition.

966
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:32,463
Certainly the goodfellas believe 
themselves to be certainly superior 

967
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:38,703
beings because they got what everyone 
else wanted without letting fear stop 

968
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:42,904
them.
And there's a certain element of truth 

969
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:44,464
to that because one of the things that 
does is stop many people from getting 

970
00:56:46,901 --> 00:56:48,010
what they want.
It's fear.

971
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:52,330
Now you can conclude from that,
that you should remove all fear and then

972
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:54,340
do whatever it takes to get exactly what
you want.

973
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,513
But you can conclude from that.
That fear is not necessarily sufficient 

974
00:56:59,681 --> 00:57:02,950
justification for not trying to pursue 
the things that

975
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:07,220
you want.
So coded interview data,

976
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,240
one of these firms,
it is them.

977
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,363
One of the questions that people had 
responded to was to name someone they 

978
00:57:15,381 --> 00:57:16,214
admired and why,
and this was seven years ago in a 

979
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:23,750
disproportionate number of people said 
that they admired Ross Perot.

980
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,303
Amazing they admired him is because 
essentially he seemed immune to social 

981
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:34,991
influence seem to uh,
people said things like,

982
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,780
I admire someone who stands up for what 
he believes in

983
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,080
whether or not other people agree with 
them.

984
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:45,290
Someone who that doesn't change his 
mind.

985
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,150
Okay.
Even when he's wrong,

986
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,073
even when he might be wrong,
someone who sticks with somebody about 

987
00:57:50,331 --> 00:57:55,331
these gangsters seems to resonate with 
that sense that they seem immune to,

988
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,533
well sure there's a certain,
there's a certain aspect of 

989
00:58:00,001 --> 00:58:01,950
individualism to that,
to that whole,

990
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,610
like in the gangster Motif,
it's criminal individualism,

991
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:10,290
but it's still indicative of the 
capacity to stand up,

992
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,920
up against group morality.
And the thing is,

993
00:58:12,921 --> 00:58:15,800
there is an aspect to heroic behavior,
so to speak,

994
00:58:15,801 --> 00:58:16,634
that requires the incorporation of the 
sorts of aggressive and defiant 

995
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:23,353
attitudes that,
that in and of themselves characterize 

996
00:58:26,511 --> 00:58:29,240
gangster behavior.
Now though I would say that

997
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,113
from the perspective of archetipal 
individual behavior on the positive 

998
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:36,104
side,
incorporation of those aggressive 

999
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,613
aspects is necessary.
But Darwin nation by the MS is counter 

1000
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:44,030
productive.
But that still doesn't mean,

1001
00:58:44,031 --> 00:58:44,864
you know,
if you're a little boy and you'd get 

1002
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:50,720
beat up on the playground,
you might say,

1003
00:58:50,721 --> 00:58:51,554
well it's better to respond nonviolent.
But really that's a mask for the fact 

1004
00:58:56,931 --> 00:59:01,730
that you had to swallow the defeat and 
couldn't respond violently if you wanted

1005
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,593
to.
Now the appropriate response to that 

1006
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:10,541
might be to develop the capacity to 
respond violently and effectively,

1007
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:15,130
but not to use it,
which is,

1008
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,013
which is to say the absence of the 
capacity to respond harshly is no 

1009
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:21,380
evidence for morality,
which is,

1010
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,040
uh,
which is

1011
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,010
a point you tried to make over and over 
and over again.

1012
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,850
So if you can't be cruel,
not being cruel is not moral,

1013
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,773
it's just,
it's just your rationalization for an 

1014
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:32,744
inability.
And I think that argument's very 

1015
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,700
powerful.
So I know,

1016
00:59:36,701 --> 00:59:37,534
I also think that's part of the reason 
why we're so drawn towards people who 

1017
00:59:39,921 --> 00:59:40,754
act out their darkest fantasies because 
they're doing something we would like 

1018
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,344
to,
but won't.

1019
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,900
That doesn't mean the thinker thinks 
should stop there.

1020
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:48,953
But say that Jesus' parable,
parable of the gnostic gospels that 

1021
00:59:51,041 --> 00:59:52,780
you're talking about,
the person acts,

1022
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,640
right?
Right.

1023
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:01,210
That's exactly what it's referring to
hold.

1024
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,080
There's this story that Christ is 
walking down the road on the sabbath and

1025
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:05,923
he sees a farmer in the ditch and he 
farmer sheep is falling into a hole and 

1026
01:00:09,921 --> 01:00:12,020
he's pulling the sheep out.
Christ says to him,

1027
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:14,270
if you know what you're doing,
do,

1028
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:15,740
you were blessed,
but if you don't,

1029
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:18,380
you're transgressor of the law in your 
curves.

1030
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,230
Anyone just walking down the street is 
the same idea.

1031
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,130
[inaudible].

1032
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,840
So the guy who was pulling out the 
sheep,

1033
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:27,674
if he's conscious,
has come to terms with his capacity to 

1034
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:30,854
violate social rules and this,
using that to pass being then to pursue 

1035
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:37,940
a higher order level of morality.
That's one way of interpreting the other

1036
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:38,774
way of interpreting it,
that he's just careless and acting and 

1037
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,023
callous self interest in it.
So it's the thing that's interesting 

1038
01:00:44,691 --> 01:00:47,720
about that as the same act.
It's just intense differ.

1039
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:52,103
How's that?

1040
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,363
Yeah.
You're not supposed to.

1041
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:57,470
No supposed to work on the Sabbath.
Oh,

1042
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,510
sorry.
Right,

1043
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,840
right.
That's the,

1044
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:01,520
that's the,
that's the law.

1045
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,480
The moral law.
Right.

1046
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,313
Flip it over and say,
if you were completely ignorant of the 

1047
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:09,980
law,
then he wasn't coming and we're cleaning

1048
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,060
meditative act against the law.

1049
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,460
Well,
the,

1050
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:15,293
the notion of being ignorant about the 
already doesn't enter into that 

1051
01:01:17,481 --> 01:01:18,620
particular parable.
To me,

1052
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:22,210
if you're completely ignorant of the law
and you break a rule,

1053
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,053
then you're in the situation of a child.
And really just like children bring 

1054
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,820
social norms all the time.
People don't make any presumptions about

1055
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:30,980
their evil.
And as a Jennifer rule,

1056
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:32,863
because they don't know the rule.
So the assumption that he knew it was 

1057
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,890
the sabbath,
right?

1058
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,733
That's the assumption.
The assumption is he knew it was the 

1059
01:01:37,871 --> 01:01:38,690
sound.
Exactly.

1060
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,470
That he wasn't just acting like,
I'm like remarkable ignorance.

1061
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,360
Okay.
So let's,

1062
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:49,343
I'm gonna read another story and this is
from soldier Knutsen and this has to do 

1063
01:01:52,741 --> 01:01:56,400
with the ideological version of 
authoritarianism.

1064
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,173
So Solzhenitsyn is lying with his friend
Hannon railway car that's being set up 

1065
01:02:02,791 --> 01:02:03,624
to transport prisoners from one 
concentration camp to another or to a 

1066
01:02:07,231 --> 01:02:11,610
concentration camp to begin with.
There's my friend Patton and I are lying

1067
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:12,653
on the middle shelf of a stolen and 
department and setting yourselves up 

1068
01:02:14,821 --> 01:02:17,550
comfortably.
Tarp salt hearing in our pockets so that

1069
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:19,110
we don't need water and can go to sleep.

1070
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,903
But at some station or other,
they shoved into our compartment of 

1071
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:23,264
Marxist scholar.
We can tell this from his goatee and 

1072
01:02:26,161 --> 01:02:28,980
spectacles.
He doesn't hide the fact.

1073
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,560
He's a former professor of the communist
academy.

1074
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,000
We hang head down in the square cutout 
and from his very first words,

1075
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:39,960
we see that he is impenetrable.
But we have been serving time for a very

1076
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:43,620
long time and we have a long time left 
to serve and we melt value.

1077
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,543
Uh,
Mary joke,

1078
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:45,893
we must climb down to have a bit of fun.
There's ample space left in the 

1079
01:02:48,781 --> 01:02:51,690
compartment and so we exchange places 
with someone in crowd in.

1080
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,490
Hello?
Hello?

1081
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:55,380
You're not too crowded.
No,

1082
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:58,350
it's all right.
Have you been in the jug a long time?

1083
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,620
Long enough?
Are you past the halfway mark?

1084
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,300
Just look over there.
How poverty's tricking our villages,

1085
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,700
our straw thatch,
crooked hats.

1086
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,270
It's an inheritance from the czarist 
regime.

1087
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,960
Well,
but we've already had 30 Soviet years.

1088
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,050
That's an insignificant period.
Historically,

1089
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,350
it's terrible that the collective 
farmers are starving,

1090
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:24,383
but have you looked in all their ovens?
Just ask any collective farmer NARC 

1091
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:28,910
compartment.
Well,

1092
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:31,170
everyone in jail is embittered in 
prejudiced,

1093
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:36,420
but I've seen collective farms myself.
That means they were uncharacteristic.

1094
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:39,810
The goatee had never been in any of them
that way.

1095
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:43,710
It was simpler.
Just ask the old folks under the czar,

1096
01:03:43,711 --> 01:03:45,510
they were well fed,
well closed,

1097
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:49,050
and they used to have many holidays.
I'm not even going to ask.

1098
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,750
It's a subjective trade of human memory 
to praise everything.

1099
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:53,460
In the past,
the cow,

1100
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:55,530
the died is the one that gave twice the 
milk.

1101
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,850
Sometimes even cited proverbs and our 
people don't like holidays.

1102
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,570
They'd like to work.
Why is there a shortage of brand in many

1103
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:06,600
cities when right before the war,
for example,

1104
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,540
not true before the war,
in fact,

1105
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:10,374
everything had been worked out,
falling into precisely at the same trap 

1106
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:13,620
he just described.

1107
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:15,803
Listen,
at that time in all the cities on the 

1108
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:19,740
vogue of the recuse of thousands of 
people,

1109
01:04:20,330 --> 01:04:22,470
well that was a local failure and 
supply,

1110
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,540
more likely your memory's failing you,
but there's a shortage now,

1111
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,913
old wives tales,
we have from seven to 8 billion bushels 

1112
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:33,230
of grain.
The grain is rotten,

1113
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:37,980
not so we have been successful in 
developing new varieties of grain and so

1114
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:39,570
forth.
He's imperturbable.

1115
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,493
He speaks in the language which requires
no effort of the mind and arguing with 

1116
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:44,364
him is like walking through a desert,
which is the emergence of some 

1117
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:48,660
mythological imagery.
By the way,

1118
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,453
it's about people like that that they 
say he made the rounds of all the 

1119
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:53,724
blacksmiths and came home on shot and 
when they write in their obituaries 

1120
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:01,260
perished tragically during the period of
the stellar count.

1121
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,230
It should be corrected to read perished 
karmically.

1122
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:06,840
But if his faith had worked out 
differently,

1123
01:05:06,841 --> 01:05:07,674
we would have never learned what a dry,
insignificant little man he was who 

1124
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:12,450
would respectfully read his name in the 
newspaper.

1125
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,433
He would've become people's commissar or
even venture to represent all Russia 

1126
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:19,390
abroad.
To argue with him was useless.

1127
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:21,490
It was much more interesting to play 
with him.

1128
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:26,230
Not a chess but at the game of comrades.
There really is such a game.

1129
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,360
It's a very simple game.
His play up,

1130
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:29,194
Tim a couple of times or so,
use some of his pet words and phrases 

1131
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:35,680
here like it for his.
He has grown accustomed to find that all

1132
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,514
around them are enemies.
He's become weary of snarling and 

1133
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,724
doesn't like to tell his stories because
all of them will be twisted around and 

1134
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:45,490
thrown right back in his face.
But if he takes you for one of his own,

1135
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:49,390
he will quite humanly disclosed to you 
what he is seen at the station.

1136
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:51,520
People are passing by,
laughs,

1137
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:52,383
laughing,
talking life goes on parties providing 

1138
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,640
leadership.
People are being moved from job to job,

1139
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:58,743
that's for sure.

1140
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:00,970
Yet you and are languishing here in 
prison.

1141
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:05,410
There are only a handful of us and we 
must write and write petitions,

1142
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:06,244
begging a review of our cases,
begging for a pardon or else he will 

1143
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:12,310
tell you something interesting.
In the Communist Academy,

1144
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:16,450
they decided to devour one comrade.
They decided he wasn't quite genuine,

1145
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:19,570
not one of our own,
but somehow they couldn't manage it.

1146
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:23,350
There were no errors in his essays and 
his biography was clean.

1147
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,720
Then all of a sudden going through the 
archives,

1148
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,554
what a fine.
They ran across an old low brochure 

1149
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,553
written by this comrade in which 
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself had held 

1150
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:35,290
in his hands and in the margin of which 
he had written in his own handwriting.

1151
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,870
The notation as an economist,
he is shit.

1152
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,910
Well now you understand.
Our companion smelled confidentially,

1153
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:43,863
but after that it was no trouble at all 
to make short work of that model had an 

1154
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,374
imposter.
He was expelled from the academy and 

1155
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:53,560
deprived of his scholarly rank.
The railroad cars go clicking along.

1156
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,740
Everyone has already asleep.
Some line down,

1157
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:57,693
some sitting up.
Sometimes a convoy guard passes along 

1158
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:01,204
the corridor yawning and one more 
unrecorded episode from Lennon's 

1159
01:07:05,141 --> 01:07:06,940
biography is lost from view.

1160
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:17,490
I read,
I read you that story because it is,

1161
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:18,473
it provides an interesting relationship 
between the adoption of a totalitarian 

1162
01:07:24,181 --> 01:07:27,570
position and the necessary consequence 
of that adoption,

1163
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,404
which is instantly the desire to torment
and persecute anyone who doesn't belong 

1164
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:36,780
to that particular tall attarian 
position.

1165
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:37,381
I would say,
well,

1166
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:39,570
it's not just a matter of,
um,

1167
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,560
the desire to protect the integrity of 
the totalitarian position.

1168
01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:44,543
That's part of it.
It's also the fact that adoption of the 

1169
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:49,524
totalitarian position allows those who 
have adopted it to rationalize and 

1170
01:07:54,001 --> 01:07:59,001
justify their admitted desires to take 
revenge on the world.

1171
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:01,921
And I would say,
well,

1172
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:02,754
why do they want to take revenge on the 
world and the revenge on the world in 

1173
01:08:05,281 --> 01:08:06,114
the form of other people?
Why would you want to take revenge on 

1174
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:11,310
the world?
It's because from your perspective,

1175
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:14,880
the world has tortured you unjustly and 
unfairly.

1176
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,520
And under those circumstances,

1177
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:20,810
the only logical thing to do is to,
in fact attempt to extract your revenge.

1178
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,203
Or we know already from looking at the 
myth of genesis and the kind of the 

1179
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:29,330
story of the fall of the Buddha,
that there's ample reason in the average

1180
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:30,164
human life.
You don't have to have a pathological 

1181
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:32,174
background to have had enough 
experiences to make it appear to you 

1182
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,033
with,
with,

1183
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:37,903
with,
with a substantial amount of 

1184
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:40,544
justification that the fundamental 
conditions of life are sufficiently 

1185
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:44,873
unfair.
So that the logical thing to do well 

1186
01:08:47,051 --> 01:08:49,850
being alive is to work for the 
destruction of life.

1187
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:52,863
When we're,
I said that we were going to spend a 

1188
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:55,034
fair amount of time trying to build up 
some representation of the personality 

1189
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,730
that is being used in mythology to 
represent the evil.

1190
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:04,180
And it's kind of complicated because it 
isn't some,

1191
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:08,900
it isn't something that you can just 
list asset as a set of fixed attributes.

1192
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:12,230
You have to get an idea of the dynamic 
nature of the process.

1193
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:13,543
And,
uh,

1194
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:14,503
while I'm trying to do that by telling 
you some different stories that 

1195
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:17,084
hopefully fit into a pattern,
but I also want to outline some of the 

1196
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:19,904
things that seem

1197
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:22,720
what you said earlier in the lecture is 
that,

1198
01:09:22,721 --> 01:09:23,554
um,
and you said this last section that 

1199
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:26,223
human,
that humans see more danger in the 

1200
01:09:30,161 --> 01:09:32,130
unknown that they,
because of their cognition,

1201
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:33,093
but what it seems to me,
what you just said right now is that 

1202
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,660
their cognition isn't necessarily made 
the end on a more potent,

1203
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:39,993
but that it attributes no tomorrow kinds
of things and the danger to more kinds 

1204
01:09:43,991 --> 01:09:45,340
of things.
And so this,

1205
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:49,270
this guy or people in that veteran a to 
talk to [inaudible] um,

1206
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:50,651
uh,
regime,

1207
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,840
whatever it can see the unknown and more
kinds of things,

1208
01:09:52,841 --> 01:09:53,674
the abstract it to other things rather 
than necessarily things be more potent 

1209
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,390
or I would say that it's also the case

1210
01:09:58,460 --> 01:09:59,293
does it,
you can see it we're animals wouldn't 

1211
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:04,870
see merely by party because you can 
switch frames of reference and something

1212
01:10:04,871 --> 01:10:08,050
that's known and one in one frame of 
reference is unknown in another.

1213
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:09,153
And you can also imagine there's ways 
where things that seem comfortable at 

1214
01:10:11,561 --> 01:10:14,200
the moment might indicate some potential
danger in the future,

1215
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,960
which is what you do when you worry.
And when you worry,

1216
01:10:16,961 --> 01:10:18,880
basically you're somewhere safe.
I mean,

1217
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:21,010
as a general rule,
it's not always the case.

1218
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,350
I mean,
if you're somewhere unsafe,

1219
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:26,380
then you're afraid of that and that's 
what we're worried you usually you're in

1220
01:10:26,381 --> 01:10:27,011
a,
you know,

1221
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:28,570
in your living room chair,
whatever.

1222
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,583
And you were attributing emergence's of 
the unknown to all sorts of 

1223
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,350
potentialities and perhaps trying to 
problem solve at the same time.

1224
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,530
What is,
what is unfair and unjust?

1225
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,290
Well,
I would say a unpredictable,

1226
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,124
that would be one aspect of it because 
you can't learn to avoid something 

1227
01:10:46,671 --> 01:10:48,350
that's unpredictable.
And also,

1228
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:49,463
um,
like I think we tend to regard a 

1229
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:51,374
punishment as just if it's only 
sufficient to eradicate the behavior 

1230
01:10:55,071 --> 01:10:55,904
that preceded it.

1231
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,780
So for example,
I mean we just,

1232
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:04,120
we strive towards that in the criminal 
justice system,

1233
01:11:04,121 --> 01:11:05,050
right?
That's what it means.

1234
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:07,120
That the punishment should fit the 
crime.

1235
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:07,851
Well,
first of all,

1236
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:10,880
I think is that there should be a crime.
And often we seem to be punished.

1237
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:12,790
And despite the fact that there's no 
evidence of crime,

1238
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,003
and it also should be that the,
the punishment is the right match for 

1239
01:11:17,791 --> 01:11:18,511
the crime.
And that's,

1240
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:20,100
it's hard to understand what that might 
mean.

1241
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:23,520
But if you look at how you treat,
we'll say a dog or that you're trying to

1242
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:27,750
train him to not do something,
if it pees on your rug for example,

1243
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,033
there might be a punishment that you 
would consider sufficiently matched to 

1244
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:37,521
that act so that it might be regarded by
the dog is just so,

1245
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:38,723
um,
like a swat on the behind with the 

1246
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:42,650
newspaper rather than,
you know,

1247
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,540
being beat half to death with a stick,
for example.

1248
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,750
So the source of the sense of 
appropriateness.

1249
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,120
Well,
wow,

1250
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,350
that's a good question.
I don't,

1251
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,480
I don't exactly know how that's worked 
out.

1252
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,130
I think a lot of it's trial and error.

1253
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,160
I can't really say much more about data 
at the moment.

1254
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:08,610
I mean it's partly looked like if say 
you're dealing,

1255
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:11,490
I see this with my children.
The question is how do you,

1256
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,900
how do you,
cause you,

1257
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:14,130
you,
you have to use,

1258
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,993
I think you have to use a
negative feedback as well as positive 

1259
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:24,540
feedback to set borders around children.
And then the question is,

1260
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,260
well where does the notion of what 
constitute just punishment come from and

1261
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,210
not sort of interaction?
Well,

1262
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,613
you have to experiment with people in a 
sense to determine the nature of their 

1263
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:36,630
temperament.
Because for some people,

1264
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,400
for my daughter,
for example,

1265
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:42,240
if I point my finger at her and say no,
she's doing something that she shouldn't

1266
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,470
do,
she'll stop.

1267
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,250
Whereas if I do that with my son,
well that's just irrelevant.

1268
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:50,100
I mean that that level of punishment is 
completely negligible.

1269
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,890
So for him,
what constitutes a just punishment?

1270
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:53,724
As far as I can tell,
it's something that's like higher up in 

1271
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:56,844
intensity than it is for my daughter.
And that's probably a matter of 

1272
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,690
temperament.
So,

1273
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,650
well that's possible.
He's also younger than her,

1274
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,850
you know,
but yeah,

1275
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:11,610
that
is more sensitive to punishment and they

1276
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:14,520
sell in the younger one.
Yeah,

1277
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:15,363
we have like my family here,
I would be the oldest and I was like 

1278
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,380
people being mad at me.
That was an,

1279
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,410
yeah.
Yeah.

1280
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:25,620
Next Sibling,
Dallas Wild One.

1281
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:28,230
You know here,
here's another example.

1282
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:31,230
In English common law,
you have the,

1283
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:32,753
you have the right to use reasonable 
force to protect yourself against 

1284
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:38,424
violation of your rights by an intruder,
which basically means that if someone 

1285
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,970
breaks into your house and you have a 45
revolver,

1286
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,280
you can't shoot them without saying 
stop.

1287
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,260
I mean it's a little more complex than 
that,

1288
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:50,094
but the point is is that you have to,
you have to use the minimum amount of 

1289
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:55,680
force that's necessary to stop the thing
that shouldn't be happening.

1290
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,190
And I think that's a,
like that's a critical aspect of justice

1291
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,700
along with the notion of predictability.
I think those are the two.

1292
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:05,430
Those are the two poles of justice as 
far as I'm concerned.

1293
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,680
Okay.
So anyways,

1294
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:08,514
what we're trying to do is to figure out
what his personality is characterized 

1295
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:12,484
by.
It's complex because there's a feedback 

1296
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:16,390
problem though.
I would say like why is it,

1297
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:22,380
see if I can get the argument down.
Pat Say

1298
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:29,280
the personality of evil is characterized
by a tendency to deny error,

1299
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:35,130
so a totalitarian personality is someone
who can admit to being wrong and I would

1300
01:14:35,131 --> 01:14:37,050
say,
well that's equivalent to not being able

1301
01:14:37,051 --> 01:14:39,360
to deny the existence of this 
information.

1302
01:14:39,361 --> 01:14:40,194
Because when you say I wasn't wrong,
what you're saying is that the 

1303
01:14:44,701 --> 01:14:45,534
information that I've received,
which indicates that there's a flaw in 

1304
01:14:48,271 --> 01:14:51,480
my argument actually doesn't exist.
There is no such flop,

1305
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:52,473
but she,
he might reinterpret the information or 

1306
01:14:54,211 --> 01:14:55,044
you might readjust your fear,
totality gelateria and idea to some 

1307
01:14:57,811 --> 01:15:00,330
degree to shut the ideo or effectively 
or whatever.

1308
01:15:00,331 --> 01:15:01,164
But it's,
I guess what I'm saying is that refusal 

1309
01:15:04,441 --> 01:15:05,274
to admit to error is exactly the same 
thing as a denial of anomalous 

1310
01:15:08,281 --> 01:15:09,114
information and I think that's why where
why one of the hallmark attributes of 

1311
01:15:13,861 --> 01:15:18,120
the devil in classical mythology is 
pride because that's what pride is.

1312
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:23,000
Pride is the statement on it's more than
that.

1313
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:25,790
It's normally the state that I never 
make a mistake,

1314
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:26,810
which is the,
for me,

1315
01:15:26,811 --> 01:15:31,190
there's no anomalous information.
That's also the statement for me.

1316
01:15:31,191 --> 01:15:34,400
There is no anomalous information,
isn't the statement for me.

1317
01:15:34,401 --> 01:15:38,600
There's no one that's Florida territory 
and the statement that for me,

1318
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:39,434
there's no unexplored territory.
It's exactly equivalent to the 

1319
01:15:41,631 --> 01:15:44,480
presumption of personal omniscience.
It's the same thing.

1320
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:47,450
If there's no unknown,
I know everything.

1321
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,190
Well,
Milton story,

1322
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:50,260
that's,
that's the,

1323
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,750
that's the story of Satan's fall as the 
description,

1324
01:15:53,751 --> 01:15:54,584
mythological description of a pattern of
behavior just characterized by implicit 

1325
01:15:58,131 --> 01:15:58,881
adoption,
loss,

1326
01:15:58,881 --> 01:16:00,710
explicit,
and that story explicit.

1327
01:16:00,711 --> 01:16:02,480
A dog should have a missed him.
So we're saying,

1328
01:16:02,481 --> 01:16:03,320
well,
what does that mean?

1329
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,333
Well,
it,

1330
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:05,183
it,
it instantly involves these other 

1331
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:07,330
things.
Pride,

1332
01:16:08,090 --> 01:16:11,690
arrogance,
totalitarianism.

1333
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:17,460
Now you might say that

1334
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:19,323
follower of a creed rather than the 
origin nater of a creed isn't someone 

1335
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:26,070
who's presuming personal omniscience.
What I would say,

1336
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:26,904
well,
they're even more corrupt than the 

1337
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:31,290
actual leader because they say,
well,

1338
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:32,580
he's the boss.
He's gone.

1339
01:16:32,581 --> 01:16:34,620
I'll do everything he tells me.
So they're actually,

1340
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:35,903
they're actually eliminating there.
At least the person who establishes the 

1341
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:43,110
dog dogma,
like Hitler for example,

1342
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,700
is taking a personal part in the 
construction of the theory.

1343
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:48,683
Someone who follows Hitler has 
completely abrogated any personal 

1344
01:16:52,081 --> 01:16:55,670
responsibility for making any moral 
judgements whatsoever to the leader.

1345
01:16:55,671 --> 01:16:58,770
So I think actually the followers are 
more pathological than the leader.

1346
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,953
But that's,
that's,

1347
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:02,520
I think that's true.
So these are,

1348
01:17:02,521 --> 01:17:05,970
these things all make a complex,
which is one of these natural categories

1349
01:17:05,971 --> 01:17:09,030
as far as I can tell.
And the question,

1350
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,160
well,
what are they lead to?

1351
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:12,260
Well,
I would say that the reason that there's

1352
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,094
a negative here and a negative here is 
because these two processes feedback 

1353
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:18,680
onto one another,
which is to say,

1354
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,570
remember,
all you have said that we had a set,

1355
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:23,540
it wasn't on a lonely age that made 
systems decrepit.

1356
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,670
It was the sins of men.
So then the question is,

1357
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:26,661
well,
what does it mean?

1358
01:17:26,661 --> 01:17:28,310
It was the sense of men.
You have to ask,

1359
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,144
what does sin mean?
Basically from the mythological 

1360
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:31,574
perspective.
And that gets you into a discussion of 

1361
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:34,640
the question of evil.
And I would say,

1362
01:17:34,641 --> 01:17:35,474
well the thing that underlies evil most 
fundamentally is the process of the 

1363
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:41,144
denial of anomalous information,
which is to say that you have a theory 

1364
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:45,680
kind,
a piece of evidence pops up,

1365
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:48,830
which according to your own criteria for
truth,

1366
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:50,173
because you set that as well,
indicates that your theory is actually 

1367
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:53,660
wrong.
It's not.

1368
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,330
It doesn't have to be objective back of 
any sort.

1369
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:57,523
It's by your own criteria.
Some things popped up that indicates 

1370
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:02,840
that you're wrong and you say,
well no,

1371
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:05,840
that thing doesn't exist and you can say
that lots of ways.

1372
01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:06,683
You can just
see Freud thought you had to actively 

1373
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:13,820
repress information,
anomalous or traumatic information,

1374
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:15,200
but that's not right.

1375
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,870
You don't have to actively repress it 
because it's a sin of omission and not a

1376
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:21,704
sin of commission.
Because if a piece of novel information 

1377
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:27,560
comes up and you do nothing about it,
then you haven't processed it.

1378
01:18:28,190 --> 01:18:29,610
Right.
It's to,

1379
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:30,444
to take into account a piece of global 
information means that you have to 

1380
01:18:33,141 --> 01:18:33,974
explore the thing that's normal,
draw the necessary behavioral 

1381
01:18:36,651 --> 01:18:39,500
conclusions and update your scheme of 
representation.

1382
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,513
So it isn't as if when something novel 
pops up and you admit to its existence 

1383
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,820
automatically the way you think is made 
proper,

1384
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:49,500
it's that to actually process something 
normal,

1385
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:51,800
you have to go through a tremendous 
amount of work.

1386
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:56,980
Some of the work which actually involved
one of these sense and resurrection,

1387
01:18:57,301 --> 01:18:58,670
so to speak,
that we talked about.

1388
01:18:58,671 --> 01:19:00,410
So if you're

1389
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,043
okay,

1390
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:05,930
finish the argument here in a sec.
Uh,

1391
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,940
so we have,
we have a sin as to the Nile of anomaly,

1392
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:11,250
but we have original sin already is 
curiosity,

1393
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:16,220
which is precisely the opposite.
Hmm.

1394
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:17,913
Okay.
Let me see if

1395
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:26,020
it's more than of curiosity.
It's the

1396
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:32,500
desire to be on a status.
It's also dial.

1397
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:34,253
I guess

1398
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:37,380
we expressed it as curiosity here last 
week.

1399
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:38,673
Yeah.
You also mentioned last week if there 

1400
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:41,273
was it.
There was a paradoxical aspect to that 

1401
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:47,040
because the gnostics for example 
regarding the serpent tempted,

1402
01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:51,900
Adam and Eve has a higher order day than
the god that had created things to begin

1403
01:19:51,901 --> 01:19:52,734
with.
And that was a heretical position from 

1404
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:54,924
the perspective of the sec that 
developed into the standard Christian 

1405
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,793
Church.
But it's also the case that even in 

1406
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,280
Catholicism in the mini and medieval 
era,

1407
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:03,953
original sin was regarded as a fortunate
sin because it was a precondition the 

1408
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,530
for the drama of the passion.
So you could say,

1409
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:14,850
well
original sin was regarded as a precursor

1410
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:18,750
of evil because it was curiosity that 
knocked Adam and eve out of paradise.

1411
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:19,584
And also the took the boot outside of 
the walled city that his father had set 

1412
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:23,814
up.
So from that perspective it's very 

1413
01:20:25,171 --> 01:20:26,004
negative,
which is to say that it's curiosity and 

1414
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,080
that brings a nominalist information to 
into an otherwise stable system.

1415
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:33,840
But from another perspective,
which is broader,

1416
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:36,840
I think you might regard it as a 
fortunate proclivity.

1417
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:40,890
So I think it depends on your,
on your temporal frame of reference.

1418
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:43,410
And I don't think,
I think that's a kind of a standard.

1419
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,080
I think that's a reasonable 
interpretation.

1420
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:46,914
It's something we'll return to actually 
in the last lecture of this course 

1421
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:53,610
because there's a myth that young pulled
out from England that actually addresses

1422
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:56,910
that point directly.
It's just a paragraph long,

1423
01:20:56,911 --> 01:20:57,744
but it describes,
well it tries to put original sin into 

1424
01:21:01,051 --> 01:21:05,250
the context of the whole,
the whole story of redemption,

1425
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:07,110
which isn't just Christian,
it's just the story,

1426
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,543
you know,
a stable preexistence state 

1427
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,040
deterioration into a state of chaos and 
then a regeneration on a more integrated

1428
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:14,874
playing original sin.
Original sin is a portrait and 

1429
01:21:16,961 --> 01:21:18,600
necessarily a problem.
Sure.

1430
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:21,570
I mean if you look at it from the 
perspective of being in chaos,

1431
01:21:21,571 --> 01:21:22,740
so we say you're in chaos.

1432
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:23,191
You say,
well,

1433
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:24,450
what got me here?
Well,

1434
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:28,800
if I were to just shut up and not 
bothered going down that path,

1435
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,800
that my curiosity drove me down,
then I'd still be,

1436
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:34,110
you know,
sitting comfortably ensconced at home.

1437
01:21:34,111 --> 01:21:38,190
I wouldn't be in this horrible stew of 
emotional wretchedness that I'm in,

1438
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:39,480
which is,
and I think you know,

1439
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:41,460
if you think about that story read 
large,

1440
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:42,710
the notion is,
you know,

1441
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,553
if we wouldn't have developed this 
cortical cap that allows us the ability 

1442
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:47,394
to manipulate abstract bits of 
information had never become self 

1443
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:54,230
conscious at all.
We would have been in a,

1444
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:55,313
in a paradise light position like the 
animals who are in a sense beyond good 

1445
01:21:58,831 --> 01:22:00,060
and evil.
Now,

1446
01:22:00,061 --> 01:22:02,030
Voltaire said,
well not,

1447
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:05,790
I included Voltaire's little commentary 
on that line of logic and he said,

1448
01:22:05,791 --> 01:22:08,970
well,
what's the,

1449
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,690
I know more succinctly putting this,
I don't remember who said this,

1450
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,960
it's better to be an unhappy philosopher
than a happy paying that sort of nest.

1451
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:21,960
You can also think of that as a form of 
pride anyways.

1452
01:22:23,220 --> 01:22:25,380
Of course the ultimate attainment is to 
be an unhappy pain

1453
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:28,920
anyways.
Okay.

1454
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,023
Have you not considered modifying your 
vocabulary since the meeting of your 

1455
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:38,244
vocabulary in this climate is it takes 
on the meaning of that which would have 

1456
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:44,394
been taught the representative of the 
church where it's where the devil will 

1457
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:49,764
be used to.
Describe the stranger and evil will be 

1458
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,230
used to describe things that go against 
the car and moral code?

1459
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,100
Well,
I don't have,

1460
01:22:58,101 --> 01:22:58,934
I not considered one to five my 
terminology because because of that 

1461
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:02,590
likelihood,
I mean

1462
01:23:03,890 --> 01:23:06,070
are you not concerned?
It causes so

1463
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:09,040
much confusion to use,
to use the,

1464
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:12,820
to use a word that has been used both as
the,

1465
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,950
uh,
denial of anomalous information and also

1466
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:18,784
the generation of new information 
depending on the perspective of the 

1467
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:24,100
person who sets you apart,
like are taking a very sophisticated use

1468
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:25,540
of the word devil.
Yes.

1469
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,433
Well,
hopefully

1470
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:30,100
your readers haven't,
don't have,

1471
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,770
you're a sophisticated use of the word 
devil.

1472
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:38,610
The devil is the devil because in your 
shoulder and mercy from God whispers bad

1473
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:40,860
things in the area,
which is what you know,

1474
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:41,863
and it tells you,
it tells you that you should break away 

1475
01:23:43,391 --> 01:23:44,290
from the long curved.

1476
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:46,370
Right.
But that's all.

1477
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,690
But that's also the case,
like for example,

1478
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,730
in this parallel,
but you brought up again,

1479
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:53,340
I mean depending on the,
okay,

1480
01:23:53,341 --> 01:23:56,310
so there's a guy in the ditch,
he's taking a sheep out of the whole,

1481
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:59,730
well,
the reason that he's doing it determines

1482
01:23:59,731 --> 01:24:02,670
the morality of the action,
not the fact of the action.

1483
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:07,440
So the problem is is that it is the case
upon occasion that the thing that tempts

1484
01:24:07,441 --> 01:24:12,390
you away from group identification is 
not the positive exploratory spirit.

1485
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:13,733
Like,
okay.

1486
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:16,223
I would say there are two consequences.
There are two political consequences to 

1487
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:22,920
the refusal to admit to anomalous 
information.

1488
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,920
And one is the construction of a 
totalitarian state,

1489
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:30,180
either as something that defines your 
personality or as something that defines

1490
01:24:30,181 --> 01:24:31,014
your whole culture,
depending on how pervasive that 

1491
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:33,324
particular pattern of action is.
And that's the one I'm kind of most 

1492
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:39,270
interested in because it's being 
totalitarian and fascist states that,

1493
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:42,240
at least in the 20th century appeared 
and I've done the most damage.

1494
01:24:42,570 --> 01:24:45,750
But there's also another form of 
political disintegration that that might

1495
01:24:45,751 --> 01:24:50,250
be more clearly classified as decadence 
and decadence,

1496
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:55,251
is the refusal to adhere to a,
to a traditional morality to begin with,

1497
01:24:56,610 --> 01:24:57,443
justified by arguments such as well 
that's all archaic and useless 

1498
01:25:01,681 --> 01:25:04,560
information to anyhow and free spirits 
such as myself,

1499
01:25:04,620 --> 01:25:05,453
which means I'm disciplined and useless 
creatures in their totality or actually 

1500
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:10,590
the kind of heroes who are going to 
transform the world.

1501
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:15,410
So I would say that for people who are 
following the roof to decadence,

1502
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,340
so to speak,
when the devil talks,

1503
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:18,480
he says,
uh,

1504
01:25:18,570 --> 01:25:21,900
cultural rules are all tyrannical and 
nonsense.

1505
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,560
So the problem is,
is it the,

1506
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:25,633
the interpretation of the process is 
entirely context dependent and you 

1507
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:31,104
can't,
you can't make it simple for that fact 

1508
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,133
because the same act in two different 
consequences can have two completely 

1509
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:40,440
different moral advances.
Nisha said at one point,

1510
01:25:40,441 --> 01:25:41,700
you know,
if you're,

1511
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,190
if you're out in the front of your 
group,

1512
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:47,310
the first thing you should make sure of 
is that you're not running away.

1513
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:48,960
Like you're thinking,
Hey,

1514
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:50,820
I'm going out here in front.
I am leading.

1515
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:53,220
But the truth of the matter is you might
no be meeting at all.

1516
01:25:53,670 --> 01:25:54,503
You might just be running away as fast 
as you can and using the idea of your 

1517
01:25:57,901 --> 01:26:00,630
leadership to justify the fact that you 
just can't cut it.

1518
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:02,243
And like a lot of what passes for 
counter cultural creativity and 

1519
01:26:07,190 --> 01:26:08,023
revolutionary thinking is not at all 
that heroic Willem wave from the 

1520
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:16,740
confines of group identification,
but pure lack of disciplined,

1521
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:20,880
a pure lack of discipline masquerading 
as heroin.

1522
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:24,070
And it's just as dangerous as fascist I 
think.

1523
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:25,243
And it's also a precursor to fascism 
because if you get a society that 

1524
01:26:28,291 --> 01:26:29,124
sufficiently disordered,
what that will produce is a tremendous 

1525
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:35,720
desire for the establishment of a rigid,
rigid structure.

1526
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,890
So
anyways,

1527
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:40,540
is that,
does that,

1528
01:26:40,540 --> 01:26:41,373
uh,
well I think that was just saying 

1529
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,360
perhaps the devil bagels is writing 
about,

1530
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:46,040
it's not the same.

1531
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,090
Definitely the cheer writing.
Well you the,

1532
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:50,600
yeah,
I think that's true,

1533
01:26:50,601 --> 01:26:51,434
but the,
the only way I can think of it is the 

1534
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:56,180
same in a way.
The question,

1535
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,014
and I think it is,
or the issue is to develop a 

1536
01:26:58,251 --> 01:27:01,820
sufficiently delineated notion of what 
constitutes evil.

1537
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,923
So that we can see the difference 
between the things that are just 

1538
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:06,403
normally classified into that domain in 
the things that should be classified 

1539
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:11,700
into the dome.
So,

1540
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:14,480
so symbol,
it operates on many levels

1541
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:21,420
to make sure you're talking about which 
level you're referring to it on theirs.

1542
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,910
It's hard to say.
It's hard to say.

1543
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:25,370
We also,
you could have been referred to it since

1544
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:26,204
the whole,
since what you're doing is this is the 

1545
01:27:27,501 --> 01:27:30,020
whole mythology of the devil.
Well,

1546
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:32,060
you know,
saw you run into a problem like this,

1547
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:32,894
we know familiar and is portable.
Them see you're reading your demo is 

1548
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:39,020
from paradise lost,
which is a different depth.

1549
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:41,780
I never read paradise.
I grew up with the devil,

1550
01:27:41,781 --> 01:27:44,930
which isn't the same devil once your 
done reading very different.

1551
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:46,430
Right,
right.

1552
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:47,960
You're a devil is like,
um,

1553
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:51,660
is like the Godfather,
you know?

1554
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:53,750
But well,
I would say,

1555
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:54,584
I would say it is the,
it is the case that what Milton do did 

1556
01:27:57,801 --> 01:27:58,634
was attempt to codify what he saw as the
fundamental traditions of the devil and 

1557
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:05,300
Christian and True Christian mythology 
that had be,

1558
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,090
and it'd be gathered up to that point.
It's like,

1559
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,230
here's an example.
Look,

1560
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:12,320
we know familiarity,
that it's a natural tendency,

1561
01:28:12,321 --> 01:28:13,154
so to speak,
to assimilate the forerunner to the 

1562
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:17,780
dragon of chaos,
right?

1563
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:18,663
Is that it's not even an assimilation.
It's a natural tendency of people to be 

1564
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:24,290
unable to distinguish the 400 from the 
dragon of chaos.

1565
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:25,333
Well,
we know that dragon imagery plays a 

1566
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:29,240
large part in our mythology of evil.

1567
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:30,463
So it's very,
it's very easy for us to contaminate up 

1568
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,010
our notion of,
you know,

1569
01:28:34,011 --> 01:28:36,620
the serpentine aspect of evil with the 
foreigner.

1570
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,810
What I'm trying to do is to say,
well,

1571
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:39,644
look there,
there are some things that we tend 

1572
01:28:41,061 --> 01:28:43,800
naturally to regard as evil because 
they're negatively valence,

1573
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:49,230
that that are only tangentially in 
situationally associated with evil.

1574
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,760
But there is one thing at the core which
is a process that that is actually right

1575
01:28:55,281 --> 01:29:00,281
at the basis of the evil.
Oh and I'm,

1576
01:29:00,431 --> 01:29:02,490
I'm trying to build up a map of what 
that,

1577
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:06,330
of what that her a personality 
characterized by that process with me.

1578
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,141
Sorry.
I said,

1579
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:07,974
well the first thing is,
is that the totalitarian personality 

1580
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,890
rejects any notion of the possibility of
personal layer.

1581
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,990
Now people sometimes hide from 
themselves when they're doing by saying,

1582
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:19,824
well,
it isn't that I'm personally omnicell 

1583
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:21,853
and it's that I'm an adherence say of 
Communist ideology and it's Communist 

1584
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:24,810
ideology.

1585
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,750
That's absolutely right.
And I just happened to believe it.

1586
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:28,763
But I think that's just rationalization 
is you get all of the advantages of 

1587
01:29:31,051 --> 01:29:34,650
being on this yet without any of the,
without any of the disadvantages.

1588
01:29:34,651 --> 01:29:36,000
So it's really,
it's really,

1589
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:40,420
really powerful.
So you can see how arrogance is relating

1590
01:29:40,421 --> 01:29:41,254
to that without any problem.
But there's also the notion of this act 

1591
01:29:44,101 --> 01:29:47,520
is there's an underlying notion there of
the sacrifice of the hero,

1592
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:51,330
which is also implicit in the whole 
notion of the rejection of the anomalous

1593
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:52,164
information.
Cause we said already that the positive 

1594
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:55,314
aspect of the individual is the aspect 
that voluntarily admits to the presence 

1595
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:03,900
of anomalous information and then 
modifies worldview,

1596
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:08,460
either his coworkers or the whole 
society as a consequence of that contact

1597
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:09,294
with no.
So there's recognition of the 

1598
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,143
uncomfortable fact,
then exploration of the fact then 

1599
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:15,714
generation of an adaptive structure to 
deal with the fact and then 

1600
01:30:17,941 --> 01:30:20,760
communication of that adaptive structure
out into this social community.

1601
01:30:20,940 --> 01:30:24,360
And that's the hero of pattern.
Well if you don't do that,

1602
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:27,360
if you do the opposite,
then that's tantamount to rejecting that

1603
01:30:27,361 --> 01:30:28,194
whole process.
So I would say that someone who refuses 

1604
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:31,674
to admit to the possibility of personal 
error also sacrifices their identity 

1605
01:30:35,461 --> 01:30:37,980
with the heroic aspect of the 
individual.

1606
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:40,530
That's also a necessary consequence.
And then you say,

1607
01:30:40,531 --> 01:30:43,740
well what are the consequences of that?
Well,

1608
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,060
the consequences,
they're simple.

1609
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:46,763
First of all,
there's only two ways of protecting 

1610
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:49,074
yourself against the unknown.
One is by directing group 

1611
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:55,650
identification.
And the other is by identifying with the

1612
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:59,100
process that makes sense of the unknown.
And most people do both.

1613
01:30:59,101 --> 01:31:00,560
And that's perfectly reasonable costs,
right?

1614
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:02,760
We had doctor,
our group identifications,

1615
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:03,594
and then we try to make sense of those 
things that are anomalous that happened 

1616
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:08,580
to us personally.
So that's a nice balance.

1617
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,370
So you can either identify with the 
hero,

1618
01:31:11,371 --> 01:31:13,800
so to speak,
or you can identify with the group.

1619
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:17,370
If you forsake your identification with 
the hero voluntarily,

1620
01:31:17,371 --> 01:31:21,810
which is to say that you say there is no
such thing as anomalous information,

1621
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:23,083
then the only thing that you've got left
to protect yourself with his 

1622
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:25,854
identification with the group,
and that makes the likelihood that 

1623
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:31,590
you'll identify rigidly with the group 
much,

1624
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,620
much higher because you don't have an 
alternative anymore.

1625
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,240
So like if you know that you can cope,
then if someone comes along,

1626
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:41,473
well,
let's take a look at this in terms of 

1627
01:31:42,181 --> 01:31:43,950
personal relationships.
Like let's say you,

1628
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:47,940
because I have a personal relationship,
can adopt to totalitarian,

1629
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:49,713
uh,
can adopt the totalitarian mode with no 

1630
01:31:52,891 --> 01:31:53,724
problem.
Let's say you're extremely dependent on 

1631
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:59,530
the person that you're associating with 
and,

1632
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:01,690
uh,
someone threatened stuff person.

1633
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:03,183
Well,
you're going to get extraordinarily 

1634
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:09,420
upset about this because you've 
sacrificed your own ability to deal with

1635
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:11,470
that known through your dependency.

1636
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,543
So you're much more likely to need the 
person that you're with than would 

1637
01:32:15,641 --> 01:32:16,990
otherwise be the case.
In fact,

1638
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:18,123
you're going to be so dependent on them 
that you're going to use all sorts of 

1639
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,710
vicious underground tricks to ensure 
that they don't abandon you.

1640
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:24,933
But anyways,
the point is is that if you eliminate 

1641
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:30,070
this as a possibility,
basically the,

1642
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:31,053
the theory runs like this,
you draw the conclusion that the 

1643
01:32:33,221 --> 01:32:36,700
negative aspect of the unknown is so 
terrible that there's no possible way it

1644
01:32:36,701 --> 01:32:37,534
can be dealt with.
Which is to say you're making the 

1645
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:42,250
presupposition that life is too terrible
to bear.

1646
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:43,473
As a consequence,
you eliminate your identification with 

1647
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:48,070
the positive aspect of that,
of the individual.

1648
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:52,220
That makes you much more likely to adopt
tie,

1649
01:32:52,221 --> 01:32:55,240
ironical identification with the 
patriarchal structure.

1650
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,403
Cause you've,
you don't have a process that you can 

1651
01:32:57,731 --> 01:32:59,080
actually engage in contacting.

1652
01:32:59,130 --> 01:32:59,963
Yeah,
I know.

1653
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:01,683
So

1654
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:05,660
it's also the case that is,
Yep.

1655
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,273
Yep.

1656
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:08,283
Is the opposite of work.
What goes to the negatives there was if 

1657
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:12,304
you rejected them,
occasional group and only would be your 

1658
01:33:15,301 --> 01:33:16,134
role.

1659
01:33:16,930 --> 01:33:18,760
The opposite of,
oh well I would say,

1660
01:33:18,810 --> 01:33:19,541
hmm.
No,

1661
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:24,541
I would say [inaudible] is a consequence
of viewing the tyrannical ass of viewing

1662
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:26,674
society is only tyrannical and seeing 
that as even more of a danger than the 

1663
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:33,540
negative aspect of the unknown because 
it has a positive aspect too.

1664
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:38,270
So I say in both cases,
decadence or fascism,

1665
01:33:38,290 --> 01:33:39,760
there's,
it's still characterized by,

1666
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:43,390
by the elimination of identification 
with the hero.

1667
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:46,210
The hero is the opposite.
True possible,

1668
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,900
which is elimination of identification 
with a group.

1669
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,600
Oh yes.
Oh yes.

1670
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:53,351
I see.
On that level.

1671
01:33:53,351 --> 01:33:54,370
That would be decadence.
Yeah.

1672
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,770
Then that would be bad.
Yeah.

1673
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:57,963
If it's motivated,
if it's actually motivated by the 

1674
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:00,844
inability to put up with any discipline 
because the problem with like group 

1675
01:34:04,151 --> 01:34:04,984
identification has a cost.
I mean you have to follow the rules and 

1676
01:34:07,931 --> 01:34:10,510
that's hard.
Now for some people,

1677
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,550
the threat of following the rules is 
more to be feared than the threat of the

1678
01:34:15,551 --> 01:34:16,210
unknown.

1679
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:18,320
Especially given like if you're a 
decadent,

1680
01:34:18,321 --> 01:34:19,154
so to speak,
you get to revel in all the positive 

1681
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:23,380
aspects of chaos as well.
So you get to,

1682
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,573
you know,
maybe you have an ex exceptionally 

1683
01:34:25,841 --> 01:34:30,400
promiscuous lifestyle and you use all 
the mood altering drugs you can get your

1684
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:33,640
hands on and,
and you live for the pleasurable moment.

1685
01:34:33,641 --> 01:34:36,340
So I mean there's lots of positive 
aspects to chaos,

1686
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:37,203
right?
And that are hidden from you by the 

1687
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:43,870
necessity of identifying with the group.
So it doesn't,

1688
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:46,430
the thing that deck the decadence takes 
place in a,

1689
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:51,070
in a highly developed societies so that 
you can sort of take for granted all the

1690
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:51,983
politics society has given you.
And that's why you're getting the 

1691
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:58,060
positive out of the unknown because 
you're just sort of thing you're denying

1692
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,881
it.
You have to follow the rules,

1693
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:00,870
but at the same time,
wrestling on all the time.

1694
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:03,110
Absolutely.
It's a short,

1695
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,303
of course that's exactly the cakes is 
that you're protected by the thing you 

1696
01:35:08,841 --> 01:35:11,480
despise despite the fact that you 
despise it.

1697
01:35:11,481 --> 01:35:12,314
It's so powerful that it can bear you 
along while you're doing everything you 

1698
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:16,550
can to undermine it.
Sure.

1699
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:18,370
That happens all the time.
You know,

1700
01:35:19,190 --> 01:35:20,023
Nisha said at one point,
I mean this is the kind of statement 

1701
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:25,100
that can be easily interpreted as 
fascist and you know,

1702
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:26,420
need,
she gets interpreted that way now.

1703
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:29,270
And then he said the strength of a 
society can be measured by the number of

1704
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:31,650
parasites that it can bear.
But he,

1705
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:34,070
what he hit the point he was making was 
that the point you're making.

1706
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,570
So although,
you know,

1707
01:35:37,571 --> 01:35:40,600
you can see how taking out the context 
that that statement perhaps

1708
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:42,973
well can be viewed as support for an 
exceptionally powerful right wing 

1709
01:35:46,290 --> 01:35:47,060
position.

1710
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:47,860
Okay.
So,

1711
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:50,630
but you know,
I'm not getting at it yet exactly what I

1712
01:35:50,631 --> 01:35:52,460
want to get at.
So we have a personality.

1713
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,430
It's characterized by all these 
necessary consequences.

1714
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:57,680
There's no anomaly that's equivalent to 
saying,

1715
01:35:57,681 --> 01:35:59,670
I know everything,
uh,

1716
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:01,273
identity identification with the group 
is also equivalent to rejection of the 

1717
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:06,890
heroic.
But the other thing is,

1718
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:07,724
is that right?

1719
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:18,770
That's the motive that I really want to 
get at.

1720
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:28,860
The idea I guess is that the development
of self consciousness,

1721
01:36:28,861 --> 01:36:31,810
which means knowledge of mortality,
um,

1722
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:36,900
heightens the negative valence of the 
unknown to such a degree where it's easy

1723
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:41,610
to draw the logical conclusion that life
is such an unfair process than it should

1724
01:36:41,611 --> 01:36:45,150
be brought to an end.
And I wanted to read you a quote from,

1725
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:51,380
from Girtha mean characterizes 
Mephistopheles,

1726
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:53,433
uh,

1727
01:36:57,730 --> 01:36:58,563
Mephistopheles central thesis.
So mephistopheles means Prince of lies 

1728
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:04,583
and alive.
So that's another attribute of the 

1729
01:37:06,131 --> 01:37:06,964
classical devil.
And of course the lie is that anomalous 

1730
01:37:09,941 --> 01:37:13,600
information that upsets your particular 
system of belief doesn't exist.

1731
01:37:13,601 --> 01:37:16,000
That's what characterizes and lie.
Anyways,

1732
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:19,240
Mephistopheles has an express credo and 
it goes something like this.

1733
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:24,370
The spirit I that endlessly denies and 
rightly too,

1734
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:29,520
for all that comes to birth is fit for 
overthrow as nothing worth wherefore the

1735
01:37:29,741 --> 01:37:31,330
world.
We're better sterilized.

1736
01:37:31,810 --> 01:37:32,643
That's all that's here is evil 
recognized his gain to me and downfall 

1737
01:37:35,561 --> 01:37:38,470
runes sin,
the very element type prosper in.

1738
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:44,560
And guess that repeats that philosophy 
in part two of files.

1739
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,130
T says this is memphis softly speaking 
again,

1740
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:52,630
gone to share,
nothing passed with no made one.

1741
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:55,150
What manages our creative,
endless toil.

1742
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,183
When Adis snatch oblivion ends the coil.
That's the question that's posed in 

1743
01:37:59,071 --> 01:37:59,790
genesis.

1744
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,850
It is by gone.
How shall this riddle run?

1745
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:08,130
As good as if things never had begun yet
circleback existence to possess.

1746
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,143
I'd rather have eternal emptiness.
So mephistopheles credo is basically 

1747
01:38:14,461 --> 01:38:19,461
that the evidence implies that the 
conditions of existence are sufficiently

1748
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:20,574
unfair in and of themselves,
such that it would be better if nothing 

1749
01:38:23,461 --> 01:38:24,294
existed at all.
And I would say that's that conclusion 

1750
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:28,231
is,
well,

1751
01:38:28,231 --> 01:38:29,064
first of all,
it to conclusion that people draw from 

1752
01:38:30,241 --> 01:38:32,610
time to time on the basis of the 
evidence that exists.

1753
01:38:32,850 --> 01:38:33,683
But I would also say that if you abandon
your identification with the process 

1754
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:38,454
that makes order out of chaos,
that's the conclusion that you 

1755
01:38:40,351 --> 01:38:41,184
necessarily have to draw as a 
consequence of the nature of your 

1756
01:38:43,801 --> 01:38:44,634
experience.
Because if you eliminate from your life 

1757
01:38:47,851 --> 01:38:48,684
all those things that are positive,
which occur as a consequence of your 

1758
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,670
voluntary tendency to move out into the 
world,

1759
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:54,593
all that you'll be left with necessarily
is constantly evidence of the existence 

1760
01:38:58,441 --> 01:39:01,020
of unwarranted pain and suffering.

1761
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:02,153
And under those conditions,
the only logical conclusion to draw is 

1762
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:05,034
that any state of existence that is 
characterized by constant in one 

1763
01:39:08,610 --> 01:39:09,443
unwarranted pain and suffering obviously
deserves to be youth and angst 

1764
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,633
eradicated.
And I think that's the motive that 

1765
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:21,171
underlies the acts of genocide that 
accompany totalitarian thinking.

1766
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:23,143
But here's an example.
There's recent biography of Stellan 

1767
01:39:25,381 --> 01:39:27,030
published.
I've only read a review of it.

1768
01:39:27,260 --> 01:39:30,480
Two books actually I want to pick up 
that have been written very recently.

1769
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:31,314
They are very relevant to this course 
and that's one of them based on archive 

1770
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,550
material.
Well,

1771
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,493
the biographer reveals that still in 
this sort of person that we've been 

1772
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:42,570
describing.
I mean he was an extraordinary and cruel

1773
01:39:42,571 --> 01:39:44,160
person,
rigid totalitarian,

1774
01:39:44,161 --> 01:39:45,990
paranoid.
Well,

1775
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:46,824
what was his plan?
This biography thinks there's a good 

1776
01:39:48,841 --> 01:39:49,674
possibility that he was murdered,
which is a good thing by all 

1777
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:53,990
appearances.
Um,

1778
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:58,590
it looks like what stolen was doing pr 
prior to his demise was,

1779
01:39:58,780 --> 01:39:59,550
well,
he like his,

1780
01:39:59,550 --> 01:40:00,383
his acts of evil had escalated in 
magnitude over the course of the years 

1781
01:40:03,241 --> 01:40:04,140
that he was in power.

1782
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,213
And as he got more and more powerful,
that domain of visibility to put his 

1783
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:13,791
evil fantasies into action increased 
this burger for claims that Stellan near

1784
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:18,630
in the years that led up to his death 
was in facts planning to start a nuclear

1785
01:40:18,631 --> 01:40:19,464
war with the West.
And that all of the systematic acts of 

1786
01:40:22,501 --> 01:40:23,334
genocide that he had committed in the 
Soviet Union might be regarded as trial 

1787
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:28,620
runs,
which I would think of as practice.

1788
01:40:28,621 --> 01:40:31,110
You know,
the first person is hard to kill,

1789
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:32,023
but once you kill one person,
one of the second person isn't so hard 

1790
01:40:33,631 --> 01:40:34,800
to kill him.
And once you get to,

1791
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:38,430
well it's not so hard to wipe out 20 and
maybe once you're pretty good at that,

1792
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:39,653
a thousand doesn't bother you anymore 
and then you can practice on a few 

1793
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:43,103
million.
And if that really doesn't distress you 

1794
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:45,960
too much,
well then there's always the possibility

1795
01:40:46,200 --> 01:40:47,700
of blowing up the whole world.

1796
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:49,920
And that's what motivated Stella.
And I think,

1797
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:53,290
and I would also say that those of us 
who,

1798
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:54,543
who tend to think of people like Stellan
and Hitler as entirely foreign entities 

1799
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,680
haven't come to term with the sock 
terms,

1800
01:40:59,681 --> 01:41:00,514
with the fact that there's a big chunk 
of our personality whose credo is 

1801
01:41:03,401 --> 01:41:04,234
precisely that have Mephistopheles,
which is that the world and its 

1802
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:08,044
conditions are so unfair in reality that
the best thing we could possibly happen 

1803
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:15,670
would be for all this to come to an end 
as rapidly as possible.

1804
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,860
And I would say that under normal 
conditions,

1805
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:19,323
we work out of this part of our 
personality and this part of our 

1806
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:22,264
personality too.
And generally it's a tossup which part 

1807
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:28,360
gets the upper hand.
So to the degree that this part gets the

1808
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:29,890
upper hand,
which is pretty constant,

1809
01:41:31,180 --> 01:41:35,560
the likelihood of a tear radical state 
increases in in magnitude.

1810
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,240
And you might say,
well,

1811
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,150
you know,
that's a ridiculous argument because the

1812
01:41:40,151 --> 01:41:40,984
actions of one individual don't have any
relationship to the consequences at the 

1813
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:44,914
level of any political maneuvering.
But I would say we don't have the 

1814
01:41:48,191 --> 01:41:50,500
foggiest clue what causes things like 
the Holocaust.

1815
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:54,100
We don't know why the Cold War started.
We certainly have no idea why it ended.

1816
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:55,143
And as far as I'm concerned,
it's premature to conclude on the basis 

1817
01:41:58,151 --> 01:41:58,984
of hard evidence,
ignorance and our inability to stop 

1818
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:01,714
things like the Holocaust from occurring
that we have no idea how the actions of 

1819
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:07,990
the individual might be related to the 
development of genocide states.

1820
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:13,330
So I'm suggesting that they might be 
alive much more closely than people have

1821
01:42:13,331 --> 01:42:17,590
been inclined to believe.
And I'm also suggesting that part of the

1822
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:18,424
reason that people have been inclined to
believe that they're not very closely 

1823
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:21,904
aligned is well because well,
partly because of the individual 

1824
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:26,074
responsibility,
the magnitude that individual 

1825
01:42:27,401 --> 01:42:29,140
responsibility that seems to imply

1826
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:42,600
processes all the flies.

1827
01:42:44,710 --> 01:42:45,543
Absolutely.
I mean I think you can even make a 

1828
01:42:46,931 --> 01:42:50,590
physiological argument to buttress that 
point,

1829
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:51,424
which is that

1830
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,233
to the degree that you're engaged in a 
constant in the constant voluntary 

1831
01:42:58,501 --> 01:42:59,334
processing of anomalous information,
your life is interesting and meaningful 

1832
01:43:03,300 --> 01:43:04,740
by definition.
In fact,

1833
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:09,150
the circuitry that you activate when 
you're engaged in voluntary exploration,

1834
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:14,390
which is a consequence of admission of 
anomaly is in fact what we call meaning.

1835
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,430
And to the degree that you're engaged in
a meaningful activity,

1836
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:18,443
you can put up with all the nasty 
preconditions of existence that make 

1837
01:43:21,601 --> 01:43:25,730
that sort of exploration possible.
Which nature said if you have a,

1838
01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:26,963
uh,
why you can bear any how and basically 

1839
01:43:29,431 --> 01:43:30,264
what he meant by that visit.
Despite the fact that life perhaps 

1840
01:43:34,351 --> 01:43:38,820
necessarily has terrible preconditions 
for it to exist at all,

1841
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:39,923
it might be rendered bearable and even 
positive if you would only participate 

1842
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:46,530
in those things that you know to be 
correct.

1843
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:48,810
Well,
it's a reasonable hypothesis.

1844
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:51,950
It's also what everyone,
if

1845
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:56,090
you could discover what it is that 
everyone would want,

1846
01:43:56,780 --> 01:43:59,390
if they could really figure out what 
they wanted,

1847
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,373
that would be it.
Because the story says if you pursue 

1848
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:03,644
those things that you personally find 
most meaningful without deceiving 

1849
01:44:06,801 --> 01:44:07,634
yourself as to their content,
what will happen is that you'll develop 

1850
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:11,623
a mode of being that enables you to look
on life as if it was a beneficial 

1851
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:17,444
process.
And that is what people want when they 

1852
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:21,110
say something like,
well,

1853
01:44:21,111 --> 01:44:24,980
what is like given this terrible thing 
that's just happened to me?

1854
01:44:24,981 --> 01:44:27,650
What could possibly be the meaning of my
existence.

1855
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:33,790
Say Well,
okay,

1856
01:44:44,110 --> 01:44:47,300
I have your,
I have almost all of your papers aren't.

1857
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:50,830
It was two of them that aren't mark and 
I'll have them ready on Friday.
