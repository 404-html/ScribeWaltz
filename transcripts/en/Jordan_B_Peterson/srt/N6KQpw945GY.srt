Paul kennedy,
welcome to ideas aristotle cleaned

2
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,440
happiness was the ultimate purpose of
knife.

3
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:17,220
Mathematician and philosopher.
Blaise Pascal,

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:22,221
believe that all men seek happiness.
The poet Alexander Pope enthused,

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,860
oh,
happiness.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,290
Our beings end

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,440
and
praising.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,620
The virtue of happiness is both timeless
and timely.

9
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,540
Go to your local bookstore and you'll
find shelves packed with titles like the

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,900
art of happiness,
authentic happiness,

11
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,530
the how of happiness,
the happiness advantage to name just a

12
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,630
few newspapers and popular magazines
regularly published scientific studies

13
00:00:56,991 --> 00:01:01,991
toting the benefits of happiness.
Happy people enjoy a greater capacity

14
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:07,181
for intimacy in relationships.
Happiness increases your physical,

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,950
mental,
and emotional health.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,820
Happiness makes you more creative
with all that happiness has going for

17
00:01:16,521 --> 00:01:19,730
it.
Who doesn't want more of it as one

18
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:21,650
expert in the science of happiness?
Put it.

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,130
It is the holy grail of life.
Everyone wants happiness.

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,500
CBC,
producer,

21
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:35,120
Frank Fault isn't so sure in this hour
of ideas,

22
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,760
frank questions our culture's obsession
with happiness and wonders.

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,560
If it's time to cool or hot pursuit of
it.

24
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,760
Here's his documentary,
say no to happiness.

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,160
Let me make one thing perfectly clear.
I am not,

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,890
nor have I ever been a curmudgeon,

27
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,930
at least not a committed one.
I like feeling good.

28
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,090
I try to maintain an optimistic outlook,
preferring to walk on the sunny side of

29
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:18,980
the street,
but am I a happy person to quote the

30
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:20,540
English poet,
William Blake?

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,090
Joy and woe are woven.
Fine.

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,450
I can tell you that's more of a mantra
for me.

33
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,520
Then don't worry,
be happy,

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,090
but to be fair,
having done some looking into this whole

35
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:35,630
business around happiness,
I know that no one is suggesting that

36
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:40,310
striving for happiness is about ignoring
the woes of life and being cheerful.

37
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,690
Twenty four,
seven.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,210
What I do know is that what is meant by
happiness is rather elusive.

39
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:50,210
Sure.
Aristotle talked about the importance of

40
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,990
happiness,
but what he meant by happiness had to do

41
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:57,560
with living a life of virtue,
achieving the golden mean,

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,890
a life lived balance.

43
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,000
Something like what a surfer achieves
when catching the perfect wave.

44
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,990
The fact is philosophers,
theologians,

45
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,050
and scientists have failed to come up
with a definition of happiness that will

46
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:15,760
make everyone well happy.

47
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,710
Well,
it's absolutely true that happiness is a

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,130
very elusive concept.
I started my career as a lawyer and I.

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,570
I spent a semester arguing about the
definition of a contract and happiness

50
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:39,710
is even more hard to pin down.
There's something like 15 academic

51
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:42,980
definitions of happiness.
Gretchen Rubin is the author of the

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,860
bestseller,
the happiness project in which he

53
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,340
details her year of trying to achieve
greater happiness in her life.

54
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,210
For me,
sort of coming to it as a lay person,

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,190
the looseness of the term happiness
wasn't a problem and in fact was sort of

56
00:03:58,191 --> 00:04:02,090
an advantage because it could encompass
a lot of different things and different

57
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:05,090
people might emphasize different
qualities within happiness.

58
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:08,170
For some people it's more about peace
and some people meaning some people

59
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:10,730
satisfaction,
some serenity,

60
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:14,910
some mindfulness people emphasize
different aspects of it and I really

61
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:18,350
wish I didn't have to agree with
everyone else and what was really

62
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:22,520
important for me was not to arrive at
some perfect definition of happiness,

63
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,350
but really to say to myself,
well,

64
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,880
how could I be happier?

65
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,170
Whatever it is to be happy.
What can I do to be happier next week,

66
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,080
next month,
so I sort of took the dodge of justice

67
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:36,680
potter Stewart who said of obscenity,
I know it when I see it,

68
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,120
and I decided that for me,
I knew what it meant to be happier and I

69
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:45,950
didn't really have to get all tangled up
in the precise definitions that are

70
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,180
required if you're going to do certain
kinds of examinations of the subject.

71
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,580
Gretchen got the idea to devote a year
to being happier while stuck on a bus in

72
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:59,240
the pouring rain,
not exactly a situation that inspires

73
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,760
positive moods.
As it turns out,

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,960
it afforded her one of those rare
moments for self reflection in which she

75
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:09,050
wondered what do I want from life
anyway,

76
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,680
and what Gretchen realized that she
wanted was to be happier.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,830
Not that she was unhappy.
She had a good marriage,

78
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,090
two small children she adored and was
completing a book on John F Kennedy.

79
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
What I meant by wanting to be happier
was that I.

80
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:27,860
I felt that I needed to appreciate my
life more.

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I felt like time was passing so quickly
and I wanted to grab onto it.

82
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,720
I wanted to appreciate it.
I didn't want to take it for granted.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,720
I have a phrase that I often say to
myself,

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,080
the days are long,
but the years are short.

85
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,210
I wanted to ask more of myself.
I wanted to be a better mother.

86
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:58,760
I wanted to be a wife.
I want to be a better friend and wanted

87
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:00,710
to be a better writer.
I wanted to be a better citizen.

88
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:05,360
I wanted to
expect more for myself and I thought

89
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,930
about the qualities that I wanted and
it's,

90
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,990
yeah,
I want it to be more creative and more

91
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:13,130
lighthearted and more calm and more
patient and have more forbearance and

92
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,430
less be less judgemental,
less naggy,

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
and I wanted to bring my life more into
harmony with my values and it's funny.

94
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,820
I don't think I really understood that
very well at the beginning.

95
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,710
That was the.
That was one of the major,

96
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:32,180
major things that I learned as I went on
is that was what was so important was

97
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,290
that my life reflect my values,
my temperament,

98
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,410
my interests,
that I could only build a happy life on

99
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,510
the foundation of my own nature.

100
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,510
Gretchen realized that if she was going
to tackle a project of this size,

101
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,420
she needed a plan,
so she created a chart.

102
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,690
The chart was divided into the 12 months
of the year.

103
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,480
Each month has a theme.
For example,

104
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:59,170
the theme for January was boost energy.
February.

105
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,040
Remember love March,
aim higher and so on,

106
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,910
and for each month she made a list of
daily resolutions,

107
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,240
so under June's theme of make time for
friendship,

108
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,030
her resolutions were,
remember birthdays,

109
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,580
be generous,
don't gossip,

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,280
make new friends.
Every night.

111
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,060
Gretchen would put a checkmark by
resolution indicating that she had

112
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:26,240
managed to keep it that day.
Having a chart help Gretchen to achieve

113
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:29,380
or monthly goals,
but seven months into a project,

114
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,170
the pursuit of happiness got stalled.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,760
I hit a low point in my happiness
project at where I felt like I was

116
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:42,150
making no progress.
I was tired of my way of thinking.

117
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:43,710
I wasn't tired of the subject of
happiness,

118
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:45,750
which I have never failed to find
fascinating,

119
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,400
but I was tired of my way of thinking
about it.

120
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,170
You know,
just like every time you go to buy

121
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:53,460
clothes you buy the same black sweater
that you bought before.

122
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:56,040
I just felt like my thoughts were stuck
in a groove.

123
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,050
I felt that I was backsliding and all
the usual ways and one of the things is

124
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:03,090
when you think a lot about how you want
to be better,

125
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,180
it makes you much more aware of what
you're doing wrong.

126
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,210
So for example,
I didn't think I gossip very much,

127
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,450
but when I decided that I was going to
stop altogether,

128
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,110
I realized how often I did.

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,500
So I was much more aware of all the
things that I was doing that I knew were

130
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,450
contrary to my happiness.
But I was doing anyway.

131
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,100
And one of the things that came from my
happiness project is I just have this

132
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:26,850
long bag of things that I do to try to
get through it.

133
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,780
So it's things like go to bed early,
call a friend,

134
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,260
go outside in the sunlight,
gets some exercise,

135
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,490
do a good deed for someone else.
One of the best ways to self medicate.

136
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,480
I did all these things and eventually I
came out of it.

137
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,980
But I think it's natural to just go
through these periods where you just

138
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:48,030
feel blue.
Um,

139
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,190
and that wasn't for any particular
reason.

140
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,350
But then of course,
naturally we all have periods where for

141
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,690
a very specific reason we're feeling
very unhappy.

142
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,290
So I think one of the things that are
happiness project is sometimes it's not

143
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,900
possible to be happy.
It's just not realistic that you're just

144
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,750
not in a happy time of life.
It's not,

145
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,450
you're not happy.
But I think what I learned was there,

146
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,620
there's things that you can do to try to
be as happy as you can be under the

147
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:15,050
circumstances.
And that kind of gives you the armor

148
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,340
that you need to deal with a difficult
situation.

149
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,600
Like any smart person planning along
trip,

150
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,890
Gretchen did lots of research and
preparation for her year long journey.

151
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,110
Many of the ideas she used to help her
deal with a difficult times came from

152
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,230
the emerging science of positive
psychology.

153
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,690
Positive psychology is really about the
scientific understanding of what makes a

154
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:42,590
life worth living,
what are the conditions that lead to

155
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,750
that,
and then most importantly,

156
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,070
what are the strategies that we can use
to help people move a little bit closer

157
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:53,600
between where they presently are and
where ideally they'd like to be.

158
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,090
Todd Cashton is associate professor of
psychology at George Mason University in

159
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:03,260
Virginia and author of designing
positive psychology,

160
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,530
a book on the science of wellbeing.
He is also a self described provocateur

161
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,470
and the field of positive psychology.
The more that you actually take a gauge

162
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,880
of how happy you are or assess how happy
you are or think about,

163
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:21,980
reflect on,
am I happy right now?

164
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,610
The more that you do that,
the less happy you become and it becomes

165
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:28,580
quickly.
We're talking about four times a day.

166
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,310
You think about,
am I happy?

167
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,150
You're less light.
You're actually show detriments in your

168
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,030
happiness,
and the reason for that is we're leaving

169
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:42,440
the present moment so no longer are we
in the present and being open and

170
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:45,980
receptive.
We're constantly deciding is what I'm

171
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:48,800
feeling or thinking about now fit with
being happy.

172
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,240
There's a lot of well meaning people who
are studying happiness but are not

173
00:10:53,241 --> 00:10:55,700
skeptical.
I don't take things at face value.

174
00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm a scientist.
I want where's the data?

175
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,890
Where's the evidence?
Mindfulness.

176
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,770
There's this cultural obsession about
taking this philosophical and ancient

177
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,560
teachings about mindfulness,
which is fantastic,

178
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,910
but then the question is,
is it always adaptive to be mindful?

179
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,660
And the answer to as to most absolute
statements is no.

180
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,550
It's very resource intensive to be
mindful,

181
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,910
to focus with great profound awareness
and attention consumes energy.

182
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,040
If you think about emergency medical
technicians going on the scene for

183
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,360
someone for a crime scene or someone,
uh,

184
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,640
that's bloodied and has maybe you know,
hours to potentially live needs to be

185
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:53,030
brought to a hospital.
There's research to show that being

186
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,050
mindless and reflexively using their
skills to get the job done right then

187
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,320
and there is more adaptive than being
mindful,

188
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,380
so being a provocateur is about bending
over backwards to disprove ideas,

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,090
to find out the truth and unravel some
of the mysteries of human nature as

190
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,920
opposed to blindly accepting things on
faith because they fit with what I'd

191
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,480
like things to look like.

192
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,740
What concerns me with a current
obsession with happiness is that under

193
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:27,530
the rubric of happiness,
all sorts of things that aren't really

194
00:12:27,531 --> 00:12:30,710
related are often discussed.
So for example,

195
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,170
there are claims that happy people are
healthier.

196
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,170
Actually,
the research doesn't precisely indicate

197
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,150
that.
What it indicates is that people who

198
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:43,151
have less negative emotion are healthier
and we don't exactly know the direction

199
00:12:44,061 --> 00:12:47,540
of causality.
I mean negative emotion is a dimension

200
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,830
in and of itself and people who are high
in negative emotion tend to be depressed

201
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:55,700
and anxious and depression is associated
with increased production of a stress

202
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:56,750
hormone.
Cortisol,

203
00:12:56,751 --> 00:12:59,500
and that seems to have very negative
consequences over time.

204
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,190
It impairs your immune system and makes
you more susceptible to obesity and

205
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,120
depression and cancer and heart disease,
but technically that's a negative

206
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:08,954
emotion issue.

207
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,100
Jordan Peterson as a clinical
psychologist and teaches at the

208
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,220
University of Toronto.
He lectures on topics such as the nature

209
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:20,430
of self deception,
the role of neuroscience and human

210
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:23,190
behavior.
The quest for meaning and purpose in

211
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:24,024
life.

212
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,130
Claim is often made.
The happy people are more creative and

213
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,500
the evidence for that again is very
weak.

214
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,060
There are a few studies that indicate
that if you put people in a state of

215
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:38,230
positive mood that they can think in a
more creative manner briefly,

216
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,520
but the bulk of the personality evidence
suggests that creative people are

217
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,170
somewhat disagreeable and that they're
high in a trait called openness and

218
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:51,130
openness is a measure of fluidity of
thought and it appears to be

219
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,670
fundamentally unrelated to happiness.
It might be objected.

220
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,710
I suppose that the right response to
negative situations is to consider how

221
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,950
they might be made better and I would
agree with that,

222
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:08,010
but the problem is is that making things
better and being happy are not the same

223
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:11,710
thing.
Unless you decide by definition that

224
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,290
they're the same thing,
in which case I don't believe that

225
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:19,120
you're speaking within the scientific
realm because you're not allowed to put

226
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,590
vastly differing phenomena in the same
box and called them the same.

227
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,680
If you're a scientist,
you can do that in normal conversation

228
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,220
and so for example,
if someone is suffering from a terrible

229
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:33,160
illness,
you might determine that aiding them

230
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,120
would be an appropriate thing to do and
you might also consider that that would

231
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,880
make you feel better.
But to call that the pursuit of

232
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:44,440
happiness is merely to be very unclear
about the distinction between compassion

233
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:48,490
and joy and given the state of
psychological science at this point.

234
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:50,920
There's absolutely no excuse for failing
to make that.

235
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,040
But

236
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,920
you see,
I've dodged that by saying my have this

237
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,550
project is my happiness,
and so the fact that there might be

238
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:03,551
multiple definitions or sub topics live
in happiness that are somehow separable.

239
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,770
I think that you get further in terms of
thinking about how to be happier if you

240
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:13,640
just throw it all into one big basket.
Rather than trying to tease out the

241
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:16,190
difference between compassion and
happiness,

242
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,610
of course had been questioned in a
happiness project with you're setting

243
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:21,140
out to be happier is,
well,

244
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,330
how are you going to know if you're
happy or how are you going to measure

245
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:26,840
yourself and and I have a friend,
he's a scientist and he was very,

246
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:30,320
very focused on this.
His idea was as I should have my husband

247
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,620
score me every morning and night on a
level one to 10 scale and I was a look.

248
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,010
That would definitely not add to the
happiness in my household because

249
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,030
there's just no way my husband is going
to be sitting around scoring me morning

250
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:46,850
and night and I do think that I don't
really think that that was a very

251
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:50,540
productive exercise to do.
I just didn't approach it very

252
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,820
scientifically.
I said to myself,

253
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,310
I want to be happier.
Whatever that means,

254
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:58,370
whatever the looseness of the term
happiness and happier mean,

255
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,030
and if I think I'm happier,
I am happier.

256
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,880
And Kevin come to the end of it and
having continued to live with the

257
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:15,090
consequences of it because.
Because I continue to do all my

258
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,990
resolutions and many,
many more resolutions,

259
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,980
so my happiness project is really
something that I think I'll do for the

260
00:16:19,981 --> 00:16:23,490
rest of my life.
It's just indisputable to me.

261
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,230
Um,
and I think anybody who's around me

262
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:30,110
would say that I'm absolutely happier.
The atmosphere of my household is let

263
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,650
more lighthearted and more calm.
It seems like we have more time,

264
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,450
but it's not like we're doing anything
less.

265
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,450
It feels more rich,
but also more simple.

266
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,230
I don't have a chart that shows me
ticking upward.

267
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,530
Um,
I don't have vials of blood showing how

268
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:51,531
my hormone levels have changed,
but I definitely feel confident saying

269
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,080
that I did make myself happy.

270
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,430
Gretchen's quest for happiness inspired
and continues to inspire others to

271
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:11,260
create their own happiness projects,
which explains why her book has been on

272
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,580
best seller lists since first hitting
the market in 2009.

273
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
Gretchen's most important piece of
advice for those wanting to follow her

274
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:23,770
example is this,
regardless of how you might define

275
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:26,530
happiness for yourself,
making happiness,

276
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:30,580
that the primary goal in your life is
going to help you achieve it.

277
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,500
There's a long tradition of people
arguing that you shouldn't aim directly

278
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:39,010
at happiness and that happiness is
something that's a byproduct of a life

279
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,040
well lived or a life directed at other
aims and that you should and if you aim

280
00:17:44,411 --> 00:17:46,690
at being happy,
he was sort of will forte yourself or

281
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,550
trip over your own feet or or somehow be
pursuing wrong goals that will bring you

282
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,250
to a happy life.
And in my own experience,

283
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,240
I really think that you're much more
likely to hit a target if you aim at it.

284
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,630
And I found for myself that when I said
to myself,

285
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,300
am I happy?
How could I be happier?

286
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,770
I almost instantly did become happier
just because asking myself that question

287
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,120
made me appreciate more of what elements
of happiness I already did have in my

288
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:14,790
life.
Things that I was taking for granted or

289
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,020
being distracted from.

290
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,820
And it also helped me see places where I
could make changes that were not hard.

291
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,790
It's funny.
Happiness has a surprisingly bad

292
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:27,630
reputation and I got a lot of criticism
from people when I.

293
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,210
When I was saying that I was doing a
happiness project that I was trying to

294
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:33,840
make myself happier,
I was talking to a journalist who

295
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,710
clearly explain that this was a very,
very selfish,

296
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,870
complacent,
spoiled,

297
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:43,980
bratty undertaking,
and he was somebody who spent a lot of

298
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,890
time.
I'm doing kind of foreign reporting,

299
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:51,891
so he was very aware of the suffering of
the world and he really felt like this

300
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,620
was very morally questionable for me to
do.

301
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,200
I was very naturally taken aback by
that,

302
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,220
but I had done a lot of thinking about
it because it is something that you

303
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,900
worry about when you're thinking about
happiness is.

304
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:06,750
I did say to myself,
is this very selfish?

305
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,920
Is it morally inappropriate to be
thinking about happiness when there's so

306
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:14,640
much suffering in the world?
I'd been thinking about it sort of,

307
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:19,641
but it wasn't until he really gave me
that withering look of disgust that I

308
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:24,030
really focused on how did I.
What did I think about the pursuit of

309
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,930
happiness?
Did I feel like this was laudable and

310
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,400
what I found is that in my experience,
people who are happy in their own lives,

311
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,930
they have the emotional wherewithal to
turn outward and to think about the pain

312
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:40,470
of the world and they're more able to
intervene effectively because we more

313
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,860
unhappy.
We tend to be isolated and defensive and

314
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,890
preoccupied with our own problems,
and so it's not the case that happiness

315
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,310
makes people complacent or self
satisfied or preoccupied with their own

316
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:54,750
pleasure.
In fact,

317
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:58,200
happiness kind of energizes people to
turn outward.

318
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,130
Professor Todd Kashdan focusing on
happiness,

319
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:05,250
trying to improve people's happiness,
writing books about happiness.

320
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:09,540
This is a big money making industry and
while I'm critical of it,

321
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,750
I recognize that this opens the doors
for people to think about how they can

322
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,310
improve their lives,
their relationships,

323
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,420
and the way that they're operating in
this world which might be sub optimal.

324
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,493
And so,
uh,

325
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,660
Gretchen Rubin,
who's a good friend of mine,

326
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,140
she's dealing with how to create optimal
conditions for human beings.

327
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,020
And she's focusing on multiple pathways
of getting there.

328
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:37,260
She's focusing on multiple ways of
setting goals,

329
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,300
meeting your goals,
deriving benefits just from devoting

330
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,670
effort,
much less whether you even achieve your

331
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,760
goals,
and I think this.

332
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:51,080
It's important to get the dialogue going
and so it ends up being that happiness

333
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,680
is the gateway for having people think
about ways that they can intentionally

334
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:59,140
improve their own lives and lives of
other people.

335
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,680
It's a great thing,
but what ends up happening is this

336
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,660
nebulous wastebasket term where
happiness is pretty much everything

337
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:12,550
that's good in life.
If we focus on happiness as a synonym

338
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,540
for the good life or a synonym for a
well lived life,

339
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,520
we miss out on so many facets,
so many nuances of what it means to be

340
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,920
human and it beat full capacity.

341
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,780
Creativity,
spirituality,

342
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,990
meaning and purpose in light,
compassion,

343
00:21:33,991 --> 00:21:37,230
self compassion,
a sense of accomplishment,

344
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,820
a sense of belonging,
a sense of what these things are not

345
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,750
synonymous with happiness and there are
plenty of happy people that are not

346
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,670
creative,
that are not spiritual,

347
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,530
that are not mindful,
and so using a wastebasket term to

348
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:56,970
capture all of the beauties and
complexities of human behavior is

349
00:21:56,971 --> 00:22:01,971
extremely problematic and it trivializes
just how amazing and how complicated it

350
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:04,980
is to navigate our social world.

351
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:16,600
I've said that some people will tell you
that the purpose of life is to be happy

352
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,650
and those people are idiots and was a
bit of a rough statement,

353
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:25,540
but I what I meant by that.
It was actually inspired by a statement

354
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:29,320
by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who was the
great critic of the Soviet prison system

355
00:22:29,321 --> 00:22:34,321
and he commented that happiness is
something that's done in by the first

356
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,410
harsh blow.
That reality deals you and and,

357
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,230
and I believe this to be the case there.
There are many circumstances in life

358
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,250
where happiness is not only the wrong
response,

359
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,060
but also where the expectation of
happiness as a response,

360
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,600
we'll put you,
the person attempting to be happy in

361
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,680
absolutely the wrong psychological state
to be prepared for what must be done.

362
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,720
People are built so to speak,
to experience a very wide range of

363
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:06,550
motivational and emotional states that
only bear a tenuous relationship to one

364
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,860
another,
and the reason for that is that the

365
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:13,861
environment that human beings inhabit is
so complex that are adaptations depends

366
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:19,270
on a variety of very finally
differentiated responses and so there is

367
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:23,020
a time to be compassionate and there's a
time to be aggressive and there's a time

368
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:27,850
to be in pain and there's a time to be
anxious and there's a time to be joyous

369
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:31,900
and a time to be satisfied,
and the healthy and well adapted person

370
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:36,280
has a very wide range of finally
differentiated response which cannot be

371
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,130
boiled down to a single dimension.

372
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:43,410
Say happiness versus unhappiness.
A life is not that simple,

373
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:46,070
and if it was,
we'd only have one system

374
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,800
happiness.
All it is is it's a barometer.

375
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,620
It's Dr Phil,
one-on-one,

376
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,940
Dr Phil always asked,
how are things working for you?

377
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,430
And if you say things are working well,
that's pretty.

378
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,650
That's pretty much what we mean by
happiness.

379
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,070
Happiness does not propel us forward,
so it's very weird to meet this,

380
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,090
the objective of your life and what I
mean by that is while I love being a

381
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,224
father,
I can.

382
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,380
I will tell you point blank with my wife
listening,

383
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,120
that it has not improved my happiness,
meaning and purpose in life through the

384
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:19,500
roof.
Happiness.

385
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:24,030
I was much happier as a 30 year old
having a lot of time with friends and a

386
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:28,020
lot of time to travel and a lot of time
to basically do whatever the hell that I

387
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:30,780
wanted to.
So in terms of my happiness,

388
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,920
it's detracted from it.
Are there moments of the most profound

389
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,950
pleasure of the most profound
spirituality that I would die for these

390
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:43,290
sacred vessels that I have in my life?
Absolutely,

391
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,580
but that's not happiness,
that's spirituality to me is striving

392
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:52,170
for the sacred and the sacred is things
that you would be willing to die for.

393
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,950
What I die for a sense of satisfaction
in my life.

394
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,440
No,
what would I be willing to take the

395
00:24:58,441 --> 00:25:00,720
bullet over my kids?
Absolutely

396
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,200
making happiness.
The focal point of your life trivializes

397
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,240
your experiences because in order to
regard anything as truly important,

398
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,900
you also have to regard it's loss as
truly meaningful,

399
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:19,250
and that means that to open yourself up
to experiences of deep meaning also

400
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:23,630
simultaneously means that you have to
open yourself up to the possibility of

401
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:28,631
deep hurt and sorrow
and you do that anytime,

402
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,940
for example,
that you make a relationship profound.

403
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,690
You put your emotions on the line and
that has to be real or the relationship

404
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:42,691
can be real and to hope that that sort
of risk could be obliterated by the

405
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:49,411
indulgence in a simplistic form of
happiness is to shrink.

406
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:53,710
I think empowered is from the demands
that real human existence place on

407
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:54,544
people.

408
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,440
This is ideas in Canada on CBC radio,
one across North America on Sirius

409
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,340
Satellite Radio,
Channel One 59 and around the world on

410
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,530
CBC dot Ca.
I'm Paul Kennedy.

411
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,660
You're listening to CBC,
producer Frank Faux say no to happiness.

412
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:21,730
The renowned psychiatrist and
concentration camp survivor Viktor

413
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:26,320
Frankl wrote what man actually needs is
not attention list state,

414
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,680
but rather the striving and struggling
for a worthwhile goal of freely chosen

415
00:26:31,871 --> 00:26:34,960
task.
There is much wisdom in the words of

416
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:39,520
Nietzsche.
He who has a why to live for can bear

417
00:26:39,521 --> 00:26:43,030
almost anyhow.
We now return to frank's,

418
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,270
say no to happiness

419
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,520
at every moment.
We're surrounded by what we know and can

420
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:56,530
understand,
but outside of that,

421
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,010
we're surrounded by all the things that
we do not know and cannot understand and

422
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:02,050
that can manifest themselves at any
moment.

423
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,500
So we're like small islands of tentative
certainty in a massive sea of

424
00:27:09,431 --> 00:27:14,431
uncertainty and ignorance.
That's our existential condition.

425
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:18,890
It's really our environment.
Even from a scientific perspective.

426
00:27:18,891 --> 00:27:23,891
It's the environment that we've emerged
into and have adapted to and we have to

427
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,760
take that into account when we deal with
our lives because that's the truest

428
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:32,150
nature of our life.
It's ordering the midst of the infinite

429
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:36,560
chaos.
The human problem is how to make sense

430
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:39,720
out of the constant interplay between
that tentative order,

431
00:27:39,721 --> 00:27:39,850
right?

432
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,170
Not Infinite chaos.

433
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,010
Jordan Peterson is a professor of
psychology at the University of Toronto.

434
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,830
He is also the author of maps of
meaning,

435
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,910
the architecture of belief.
His book explores how religious and

436
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:57,911
mythological stories shed light on our
existential predicament and in turn can

437
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:00,320
provide a sense of meaning and purpose.

438
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,760
In the Old Testament in genesis,
it's one of the most profound ideas ever

439
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:07,680
expressed.
The Old Testament,

440
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:12,681
God in genesis generates order out of
chaos and upon doing so,

441
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,980
he states,
man and woman are made in my image.

442
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,620
What does he mean by that?
Well,

443
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:21,960
he dignifies the human soul with that
statement,

444
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:26,961
but the attribution of dignity is based
on a psychological and an ontological

445
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:31,440
reality,
and that reality is that what the

446
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:36,441
individual consciousness confronts his
equivalent in some sense to the chaos

447
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,410
that God originally turned into order at
the beginning of time.

448
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,360
In that what you confront moment to
moment is the potential of being.

449
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,310
That's what consciousness does.
It takes unformed potential and makes it

450
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:55,311
manifest and each human being has the
choice about which direction that

451
00:28:56,671 --> 00:29:00,600
potential will manifest itself in,
but not about whether or not that

452
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:05,220
manifestation will take place because it
takes place no matter what and that's

453
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:09,810
why the moral obligation of existence is
incumbent on our being.

454
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Existence implies coexistence to be is
to be involved with the life of others.

455
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,480
We delude ourselves if we think that
we're simply innocent bystanders and

456
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:31,220
life being is never neutral.
What we do matters.

457
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,360
You can be a creator of things positive
or you can be a creator of things

458
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:42,160
negative or you can be a creator who
abdicated their responsibility,

459
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:47,161
but in all three situations,
you are participating in the process

460
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,650
that turns chaos into order and there is
no escaping that.

461
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:58,840
When the high school kids,
the chart up columbine wrote about their

462
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,990
philosophy and the most telling aspect
of their philosophy was their judgment

463
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:08,500
of existence state and they did.
You can read this on the net.

464
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,890
Their conclusion at the great age of 19
was that the tragedy of existence was

465
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:21,001
such that being itself was corrupt.
That because people suffered and because

466
00:30:22,601 --> 00:30:25,120
of the world was a dangerous and
terrible place.

467
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,110
That being itself should be eradicated
and this is a very common judgment,

468
00:30:29,111 --> 00:30:34,111
is far more common than people think,
and once you forego the luxury of

469
00:30:36,641 --> 00:30:41,110
deciding in a sense to hell with
everything that that everything is so

470
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,950
corrupt that it's unredeemable.
Once you forego that luxury,

471
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:49,951
then it becomes incumbent on you to try
to work for the betterment of being in

472
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,550
that requires faith and the reason it
requires faith is because a,

473
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,700
you don't know if ben can be bettered
and B,

474
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,950
you don't know if you're the creature to
do it,

475
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,240
but the peculiar thing is is that you
will never find out if being can be

476
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:08,230
bettered or if you're the creature to do
it until you assume that it can be

477
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:10,990
bettered and you assume that you are the
creature to do it.

478
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,250
Critics of religious thinking believed
that what faith means is the willingness

479
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:19,420
to suspend rational judgment and swallow
any old thing.

480
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,230
No matter how absurd,
and that's not what faith means at all.

481
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,260
What faith means is the willingness to
put yourself on the line in pursuit of

482
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:32,080
those things that you find deeply
meaningful and that's why so many great

483
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:37,081
philosophers such as Soren kierkegaard
emphasize above all the role that faith

484
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:42,421
plays.
I'm a clinical psychologist.

485
00:31:49,981 --> 00:31:53,280
I have an active practice,
so I have 20 clients and I see them

486
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:57,060
weekly and I'm a professor of psychology
at the University of Toronto,

487
00:31:57,061 --> 00:32:00,240
and so it might be surprising that I use
religious language,

488
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:05,241
but it's not surprising because as soon
as you start to talk about the deepest

489
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,080
meanings of life,
the language that is most appropriate is

490
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:14,640
immediately religious and the reason for
that is that religion is precisely that

491
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,170
element of human existence that deals
with the most profound elements of human

492
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,273
being.

493
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,990
I believe that the reason for this is
this,

494
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,090
in some sense,
human existence is so contradictory that

495
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,090
it's in in a manner technically
impossible.

496
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:39,630
We're limited creatures and we face
unlimited catastrophe in in everything

497
00:32:40,251 --> 00:32:43,670
we know will disappear and everyone we
love will die,

498
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,130
and so that makes existence.
Human existence in a sense existentially

499
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:53,390
impossible,
but the religious impulse combats that.

500
00:32:53,391 --> 00:32:56,960
In a sense,
because the religious impulse opens up

501
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:01,961
to the human being the possibility that
there is sufficient absolute within to

502
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:08,450
serve as an antidote to the absolute
without and the notion that it's

503
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:11,720
necessary to have an individual
relationship with the absolute,

504
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:12,920
with God,
for example,

505
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:17,921
is a statement of the fact that we are
in fact adapted to the nature of reality

506
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,030
and if we draw on everything that is
within ourselves without fear,

507
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,200
then we can develop the sorts of
personalities that are powerful enough

508
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,440
to confront the horrible absolute and to
consider that justifiable and

509
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:33,794
worthwhile.

510
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,820
I want to put it in a good word coming
from the Jewish tradition,

511
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:46,750
a good word for happiness.
It's,

512
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,800
it's.
It's striking to me that the very first

513
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:54,090
word in the first verse of the First
Chapter of the Book of Psalms is a word

514
00:33:54,091 --> 00:33:56,460
that is probably best translated as
happy.

515
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,480
So it says in Psalms,
happy is the one who does not stand in

516
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:04,290
the way of the wicked or walk with
sinners or sit in the company of

517
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:07,020
mockers,
but whose delight is in the law of the

518
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:10,710
Lord in God's law.
Does he meditate day and night?

519
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,430
Happiness is a,
I think a not a bad thing.

520
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:17,220
It's certainly better than its opposite,
but,

521
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:21,030
but clearly it is inadequate as a goal
for our lives.

522
00:34:21,031 --> 00:34:23,860
If that's all that we can inspire to
then alive,

523
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,670
do become trivial,
then they become insignificant.

524
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,530
The happiest creature in the world I
think is a lizard sitting in the sun,

525
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,500
and if all we want to be or lizards
sitting in the sun,

526
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,030
it won't work for us because we have an
awareness that lizards don't have.

527
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,360
We have an awareness that there is
something greater than ourselves,

528
00:34:42,361 --> 00:34:45,600
greater than our material,
corporeal being that there is the

529
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:46,434
infinite.

530
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,280
Dan Polish is the author of talking
about God,

531
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,680
exploring the meaning of religious life
with character,

532
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:54,900
guard,
boober,

533
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,250
Tillich and Heschel in his book,
Polish explorers.

534
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,400
How each of these thinkers understand
the human encounter with the infinite.

535
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,350
The Danish Christian philosopher Soren
Kierkegaard coined the term angst or

536
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:15,351
anxiety to describe our experience as
limited being overwhelmed by the

537
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,120
infinite.
Paul Tillich,

538
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,740
a Christian theologian talked about the
courage to be in the face of our

539
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:26,730
existential predicament.
The Jewish theologian Martin Buber

540
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,810
talked about the importance of holding
ourselves open to the unconditional

541
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:34,530
mystery that we encounter in every
sphere of our life.

542
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:40,190
Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel spoke of
knowing life has ultimate meaning.

543
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,010
Though we can never fully comprehend
that meaning only sense it.

544
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,210
All of them could be characterized is
existentialist thinkers,

545
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,600
by which I mean that they like other
existentialist recognize that as

546
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,220
Shakespeare said,
there's more in heaven and earth and

547
00:35:56,221 --> 00:36:00,000
there is in your philosophy of ratios.
They don't focus on creating theories.

548
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:04,170
They know that the mind can go only so
far so they don't start with theory.

549
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:07,530
They start with a with human experience
it religiously.

550
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:12,531
That means that they are less interested
in talking about what God is a then

551
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,540
talking about how we human beings
respond to God rather than trying to

552
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:23,280
define that which they recognize
ultimately as beyond the capacity for

553
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:28,281
human beings to either define or even
understand and that unless we find a way

554
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:34,020
of living constructively with the
infinite are living in the infinite.

555
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,150
Unless we find the courage to have faith
in that which we cannot begin to

556
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:41,940
understand or begin to articulate a,
then we're,

557
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,620
then we're going to suffer what
kierkegaard called angst.

558
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,350
We're going to suffer that anxiety.

559
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,840
Character guard by all accounts was not
a happy fellow.

560
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,160
He suffered a major romantic
disappointment as a young man and

561
00:36:55,161 --> 00:37:00,161
eventually retreated into a solitary
life of study and writing when it came

562
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:04,580
to achieving happiness in this life.
He didn't believe it was possible.

563
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:10,330
The best we can do is aspire to diminish
the anx that defines human existence.

564
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,710
As for the other three,
the who lived in the 20th century,

565
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,550
that,
that I've written about Heschel,

566
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:18,603
Uber,
Tillich,

567
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:24,010
all three of them knew a great deal of
suffering in their lives so that the

568
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:26,780
idea of happiness being something
paramount,

569
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,200
I think would look ridiculous to them,
or three of them were forced to leave

570
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,380
Germany and Europe.
Uh,

571
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,660
when it fell under Nazi domination.
Heschel of course,

572
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,840
came to the United States before the
full horrors of the Nazi reality acted

573
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:48,380
itself out in Europe.
He was living in Cincinnati,

574
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:53,270
Ohio when he got word that his whole
family had been exterminated.

575
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,510
My guess is that anybody who's life is
shaped as his wife's by that experience

576
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,190
would really not take the notion of
happiness is the goal of life very

577
00:38:10,191 --> 00:38:12,530
seriously.
And in this book on the Prophets,

578
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:13,610
he says,
quote,

579
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,750
the world is dark and human agony is
excruciating.

580
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,050
This is not the,
uh,

581
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:28,280
the writings of somebody who could
understand human life in terms of what

582
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,690
we're calling happiness here.

583
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:37,490
Yeah.

584
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,350
It's something strange that I've
observed with my students is that when I

585
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:57,570
state the proposition to them clearly
that life is suffering and that the

586
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:01,530
purpose of life is not happiness.
They actually experienced that as a

587
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:04,350
great relief.
And the reason I believe that they

588
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:07,230
experienced it as a great relief is they
already know it.

589
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,510
You know,
even if they wouldn't necessarily

590
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:13,920
articulate that their experience has
taught them that life is complex and

591
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:18,030
tragic and difficult.
And the problem with the public

592
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:22,920
portrayal of the ideal state of
humanness as happiness is that it makes

593
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:27,240
all of these people,
these young people feel ashamed of their

594
00:39:27,241 --> 00:39:30,210
own suffering.
They feel that if they're suffering and

595
00:39:30,211 --> 00:39:32,460
if they find their life tragic in its
essence,

596
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:35,580
that that means that there's something
wrong with them and instantly that makes

597
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:39,720
it impossible for them to communicate
anything real about their own tragedy.

598
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,320
One of the great spiritual geniuses of
all humanity was the Buddha and the

599
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,300
Buddha came to an understanding that,
that he can talk about human life in

600
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:54,690
terms of four noble truths.
And the first of the noble truths is

601
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,150
that all of life is Duco,
which we,

602
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,990
which we can translate as suffering.
Uh,

603
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,880
the Buddhist teaching.
I said the essence of the human

604
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:07,881
experience is to suffer that suffering
is not some unfortunate thing that

605
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:13,490
disrupts an otherwise perfect existence
or that suffering is a,

606
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,220
you know,
an accident that may be false on people.

607
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,660
The Buddhist teaching that suffering is
at the heart of being a human.

608
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,360
And so it appears to me that the price
we pay for being is suffering.

609
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,980
And then the issue there,
and I believe that this is what the

610
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:34,670
greater religious traditions of the
world have been attempting to elucidate,

611
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:39,671
is that the purpose of life given that
is to identify and and follow a mode of

612
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:46,961
being that makes life justifiable,
even given the radical necessity of

613
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,870
suffering.
If you're constantly in a state of

614
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,900
placidity satisfaction and happiness,
then nothing is going to affect you

615
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:59,630
deeply enough,
not your own suffering and the suffering

616
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,490
of other people.
Not Injustice,

617
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,610
not knocked the horrors of the world.
Nothing is going to affect you deeply

618
00:41:04,611 --> 00:41:09,611
enough so that you'll become deep and
life without depth is by definition

619
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,870
shallow and meaningless,
and there's a problem that's associated

620
00:41:14,871 --> 00:41:18,830
with that because life is tragic and
because life involves suffering.

621
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,530
If your philosophy is shallow and
meaningless,

622
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:26,531
when you suffer,
you'll become resentful and hostile and

623
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,620
self critical and then you'll become
cruel and destructive.

624
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,860
And so not only is there a necessity for
your own mental health too,

625
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:40,570
14

626
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,080
rightly confront the deepest questions
of life,

627
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,740
but if you don't,
then you remain a danger to yourself.

628
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:48,630
And maybe more importantly to others,

629
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:53,040
the suffering that we experience is
something that we can use.

630
00:41:53,041 --> 00:41:58,041
There's the well known image of the
grain of sand that finds its way into

631
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:03,000
the shell of an oyster and out of that
discomfort,

632
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,220
the oyster fashions,
the Pearl,

633
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,430
the ox,
the kierkegaard talks about can become

634
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:13,431
the inspiration of for us to live in
ways that transcend simple selfishness,

635
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:19,050
simple egocentricity simple focusing on
ourselves.

636
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,840
Reinhold Niebuhr,
who was actually a very close friend of

637
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:26,520
Heschel,
said that life has no meaning except in

638
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:30,000
terms of responsibility.
I'm sure how she would shake his head.

639
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,060
Absolutely.
One of Heschel's earliest books is

640
00:42:38,871 --> 00:42:42,290
called the image of God in this world.
Humanity.

641
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,560
Human beings are God's image in this
world.

642
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,580
Our goal in life is very clear to be in
this world where we would want God to be

643
00:42:51,651 --> 00:42:56,651
in this world
for us through our actions and our

644
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:04,711
behaviors and our engagements to
manifest God in the world,

645
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,090
to be radically discontent with the
things that exist in this world,

646
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:15,350
to be radically discontent with the
social evils that we see around us.

647
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,860
Do what we can to write them
because we are God's own self.

648
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,990
Is it work in this world

649
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:32,420
which actually wouldn't say means where
we finally become the most human.

650
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,500
I've gotten very interested in the
psychology of morality because we often

651
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,160
push it aside to just religious
teachings,

652
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,160
religious ideas,
and when we're making moral decisions on

653
00:43:59,161 --> 00:44:04,161
a daily basis and it makes me think of
exemplars of people that have profound

654
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:08,550
meaning and purpose in life,
but are probably average to below

655
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:13,551
average on happiness and Martin Luther
King happens to be a real great example

656
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,770
of this.
Todd Cashton is associate professor of

657
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:19,860
psychology at George Mason University in
Virginia.

658
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,640
He is the author of designing positive
psychology,

659
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,120
a book on the science of wellbeing.
Professor cashton regularly gives talks

660
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:33,450
and workshops on how to live a
worthwhile and meaningful life.

661
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,960
This is someone in context who had
extreme righteous indignation.

662
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,580
This is a.
This is just a manifestation of anger of

663
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,270
the mistreatment of other of other
fellow human beings on the lack of

664
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:51,870
equality and fairness.
These are fundamental moral principles

665
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,030
and his life was devoted to this.

666
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,720
If you're talking about pursuing goals
that are outside the parameters of

667
00:45:01,141 --> 00:45:03,600
happiness,
look to Martin Luther King,

668
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:09,050
the idea of absorbing the blues,
the hatred,

669
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,780
the prejudice,
the discrimination for other people to

670
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:17,781
make a point that these,
these behaviors are not indicative of

671
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,850
what a good society is built on,
and Martin Luther King is not the only

672
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:27,120
person.
He just happens to be a public exemplar.

673
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:31,830
You have people in schools right here in
DC where I'm sitting right now who are

674
00:45:31,831 --> 00:45:36,831
devoting themselves in inner city kids.
You've got teachers that are creating a

675
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:40,380
safe space for them,
a place where they can actually learn

676
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:43,530
and grow and become a moral outstanding
citizen.

677
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,150
We're talking about people that are
taking time away from their own

678
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:53,040
happiness to do something that really
matters and but lead to a sense of

679
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,760
morality,
meaning and purpose in life that just

680
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:58,980
don't fit on the same spectrum.
Now,

681
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:03,960
there are multiple pathways to living a
good life and I think a better approach

682
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,610
than having happiness as the ultimate
end point is to do things you care

683
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,800
about.
We're not talking about happiness.

684
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:14,550
We're talking about engagement.
We're talking about meaningful pursuits.

685
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,320
Nothing can drive you to find the
deepest meanings of life without first

686
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:26,630
realizing the absolute fragility of life
because there's nothing that's

687
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:31,631
sufficiently terrifying as realization
of that absolute fragility and it's

688
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:37,391
necessary to be profoundly terrified
before you can be motivated to seek out

689
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:42,920
those things that are of the highest
value as a consequence of considering

690
00:46:42,921 --> 00:46:47,240
these ideas for many years and
especially considering the role that

691
00:46:47,241 --> 00:46:50,060
evil has played,
say in the 20th century and also the

692
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:55,061
role that suffering plays in life.
I've asked myself deeply what the

693
00:46:55,821 --> 00:47:00,821
purpose of life might be and it seems to
me that life requires virtue and so then

694
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:02,871
you might ask,
well,

695
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:07,871
what do I mean by virtue?
And what I mean by virtue is following

696
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,960
whatever it is in your life that
manifests itself to you as meaningful

697
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:17,900
and right,
and there's Cota sales to that.

698
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,330
For example,
in order to determine clearly what's

699
00:47:20,331 --> 00:47:23,510
meaningful in right,
you have to stop light because if you

700
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:25,460
lie to yourself or you lie to other
people,

701
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,370
you blind yourself and then the things
that might appear to you as meaningful

702
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:35,320
or no longer trustworthy because you're
using an instrument that you voluntarily

703
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:40,321
damaged to perceive reality and that
will lead you astray and virtue requires

704
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,100
while requires humility because you have
to stop thinking that you know,

705
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:49,270
and so humility and honesty are absolute
preconditions.

706
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,290
Courage as well as necessary because
you'll have to learn to come to terms

707
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:58,150
with your own capacity for anxiety and
dread and aggression and and even your

708
00:47:58,151 --> 00:48:01,210
capacity for welfare,
terrible acts,

709
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,630
and to continually set yourself right is
to walk down the path I believe of moral

710
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:08,134
virtue.

711
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,530
I would contrast the difference between
having happiness as a desirable thing,

712
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,330
which it's incredibly desirable to be
happy,

713
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:21,340
but what I like to talk about is
thinking about this as a compass.

714
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Provide a navigator of which direction
to go into.

715
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,010
It doesn't tell them what direction it
says,

716
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:31,420
here's the direction that you're facing.
If happiness is your compass to navigate

717
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:35,170
through the complexities and ambiguities
of life,

718
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:39,850
it means when something is negative or
problematic,

719
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:45,210
that's the wrong direction to move into.
When it's your values become your

720
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:47,350
compass,
it's very different.

721
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:50,260
Let me give you example,
so one of my fundamental values,

722
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,550
I have twin four year old girls,
is to try to be a good father and

723
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:59,551
instill good values in them and try to
cultivate their strikes and so when I'm

724
00:48:59,801 --> 00:49:02,470
faced with conflicts,
which we all are faced with,

725
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,010
I love writing.
I love doing science.

726
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,520
I loved teaching and I'm in the middle
of a great writing session.

727
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,920
Eight hours.
I'm in flow of the words were just

728
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:15,850
spilling out of my brain onto the page
and I looked at the clock and I realize

729
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,820
it's almost time for their bedtime.
I've got a conflict here.

730
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,290
Do I continue with this incredible
writing session or do I make sure I've

731
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,090
seen my kids before?
I let you go to sleep,

732
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,670
read them a story,
tuck them in,

733
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,460
show them some affection,
and maybe come back to this.

734
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,620
Am I writing?
Might not be as good afterwards.

735
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:38,170
Knowing that my values are to trying to
be a good father and instill values in

736
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:41,660
them helps me with the decision and it
helps them decide,

737
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,820
you know what?
I'm going to go home,

738
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,540
spend some time my children come back to
my work.

739
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:51,220
If happiness is my objective,
it leaves me in a much bigger quandary

740
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:55,600
of all of these conflicts of what do I
do with the limited amount of time and

741
00:49:55,601 --> 00:50:00,100
energy I have in any given day and all
of these competing things that are

742
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:04,660
fighting for my attention,
meaning and purpose in life and values

743
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,850
is a very stable compass.

744
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:11,080
This is a way to create a life,
to feel good about who we are,

745
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:16,090
to have an understanding of what type of
person we want to be and try to close

746
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:19,180
the gap between what we do and what we
strive to become.

747
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:24,730
I want to make my personal signature on
my work so that I leave the world a

748
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:26,200
little bit of a better place,

749
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,570
deeply embedded again in western
religious thinking.

750
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:46,571
That reality is in some sense incomplete
unfinished and the name of the human

751
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:51,500
being is to complete it.
To perfect it,

752
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,590
to finish it and see the idea that
reality is in some sense unfinished and

753
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:02,330
hence it's tragic in an incomplete
manner and that the role of the human

754
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:07,331
being is in some sense to participate in
its perfection is a concept that is so

755
00:51:09,381 --> 00:51:14,381
profound that it makes happiness as a
concept design to encapsulate the

756
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:20,300
meaning of life so shallow that it
instantly becomes virtually negligible.

757
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,040
We have a hypothesis here that the
purpose of conscious being is for those

758
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:36,690
beings who are conscious to transcend
their mortar limitations and to work for

759
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:41,691
the perfection of all that exists as a
goal that justifies suffering.

760
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,140
That's unbeatable.
I think because what it does is broaden

761
00:51:46,141 --> 00:51:50,790
and deepen your life in a manner that
you might compare to the difference

762
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,820
between elevator music and a Beethoven
symphony.

763
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:59,360
It's not that the symphony is in any
sense happier than the Muzak and in fact

764
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,150
quite the contrary,
but it's deeper and more profound

765
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:07,140
enricher and incorporates more and
justifies itself more.

766
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,980
And that's the right metaphor for life.
Not Happiness,

767
00:52:10,981 --> 00:52:15,981
but but depth and and and differentiated
quality and profundity to match the

768
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,920
profundity of the necessity of
suffering.

769
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,390
