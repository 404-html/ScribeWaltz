00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,090
On Wednesday,
the 31st of January at 7:30 PM,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,583
I'm going to be speaking about my new 
book and its genesis at the lovely 

3
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:16,361
orpheum theater in Los Angeles,
and so I'd like to invite you to attend.

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,270
I'll talk for about an hour and a half 
or so perhaps to take questions from the

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,204
audience and then sign and dedicate 
books and so if you'd be interested in 

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:27,794
hearing about 12 rules for life and 
about how it came about and what it's 

7
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,354
about and why,
then please come to the theater and 

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,800
we'll have a fine time.
So looking forward to seeing you there.

9
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,363
12 rules for life,
how to live properly in the face of 

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,380
vulnerability,
tragedy,

11
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,214
and malevolence.
One of the propositions in 12 rules for 

12
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:58,541
life is that life existence is usefully 
characterized as an interplant order and

13
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,244
chaos or unknown unknown.
You're always striving to balance those 

14
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:05,870
two.
If if,

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,043
if what you,
what you're doing is too familiar your 

16
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,940
board and if what you're doing is to 
unfamiliar,

17
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,774
then you're anxious and what you want to
do is find the harmonious line between 

18
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:21,590
those two and that signified by leaning.
If you can get those two things right,

19
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:23,150
then you can have your cake and eat it 
too.

20
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,920
I hope people can take away the idea 
that there is a motive being in the face

21
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:31,484
of the vulnerability and tragedy of life
that is noble and powerful and capable 

22
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:39,794
of sustaining them through the worst 
possible times without becoming corrupt 

23
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:45,344
and bitter.
