1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,250
I should tell you first about the 
genesis of this theory,

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,020
I suppose is the right way of putting 
it,

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,100
um,

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,500
when I was about your age,

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,140
that was back in the early eighties

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,460
or thereabouts.

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,130
Um,

8
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,220
and this was particularly true around 
1984,

9
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,650
but it was true before that too.
Um,

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,870
you know,
every generation has its worries,

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,890
real or imagined,
and the primary worry for people of my 

12
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,701
generation was nuclear war and you know,
it was a genuine worry.

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,300
Um,
at one point,

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,360
many years later,
I went down to Arizona to visit an icbm,

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,690
a decommissioned icbm nuclear missile 
silo.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,380
And I,
the ICBM intercontinental ballistic 

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,100
missiles were very large rockets,
right?

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,140
They flew it,
it could fly halfway around the world,

19
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,800
and it was deep underground and behind 
very,

20
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,860
very thick steel doors.
It was light green,

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,250
pastel green that everyone seemed to 
like in the 19 fifties was like pastel 

22
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:35,610
green star trek console.
That's what it looked like.

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,770
And,
uh,

24
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,450
so we went down,
out in the yard,

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,160
was in the desert,
out in the yard.

26
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:43,560
There was a very,
I would say,

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,150
magical object,
for lack of a better word,

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:56,980
and that was the nose cone for the IC I 
icbm and it was quite big about that big

29
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,290
boat out high pointed,
like the point of a bullet about three 

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,990
quarters of inch of an inch thick 
plastic,

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,840
you know,
a kind of a resin and it was designed to

32
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:11,750
melt on re-entry.
So that was just sitting there.

33
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,760
So that was fairly thought provoking,
let's put it that way.

34
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,480
And then we went into the missile silo,
interestingly enough,

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,880
appended to the front of it.
It had been decommissioned under Reagan 

36
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:27,880
by the way,
in the front of it,

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,100
there was a,
like a museum with artifacts from the 19

38
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:38,591
eighties featuring Reagan and Gorbachev 
meeting multiple times and it was 

39
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,611
staffed by these southern.
These Americans from the south who were 

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,100
grandparent age and they were,
they were just super friendly and you 

41
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,860
know,
they were happy to be in the museum.

42
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:55,640
It was like going to visit your,
your grandma's nuclear missile silo.

43
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,860
And so it was jarring,
you know,

44
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,980
because it's obviously a

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,370
poor tentious place and yet it was 
conjoined with hospitality and 

46
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,660
welcoming.
It was surreal in that manner.

47
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,820
Anyways,
we went into the,

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,560
into the silo and uh,
they ran us through a simulated launch.

49
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,160
So imagine a panel like this made out of
metal except twice as long with another 

50
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:31,430
one of these things at the other end,
16 feet across or so,

51
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,860
basically 19 fifties technology,
but updated.

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,120
And then imagine that what you had to do
to launch it was the,

53
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,830
there was a guy with a key and there was
another guy with a key,

54
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,650
and if I remember correctly,
the keys were around their necks,

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,350
although I don't think they're restored 
around their necks permanently.

56
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:52,600
But.
And so to launch the missile,

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,200
you had to put the key in the lock,
both of you.

58
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,770
That was the safety precautions had to 
be to have you put the key in the lock 

59
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:05,800
and hold it for 10 seconds.
And then away the missile goes.

60
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:09,250
And it wasn't as big.
The missile wasn't as big as the rockets

61
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,910
that went to the moon.
But it was plenty big,

62
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,060
you know,
the silo itself would have easily been 

63
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,350
as wide as this room is and perhaps 
larger and many,

64
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,730
many stories tall,
you know,

65
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,740
because it was nested under ground.
So they ran us through a simulated 

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:26,740
launch,
which was

67
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,500
surreal,
I would say.

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,450
And then they told us that someone asked
and they said the keys were in once.

69
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,680
Now they wouldn't tell us when,
you know,

70
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,280
that would have been during the Cuban 
missile crisis because we were that 

71
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:50,610
close and we were close again at other 
times,

72
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:55,611
although perhaps not that close.
And there seemed to be another peak of 

73
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:01,670
conflict in 1984 when there was a movie 
showed at that time called the day 

74
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:08,541
after,
which at that time garnered more views 

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,660
than any movie ever had on,
on TV.

76
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:14,780
And it was a story about the aftermath 
of a nuclear war and the people who were

77
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:20,661
left.
And it was pretty realistic and pretty 

78
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,560
frightening.
And it turned out,

79
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,460
as I found out later that that movie 
actually was one of the things that 

80
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,110
influenced Ronald Reagan to put pressure
on or negotiate with the Soviets.

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Depending on how you look at it and so,
well,

82
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:38,670
and then,
you know,

83
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,570
five years later the Soviet Union 
collapsed.

84
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,940
No one saw that coming,
um,

85
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,530
and it really didn't collapse in 1989 in
some sense.

86
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:54,531
You know,
like a huge machine like that doesn't 

87
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,830
fall apart all at once.
It falls apart over time.

88
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,220
And then

89
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,680
at some point it just becomes an 
unsustainable and topples and you know,

90
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,930
it's like they lost faith in their 
doctrine and,

91
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,170
and,
and for good reason.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,580
You know,
that

93
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,330
the system in Russia,
the Soviet Union,

94
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:24,331
which was a collection of states,
an empire and the system that was 

95
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,850
established in China and the system that
still exists in Korea as a remnant of 

96
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:35,791
the Cold War and systems in Southeast 
Asia and in Africa were all predicated 

97
00:06:38,051 --> 00:06:43,051
on Marxist presuppositions.
Presuppositions that were Utopian in 

98
00:06:45,761 --> 00:06:46,300
nature.

99
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,390
And that

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,160
posited a utopian future where property 
was held in common and everyone had 

101
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,910
enough.
And everyone was called upon to do what 

102
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,001
they could write from each according to 
his ability to each according to his 

103
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:06,020
need.
Which is a lovely sentiment.

104
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,110
And you can imagine how it would be 
attractive even intellectually because 

105
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:16,151
of course other systems,
all other systems produce vast 

106
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:21,521
disparities in income.
It's like a natural law that's actually 

107
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,340
governed by.
You can model it

108
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,630
with a distribution called the 
peritoneal distribution and the prieto 

109
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:32,630
distribution.
It looks like this.

110
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,980
It doesn't look like a normal 
distribution.

111
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:39,330
A lot of you guys have been told about 
normal distributions and how many things

112
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,870
follow a normal distribution.
Most things,

113
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,990
but that's really a limited case.
You can understand that prieto 

114
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:49,530
distribution,
if you.

115
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,160
You've all played monopoly,
I presume at the beginning everyone has 

116
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,100
the same amount of money,
will include property,

117
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,160
the same amount of wealth.
And then what happens as the game 

118
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,410
progresses and really as a function of 
chance.

119
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:07,080
I mean I know yet you have to use your 
head a little bit monopoly,

120
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:12,081
but the basic rule is just buy 
everything you can get your hands on and

121
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,520
then trade meanly,
something like that.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,060
So at the beginning everybody has the 
same amount.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,510
And then as you begin to play,
if you had enough players,

124
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:27,590
you would develop an,
a normal distribution because some 

125
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,471
people would win,
see relatively consistently and some 

126
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:30,690
people would lose relatively 
consistently.

127
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,100
And so the money starts to be 
distributed in a normal distribution.

128
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:40,101
But the thing about money and the thing 
about lots of things is that zero is 

129
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:47,631
involved in zero is a weird place 
because if you're playing a trading game

130
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,810
and you hit zero,
then you're done.

131
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,250
And so,
and it's very hard to recover zero and 

132
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:58,250
you know,
it's really hard to recover.

133
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,670
You know,
when you're doomed and monopoly,

134
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,640
you know,
you can tell you've got some resources,

135
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,880
but there's going to be some crisis when
you land on some hotel and you're going 

136
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,360
to get wiped out,
you know it.

137
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:12,870
So there's a point at which you're 
headed for zero.

138
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:17,871
Even if you have something you know and 
you might be rescued by luck,

139
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,710
but you know when you're doomed.
So what happens is that as you continue 

140
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:33,051
to play monopoly,
more and more people stack up at zero 

141
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,020
and fewer and fewer people have more and
more money.

142
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,740
And when the game is over,
everyone has nothing except one person 

143
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,440
and they have all of it.
Now,

144
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:48,441
the funny thing about that is that in 
some sense that's how trading games 

145
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:49,170
work.
You know,

146
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,880
you've got.
You might wonder why is that,

147
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,920
why there is any quality in this 
society?

148
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,250
And it's easy to consider that it's 
because the society is corrupt and 

149
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,920
perhaps no society is ours somewhat or 
horribly corrupt.

150
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,180
That's the variation.
There is no society that's without.

151
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:11,181
It's criminal and criminal element and 
fixed element anyways.

152
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Trading Games tend to produce a prieto 
distribution so that very many people 

153
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,200
have very little and a tiny minority 
have a tremendous amount.

154
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,720
That's the one percent that you hear 
about,

155
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,460
right?
And you know,

156
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:31,461
the thing about that one percent is that
that's happened in every society that's 

157
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:35,151
ever been studied.
It doesn't really matter what the 

158
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:37,641
governmental system is and it certainly 
handled it certainly happened under the 

159
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:37,641
Soviets,
that's for sure.

160
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,230
And there was a lot of people who had 
enough zero,

161
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:44,310
so they just died.
So you know,

162
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,320
the,
the Utopian dream was completely 

163
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,730
unimplementable for a variety of very 
complex reasons.

164
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,790
One is that it's very hard to fight 
against that distribution pattern when 

165
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,180
people are trading because mirror 
statistics will do that and then there's

166
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:08,181
other things that,
and I should tell you as well that the 

167
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:08,310
prieto distribution government governs a
lot of things,

168
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:13,340
so if you look at books,
if I remember properly last year there 

169
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:19,341
was something like a million English 
language books published and I think 500

170
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:22,620
of them sold more than 100,000
copies,

171
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,910
which is none,
right?

172
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:28,910
That's none of that 500.
You can be sure that one of them was by 

173
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,751
Stephen King and he took half the money 
because there's like five authors in the

174
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,560
English language who are at on every 
airport,

175
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,270
paperback stand,
occupying the top rung.

176
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,890
And that's massive real estate,
right?

177
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:48,870
Because it's replicated everywhere and 
because they're so prominent and because

178
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:53,040
there are no names when people are in a 
hurry and they just want something to.

179
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,720
They just grabbed that and then more 
money goes to those people.

180
00:11:55,721 --> 00:12:00,721
And so you know,
success breeds success and failure 

181
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,440
breeds failure and it's not necessarily 
linear.

182
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,850
Now.
It's a really difficult thing to deal 

183
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,171
with and it's hard on societies because 
one of the things we do know is that,

184
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,030
you know,
as you stretch out the inequality you 

185
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,390
make,
men particularly on the lower end of the

186
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,540
distribution,
more and more likely to be aggressive.

187
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,260
It's sort of like imagine every man has 
a threshold for violence.

188
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,140
Um,
and status is important to men.

189
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,830
Not that it's not important to women,
but it's a different,

190
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,980
it's a different kind of status.
It's status is important to men because 

191
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,611
it's one of the things that makes them 
marketable as partners to women's what 

192
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:42,770
actually turns out to be quite important
to the men.

193
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,540
Men tend to compete with one another for
status,

194
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
hierarchy position and in a really 
unequal society.

195
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,340
If you're like a low rung guy then and 
you don't have any opportunity to rise 

196
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:01,690
because the society isn't structured so 
that there's mobility.

197
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,110
Then the more aggressive guys tend to 
turn into criminality and you know,

198
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:13,021
and so you could say there's a threshold
for criminality and the more inequality 

199
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:18,721
pressure you put on a particular area,
geographic or political area,

200
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,490
the more inequality pressure you put on 
it,

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,740
the more men slip past that threshold 
and into criminality.

202
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,230
And you know,
there's been pretty good studies done of

203
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,550
drug gang in Chicago.
That was the best one.

204
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:36,400
A sociologist actually went and hung out
with a drug gang for.

205
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,260
He got into it.
I guess the drug gang leader was no,

206
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,940
I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,
but that might be a reasonable way of 

207
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,961
thinking about it.
And he was kind of happy with the idea 

208
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:55,981
of maybe being a subject of a book and.
And so this guy was able to associate 

209
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:00,880
with them,
got to know them quite well.

210
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,360
And then the housing project in which 
the gang was housed was slated for 

211
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,521
demolition and the gang broke up and he 
got the books because they kept books.

212
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,950
And what he found was the average street
drug dealer,

213
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,550
first of all,
was employed in another job as well.

214
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,350
And was making far less than minimum 
wage now,

215
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,530
but the guys further up the chain of 
course followed the prieto distribution 

216
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:33,751
and so there was a tiny minority of them
who were raking in a tremendous amount 

217
00:14:33,751 --> 00:14:36,991
of loot and the guys at the bottom,
we're just waiting around for the 

218
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:40,420
possibility that they could rise up the 
hierarchy and you know,

219
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,620
it's pretty violent game.

220
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,620
So the chances that someone is going to 
be taken out is pretty high and then a 

221
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,971
little slot opens up for some 
opportunistic second rater and perhaps 

222
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:59,951
he can move up the hierarchy.
So the prieto distribution,

223
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,280
governance,
all sorts of other things too.

224
00:15:05,281 --> 00:15:09,810
I mentioned it governs the popularity of
books,

225
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,150
the sales of books,
but it also,

226
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,660
it also characterizes the distribution 
of everything that people produce.

227
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,520
So if you think of creative production 
of any sort of artistic production,

228
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,800
industrial production,
it doesn't matter.

229
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,190
Almost everything fails

230
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,110
and a few things succeed beyond anyone's
wildest imagination.

231
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,390
Apple's a good example of that.
No,

232
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,990
I mean the iphone,
they have their competitors,

233
00:15:41,991 --> 00:15:46,991
but it's an extraordinarily dominant 
product and they rake in billions of 

234
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:51,490
dollars I think.
I don't know if apple is valued at a 

235
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,210
trillion dollars,
but it's close to that and that's a lot 

236
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,120
of money and I think if I remember 
correctly,

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,240
it's something like this.
I probably have the figures wrong,

238
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:04,241
but like the top 40 people,
the richest 40 people in the world have 

239
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:06,320
as much money as the bottom 2 billion 
right now.

240
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,350
You know,
it's not like they're stuffing their 

241
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,900
mattresses with that money or they have 
a skyscraper full of cash.

242
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,520
That money is out in the economy doing 
whatever money does.

243
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,510
So you know,
you can't spend $28,

244
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:22,490
billion dollars.
So.

245
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,500
And sometimes you can even do some good 
with it.

246
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:29,501
You know,
Bill Gates seems to be doing something 

247
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,591
reasonable with his money.
But the reason I'm telling you this is 

248
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,951
because one of the things you should 
know is that this proclivity for 

249
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:41,591
inequality is pervasive among the 
creative products of human beings.

250
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,320
It's the case with,
with goals scored in hockey.

251
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:50,620
My son told me,
and he's a reliable source on hockey 

252
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:50,620
statistics that

253
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,360
if Wayne Gretzky,
if you don't count any of the points 

254
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,821
that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring,
he still had enough points just with 

255
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:02,160
assists to have more points than any 
hockey player that ever played.

256
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So you know,
you even at the upper end of of of the 

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,490
distribution,
there's some person who's hot.

258
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:15,580
They're so good at what they do and then
there's another person that's so much 

259
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,090
better than them that it's not even 
comparable and so.

260
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,080
And the benefits flow to people who are 
in that position.

261
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:27,081
And you can understand why I would say 
because now let's say you start writing 

262
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:32,450
and you get a book and a rare things.
Very rare things to have happened.

263
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,410
And then some people read it and they 
like it.

264
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:37,410
And then of course it's much more likely
that you'll get a next book.

265
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,800
And if people like that,
while it's even more likely that you'll 

266
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:42,800
get a third book and then people start 
to know who you are.

267
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,780
And then because they know who you are.
They phone you up and offer you 

268
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,691
opportunities.
And your network grows and it's like 

269
00:17:50,691 --> 00:17:53,360
this exponential increase in your reach 
and your capacity for production and 

270
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,540
more and more flows to you.
And then on the other hand,

271
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,920
if you start to fail and you know,
why would someone fail?

272
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:07,030
Well God,
you know,

273
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,520
one idea that's very common in our 
culture is that poverty is caused by 

274
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,001
lack of money.
And that's a really stupid idea because 

275
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,901
money is very difficult to handle.
I had clients who were drug addicts and 

276
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,330
the worst possible thing that could 
happen to them was that they got some 

277
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:26,940
money.
They're just done.

278
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,690
First of all,
you know,

279
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:32,610
they were hanging around with people who
were little on the sociopathic side.

280
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:37,611
And so especially if they weren't that 
bright and couldn't defend themselves 

281
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:42,141
very well,
as soon as they got money while it was 

282
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:42,141
off to the bar with all the friends.

283
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:45,420
And you know,
one guy I remember in particular,

284
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,540
you know,
every time he got as his disability 

285
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,080
check,
he was gone for five days,

286
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:54,150
usually fondom in a ditch,
you know,

287
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,170
cause he just go to the bar,
spent every Saturday had on alcohol and 

288
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
cocaine.
And wake up in a ditch three quarters 

289
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,640
dead eventually completely did and you 
know,

290
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:13,851
then he was ashamed and horrified and 
repentant and he'd straightened himself 

291
00:19:15,001 --> 00:19:20,001
out again.
And then that was all well and good 

292
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:22,131
until,
as long as he was broke until the next 

293
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:22,560
check showed up and then bang the same 
thing.

294
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:27,561
So you know,
it's not like money is necessarily a 

295
00:19:27,561 --> 00:19:29,430
good for everyone.
It's hard managed money.

296
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,760
It's really easy for it to disappear.
I mean elderly people have a hell of a 

297
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,911
time now because you know,
crooks are contacting them on the 

298
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:40,830
Internet nonstop.
And so just giving people money,

299
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,690
money's like,
it's like pouring water in their hands 

300
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:46,690
is not that helpful.

301
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,930
Not necessarily that helpful.
And then of course contributors to 

302
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,560
poverty are well,
it's not so good to have a low Iq.

303
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,030
You know,
people don't like the idea of Iq because

304
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,460
it seems so arbitrary,
you know,

305
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,520
have a high Iq.
Well it's not like you deserved that.

306
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:07,521
Exactly.
It's your setup that way pretty much 

307
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:07,521
right from the beginning.
It's a very,

308
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,640
very,
very,

309
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,420
very stable.
You can make a high Iq person stupider.

310
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,630
Why?
You know,

311
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,080
not educating them up to the level of 
their possibility,

312
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:19,470
but taking someone who has a low Iq and 
trying to raise that.

313
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,330
It's like if you can figure out how to 
do that,

314
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,780
well you know,
Nobel prize time for you because people 

315
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,650
have tried that a lot and most recently 
with those,

316
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:33,651
you know,
Luminol lumosity games and that sort of 

317
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,961
thing and the evidence that those 
produce anything other than brilliant 

318
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:41,400
performances on the lumosity game itself
is basically zero.

319
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:46,550
We haven't been able to figure out how 
to see because intelligence is across 

320
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,440
domain phenomena and you can get really 
good in a single domain by practicing 

321
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,131
like mad and what you'd want is to 
practice like matt in a single domain 

322
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,910
and hope that it generalized to other 
domains.

323
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,820
That's the holy grail of intelligence 
increase.

324
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,870
It's like,
no,

325
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,890
no one's done it.
People claim it but the claims never 

326
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,041
hold up and people have been trying for 
a long time to do it and they haven't 

327
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:11,680
been able to do it.
And

328
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,880
differences in Iq really make a 
difference.

329
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,660
You know?
I mean,

330
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,890
you guys,
average Iq is probably one slash 25 

331
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,200
slash 30 ad at 1:15
you're at the 85th percentile and 1:15

332
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:35,650
would barely get you going for you.
For Harvard University,

333
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,000
1:30,
you're probably graduate school material

334
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,310
1:45.
You're up there at the range where you 

335
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,620
can probably do pretty much whatever you
want.

336
00:21:47,621 --> 00:21:52,621
Although as you get smarter,
the scatter between your abilities 

337
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:56,251
increase.
So you might have a very high verbal Iq 

338
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:56,350
but not be so good at mathematics or the
other way around,

339
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,890
but it's a massive contributor to 
lifetime success and I don't know what 

340
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,770
to do about that.
I mean why do smart people make more 

341
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:07,900
money?
Well,

342
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:13,230
they get to where the edge of production
is faster.

343
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:17,230
So if you have a thousand people and you
rank order them by ICU,

344
00:22:17,231 --> 00:22:22,231
the smart people are going to come up 
with new ideas first and they're going 

345
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:23,740
to have more ideas and they're going to 
strategize better.

346
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,490
And you know,
with an Iq of 90,

347
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,850
which is 15 percent of the population,
you think about that 15 percent of the 

348
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:40,281
population.
That's pretty much the threshold for 

349
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:41,310
reading instructions and being able to 
follow them.

350
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,350
So you know,
and our society is increasingly 

351
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,310
sophisticated so it's by no means 
obvious,

352
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,650
you know,
the liberals think,

353
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:53,010
well

354
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:53,980
hmm,

355
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,410
the society is unfair because there's 
unemployment and the Conservatives think

356
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,070
while there's a job for everyone,
but none of them think,

357
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,960
well there are massive,
massive,

358
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:08,700
massive differences in people's ability 
far greater than anyone realizes.

359
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And that poses a structural problem.
I had a client and I got him a volunteer

360
00:23:15,931 --> 00:23:18,030
job,
which is way harder than you think.

361
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:23,031
You need a police check for example,
like it's harder to get a volunteer job 

362
00:23:23,031 --> 00:23:25,470
than a real job.
But I regard them in a volunteer job and

363
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,010
he had to fold pieces of paper letters.
It was.

364
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:34,011
He worked at a charity.
He had to full pieces of paper in three 

365
00:23:34,011 --> 00:23:35,250
so that he could put them inside 
envelopes and,

366
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,950
and then the letters which were in a 
pile had to be matched with the proper 

367
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,950
envelopes,
which we're also in a pile,

368
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,080
but some of them were French and some of
the wrangling.

369
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,430
So the French ones had to be matched 
carefully to the French envelopes and,

370
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,050
and then if,
you know,

371
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,620
if there was one envelope out of,
out of order,

372
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,400
well then he had to figure out whether 
it was the papers that were out of order

373
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:03,401
or the letters that were out of order.
And then some of the letters had 

374
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:07,930
photographs attached to them and you 
weren't supposed to bend the photographs

375
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,590
but they weren't always in the same 
place.

376
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:14,591
So that meant you had to figure out how 
to fold the paper in three a bunch of 

377
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,420
different ways without creasing the 
photograph.

378
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,790
And then the other thing is,
and I never realized how difficult it is

379
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:27,791
to put a piece of paper and an envelope 
till I watched someone who couldn't do 

380
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:30,500
it and he probably had an Iq of about 
80.

381
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,120
You know,
if you met him on the street,

382
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,460
you wouldn't think anything different of
him.

383
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,210
It was normal looking guy had some other
problems.

384
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:43,910
Um,
I trained him to fold those damn papers 

385
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,550
for like 30 hours and he got reasonably 
good at it.

386
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:51,551
But you know,
if you're good at it and you probably 

387
00:24:51,551 --> 00:24:55,811
all are,
you fold it and the edges line up 

388
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:56,900
exactly like really,
exactly.

389
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,510
The tolerance is probably half a 
millimeter or something like that.

390
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,500
Then you do the second fold and the 
tolerance is the same.

391
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,620
But let's imagine that the first full 
you,

392
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,650
you're out by an eighth of an inch in 
the second full year out by an eighth of

393
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:11,540
an inch.
So it's a little crooked.

394
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,300
Not means in totally route by a quarter 
of an inch.

395
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Then it won't fit in the damn envelope.
So then you kind of crumpled the 

396
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,251
envelope when you put it in there and 
then it gets stuck in the sorting 

397
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:23,251
machine.

398
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:27,400
And so he sweated blood trying to do 
that job and eventually eventually plan 

399
00:25:30,141 --> 00:25:33,290
to fire him.
So imagine what that's like a,

400
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:39,230
you know,
you can't get a job and then so you get 

401
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,761
a job at a charity as a volunteer and a 
charity decides to fire you.

402
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,400
You know?
I mean really that's just.

403
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,150
So I talked to the woman who was running
it and suggested that that might be a 

404
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:58,160
little on the devastating side.
I mean,

405
00:25:58,161 --> 00:26:00,410
she had her reasons,
you know,

406
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,090
he,
he,

407
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,560
he was always asking people questions 
about how to do his job and you know,

408
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,590
so that meant he was interfering with 
the productivity of other people and it 

409
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,720
was genuine interference.
I mean,

410
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:16,721
she wasn't being mean and it was her job
to make sure the place did what it was 

411
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:17,750
supposed to.
So,

412
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,680
you know,
she was between a rock and a hard place.

413
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:27,630
Um,
he eventually decided that the job 

414
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,851
wasn't for him and relatively soon after
that I think it was too stressful and 

415
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:33,560
uh,
he quit.

416
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,950
So that solved that problem except in he
didn't have job,

417
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,060
which of course is a problem.
Um,

418
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,840
it has a happy ending.
This story,

419
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,840
as far as I know,
he,

420
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,970
he got a dog because he was very 
lonesome.

421
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,910
And that dog man have not guy trained 
that dog.

422
00:26:50,911 --> 00:26:55,911
That was something else.
That dog just think he lost 30 pounds 

423
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:55,911
while he was training that dog because 
dogs,

424
00:26:55,911 --> 00:26:56,250
they're,
you know,

425
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,760
dominant.
And he had to have a tussle with the dog

426
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,030
to figure out who was in charge and it's
a lot of responsibility to have a dog,

427
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,430
but he was pretty damn committed to that
dog.

428
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,940
And he managed it.
The things he went through to keep that 

429
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,160
dog.
You just cannot possibly imagine.

430
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:12,930
It's like a,
it's like a,

431
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,710
it's like a surreal.
It was surreal.

432
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,110
Just like the nuclear missile silo.
I mean,

433
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,250
he had people following him around 
informing on him because they thought he

434
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:28,251
was abusing the dog when in fact,
because I watched the dog was clearly 

435
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,040
abusive.
Um,

436
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,260
so he got a job helping a woman who 
trained dogs and,

437
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,430
and then he had a job.
So Hooray,

438
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,510
you know,
but it was like a miracle fundamentally.

439
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,600
So anyways,
the reason I'm telling you all this is 

440
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,871
because there was a reason for the Cold 
War and the reason was that there's 

441
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:56,790
inequality and there's different 
theories about how to address that 

442
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,770
inequality and different theories about 
why it exists.

443
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,790
And there was a Marxist theory about why
it exists,

444
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,970
which was roughly something like 
property equals theft.

445
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:09,390
And those who have more have taken it 
from those who have less,

446
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
which,
you know,

447
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,390
seems to me to eliminate any conceptual 
than that.

448
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,360
There isn't a fixed pot of money,
you know,

449
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:22,710
money expands actually as we become more
technologically proficient.

450
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:28,310
And lots of people who have money have 
it because they've generated a lot of 

451
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,980
wealth.
I mean,

452
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,350
Bill Gates is a great example of that,
right?

453
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:34,500
He popularized computing.
He made it possible for everybody to,

454
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,050
to have access to computing.
It's like,

455
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,260
seems like a good good for him.
You know.

456
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,560
And you could say the same thing about 
Steve jobs and maybe you'll be able to 

457
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,080
say the same thing about Elon Musk and 
you know,

458
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,720
these guys have tremendous resources out
their disposal,

459
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,080
but you know,
they're not like,

460
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,280
they're not bathing in bank notes,
you know,

461
00:28:56,281 --> 00:29:01,281
they're,
you're trying to continue to do things 

462
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,611
and they use their money to do things.
And anyways,

463
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,280
the Russians set themselves up under 
Marxists presuppositions and tried to 

464
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,710
equalize the distribution of property 
and to call that catastrophic,

465
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,500
barely scratches the surface.
And I know that you guys probably don't 

466
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,020
learn much about this because for some 
reason people aren't taught about it,

467
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:28,290
but

468
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:30,330
no,

469
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,430
the good estimates are that the Russians
killed about 30 million of their own 

470
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,160
people between 19,
19 in 1959,

471
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,420
you know,
and it's,

472
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,090
it's,
it's brutal.

473
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:44,620
A lot of that with,
through starvation.

474
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,980
You know,
I saw a photograph the other day which I

475
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:52,981
tweeted,
which is the worst photograph I've ever 

476
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:52,981
seen in my life.
And that's actually saying a lot because

477
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:57,900
I've seen a lot of really terrible 
photographs because I've done so much 

478
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,771
investigation into totalitarianism.
This was a photograph that was taken 

479
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:05,610
during one of the early starvation 
periods in,

480
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,170
in the Soviet Union were about 3 million
peasants died.

481
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,380
It was a picture of a peasant couple 
standing behind a table at a market 

482
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,820
selling human body parts for food.
It's like,

483
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,980
and you know,
I have this weird quirk,

484
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,420
which I don't think does me much good,
but maybe helps me understand things 

485
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,750
better when I see that someone has done 
something extreme.

486
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,950
I learned to do this a long time ago 
when I worked briefly in a maximum 

487
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,960
security prison.
I try to imagine what I would have to be

488
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,961
like,
what kind of situation I would have to 

489
00:30:42,961 --> 00:30:43,720
find myself in to do that and believe 
me,

490
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,520
man,
that's a horrifying enter.

491
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,510
That's a horrifying enterprise because 
it is actually possible.

492
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,780
No matter what it is that you read about
someone doing and no matter how unlikely

493
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:59,821
it is that you think you would do that,
it's possible to imagine yourself in 

494
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,260
that situation

495
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,310
and that.

496
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,140
Well,
that's enlightening.

497
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,940
That's what I would say.
That's enlightening.

498
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,230
You know,
because one of the things about 

499
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,771
enlightenment is is that you get 
enlightened by doing things that are 

500
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,690
necessary that you really,
really,

501
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:24,691
really do not want to know.
You don't want to do and imagine 

502
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:29,460
imagining yourself as a perpetrator of 
that sort is that tells you something 

503
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:32,650
about the world and that tells you 
something about human beings.

504
00:31:32,651 --> 00:31:36,700
But it's a hell of a thing to swallow.
You know,

505
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:41,701
and in a very well structured society 
like ours where were so peaceful while.

506
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:49,261
Because we have the heat and it always 
works and we have electricity and it 

507
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:51,100
always works,
and we have plumbing,

508
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:54,520
which is a bloody miracle and it always 
works.

509
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,880
You know,
it's just one of the things that this 

510
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,510
imagination process has done for me is 
keep me alert

511
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,370
to the absolute miracle that my life is 
every day.

512
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,210
It's horribly cold out there.
You can't grow any food.

513
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,630
You die if you're out there for 24 
hours.

514
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:20,430
If any of this infrastructure was 
unreliable for any length of time,

515
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:24,360
we would be in serious trouble.
And it's never unreliable.

516
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:30,050
It's so unlikely.
And so here we are with all this 

517
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:32,760
reliable infrastructure and because of 
that,

518
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:34,950
we don't really have to compete with 
each other much.

519
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,040
I mean,
some you don't compete for food,

520
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,550
you don't compete for shelter or some 
people do,

521
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:43,910
but not very many.
So it's really easy to think of yourself

522
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,120
as good because,
well,

523
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,240
you're not doing anything nasty,
Danny one.

524
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,430
But you know,
a cynic might say,

525
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,920
well that's just because you don't have 
any reason to.

526
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,110
But those reasons have arisen many times
in the past,

527
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:04,120
and in fact they're the norm,
not the exception.

528
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:09,220
We're the exception.
This insanely functional society that 

529
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,330
we've somehow managed to generate is 
it's incomprehensible to me that it 

530
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:21,311
exists.
So anyways,

531
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,620
back in the industrial,
at the end of the industrial revolution,

532
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,140
you know,
the conditions of the worker were pretty

533
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:33,340
brutal.
I mean,

534
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:36,430
George Orwell wrote a book called road 
to Wigan Pier,

535
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,860
which I would highly recommend.
It's a great book.

536
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,520
And he went up in the thirties,
I think it was the thirties to work to 

537
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:48,310
live with the coal miners up in northern
northern uk.

538
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,210
And those poor guys,
you know,

539
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,280
they had to crawl to work for two miles 
down a tunnel that they couldn't stand 

540
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,661
up in just to start their shift.
And then after their eight hours of,

541
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,430
you know,
hacking away at the coal walls,

542
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,490
which is rather difficult and dirty and 
dangerous.

543
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,740
And of course you get black lung from 
it.

544
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:13,741
So it's also fatal.
And of course they didn't get paid very 

545
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:13,741
much.
So after doing that for eight hours,

546
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:18,010
then you crawled back,
you're two miles and you didn't get paid

547
00:34:18,011 --> 00:34:18,340
for that.

548
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,530
That was just,
that was just the commute.

549
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,280
And the housing for those people was not
good.

550
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,340
The food wasn't good.
Most of them had no teeth by the time 

551
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,340
they were 30,
you know,

552
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,070
I mean,
being poor was no joke.

553
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:33,160
Even in a place like the UK,
which was relatively well off.

554
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,400
And so there was every reason to be 
concerned about the disparity between 

555
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,960
rich and poor and poor is the natural 
state.

556
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:42,940
You know,
that in the Western world,

557
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,620
in 18,
95,

558
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:48,280
the typical person lived on a dollar a 
day in today's dollars.

559
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And you know,
that's not uncommon in many places in 

560
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,751
the world now.
So there were reasons to be concerned 

561
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,590
with inequality.
And you know,

562
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:04,591
the Russians took one pathway inspired 
by Marx and we took another pathway 

563
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:10,110
inspired by John Stuart Mill and John 
Locke and the English tradition,

564
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:16,021
I would say,
of democracy and competed for 70 years.

565
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,800
And things seemed to have worked out 
better here.

566
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:27,970
But it was a hell of a competition.
And there were real differences in 

567
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:32,471
opinion at the bottom of it and those 
two systems turned into armed camps.

568
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,970
And that's not over exactly.
You know what I mean?

569
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,310
There's the Chinese,
the whole a hybrid now between communism

570
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:46,311
and capitalism and hopefully they're 
more interested in getting rich than 

571
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:46,311
they are in,
you know,

572
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,700
having a war.
Greed is a good motivator.

573
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,460
A surprisingly enough,
it's kind of reliable.

574
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,720
But anyways,
by 1989,

575
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,560
the Jig was up.
It was obvious that the Soviet system 

576
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,030
could not,
was not functional.

577
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,510
There was no,
no consumer goods,

578
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,890
that's for sure.
Even in the main department stores and 

579
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:14,890
in Russia,
in Moscow,

580
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:17,910
and people just kind of lost faith in 
the whole project.

581
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,120
You know,
it became her for awhile.

582
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,270
I don't know if you know about the show.
Dallas Dallas was a soap opera that ran 

583
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:28,910
at night a cereal.
And uh,

584
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,150
it was about these rich Texans who 
lived,

585
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,670
you know,
a one percent lifestyle.

586
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,090
And it was the most popular show in East
Germany.

587
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,030
The streets would empty so that people 
could watch dallas.

588
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,390
Well,
when you're sitting in your horrible 

589
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,991
Soviet architecture flat that you know,
you had to struggle to get with your 

590
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:56,601
informing relatives because one out of 
three people in East Germany was an 

591
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:00,210
informer government informer and you 
watched Dallas,

592
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:05,390
you know,
there's a little cognitive dissonance 

593
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,701
occurring and so fell apart and quite 
peaceful.

594
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:10,980
He actually,
you know,

595
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:14,520
there was a war and there was a bit of 
war in eastern Europe,

596
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,260
but it fell apart remarkably peacefully.
And so here we are and we don't know 

597
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:24,210
what to do with the Pesky Russians,
but

598
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,340
at least there's no evidence that there 
are mortal enemies for fundamental 

599
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,871
reasons of axiomatic presupposition and 
things are a lot better in the world 

600
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,920
despite what everyone tells you than 
they were 40 years ago and there's so 

601
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,720
much better than they were 50 years ago.
That it's absolutely staggering.

602
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:53,990
We've lifted more people out of poverty 
in the last 15 years that have been 

603
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,130
lifted out of poverty in the entire 
history of the world before then.

604
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,580
People are gathering economic resources 
at a rate that even the wildest 

605
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:05,550
optimists really couldn't dream of 
speeding up.

606
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,770
So it's not like we're without our 
problems,

607
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:16,771
but so during that period of time I was 
obsessed is a good word with a question 

608
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,130
and the question was why would human 
beings

609
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:39,490
produced two and then produce a massive 
arsenal of hydrogen bombs and I don't 

610
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:47,521
know what you know about hydrogen bombs,
but they have atom bombs for triggers 

611
00:38:47,521 --> 00:38:48,730
and you know,
that's where thinking about,

612
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,900
because an atom bomb,
you know,

613
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:50,770
hey,
that's,

614
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,080
that's something but a hydrogen bomb,
that's the son that's really something.

615
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,110
So,
and you know,

616
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,850
there's 20 there at,
at,

617
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,970
at the peak of the Cold War and there's,
this is still true to some degree.

618
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,600
There were literally tens of thousands 
of these weapons aimed at the Soviet 

619
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,040
Union then at the West.
And that was enough to pretty much put 

620
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:18,490
an end to everything.
And that's a dangerous game man,

621
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,850
you know,
and not only because of intent,

622
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:24,400
but also because of the possibility of 
accidental.

623
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,410
Just an accident,
you know,

624
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,220
just,
just a mistake or just someone who's a 

625
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,220
little crazier than you might want them 
to be.

626
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,820
You know?
And you might think,

627
00:39:33,821 --> 00:39:38,821
well,
no one would want to bring about the 

628
00:39:38,821 --> 00:39:40,261
destruction of the world,
but that just means you don't know very 

629
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:43,741
much about stellan because of all the 
people who lived in the 20th century who

630
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:49,591
had power.
Stalin was the most motivated to bring 

631
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:55,381
everything to an end.
There's some evidence that he was 

632
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:59,041
murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and 
Khrushchev was the next leader.

633
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,520
And if he wasn't murdered,
he was at least not provided with 

634
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,460
medical attention when he was dying.

635
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,490
And,
uh,

636
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,790
there is reasonable evidence that he was
gearing up to invade western Europe and 

637
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,500
he didn't really care how much 
destruction would go along with that.

638
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:22,501
I mean,
he'd already killed tens of millions of 

639
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:22,501
people.
He had a lot of practice.

640
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,880
He was good at it.
It didn't really bother him.

641
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,180
Maybe even enjoyed it.
So what the hell?

642
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,930
That's what I thought.
How can it be that we're doing this?

643
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:40,931
It's so insane.
So then I started to think about belief 

644
00:40:41,581 --> 00:40:42,650
systems,
you know,

645
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,230
because you could say that each camp had
its own belief system.

646
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:51,231
The one in the West was derived.
It had a very lengthy history derived 

647
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:56,090
from the Greeks and the Romans and Jews 
and the Christians and and from various 

648
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:00,390
schools of philosophy and from the 
enlightenment and all of that,

649
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:05,391
and then the Soviet Union was basically 
predicated on irrational philosophy that

650
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:11,290
that opposed the axioms that the West 
had evolved and each group organized 

651
00:41:13,801 --> 00:41:18,801
their societies around that and no,
I took political science for quite a 

652
00:41:19,551 --> 00:41:20,090
long time

653
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,130
and the political scientists and the 
economists,

654
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,330
they basically thought that people 
competed over resources,

655
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,400
but that wasn't a very good answer as 
far I was concerned because it wasn't 

656
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,400
obvious to me why people valued the 
resources they valued.

657
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:42,410
There is the economist.
Just assume that there's resources that 

658
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,410
you value,
but you know,

659
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,420
people can value a lot of different 
things.

660
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:49,421
It's not exactly fixed.
I mean you tend to value food very 

661
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:50,600
highly if you're hungry obviously,
but you know,

662
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:55,601
there's lots of things that we value and
that we want that seem somewhat 

663
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:57,350
arbitrary,
somewhat like a decision.

664
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,150
So I got more interested in why people 
valued things and what it meant to value

665
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:07,151
something and then what it meant to 
believe something and then how it could 

666
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:14,321
be that someone could believe something 
so deeply that they would risk their own

667
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:19,361
death to protect it or at least risk the
death of other people and and maybe on a

668
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:22,250
massive scale like,
man,

669
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,950
people are committed to their,
to their system.

670
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Now you know,
a system of belief is not just a system 

671
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,421
of belief.
That's one of the things that I came to 

672
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:36,371
understand is that it's not appropriate 
to make this to psychological people,

673
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:39,290
defend their belief systems,
but that's not exactly right.

674
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,720
You know,
we have a shared belief system.

675
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,470
Well,
it's sufficiently shared so that here we

676
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:47,420
are,
we don't know each other.

677
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,010
We're a bunch of primates.

678
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,910
We're in this room and it's peaceful and
no one's scared.

679
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,540
And,
and that's pretty amazing.

680
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:58,240
And that means that we're all acting out
our roles.

681
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,780
So we're acting out our roles and we 
have an expectation with regards to 

682
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,920
those roles.
And those two things match.

683
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,490
And that's the important thing.
And we'll talk about that a lot.

684
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:14,290
It isn't the belief system or the 
integrity of the belief system even it's

685
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:19,291
the match between the belief system and 
the actions of the other people within 

686
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:21,850
the belief system.
What you want to maintain is that match.

687
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:27,330
You want to act out your beliefs in the 
world and you want what you want to 

688
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:28,930
happen.
That's good thing.

689
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:31,480
You get what you want and you validate 
your belief system.

690
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,060
Great,
perfect security,

691
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,050
but a lot of that is if we're 
interacting even right now,

692
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:41,770
there's a whole set of expectations that
are governing what we're doing.

693
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,620
Like you don't want me to take your your
little tablet there,

694
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,900
smash it.
That would be shocking,

695
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:48,550
right?
You wouldn't know what the hell to do,

696
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:53,970
right?
You'd be somewhere different if I did 

697
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:54,610
that and you wouldn't know where you 
were,

698
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,130
and that's another thing to know because
that's a fundamental difference.

699
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,430
There is a fundamental difference 
between knowing where you are and not 

700
00:44:05,471 --> 00:44:10,471
knowing where you are.
I think it's in some sense the 

701
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:14,371
fundamental difference.
You can think about it as the 

702
00:44:14,371 --> 00:44:14,371
distinction between explored an 
unexplored territory,

703
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,520
but you have to.

704
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,860
I don't know if you've ever taken a cat 
to a new house.

705
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,040
Cats hate that and because in our old 
house and maybe in their old 

706
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,340
neighborhood,
they've slunk around

707
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,820
at the edges,
checking everything out.

708
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,570
They start out freight afraid.
They check everything out.

709
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:41,160
They know where to hide.
They know where to.

710
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,030
They knew,
they knew,

711
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,150
they know what,
what's safe and they know that because 

712
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,221
they go somewhere and nothing happens 
and so then the assuming that it's safe 

713
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:52,380
and they slowly build up a neighborhood 
that they're comfortable with.

714
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:58,010
My Dad used to take the dog for a walk 
and then the cat got lonesome and so it 

715
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,030
started to follow him and first of all 
it would just go along the buildings,

716
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,310
the houses on their route,
you know,

717
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:07,610
hiding really from predators and after a
while it got kind of comfortable with 

718
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:09,900
that and then it would follow right 
behind the dog.

719
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,320
But it had a border.
And if my dad took the dog over one 

720
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:21,501
street too many for the cat,
the cat would just sit on the corner 

721
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:21,501
and,
and you know,

722
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,500
cry like a cap cries.

723
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,680
It was like,
that's it for me,

724
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:30,681
man.
I'm not going any farther out into the 

725
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:33,321
unknown.
And so the distinction between the 

726
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:38,151
territory that you have mastered and the
territory that you haven't mastered is a

727
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:44,241
fundamental distinction.
It's the distinction between home and 

728
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,470
the strange land.
And the thing about familiar territory 

729
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,880
for people is that most of the familiar 
territory that we inhabit is other 

730
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,620
people because we're so social.
So you can't really think.

731
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,630
It's a weird way of thinking about 
territory.

732
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,230
It's not exactly geographical objective 
territory.

733
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:04,890
It's territory with a dominance 
hierarchy in it.

734
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,250
And the dominance hierarchy has a 
predictable structure and you know where

735
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:13,251
you fit in it most of the time.
And so that when you act out in that 

736
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:16,881
territory surrounded by your people,
then often you get what you want and 

737
00:46:16,881 --> 00:46:21,620
you're so thrilled about that because 
you just don't want someone acting 

738
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:22,640
radically around you.
Like,

739
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,950
and you know that.
So he walked down blue or and there's 

740
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,590
people there that should really be 
institutionalized,

741
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:34,390
but we institutionalize them all so they
could be free and free to be,

742
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:39,690
you know,
suffering and malfunctioning out on the 

743
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:40,710
street.
That's what the freedom ended up being.

744
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,950
But you know,
you'll walk by someone like that who's 

745
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,880
monitoring away to the voices in his 
head,

746
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:48,300
didn't,
you know,

747
00:46:48,301 --> 00:46:48,690
maybe

748
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:55,990
striking out against whatever it is 
that's plaguing him and you will make 

749
00:46:56,091 --> 00:46:59,750
eye contact.
You might even go across the street.

750
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:01,640
You're certainly going to give him a 
wide berth.

751
00:47:01,641 --> 00:47:06,641
You're going to keep a distance between 
him and you and you're going to hope 

752
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:11,651
that you don't attract his attention 
because he's not in the dominance 

753
00:47:11,651 --> 00:47:14,000
hierarchy and you don't know what the 
hell he might do.

754
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:18,830
And that's unexplored territory too.
That's another way of thinking about it.

755
00:47:18,831 --> 00:47:23,831
Like we inhabit time and space,
not just space and not just time.

756
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:28,730
We inhabit time and space and our 
territories are spacial.

757
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:34,620
We're here now and this is safe now,
and it saved partly because of the 

758
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:40,231
physical structure and it's working,
but it's also safe because none of you 

759
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:44,341
are manifesting peculiar behavior,
but if you started to manifest peculiar 

760
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:48,910
behavior,
if you stood up and started muttering or

761
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,850
yelling or maybe attacking someone next 
to you,

762
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:57,450
all the rest of you would freeze first 
because then all of a sudden this would 

763
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,790
be unexplored territory,
the match between what you want,

764
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,850
which is a peaceful lecture that you 
hope has some content,

765
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:11,320
the match between what you want and 
what's happening has vanished and so 

766
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:15,590
then you're not.
You don't know where you are and so then

767
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,270
what do you do when you don't know where
you are?

768
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,820
What do you do when you don't know what 
to do?

769
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,590
Well,
if your computer,

770
00:48:21,591 --> 00:48:26,591
you just crash,
but you know what good is that to you?

771
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,180
You're just going to die.
That isn't helpful.

772
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,220
You freeze first and then maybe you 
cautiously cautiously attend or maybe 

773
00:48:36,681 --> 00:48:41,681
you don't.
Maybe you just keep your damn eyes 

774
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:41,681
averted and you sit there and you hope 
that no one notices you.

775
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,790
That's a.
that's a prey response,

776
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:48,791
right?
That's like a rabbit frozen when it 

777
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:49,280
thinks a fox is looking at it and we 
were prey animals for a long time.

778
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,060
There was a cat that they recently 
discovered,

779
00:48:53,061 --> 00:48:58,061
a prehistoric cat that had this bottom 
single tooth and they found out that a 

780
00:48:58,731 --> 00:49:03,110
human skull fit right inside its mouth 
and so it could grab you here and Pierce

781
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,740
the back of your skull with its,
with its single tooth.

782
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:10,070
And that's what it was evolved for.
So you know,

783
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,710
it's under such conditions.
We evolved and we're predators 

784
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:20,861
obviously,
but were tasty predators and so other 

785
00:49:20,861 --> 00:49:21,020
things were perfectly happy to eat us.

786
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,250
And so when you're aware you don't know 
what to do,

787
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:31,251
you act like a prey animal and that's 
probably what you should do because 

788
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,780
maybe if you keep your head down and 
shut the hell up,

789
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,580
there will be any attention to attracted
to you and maybe you'll get through it.

790
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,220
You know,
you might decide,

791
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,350
unlikely to intervene and take the guy 
down,

792
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,920
but,
but you would be the exception rather 

793
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,850
than the norm.
And it's unsurprising.

794
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,040
Okay.
So what I came to understand was that 

795
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,730
belief systems,
regulated emotions,

796
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,080
but not exactly psychologically like it 
isn't exactly.

797
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:17,020
It isn't exactly.
And this is sort of like the terror 

798
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,341
management theories.
It's not exactly like you have a theory 

799
00:50:19,341 --> 00:50:21,591
in your head,
in the theory explains the world and 

800
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:21,591
because of the theory explains the 
world.

801
00:50:21,591 --> 00:50:24,120
The theory is what's making you secure.
It's kind of like that.

802
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,850
It's like you have a theory in your head
and the makes you feel secure because it

803
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:33,851
explains the world.
But the reason that explains the world 

804
00:50:33,851 --> 00:50:36,340
is because other people have the same 
theory in their head and then when you 

805
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:39,491
both act out the theory,
you both get what you want and it's 

806
00:50:39,491 --> 00:50:43,091
that.
It's the coming together of the theory 

807
00:50:43,091 --> 00:50:43,910
and the outcome that makes you.

808
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,900
It's life.
Not only does it stop you from being 

809
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,220
anxious and often make you happy because
you get what you want,

810
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,220
but it's not just psychological.
You know,

811
00:50:56,221 --> 00:51:00,120
the fact that we do this,
that we cooperate within our societies.

812
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,520
We match our belief systems and then act
them out.

813
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,670
That's the predicate for a productive 
society.

814
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,150
So it's actually,
it isn't just that it saves,

815
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,340
saves you from death,
anxiety,

816
00:51:11,341 --> 00:51:14,060
like the terror management theorists 
have it.

817
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:17,580
It's,
it saves you from death and that's good.

818
00:51:17,581 --> 00:51:19,560
I mean,
being protected from death,

819
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:20,300
anxiety.
Yeah.

820
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,050
Oh good.
That's great too,

821
00:51:22,051 --> 00:51:24,180
man.
But actually not dying.

822
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:26,460
That's sort of the fundamental thing 
that you're after.

823
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:30,630
And so people have reason to defend 
their territory.

824
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:35,631
If you think of territory that way,
as you think about it as a domain where 

825
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:40,191
the fundamental presuppositions of each 
citizen are matched by the behavior of 

826
00:51:40,261 --> 00:51:43,680
their coast citizens,
they have every reason to defend that.

827
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,640
And if it falls apart,
it can have mortally serious 

828
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,460
consequences.
It's chaos,

829
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:56,510
you know,
and that chaos doesn't just destabilize 

830
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:56,510
everybody.
Psychologically.

831
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:59,210
It destabilizes everything.
It can destabilize the currency.

832
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:01,600
If can destabilize the industrial 
economy,

833
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:03,400
it can.
The lights can go off.

834
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:08,140
It's like it's not good.
So Hey,

835
00:52:08,141 --> 00:52:09,520
no wonder people protected.

836
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:19,770
So then I started thinking about what a 
belief system was and I realized that a 

837
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:27,380
belief system was actually a set of 
moral guidelines

838
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,950
and moral guidelines are guidelines 
about how you should behave also how you

839
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:38,510
should perceive.
And the reason that a moral guideline is

840
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:43,511
necessary for you to perceive is that 
you can't look at anything without a 

841
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:46,310
hierarchy of value.
Right?

842
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,130
Think about it like how many things in 
this room could you look out?

843
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,210
There's an in innumerable things in this
room to look at.

844
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,020
There's just all this squares,
the little tiny squares in this fabric.

845
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,930
You could look at those things for til 
the end of time,

846
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,880
one at a time,
but you don't do that.

847
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,940
In fact,
if I took most of you out of this room,

848
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,850
there's a very low probability that 
you'll be.

849
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,880
You'd be able to tell me what color the 
walls were or even if those things were 

850
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,171
on the walls.
And the reason for that is that who 

851
00:53:17,171 --> 00:53:19,970
cares?
As long as the walls don't move,

852
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,560
colors irrelevant.

853
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,360
And there's no reason for you to 
remember it.

854
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,330
It has no emotional significance,
it has no value.

855
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,570
And so what you do instead is,
well,

856
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,550
this is what you're doing.
So why are you here to.

857
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,590
I don't mean in the broad metaphysical 
sense.

858
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:40,020
I mean specifically why are you here 
right now?

859
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,520
And I would say,
well,

860
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:46,110
your students obviously and you're 
trying to get a degree and you know,

861
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,930
you believe that that will have some 
functional utility.

862
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,950
Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a 
little more literate and a little and be

863
00:53:52,951 --> 00:53:57,951
able to think a little better and be 
able to write a little better and so 

864
00:53:57,951 --> 00:53:57,951
you'll actually be more functional in 
the world.

865
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,120
That would be good.
You know,

866
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:01,830
and,
and maybe you're interested in,

867
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,790
but anyways,
it's,

868
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:08,720
you're in this particular lecture so 
that you can take this particular class 

869
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:14,120
so that you can get a particular kind of
degree so that you could launch your 

870
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,991
life and then in your life you're 
probably going to meet someone that you 

871
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:19,770
have a longterm relationship with and 
you're going to have children and you're

872
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:21,300
going to partake in this society.

873
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,540
And that's why you're here.
All of those reasons,

874
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,880
similar caneously is why you're here.
And so then that helps you decide what 

875
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:35,241
to look at.
And so what you look at is at the 

876
00:54:35,241 --> 00:54:36,210
moment,
or listen to is me,

877
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,240
because in principle I'm the gateway to 
that set of accomplishments at this 

878
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:48,921
moment.
And so you focus on me and that's 

879
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:53,160
because you value that.
And so what that means is you can't even

880
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:55,110
look at the world without a value 
structure.

881
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:01,410
You know,
it's chaos if everything is equally 

882
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:01,410
unimportant or if everything is equally 
important.

883
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:07,010
It's chaos.
And so value system structures the very 

884
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,990
way that you perceive the world.
And I don't mean that metaphysically.

885
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:12,270
There's plenty of experiments that have 
demonstrated that,

886
00:55:12,271 --> 00:55:14,670
like the invisible gorilla experiment,
which,

887
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:17,280
how many of you know about the end of 
the invisible gorilla experiment?

888
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,120
How many don't?

889
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,510
Well,
roughly speaking,

890
00:55:24,511 --> 00:55:27,120
what happens is that there are two 
teams,

891
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,330
a white team dressed dressed in white,
and the team dressed in black and 

892
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,140
there's video of them and the black team
is passing the basketball back and forth

893
00:55:34,141 --> 00:55:39,141
and the white team is passing the 
basketball back and forth and you're 

894
00:55:39,141 --> 00:55:42,231
supposed to count the Times.
The basketball gets passed back and 

895
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:42,231
forth.
There's only one basketball.

896
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:43,380
And so,
you know,

897
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:48,460
you're diligent for whatever reason you 
do what the experiment or asks you and 

898
00:55:50,131 --> 00:55:52,290
you count the basketball tosses and you 
think,

899
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:54,540
well that's not so hard.
It's like 16.

900
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:59,100
So you tell them 16 and they say,
did you see the gorilla?

901
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,270
And half of you say what?
What are you talking about?

902
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,210
And the experimenter says,
well let's watch again,

903
00:56:06,211 --> 00:56:11,211
but this time don't count.
I'll sure enough like 30 seconds into 

904
00:56:11,211 --> 00:56:14,100
the video and you know,
the players fill the video screen.

905
00:56:14,101 --> 00:56:16,320
It's not like they're 300 yards in the 
distance,

906
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:21,321
you know,
like little ants playing basketball 

907
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:21,321
there,
right?

908
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:21,660
Filling the screen,
you can see their faces.

909
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:27,900
Sure enough a minute into the video.
This guy in a gorilla suit and he's not 

910
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:30,460
little and neither is the gorilla suit.
He comes out,

911
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,880
bangs his chest right in the middle of 
the screen for five seconds and then 

912
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,740
disappears and half more than half.
Actually,

913
00:56:38,741 --> 00:56:41,200
if people don't see that and it's even 
worse down.

914
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,880
Simon did another experiment where

915
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:46,070
you're at a counter,
you know,

916
00:56:46,071 --> 00:56:50,420
at a store and there's a clerk there and
you're talking to the clerk.

917
00:56:50,421 --> 00:56:55,320
And the clerk goes down hypothetically 
to get something in,

918
00:56:55,321 --> 00:56:57,780
a different clerk pops up and you'd 
think,

919
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,190
Hey,
I noticed that,

920
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:04,820
but you don't.
And you can even vary the clerk quite a 

921
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:08,991
bit and people don't notice.
So we focus on very particular things.

922
00:57:11,491 --> 00:57:16,491
And the reason we don't notice this 
because it actually doesn't matter in 

923
00:57:16,491 --> 00:57:17,340
terms of the ongoing,
our ongoing action.

924
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:22,341
At that point,
the clerk is interchangeable as long as 

925
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:25,470
the entity there acts like a clerk 
that's sufficient.

926
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:43,050
So leave system structure your 
perceptions,

927
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:45,390
value systems,
we're going to call them value systems.

928
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:50,750
They structure your perceptions and they
also guide your actions because you act 

929
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,410
in accordance with your values,
conscious or unconscious.

930
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:00,710
You have values that you don't know 
about because you just don't know 

931
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,710
yourself very well.

932
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,710
Um,

933
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,910
the,
you can tell that,

934
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:08,380
that you have values that you don't know
very well because sometimes you get 

935
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,280
attracted to people that you know you 
don't perfectly well that's a mistake.

936
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Or you know,
you're trying to tell yourself to study 

937
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:16,880
and you don't.
And you know,

938
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,080
so there's,
you're not really in control of yourself

939
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:22,290
to any great degree.
Some and the more integrated you are,

940
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:27,291
the more control you have,
but you know you're kind of a loose 

941
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:29,691
collection of arguing subpersonalities 
and they're more or less directed 

942
00:58:29,821 --> 00:58:34,821
towards a single goal,
but it depends on how committed you are 

943
00:58:34,821 --> 00:58:34,980
to that goal,
how much you've thought it through,

944
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,190
how much you buy into it,
how many of the contradictions in your 

945
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,020
world representation you've managed to 
iron out and all of that,

946
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,920
so,
but in any case,

947
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:51,921
it's value systems that government 
action and perception and so we're going

948
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:54,320
to take an existential

949
00:58:56,210 --> 00:59:01,210
perspective of phenomenal logical and an
existential perspective in this course 

950
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:02,870
and phenomenological means that we're 
going to.

951
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,380
We're going to base our presuppositions 
on the idea that what you experience is 

952
00:59:08,481 --> 00:59:09,920
real.
All of it.

953
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,850
We're not really dividing the world into
object and subject that that isn't how 

954
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,391
this particular approach works.
It's more like you have a field of 

955
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:20,600
experience.
It includes things like pain,

956
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:25,730
which is not really something objective 
and but it's real.

957
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,760
I mean,
one of the things I've come to 

958
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,201
understand is you don't.
You are not required to believe what I'm

959
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,440
telling you.
By the way,

960
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:39,190
if you have an argument about why some 
of this doesn't make sense,

961
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,830
then you know,
follow that sucker because I'm trying to

962
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,090
tell you what I've reached with regards 
to bedrock presuppositions and I haven't

963
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:52,940
been able to put pry bars underneath 
them,

964
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,750
but that doesn't mean you won't.
Um,

965
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,800
and you,
you know,

966
00:59:57,801 --> 01:00:02,801
you should try anyways.
Moral System tells you how to act and 

967
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:12,691
what to see and a shared moral system 
keeps your emotions under control and 

968
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:15,880
fulfills your motivation leads.

969
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,550
Now,
there's this old idea of David humes and

970
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:30,861
David Hume famously posited that you 
cannot derive in ought from an is.

971
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:41,030
And what he meant by that was that 
merely knowing the objective facts about

972
01:00:41,461 --> 01:00:46,461
something does not tell you how to 
implement those facts in your life and 

973
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:50,730
that that's actually a gap.
Now you could say,

974
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,080
and I,
I think this is the case,

975
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:57,081
that that's actually a necessary 
consequence of the scientific endeavor 

976
01:00:57,081 --> 01:01:01,311
because one of the things that you're 
trying to do as a scientist is to strip 

977
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,760
away the value of the object,
right?

978
01:01:02,761 --> 01:01:07,740
Because I don't care what your 
idiosyncratic notion of the object is,

979
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:13,010
I want to know how you perceive the 
object such that everyone else will 

980
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:17,901
perceive it at least that way.
And so that takes the subjectivity 

981
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:21,501
completely out of it.
And so it might just be a necessary 

982
01:01:21,501 --> 01:01:24,030
consequence of the scientific method 
that it doesn't have a morality implicit

983
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:27,090
in it.
People argue about that.

984
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:28,650
Sam Harris,
for example,

985
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:32,160
argues he believes that we can come up 
with a scientific morality.

986
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,550
Um,
I,

987
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,740
I don't believe that because I don't 
think that you could make rational 

988
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:41,580
judgments about value.
It's too complicated.

989
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,300
It's far too complicated.
It's something that has to emerge.

990
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:45,870
It can't be.

991
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,580
I mean,
Marxism was supposed to be a scientific 

992
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:53,930
utopia predicated on scientific 
principles and all of that.

993
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:58,931
And you know,
it just didn't work anyways.

994
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:06,040
So I kind of buy hume's argument.
You can't derive an art from it is now.

995
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:10,720
That's a problem.
First of all,

996
01:02:10,721 --> 01:02:13,060
it's a problem because you have factual 
knowledge,

997
01:02:13,061 --> 01:02:14,650
but you don't know how to implement it.
You know,

998
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:17,350
it's like,
should you spend money on aids or should

999
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:20,730
you spend money on cancer or should 
spend money on higher education,

1000
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,240
how the hell are you going to calculate 
that rationally you can't because you 

1001
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,310
just don't have the information at hand.
It's not possible to,

1002
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:34,870
you know,
I worked for UN committee at one point 

1003
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:37,101
and they,
the UN committee had like 100 proposals 

1004
01:02:37,101 --> 01:02:38,850
for how the world could be improved,
but there was no order to them.

1005
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:41,670
It's like it wasn't that this was more 
important than this.

1006
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:42,360
It's like,
Whoa,

1007
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,670
that's the end of that.
You know,

1008
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,680
you to start with something and so that 
means you have to make something more 

1009
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:52,230
important than other things have.
Obviously in your life.

1010
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,160
If everything is of equal importance,
then you're paralyzed.

1011
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:09,140
Now you know,
it's a truism and probably an 

1012
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:13,401
oversimplified one that since the dawn 
of the scientific revolution,

1013
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:20,470
a wedge has been driven through the 
heart of our society such that the moral

1014
01:03:21,661 --> 01:03:26,661
systems that we use to unite us.
So those would be religious systems 

1015
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:28,980
fundamentally

1016
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,430
have been subject to an intense critique
from the scientists.

1017
01:03:34,431 --> 01:03:39,431
And you know,
it's pretty effective critique even if 

1018
01:03:39,431 --> 01:03:43,511
you have,
even if you've maintained a traditional 

1019
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:43,511
faith,
it's like

1020
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:43,520
no,

1021
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:48,890
the scientific onslaught is no joke and

1022
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:55,020
that's a problem as far as I can tell 
because and the problem is,

1023
01:03:55,021 --> 01:03:58,450
is that you're still left with the 
problem of how you should act.

1024
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:01,190
And Nietzsche,
the philosopher Nietzsche,

1025
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:06,191
where he would say that we're running on
the fumes of Christianity in the West 

1026
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:10,840
because over it's thousand years of 
domination to let's say,

1027
01:04:10,841 --> 01:04:15,841
1500 years of absolute domination,
it produced a consensus of morality that

1028
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:22,381
was predicated on metaphysical 
presuppositions and that organized 

1029
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:25,831
societies and those societies are 
predicated on certain beliefs like the 

1030
01:04:26,351 --> 01:04:31,351
belief.
And really I would say that something 

1031
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:31,580
divined inhabits each individual.
You know,

1032
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,880
that's sort of presumption that's 
embedded in law.

1033
01:04:33,881 --> 01:04:36,430
It's sort of the idea that underlies the
idea of natural.

1034
01:04:36,431 --> 01:04:37,000
Right,
right.

1035
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:42,070
There's something about you that's so 
valuable that even the law has to bow to

1036
01:04:42,071 --> 01:04:44,380
it,
even if you're reprehensible,

1037
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:47,830
even if you're convicted in 
reprehensible now.

1038
01:04:47,831 --> 01:04:52,831
That's man,
the idea that people came up with that 

1039
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:52,831
idea.
That's a bloody miracle.

1040
01:04:52,831 --> 01:04:53,140
It's,
you know,

1041
01:04:53,141 --> 01:04:58,141
because generally speaking,
your proclivity is if someone's been 

1042
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:02,641
even accused of doing something,
that general human proclivity is that 

1043
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:04,390
even if someone's just been accused of 
doing something terrible,

1044
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:09,391
that's enough so that you can stone them
to death or do whatever you're going to 

1045
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:10,420
do with them.
Presumption of innocence before guilt,

1046
01:05:10,690 --> 01:05:15,690
good God,
of all the things that aren't automatic 

1047
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:16,300
that's got a top the list,
you know,

1048
01:05:16,301 --> 01:05:21,301
it's.
It's unbelievable that that occurs and 

1049
01:05:21,301 --> 01:05:22,960
it's interesting to me because it seems 
to me that

1050
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,880
that presupposition that there's 
something valuable transcendent about 

1051
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:33,331
each individual.
I wouldn't call that a scientific 

1052
01:05:33,331 --> 01:05:37,411
presupposition,
but it seems to be a highly functional 

1053
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:37,411
presupposition,
right?

1054
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:42,300
I think in that it isn't unreasonable to
notice that societies that have

1055
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:49,590
value the individual and made the law 
subject to the individual even with 

1056
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:53,890
regards to voting because that's 
basically what voting does,

1057
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,750
put sovereignty in the hands of the 
people.

1058
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:01,260
Those societies actually seemed to work.
Now whether they'll work for the next 

1059
01:06:01,391 --> 01:06:03,760
300 years,
who the hell knows?

1060
01:06:03,761 --> 01:06:08,761
I don't know,
but they've worked pretty well for the 

1061
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:08,761
last 500 years,
let's say,

1062
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:12,360
and we've got it pretty good right now 
and you know,

1063
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:17,520
I suspect most of you are rather pleased
that the law recognizes your value as 

1064
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:20,530
individuals and you take that for 
granted,

1065
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:25,560
right?
You think you have rights and of course 

1066
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:28,441
the rights that you have,
natural rights are a logical consequence

1067
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:34,501
of your transcendent value and that's 
nested in this as niches observation 

1068
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,470
that's nested in a set of metaphysical 
beliefs and his idea was that if you 

1069
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,470
wipe out,
sorry,

1070
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:45,690
you wipe out the metaphysical beliefs 
eventually wipe out the whole system 

1071
01:06:45,690 --> 01:06:49,620
because you've knocked out the 
cornerstone and it might take a long 

1072
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,490
time for the thing to shake and fall,
but,

1073
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,290
but it will now whether he was right or 
not.

1074
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:01,770
It's hard to say.
It looks to me like what's happened 

1075
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:05,950
since Nietzsche announced the death of 
God in say the late 18 hundreds,

1076
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:09,970
is that western society is oscillated 
between extremes.

1077
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:15,690
Extremes on the right Germany extremes 
on the left and you know,

1078
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:18,850
with,
with the democracies,

1079
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:24,140
at least the other democracies,
democracies managing to stay the course 

1080
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:27,370
somewhere down the middle,
but,

1081
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:35,990
but it's not obvious to me that that can
be maintained without the underlying 

1082
01:07:36,091 --> 01:07:41,091
metaphysics.
And that's a problem because whatever 

1083
01:07:41,250 --> 01:07:43,770
you might say about the underlying 
metaphysics,

1084
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:50,710
it's not true the way science is true.
And that could be okay because there 

1085
01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,160
might be more than one form of truth.
In fact,

1086
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,890
I think there is,
um,

1087
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:59,060
I think there's pragmatic truth and I 
think pragmatic truth is actually deeper

1088
01:07:59,061 --> 01:08:04,061
than scientific truth.
And pragmatic truth is the truth that 

1089
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:08,531
enable you to act in a manner that best.
It improves the probability roughly 

1090
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:14,900
speaking of your existence and your 
reproduction maximally.

1091
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,220
That's a Darwinian idea on one of the 
things about the Darwinian theory,

1092
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,540
this kind of puts it in opposition to 
scientific materialism,

1093
01:08:23,541 --> 01:08:28,541
I would say,
is that the Darwinian theory is that you

1094
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:33,641
don't have privileged knowledge of the 
world and you can actually tell that 

1095
01:08:33,641 --> 01:08:34,770
because you die,
right?

1096
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:37,700
If you knew enough about the world,
you wouldn't die and you do die,

1097
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:42,701
and so you're an embodied theory of 
sorts and that theory is good enough to 

1098
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:46,691
get you along about 80 years and 
produced some reasonable probability 

1099
01:08:47,391 --> 01:08:49,970
that you'll have children and that they 
all survive.

1100
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:50,660
That's it,
man.

1101
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:55,661
That's what you've managed after 3 
billion years of evolution.

1102
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:03,670
It's a good enough solution.
It's a good enough way of acting and we 

1103
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:06,671
don't know a better way of acting and 
our world conceptions are actually 

1104
01:09:06,671 --> 01:09:11,080
nested inside the Darwinian system and 
they might be predicated on pragmatic 

1105
01:09:13,311 --> 01:09:18,311
truths rather than objective truths.
Pragmatic truths are truths that have 

1106
01:09:18,311 --> 01:09:22,811
functional utility and we're alive.
We care about being alive.

1107
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:28,930
We tend to use our theories as tools.
It's possible that our theories are 

1108
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:31,100
tools and that they're tools to help us 
stay alive.

1109
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,650
Now,
I was reading a bit about Camille Paglia

1110
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,200
the other day and,
uh,

1111
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:48,010
I've noticed some similarities between.
She's a famous gadfly.

1112
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:52,930
I would say a feminists have classic 
modern feminists,

1113
01:09:52,931 --> 01:09:54,820
although she would regard yourself as a 
feminist,

1114
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:00,540
unbelievably smart.
Like if you want to watch someone who's 

1115
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,930
verbally who has verbal mastery beyond 
belief,

1116
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:07,030
it's you could watch Camille Paglia.
She's,

1117
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,070
she's,
she seems a little manic to me.

1118
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:14,370
She can wrap off and argument at a rate 
that's just mind boggling and it's very 

1119
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:19,141
coherent and you know,
she tends to shred her opponents and 

1120
01:10:19,141 --> 01:10:19,141
arguments.
He's so brilliant.

1121
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,270
Um,

1122
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,880
she said something interesting and she's
been influenced by some of the same 

1123
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,390
people that I've been influenced by it.
She liked this book by Eric Norman 

1124
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,840
called the origins and history of 
consciousness,

1125
01:10:31,841 --> 01:10:35,470
which I would recommend if you're 
interested in union theory,

1126
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,290
Carl Young.
It's a good introduction to union theory

1127
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:43,470
and it's about the development of 
consciousness and it's predicated like 

1128
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:50,560
young's work and Joseph Campbell's work 
and Mircera Elliot is work,

1129
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:55,680
all of which has been criticized or 
ignored by the postmodernist predicated 

1130
01:10:56,591 --> 01:11:00,190
on id on the idea that human beings have
a central narrative

1131
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,740
and that,

1132
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:09,730
that central narrative is the dramatic 
expression of

1133
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:17,630
the human system of values and that 
that's built into us.

1134
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,120
It's,
it's,

1135
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:22,140
it's part of our nature.
We have a nature as human beings.

1136
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:26,190
We're not infinitely malleable white 
culture,

1137
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,830
which is a postmodernist claim and a 
dangerous one.

1138
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:39,520
It's dangerous if we have a nature.
Paglia has this idea

1139
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:41,080
that

1140
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:48,260
the reason that you come to university 
and you studied the humanities or the 

1141
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:52,191
proper reason if you do that,
is not to engage in premature and 

1142
01:11:53,941 --> 01:11:58,320
destructive criticism of something that 
you don't even get understand,

1143
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:04,370
but to learn as much as you can about 
art and literature and poetry and drama

1144
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,960
and fiction

1145
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:15,170
and religious thinking and this is all a
kind of a.

1146
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:17,900
You think about it as a.
What is that?

1147
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,470
What is all that?
It's art,

1148
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,430
you know,
culture.

1149
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:26,360
Music belongs in that category and like 
what the hell?

1150
01:12:26,361 --> 01:12:27,620
What,
what about music?

1151
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,870
It's like everyone loves it or almost 
everyone.

1152
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:35,920
It's a mystery.
You listened to music and it's very 

1153
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:35,920
meaningful.
I mean,

1154
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,220
music gets people through some pretty 
dark times.

1155
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:41,090
Why it's not obvious,
that's for sure.

1156
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:42,410
You know,
and in most cultures,

1157
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:45,320
music plays a very central role in 
identity formation.

1158
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:50,321
And you guys,
I think you'll probably find as you age 

1159
01:12:50,321 --> 01:12:53,111
that your favorite music will be the 
music that you listened to between the 

1160
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:56,420
ages of 16 and 20.
It's kind of like an imprints on you and

1161
01:12:56,421 --> 01:13:00,490
it defines a maybe that defines a 
generation and maybe you know,

1162
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,840
in our tribal past,
and this is highly likely

1163
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:10,130
when you were being inculcated into the 
tribal culture that was inculcated with 

1164
01:13:11,761 --> 01:13:15,390
dance and with masks and with music all 
at the same time.

1165
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,600
So you're invited to participate in this
drama and to take your place in this 

1166
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,850
drama and to think of that as a 
representation of the objective world is

1167
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:25,650
just not right.
That isn't what it is.

1168
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:31,070
It's an invitation to a drama.
Now then the question might be,

1169
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:36,770
well is the drama reel?
And the answer to that is it depends on 

1170
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:42,081
what you mean by real.
I think that great dramas are more real 

1171
01:13:42,081 --> 01:13:45,000
than real.
They're hyperreal there.

1172
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,800
They're hyper real because they provide 
guidelines about how to act that are 

1173
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,400
abstract and even perhaps generic but 
applicable across an extraordinary broad

1174
01:13:58,981 --> 01:14:01,920
range of situations.
So imagine this,

1175
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:03,690
you know,
you get up in the morning,

1176
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,070
you do a bunch of things and someone 
asks you what you're doing,

1177
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,320
what you did and you,
you know,

1178
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,010
you tell them while

1179
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
the first thing I did this morning was 
open my eyes and the second thing was 

1180
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:18,700
think about whether I want it to go back
to sleep and then,

1181
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:21,460
you know,
I took off my blankets and then I put my

1182
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:25,480
feet on the floor and then I stood up 
and I was blinking while I was doing all

1183
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:27,670
this and I was also breathing.
And then,

1184
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,660
you know,
I looked for my call and you,

1185
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,650
you really want to listen to that guy.
You don't want to listen to that guy.

1186
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,710
It's like,
why do you,

1187
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,940
why are you telling me that?
I want you to tell me something 

1188
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:39,130
interesting.
Well,

1189
01:14:39,190 --> 01:14:42,070
what is it that's interesting and why 
isn't that interesting?

1190
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,960
It's not obvious.
So,

1191
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:50,210
so then imagine the guy actually tells 
you a pretty good story and a little 

1192
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:52,840
adventure.
Probably he was doing something normal.

1193
01:14:52,841 --> 01:14:54,400
Something unexpected happened.

1194
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:59,730
He had to conjure up some new responses 
and he settled the problem or didn't 

1195
01:14:59,730 --> 01:14:59,770
settle the problem.
Yeah,

1196
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:03,910
you're interested in that.
Especially if he settled the problem,

1197
01:15:03,911 --> 01:15:08,890
because if he can tell you how when he 
encountered some unexplored territory,

1198
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:14,490
he was able to sew it back together,
then maybe you can do that when that 

1199
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:16,300
thing happens,
and that's pretty cheap wisdom for you.

1200
01:15:16,301 --> 01:15:18,070
It's.
He had to go through all the aggravation

1201
01:15:18,071 --> 01:15:19,390
of figuring it out.
No,

1202
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:21,520
you have to do is listen.
You know,

1203
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,430
and that's kind of a classic story.
Classic Story.

1204
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:28,780
Roughly speaking is there's a guy or 
woman,

1205
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,900
doesn't matter,
go on about their life relatively 

1206
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:36,040
normally.
Something blindsides them and they're in

1207
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:40,990
a state of chaos.
Chaos is the place.

1208
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:46,710
Chaos is the place that you end up when 
what you're doing and the world stopped 

1209
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:52,450
matching and the chaos can be of 
different degrees.

1210
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:57,450
You know,
you could wake up and find that your 

1211
01:15:57,450 --> 01:15:57,490
house was burgled and you could wake up 
and find that apparent.

1212
01:15:57,550 --> 01:16:02,550
Has Your parent has Alzheimer's or some 
fatal disease or that you do or that 

1213
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:05,020
your whole family was murdered or that 
there's a war starting her?

1214
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:10,070
You know there's different degrees of 
chaos and I think you can quantify the 

1215
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:17,941
chaos by calculating how much of what 
you do and expect is likely to be 

1216
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:25,201
disrupted by the event now because that 
the more disruption in the more 

1217
01:16:26,411 --> 01:16:31,411
destabilized you're going to be,
which is why if if someone tells you 

1218
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:33,430
that you're going to perish painfully in
three months,

1219
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:38,431
it's like that's a bad one.
You're really in an unexpected territory

1220
01:16:41,061 --> 01:16:46,061
there.
Nothing that you assumed that was real 

1221
01:16:46,061 --> 01:16:47,300
roughly speaking in the world is real 
anymore.

1222
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:54,690
We like to watch people in their normal 
life blindsided by something 

1223
01:16:56,820 --> 01:17:01,820
experiencing this inter regnum of chaos 
where they explore and gather new 

1224
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:07,701
information and retooled their character
or retool the world because you either 

1225
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:12,831
of those would work as a and then come 
out the other side and things are better

1226
01:17:13,341 --> 01:17:15,950
than they were to begin with,
or at least as good,

1227
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:18,170
but better is better.
That's a happy ending,

1228
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,730
right?
That's a happy ending.

1229
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,560
That's a comedy.
Technically speaking,

1230
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:22,640
and so

1231
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,550
what you want,
you want your life to be a comedy,

1232
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:32,300
not that it's supposed to be funny 
because comedy doesn't have to be funny 

1233
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,440
technically speaking.
It's just the opposite of tragedy.

1234
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,560
Tragedy is when you're going along 
pretty well and you get blindsided and 

1235
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,340
that's that and you know that can 
certainly happen.

1236
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:46,341
It happens to people all the time,
but it's a comedy want now.

1237
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:57,200
What I hope to provide you with,
is there a magic code?

1238
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:02,370
You know,
there was a book published a while back.

1239
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:10,070
Tom Hanks was in the movie.
He was a harvard professor who went 

1240
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:12,320
around solving symbolic mysteries.
Do you remember what,

1241
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,370
what was it called?
The DAVINCI code.

1242
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:19,020
Everyone liked that.
It sold a lot and you know,

1243
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:22,560
it was a little mysteries and it was 
full of hints that there was more to the

1244
01:18:22,561 --> 01:18:27,561
world than you think and which is 
definitely true and that,

1245
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:33,140
you know,
there was a way of getting access to 

1246
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:33,140
that knowledge and then it would really 
be worthwhile.

1247
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:34,890
And people liked that.
They liked that idea.

1248
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:37,080
And the reason for that is because it's 
actually.

1249
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,500
It's true.
It's true,

1250
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,230
it's true,
like,

1251
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,570
like fiction is true,
so okay,

1252
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:47,820
let's go back to the guy who's telling 
you about his morning.

1253
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,460
Well,
he tells you something exciting.

1254
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:57,230
Well then imagine that 10 people tell 
you something exciting and then you 

1255
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:01,281
extract out the pattern of them dealing 
with this problem from that and so then 

1256
01:19:02,851 --> 01:19:03,420
you have a.

1257
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,330
that's what you do if you're an author,
right?

1258
01:19:06,331 --> 01:19:07,890
Because in a,
in a book,

1259
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:13,310
you don't want the book exactly to be 
about what ordinary people do in 

1260
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:17,601
ordinary times in their life.
It's like you already know how to be 

1261
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:18,120
ordinary during ordinary times of your 
life.

1262
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:19,530
What?
That's not useful.

1263
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:25,340
You know,
you wouldn't watch a video tape of 

1264
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,201
yourself.
Imagine you videotaped yourself during 

1265
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:28,290
the day and then the next day you 
watched that.

1266
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:31,170
It's like God,
who would want to do that?

1267
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,250
So what seems to happen in stories is 
that they distill,

1268
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,550
they distill.
So they watch people,

1269
01:19:38,551 --> 01:19:41,970
people watch people and then they tell 
stories about what they see,

1270
01:19:41,971 --> 01:19:43,860
but they leave a lot out of those 
stories.

1271
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:49,010
Everything that's boring hopefully.
And then more and more stories about 

1272
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:54,591
exciting things get sort of aggregated 
and then maybe a great writer comes 

1273
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:55,920
along and write something really,
really interesting,

1274
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:59,790
profound character transformations.
And then you say,

1275
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:00,630
well,
that's fiction.

1276
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:05,990
And then you say,
well that's not true because it's 

1277
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:07,020
fiction.
But then then maybe that's not right.

1278
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:13,080
Maybe it's more than true because who 
wants the truth?

1279
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:16,170
The truth is mundane reality.
And you've already got that mastered.

1280
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:21,470
What you want is the distillation of 
interesting experience.

1281
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:23,040
And you might think,
well,

1282
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:24,600
why is it interesting?
Well,

1283
01:20:24,601 --> 01:20:26,910
that's a really good question because 
you don't actually know.

1284
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:32,390
And believe me,
you really don't know because you'll be 

1285
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:32,390
interested in things that just don't 
make any sense at all.

1286
01:20:32,390 --> 01:20:36,180
I'm going to walk you a bit today 
through Pinocchio and we'll do that more

1287
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,400
the next time to,
you know.

1288
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:40,950
But I want to tell you a little bit 
about that movie to begin with,

1289
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:45,240
just so you know how crazy you are.
So you know the plot.

1290
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,740
How many people have seen the Disney 
movie?

1291
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:48,660
Pinocchio?
Okay.

1292
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:53,661
So lots of people.
So that's strange enough in itself that 

1293
01:20:53,661 --> 01:20:55,500
so many people have seen it and it's 
worth thinking about,

1294
01:20:55,501 --> 01:21:00,501
you know,
you tend to show your kids that moody 

1295
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:00,501
and.
But do you think about the movie?

1296
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:05,091
It's,
you're doing some pretty weird things 

1297
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:05,091
when you're sitting there watching that 
movie,

1298
01:21:05,091 --> 01:21:05,820
man,
first of all,

1299
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,010
it's drawings,
right?

1300
01:21:08,011 --> 01:21:10,980
And they're low resolution drawings.
You don't care.

1301
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:13,590
And you watch the simpsons or maybe fa 
or a.

1302
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,430
what's that called?

1303
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:21,490
The the one that's been concentrating on
political correctness so much south 

1304
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:21,490
park.
God,

1305
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:23,220
that animation man,
it's just awful,

1306
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,960
right?
It's just horrible.

1307
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:29,961
It couldn't be worse.
You don't care like round heads smile a 

1308
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:36,380
little bit of shuffling.
That's a person as far as your concern 

1309
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,620
is just irrelevant.
And if it was higher resolution,

1310
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,560
it wouldn't help.
You just need the bare bones,

1311
01:21:40,561 --> 01:21:42,960
right?
Dang your perceptions on.

1312
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:48,860
So.
So you watched this drawing that's been 

1313
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,420
oakeel beautiful drawings,
animated in a sequence.

1314
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,930
You don't watching something real,
you're watching a pure construction and 

1315
01:21:56,930 --> 01:22:00,120
then you think about the plot.
It's like it's completely absurd.

1316
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,040
Everything about it is absurd.
It's like,

1317
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:07,430
well,
one of the characters is a bug and he 

1318
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,110
turns out to be the conscience and so 
what the hell is up with that?

1319
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:15,740
And then there's another character is 
this puppet Marionette and you know,

1320
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:21,380
somehow he gets free of his strings and 
then goes on this adventure and then 

1321
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,690
which is,
and then you know,

1322
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,700
he gets enticed into various nefarious 
places by a Fox and a cat and then he 

1323
01:22:30,091 --> 01:22:35,091
rescues his father from a whale and you 
don't even know how his father God in 

1324
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:35,091
the way.

1325
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:40,070
Oh,
it's like the last time you see his 

1326
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,070
father,
he was in a rainstorm and the next thing

1327
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:41,730
that happens is he's in a whale and 
you're sitting there thinking,

1328
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:42,720
Hey,
no problem.

1329
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:44,280
This all makes sense.
It's like,

1330
01:22:44,281 --> 01:22:45,300
what?
Really?

1331
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:48,750
Why?
How does that make sense?

1332
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:51,330
Well,
the answer is you don't know.

1333
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,810
That's the thing that's so cool.
You don't know.

1334
01:22:54,811 --> 01:22:56,190
You don't even know what you're 
watching,

1335
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:01,880
but it doesn't matter.
You Watch it and you're interested in 

1336
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:01,880
it.
You want to see what the hell happens to

1337
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:04,410
this puppet.
You want to see if he ends up becoming a

1338
01:23:04,411 --> 01:23:05,800
real boy because

1339
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:10,980
this seems important.
Well,

1340
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:11,960
you say,
well,

1341
01:23:11,961 --> 01:23:13,340
let's Pinocchio.
True.

1342
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,700
Well,
that's a stupid question.

1343
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:27,620
It's partly a stupid question because 
the answer is it depends what you mean 

1344
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:27,620
by true

1345
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:29,000
and

1346
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:35,210
it isn't obvious to me what you should 
mean

1347
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:37,210
when you

1348
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:43,280
say that something's true and the reason
it's not obvious is because we have this

1349
01:23:45,241 --> 01:23:50,241
idea in our society and it's a.
it's a very profound idea and that idea 

1350
01:23:50,241 --> 01:23:54,351
is that the ultimate truth is scientific
truth at that tells us about the nature 

1351
01:23:55,111 --> 01:23:58,980
of the world and it does that in a final
way.

1352
01:23:58,981 --> 01:24:03,981
In some sense there is no brooking any 
arguments about it and the physicists 

1353
01:24:03,981 --> 01:24:08,211
have got it right and that's why they 
can make hydrogen bombs and that's a 

1354
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:08,550
pretty good demonstration of their being
right,

1355
01:24:13,370 --> 01:24:16,160
but you don't act as if that's true

1356
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,560
and you don't.

1357
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:26,040
And you watch things and pay attention 
to things in are captivated by things 

1358
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,580
that aren't predicated on those 
assumptions.

1359
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:33,730
And it seems to me that

1360
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,420
there is a problem of what the world is 
made out of,

1361
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:43,421
but there is a bigger problem and that's
the problem of how you should conduct 

1362
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:45,860
yourself in the world.
And that's really what you want to know.

1363
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,000
People want to know that more than 
anything because you need to know.

1364
01:24:50,030 --> 01:24:51,860
It's like,
here you guys are in university.

1365
01:24:51,861 --> 01:24:53,210
It's like you don't know what you're 
doing.

1366
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,040
I mean some of you know more than 
others,

1367
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:59,630
but you're at the beginning of your life
and life is very complex and chaotic and

1368
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,700
it isn't exactly obvious.
You know,

1369
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:06,730
how,
what kind of relationship you should 

1370
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:08,441
form or what sort of character you 
should develop or what you're going to 

1371
01:25:08,441 --> 01:25:09,950
do for a job or how.
What's the meaning of life?

1372
01:25:09,951 --> 01:25:12,020
That's a good one.
What's the meaning of life?

1373
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,590
Well then you know,
people come to university,

1374
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:18,980
at least many of them and that's kind of
what they want to find out now.

1375
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:23,981
Paglia her notion is that you can think 
about it this way,

1376
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:29,291
is that articulated knowledge is 
embedded in inarticulate knowledge and 

1377
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:34,550
inarticulate knowledges.

1378
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:41,550
The domain of literature and art and and
high culture,

1379
01:25:41,551 --> 01:25:46,380
let's say,
and it's we sort of know what it means,

1380
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:50,340
but we don't exactly know what it means.
It means more than we know,

1381
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,600
and then outside of that is what we 
don't know at all and that's an idea 

1382
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,680
that you developed as well and maybe 
Paglia picked it up from you because you

1383
01:25:58,681 --> 01:26:03,681
believed that you know,
there was this domain that had mastered 

1384
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:08,270
in every domain and then there were.
There was a domain outside of that which

1385
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:13,330
you could think of as unexplored 
territory and what we meant unexplored 

1386
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:16,220
territory with was our creative 
imagination and that what we were trying

1387
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:21,221
to do with our creative imagination is 
to figure out how to deal with that 

1388
01:26:21,221 --> 01:26:25,961
unexplored territory.
We were producing dramas that we could 

1389
01:26:25,961 --> 01:26:29,390
act out that would help us deal with 
what we still hadn't mastered.

1390
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:32,840
And then outside of that,
there's just what we don't know at all.

1391
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,830
And Paglia his idea,
and this was [inaudible] idea,

1392
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:42,580
was that without understanding that 
surround,

1393
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:55,780
you're too atomized.
You're not part of your historical 

1394
01:26:55,780 --> 01:27:00,281
tradition.
You haven't incorporated the spirit of 

1395
01:27:00,281 --> 01:27:02,950
your ancestors who built all this.
You're,

1396
01:27:03,250 --> 01:27:08,250
you're just here now and,
and you don't know what to do either and

1397
01:27:08,301 --> 01:27:13,301
you don't know how to maintain your 
culture and you don't know how to serve 

1398
01:27:13,301 --> 01:27:13,320
it.
And you know,

1399
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,480
you might say,
well why should you serve your culture?

1400
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:18,620
And while I have a hypothesis about 
that,

1401
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:21,710
you know,
you can think about this,

1402
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:26,740
I don't know if it's true,
but people ask what the meaning of life 

1403
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:30,281
is and it seems to me that meaning is 
proportionate to the adoption of 

1404
01:27:32,321 --> 01:27:34,650
responsibility.
You know,

1405
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:39,350
like let's say you have a little sister 
who's like three,

1406
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:47,370
you're going to take care of her.
Like questioning whether that's a good 

1407
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,670
idea just seemed stupid.
You know what I mean?

1408
01:27:49,671 --> 01:27:51,530
It just doesn't seem like the right kind
of question.

1409
01:27:51,531 --> 01:27:56,531
It's like,
well obviously self-evidently let's say 

1410
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,200
that's what you do and you find it 
meaningful.

1411
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:02,390
It's like probably,
you know,

1412
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:05,840
interacting with a little kid when we 
had,

1413
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,070
when I had little kids,
you know,

1414
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:12,120
when they were like two or under,
we took them out to see their relatives 

1415
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,600
and they were older people and you know,
they watched that two year old like,

1416
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:18,230
like it was a fire,
you know,

1417
01:28:18,231 --> 01:28:22,040
every second that that little kid was in
the room,

1418
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:26,930
every single adult was focused on,
focused on,

1419
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:28,820
on him or her.

1420
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:31,190
Yep.

1421
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:36,420
That's something that people attend to 
and that's the source of meaning and 

1422
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,160
what else is a meaningful well,
your family relationships are meaningful

1423
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,920
to you and maybe the responsibility that
you adopt as,

1424
01:28:43,990 --> 01:28:44,950
as a friend,
that,

1425
01:28:44,951 --> 01:28:49,951
that seems meaningful.
Maybe your decision to pursue a 

1426
01:28:49,951 --> 01:28:51,850
particular career and be of some utility
in society.

1427
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:57,240
You know,
part of that's governed by your desire 

1428
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:57,370
to establish some security and get 
ahead.

1429
01:28:57,371 --> 01:29:00,340
It's fine,
but you're also

1430
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:07,220
playing an integral role in the 
maintenance of the structure that 

1431
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:11,031
supports you.
And my observation has been that in my 

1432
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:15,081
clinical practice is that people just 
have a hell of a time if they don't 

1433
01:29:15,081 --> 01:29:16,200
have.
If they don't slot in somewhere,

1434
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:17,180
you know,
you know,

1435
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:19,530
you think I got to go to work at nine in
the morning and you know,

1436
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:21,210
I've got this rigid schedule.
It's like,

1437
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:28,270
it's probably a good idea to be grateful
for that because what I've noticed is 

1438
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:31,490
that if people pull out from those 
externally scaffolded systems,

1439
01:29:32,810 --> 01:29:35,270
they drift,
they get depressed,

1440
01:29:35,271 --> 01:29:40,271
they get anxious,
they don't know what to do with 

1441
01:29:40,271 --> 01:29:40,271
themselves,
you know,

1442
01:29:40,271 --> 01:29:40,460
they're kinda like sled dogs with no 
sled.

1443
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,250
And we're kinda like sled dogs as far as
I can tell.

1444
01:29:43,251 --> 01:29:45,710
Beasts of burden.
Like we need a load man.

1445
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:51,100
We need a load.
And the question is what,

1446
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,890
what sort of load do you need?
And here's why I think we need,

1447
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:58,730
we need that.
You know,

1448
01:29:58,731 --> 01:30:03,731
there's,
I've been thinking about how to figure 

1449
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,180
out what's real for a long time.
And because I'm an existentialist,

1450
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:09,560
I'm operating under the presupposition 
that you can tell what people believe by

1451
01:30:09,561 --> 01:30:11,630
watching what they,
how they act.

1452
01:30:11,900 --> 01:30:16,900
I don't care what they say,
I don't care what their statements are 

1453
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:21,281
about their view of reality because the 
correlation,

1454
01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:26,410
the relationship between that and their 
actual actions is not certainly not 

1455
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:29,330
perfect and sometimes it doesn't even 
exist.

1456
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:36,020
One thing I've noticed is that people,
no one argues with their own pain.

1457
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:44,190
Everyone who hurts acts as if they 
believe that pain is real.

1458
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:52,100
So we could say the ultimate reality is 
pain.

1459
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:58,600
That's how people act.
It's in keeping with the claims of many 

1460
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:03,161
religious traditions.
You know the Jews are always 

1461
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:07,600
recollecting past pain.
I mean the Christian God is crucified 

1462
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:12,761
person.
I mean there's a fair bit of pain there 

1463
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:15,281
for the Buddhists.
The fundamental maximum is that life is 

1464
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:15,281
suffering,
and I'm.

1465
01:31:15,281 --> 01:31:16,610
It seems to me that there's a 
metaphysical claim.

1466
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:21,611
There are no metaphysical claim is that 
pain is real.

1467
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:26,380
Now,
of course it depends on what you mean by

1468
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:31,270
real,
but people act as if their pain is real,

1469
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:36,330
so that's a good place to start.
Now that poses a problem.

1470
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:48,350
Life is a pain.
Life is suffering,

1471
01:31:48,470 --> 01:31:50,240
let's say,
and why is that?

1472
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:54,470
Well,
it's because you can be broken,

1473
01:31:55,490 --> 01:32:00,100
hurt and destroyed,
and so that

1474
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
seems pretty self evident and worse,
you know it and that makes people 

1475
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:07,810
unique.
Like that's our self consciousness,

1476
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:12,811
right?
That's really what separates us in some 

1477
01:32:12,811 --> 01:32:15,121
sense from other creatures.
I mean other creatures have some self 

1478
01:32:15,121 --> 01:32:19,201
consciousness like a chimp can learn to 
recognize itself and a mirror and soak 

1479
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:20,410
in a dolphin,
but you know,

1480
01:32:20,411 --> 01:32:22,600
that's pretty,
that's pretty bare bones,

1481
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:23,980
selfconsciousness,
you know,

1482
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:29,700
real self consciousness is the knowledge
of your borders and not only in space 

1483
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:36,450
but in time and as far as I can tell,
human beings are the only creatures that

1484
01:32:36,581 --> 01:32:41,581
have discovered the future and that's 
really good because we can plan for the 

1485
01:32:41,581 --> 01:32:42,580
future,
but it's really bad because you know,

1486
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:49,410
the future is finite and that's like 
that's a big shock to the old system and

1487
01:32:50,871 --> 01:32:55,871
it's the existential burden that 
everyone bears and its associated 

1488
01:32:55,871 --> 01:32:57,260
integrity with suffering.
And so then you think,

1489
01:32:57,261 --> 01:33:02,261
well,
life is suffering and it's finite and 

1490
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,541
that's part of the suffering.
That's part of what you makes you 

1491
01:33:04,541 --> 01:33:07,781
question the value of existing and maybe
the value of existence itself.

1492
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,930
So then what do you have to,
were used as a weapon against that?

1493
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:14,010
Well,
you know,

1494
01:33:14,011 --> 01:33:16,020
we talked a little bit about 
responsibility.

1495
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,100
Now it seems to work,
you know,

1496
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:26,510
the,
the amount of responsibility that you 

1497
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:26,510
adopt

1498
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:31,450
with really in relationship to things 
seems to increase your meaningful 

1499
01:33:32,391 --> 01:33:33,590
engagement.
And you might say,

1500
01:33:33,591 --> 01:33:38,300
well what's the most meaningfully 
engaged activity?

1501
01:33:38,301 --> 01:33:43,301
And you might say,
well how about little reduction in the 

1502
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:44,810
old suffering?
No.

1503
01:33:45,350 --> 01:33:49,880
So you live your life so that you're not
causing undue pain,

1504
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,520
especially pointless pain.
That would be good.

1505
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:54,980
And maybe you could even be more useful 
than that.

1506
01:33:54,981 --> 01:33:58,880
And you could figure out some ways that 
some suffering years,

1507
01:33:58,881 --> 01:34:01,580
other people's both.
If you're really,

1508
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,790
you know,
hitting a home run,

1509
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:08,060
maybe you can figure out some way that 
some of that can be rectified.

1510
01:34:08,061 --> 01:34:12,410
And that seems to be meaningful in and 
of itself.

1511
01:34:12,411 --> 01:34:17,411
I mean,
if it's pain that makes you doubt the 

1512
01:34:17,411 --> 01:34:17,411
meaning of life,
which is perfectly reasonable,

1513
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:23,690
then the cessation of pain,
the cessation of suffering,

1514
01:34:23,691 --> 01:34:28,691
the minimization of suffering as a 
logical corollary should be the proper 

1515
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:34,900
medication.
And so I would say that means that 

1516
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:39,250
there's some mode that you can conduct 
yourself in that makes you a good 

1517
01:34:40,671 --> 01:34:41,210
person,

1518
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:42,870
and

1519
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:48,550
part of being a good person is to 
alleviate suffering.

1520
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:50,150
And

1521
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:55,020
I don't think you get to question that 
actually.

1522
01:34:55,021 --> 01:35:00,021
If,
if the suffering itself is making you 

1523
01:35:00,021 --> 01:35:00,021
question

1524
01:35:00,021 --> 01:35:03,010
the validity of your life,
then you can't also say that the 

1525
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:05,810
cessation of that is not useful.
I mean you can,

1526
01:35:05,811 --> 01:35:07,860
but it's completely incoherent.
You can.

1527
01:35:08,020 --> 01:35:09,950
You can claim incoherent things if you 
want.

1528
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:20,410
So then I would say these distilled 
stories that I'm talking about,

1529
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,880
the stories that are written by great 
authors,

1530
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:32,540
I'm particularly fond of Dostoevsky 
whose,

1531
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:37,680
whose works are he's head and shoulders 
above anyone I've ever read in terms of

1532
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:44,720
writers of fiction.
He deals with the hardest questions that

1533
01:35:44,721 --> 01:35:48,190
human beings face.
And he,

1534
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,200
he has characters on both sides of the 
argument.

1535
01:35:51,201 --> 01:35:54,260
And there they really lay out the 
arguments.

1536
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:55,560
It's not like Dostoyevsky,
you know,

1537
01:35:55,580 --> 01:36:00,580
he has got a belief and so he has a 
character and that character has his 

1538
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:04,841
beliefs.
And that character always wins the 

1539
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:04,841
arguments.
It's,

1540
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:04,841
that doesn't happen in the Dostoyevsky 
novel at all.

1541
01:36:04,841 --> 01:36:09,730
He sets up a character and then he sets 
up like three or four antagonists and 

1542
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:10,700
those antagonists,
they're not straw man.

1543
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:14,000
They're like iron giants.
They just stomp his,

1544
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:15,890
his protagonist,
you know,

1545
01:36:15,891 --> 01:36:20,450
in the whole thing is a war between 
these different conceptions of being.

1546
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:23,030
It's amazing to see.
It's amazing to read.

1547
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:24,540
Um,

1548
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:34,920
so you distill these stories,
great authors distill stories,

1549
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:39,450
great storytellers distill stories,
and we have stories that are very,

1550
01:36:39,451 --> 01:36:40,020
very,
very,

1551
01:36:40,021 --> 01:36:45,021
very old.
Those are usually religious stories of 

1552
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:46,770
one form or another particular be fairy 
tales because fairy tales,

1553
01:36:46,771 --> 01:36:49,120
some people have traced fairytales,
you know,

1554
01:36:49,230 --> 01:36:50,520
more than 10,000
years.

1555
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:55,940
And so they're part of an oral tradition
and oral traditions can last for tens of

1556
01:36:56,251 --> 01:36:58,370
thousands of years.
And you know,

1557
01:36:58,530 --> 01:37:02,400
it's a story that's been told for 10,000
years is a funny kind of story.

1558
01:37:02,401 --> 01:37:06,420
It's like people have remembered it and,
and obviously modified it.

1559
01:37:06,421 --> 01:37:08,640
It's like the game of telephone,
you know,

1560
01:37:08,641 --> 01:37:13,641
where I to tell you something and you 
whispered to the person next to you and 

1561
01:37:13,641 --> 01:37:16,821
so on.
It's like a game of telephone that's 

1562
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:16,821
going on for,
you know,

1563
01:37:16,821 --> 01:37:21,170
thousand generations and all that's left
is what people remember and maybe they 

1564
01:37:21,991 --> 01:37:24,930
remember what's important because you 
tend to remember what's important.

1565
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,240
Doesn't necessarily the case that you 
know,

1566
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:29,850
what the hell it means.
You don't know what music means,

1567
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:33,780
but you know that's a stop you from 
listening to it.

1568
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:36,390
You don't know,
generally speaking,

1569
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,950
what a movie that you see or a book that
you read means not if it's profound.

1570
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:45,000
It means more than you can understand 
because otherwise why read it?

1571
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:48,370
Wow.
So the idea is this,

1572
01:37:48,371 --> 01:37:53,371
is that were necessarily nested inside 
moral systems.

1573
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:58,380
The moral systems are on narratives,
narrative,

1574
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:03,381
dramas of sorts and the moral systems or
what orients us in life.

1575
01:38:04,681 --> 01:38:09,681
And the reason to understand them to the
degree that you can is because you need 

1576
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:13,970
to know how to live.
Nisha said that if you had a,

1577
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:17,790
uh,
why you could bear anyhow.

1578
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:19,280
And

1579
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:25,120
that's good.
One of the things that the Auschwitz 

1580
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:25,960
guards used to do to the prisoners,
and this is very telling,

1581
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:30,460
so at Auschwitz there was a sign that 
said work will make you free.

1582
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:35,560
It was a little joke.
Not really a very funny joke,

1583
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:42,260
you know,
it's the kind of joke that you have to 

1584
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,371
be,
say tannic is the appropriate term to 

1585
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:48,410
conceptualize and to dare to,

1586
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:55,020
to just state.
So when our Switz prisoners came to 

1587
01:38:55,301 --> 01:38:56,140
Auschwitz,
you know,

1588
01:38:56,141 --> 01:38:58,390
they're already pretty,
pretty rough shape.

1589
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:03,391
They were in cattle cars.
They'd been separated from their 

1590
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:03,391
families.
Everything had been taken from them.

1591
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:05,890
They were transported for a long time.
They were standing up,

1592
01:39:06,130 --> 01:39:08,290
the kids were suffocating because there 
was no room in the,

1593
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,730
you know,
it was so packed in there.

1594
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:14,910
They didn't have anything to eat.
There weren't any toilet facilities of 

1595
01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:16,420
any sort.
It was like you got rid of 20 percent of

1596
01:39:16,421 --> 01:39:18,340
the people just transporting them,
you know,

1597
01:39:18,341 --> 01:39:21,820
the ones on the outside of the cars,
they froze to death because of course it

1598
01:39:21,821 --> 01:39:26,821
was cold and pretty nasty.
And then when they got to Auschwitz,

1599
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:32,460
the guards used to have this game that 
they would play and this is part of the 

1600
01:39:32,460 --> 01:39:35,320
work will set you free thing.
They would get a prisoner,

1601
01:39:35,321 --> 01:39:40,321
they take a prisoner who's already in 
pretty rough shape and then have them 

1602
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:46,501
carry a sack of wet salt,
100 pounds from one side of the camp to 

1603
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:47,710
the other.
And you know,

1604
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:52,980
when you think of a camp,
you think of something like a football 

1605
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:52,980
field,
you know,

1606
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:53,080
maybe something that big fences around.
It's like,

1607
01:39:53,081 --> 01:39:54,700
no way man,
these were cities.

1608
01:39:54,701 --> 01:39:59,701
These were,
there were tens of thousands of people 

1609
01:39:59,701 --> 01:39:59,950
in these places.
So from one side of the camp compound to

1610
01:39:59,951 --> 01:40:02,500
the other,
that was a good hike and that wasn't bad

1611
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:07,501
enough.
They had to get them to carry it back 

1612
01:40:07,501 --> 01:40:07,501
and put it in the same place.

1613
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:09,580
Now

1614
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:17,630
that's poetic and it's malevolence.
You know,

1615
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:22,631
what you're doing is you're harnessing 
the human compulsion to engage in useful

1616
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:31,781
activity and demonstrating how 
absolutely futile that is despite its 

1617
01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:39,311
difficulty,
seems like a bad thing to do.

1618
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:49,620
People need.
It's a parody of meaninglessness.

1619
01:40:49,621 --> 01:40:51,690
That's what that is.
And you know,

1620
01:40:51,691 --> 01:40:54,460
people need meaning in their because 
their lives are difficult.

1621
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:59,830
And so the question is to what end 
should you devote your life?

1622
01:41:00,970 --> 01:41:02,430
And another question might be,
well,

1623
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:05,530
does it matter?
Matters an interesting word,

1624
01:41:05,531 --> 01:41:10,330
a because matter is matter,
but matter is also what matters.

1625
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:15,070
And I would say that what matters is 
more real than matter.

1626
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,430
At least that's how you act.
And then the question is,

1627
01:41:18,431 --> 01:41:23,431
well,
is there something you should be aiming 

1628
01:41:23,431 --> 01:41:24,240
at?
That's a good question.

1629
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:26,610
That's the question of the meaning of 
life.

1630
01:41:28,350 --> 01:41:33,350
And you know,
one of the things that supposed to 

1631
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,091
happen when you come to university is 
that that's the sort of question that 

1632
01:41:35,091 --> 01:41:35,820
should be addressed.
And as far as I can tell,

1633
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:39,120
and this might just be my more cynical 
side,

1634
01:41:39,121 --> 01:41:42,000
what I see happening to university 
students generally speaking,

1635
01:41:42,001 --> 01:41:47,001
is that they come in clinging to the 
wreckage of their culture and floating 

1636
01:41:50,370 --> 01:41:55,370
with the pieces.
And those pieces are taken away by 

1637
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:01,950
professors who tell them that everything
can be deconstructed and no,

1638
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:07,830
nothing has any real meaning.
And it's like when you're finally 

1639
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:11,041
educated,
it's when you're floating out on the 

1640
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:11,041
ocean and you've got nothing to stay 
afloat with.

1641
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:11,500
It's like,
well then you're,

1642
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:12,960
you're done.
And you congratulate.

1643
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:13,540
And it's like,

1644
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:22,190
I don't see that as useful.
Quite the contrary.

1645
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:32,410
So let me tell you a story.

1646
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,120
The first thing I'm going to propose to 
you,

1647
01:42:42,121 --> 01:42:47,121
and we'll talk about this a lot,
is that you inhabit a story that the 

1648
01:42:47,121 --> 01:42:49,380
framework through which you look at the 
world is actually a story.

1649
01:42:49,381 --> 01:42:54,270
And here's the story.
The story is you're somewhere and you're

1650
01:42:54,271 --> 01:42:55,890
going somewhere.
I didn't even.

1651
01:42:55,891 --> 01:42:57,650
That can be conceptual or whatever.
It's that.

1652
01:42:57,990 --> 01:43:00,940
But there's a gradient between where you
are and what were aiming at,

1653
01:43:00,980 --> 01:43:03,630
which means no more really than you're 
doing something.

1654
01:43:03,631 --> 01:43:08,631
Well,
you're sitting there and hypothetically 

1655
01:43:08,631 --> 01:43:11,331
you're aiming for something better and 
so you're in a state of insufficiency.

1656
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:15,000
Oh,
is the DNS sufficiencies change?

1657
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:20,900
And then you're trying to rectify the 
insufficiency and you presume that your 

1658
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,620
current state is less preferable to the 
state that you're aiming at.

1659
01:43:23,340 --> 01:43:28,340
And then the way that you bring those 
two together is sometimes you can do it 

1660
01:43:29,311 --> 01:43:34,311
through thinking,
but fundamentally you do it through 

1661
01:43:34,311 --> 01:43:34,311
action.
You do it through acting in the world.

1662
01:43:34,311 --> 01:43:39,111
And so that's sort of,
that's sort of the answer in some sense 

1663
01:43:39,111 --> 01:43:40,890
to the mind body problem.
You have a conceptual structure,

1664
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:43,010
but when you implement it,
you're,

1665
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:45,090
you're implementing it,
not abstract,

1666
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:46,680
but you're implementing it through 
action.

1667
01:43:46,681 --> 01:43:49,830
And so that's,
that's the basic story.

1668
01:43:49,860 --> 01:43:51,950
It's not a very interesting,
but

1669
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,050
it's the framework through which you 
view the world.

1670
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:59,051
So it's a value laden framework,
otherwise you wouldn't be able to act 

1671
01:43:59,051 --> 01:44:01,640
and you wouldn't know what to look at.
So it's a value laden framework.

1672
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:04,110
You look at the world through a value 
laden framework.

1673
01:44:04,111 --> 01:44:05,000
So then we might say,
well,

1674
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:07,280
what is the optimal Value Laden 
framework?

1675
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,170
That's what we're going to try to figure
out.

1676
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:16,390
Now I told you about the war that went 
on between the Communists and the way 

1677
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,460
Austin,
how that obsessed me.

1678
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:24,350
And so one of the things that I really 
wondered about was what was this just an

1679
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,140
arbitrary thing?
You know,

1680
01:44:26,141 --> 01:44:31,141
like did the Communists,
they had some axioms and we had some 

1681
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:31,141
axioms and if you're a moral relativist,
you might say,

1682
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:36,041
well,
who's to say which set of axioms are 

1683
01:44:36,041 --> 01:44:39,041
better?
Or even who's to claim that you could 

1684
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:40,460
say that a set of axioms,
one set is better than another.

1685
01:44:41,510 --> 01:44:45,170
That's a moral relative,
this claim and know fair enough.

1686
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:56,350
So I thought,
well maybe this is just an arbitrary 

1687
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:58,421
thing and it's going to be settled by 
force because that's how you settle an 

1688
01:44:58,421 --> 01:45:02,201
arbitrary claim between two competing 
systems where there's no room for 

1689
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:03,620
negotiation.
So I thought about that for a long time.

1690
01:45:03,621 --> 01:45:08,621
I wanted to know what the roots were of 
the Marxist system and what the roots 

1691
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:13,760
were of the Western system.
And what I surmised was that the western

1692
01:45:13,761 --> 01:45:16,490
system was actually something that 
evolved.

1693
01:45:17,510 --> 01:45:22,510
Whereas the communist system was a 
rationalist construction that was 

1694
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:25,040
imposed and they weren't the same thing.
And so then I wondered,

1695
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:30,310
well,
what's western culture grounded in and 

1696
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:32,060
is there any reason to assume that 
that's real in any sense?

1697
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:37,660
And so that's what took me into this 
study of the underlying stories.

1698
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:41,330
The fundamental stories upon which our 
culture,

1699
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:43,790
I believe is based and some of those are
very old.

1700
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:46,460
I'm going to tell you a Mesopotamian 
story.

1701
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:49,280
It's one of the oldest stories we know 
I'm going to tell you an Egyptian story.

1702
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:55,430
Those are sources of our culture and I 
think those stories are grounded in much

1703
01:45:55,431 --> 01:46:00,431
older traditions and I think they refer 
to something real actually real.

1704
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:03,560
Now,
I already told you that

1705
01:46:05,410 --> 01:46:10,410
there are different ways of 
conceptualizing real and that my initial

1706
01:46:10,601 --> 01:46:12,220
hypothesis,
presumption,

1707
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,020
axiom you might say,
is that okay,

1708
01:46:16,060 --> 01:46:19,390
pain is the most real,
and the reason I believe that is because

1709
01:46:19,391 --> 01:46:23,170
that's how people act.
Now you can criticize that.

1710
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:29,190
You can certainly come up with an 
alternative conceptual framework which 

1711
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,640
the scientists have because they believe
that the most real thing is mattered.

1712
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:36,350
Maybe we need more than one set of tools
to operate in the world.

1713
01:46:37,270 --> 01:46:38,060
It's possible.

1714
01:46:45,010 --> 01:46:50,010
So now I want to tell you what I think 
the fundamental constituent elements are

1715
01:46:50,641 --> 01:46:55,641
of stories,
and one of the things that I hope is 

1716
01:46:56,191 --> 01:47:01,191
that this knowing this will make you 
immunize,

1717
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,400
immunize you against ideology.
And the reason am because I believe that

1718
01:47:07,601 --> 01:47:11,610
the ideologies are fragmentary,
Meta narratives,

1719
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,240
and they have their power because 
they're grounded in the Meta narrative,

1720
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:20,241
but they only tell part of the story,
but they have power because they're 

1721
01:47:20,241 --> 01:47:23,430
grounded in the fundamental narrative,
and so here's the fundamental America as

1722
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:27,990
far as the characters,
let's say we're going to say that people

1723
01:47:27,991 --> 01:47:32,250
are prone to characterize the world 
where social primates,

1724
01:47:32,251 --> 01:47:37,251
we're social cognitive primates,
so we tend to see the world through the 

1725
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:40,971
lens of a social creature and so and 
partly because we're concerned with 

1726
01:47:40,971 --> 01:47:43,110
acting in the world and the world is 
mostly other people.

1727
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:48,410
Then we conceptualize the ground of that
structure for action in 

1728
01:47:48,721 --> 01:47:50,070
characterological terms.

1729
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:59,150
So the the most fundamental reality is 
chaos and chaos is what you don't 

1730
01:48:01,861 --> 01:48:05,820
understand at all.
You can't even conceptualize it.

1731
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,560
You,
you come into contact with it in bits 

1732
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:13,470
and pieces.
When the twin towers fell,

1733
01:48:13,471 --> 01:48:17,310
when the twin towers fell,
chaos reigned for a few days.

1734
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:20,760
Everyone was shellshocked and that was 
chaos.

1735
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:25,440
And Chaos is what you experience.
When your story falls apart,

1736
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:29,880
and that's a descent to the underworld.
That's chaos.

1737
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:34,530
And basically you live in order and 
chaos in order is where when you do what

1738
01:48:34,531 --> 01:48:38,040
you think you should do,
what you want to have happen happens,

1739
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:43,340
that's ordered,
that's explored territory and chaos is 

1740
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:46,551
when you do what you're supposed to do 
to get what you want and it doesn't 

1741
01:48:46,551 --> 01:48:51,081
happen,
and then that place that you're 

1742
01:48:51,081 --> 01:48:51,081
magically in.
When that happens,

1743
01:48:51,081 --> 01:48:53,370
that's chaos and it has different depths
you could say.

1744
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:58,580
It reaches all the way to hell,
and that usually happens when your life 

1745
01:48:58,580 --> 01:49:02,781
falls apart very badly and you're down 
in that chaos and you realized that it 

1746
01:49:02,781 --> 01:49:07,230
was your fault and that you did 
something wrong and that you knew it and

1747
01:49:07,231 --> 01:49:11,250
you ignored it.
That's the worst form of chaos.

1748
01:49:13,960 --> 01:49:18,960
So there's chaos itself and then then 
the next thing is fairly 

1749
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:21,400
straightforward.
You could think there's the individual,

1750
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:26,170
the individual exist in culture and 
culture is embedded in nature.

1751
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:29,260
Pretty straightforward.
Nature is mother nature.

1752
01:49:29,261 --> 01:49:32,650
For reasons we'll get into and culture 
is father culture.

1753
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:38,340
And I think that's because the 
fundamental dominance hierarchies in 

1754
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:41,970
human primates are masculine and that 
nature is assimilated to the feminine 

1755
01:49:42,761 --> 01:49:45,850
because it's all for two reasons.
First of all,

1756
01:49:45,851 --> 01:49:48,370
females do the sexual among human 
beings.

1757
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:51,460
So they actually are nature from the 
Darwinian perspective.

1758
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:56,020
And second nature is the productive 
biological force.

1759
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:01,590
And so we've always conceptualize males 
and females and we've used that 

1760
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:05,341
conceptualization to sort out the world 
at large.

1761
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:09,460
It's a metaphor,
but it's not just a metaphor,

1762
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:13,030
you know,
it's reasonable to consider culture as a

1763
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:18,031
judgmental father.
It's really reasonable because you know 

1764
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:20,980
your,
you have a group of people around you,

1765
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:23,320
some friends,
some people that watch you work,

1766
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:28,321
some judges,
and that stretches across a very long 

1767
01:50:28,321 --> 01:50:31,210
expanse of time.
And those people as an aggregate make an

1768
01:50:31,211 --> 01:50:35,320
entity that is judging your reputation 
constantly.

1769
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:41,100
And it's perfectly reasonable to 
personify that because it's like a Meta 

1770
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:45,010
person that's watching you.
And so it's a useful metaphor.

1771
01:50:45,190 --> 01:50:47,230
There's a metta person that's watching 
you.

1772
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:47,830
Well,
yeah,

1773
01:50:47,831 --> 01:50:51,700
there is obviously.
So now you could say,

1774
01:50:51,701 --> 01:50:53,170
well that's not real.
It's like

1775
01:50:56,550 --> 01:50:59,640
it's not real.
The way a scientific truth is real,

1776
01:50:59,790 --> 01:51:01,410
it's a different kind of real.

1777
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:06,780
Well,
nature has two elements.

1778
01:51:06,781 --> 01:51:11,781
It's destructive and creative.
Obviously there's the beauty of nature 

1779
01:51:11,781 --> 01:51:13,980
and it's bountiful element and then 
there's,

1780
01:51:14,250 --> 01:51:19,250
you know,
an awful east mosquitoes and 

1781
01:51:19,250 --> 01:51:22,311
elephantiasis and cancer and starvation 
and all the terrible elements of nature 

1782
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:29,720
and then there's culture and culture is 
tyrannical because you have to shape 

1783
01:51:29,851 --> 01:51:33,540
yourself involuntarily even to get along
with other people.

1784
01:51:33,541 --> 01:51:36,240
You sacrifice a lot of yourself and 
develop yourself,

1785
01:51:36,241 --> 01:51:39,060
but you sacrifice a lot of yourself in 
that endeavor,

1786
01:51:39,210 --> 01:51:41,820
right?
We have to kind of average ourselves out

1787
01:51:41,821 --> 01:51:46,821
in order to to live together and some 
societies are more tyrannical than 

1788
01:51:46,861 --> 01:51:49,230
others,
but there's always a tyrannical element.

1789
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,670
Do you see that at the university?
You know,

1790
01:51:50,671 --> 01:51:53,610
you guys know that to some degree this 
is such a big place.

1791
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:58,970
It's easy to feel like a number here and
that whether or not you're here or not 

1792
01:51:58,970 --> 01:51:59,790
doesn't matter.
Institution doesn't care.

1793
01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:02,160
Well,
that's the tyrannical element of it.

1794
01:52:02,190 --> 01:52:07,190
Now what does care?
Because here you are and you're getting 

1795
01:52:07,190 --> 01:52:07,380
educated and all that and so maybe 
that's positive,

1796
01:52:08,310 --> 01:52:09,750
but it's a.
it's got both.

1797
01:52:10,230 --> 01:52:15,230
These characters always have two sides,
you know there's does negative side in 

1798
01:52:15,241 --> 01:52:20,241
the positive side of nature and there's 
the negative side,

1799
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:22,710
the positive side of culture,
and then there's the individual,

1800
01:52:22,711 --> 01:52:26,340
so the individual is like standing on an
island in the midst of an ocean.

1801
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:27,750
That's a good

1802
01:52:29,670 --> 01:52:32,430
imagistic conceptualization of your 
position.

1803
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:38,090
There's solid ground,
it has a limited expanse and outside of 

1804
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:41,550
that is everything you don't understand 
and you as an individual have a positive

1805
01:52:41,551 --> 01:52:45,090
and negative elements as well,
and that's the hero and the villain.

1806
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:50,580
And of course what good is this story 
without a hero and a villain and the 

1807
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:54,161
villain is the person who isn't acting 
like a person should act in the hero is 

1808
01:52:54,161 --> 01:52:54,890
the person who's acting like a person 
should act.

1809
01:52:55,250 --> 01:53:00,250
And so you go to movies and you read 
books and there's heroes and villains 

1810
01:53:00,250 --> 01:53:03,911
and to some degree what you're doing is 
you're fleshing out your notion of a 

1811
01:53:03,911 --> 01:53:07,781
villain.
You know you read about 30 villains and 

1812
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:07,781
you think,
well,

1813
01:53:07,781 --> 01:53:07,820
there's something villainous about the 
villains.

1814
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,810
That's the central element of Villainy.
Whatever that is,

1815
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:17,230
and you could imagine you construct out 
a mega villain and a metta hero and 

1816
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:22,220
those are the characters in religious 
stories.

1817
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:25,130
Generally speaking,
you know,

1818
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:25,610
in,
in,

1819
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:27,710
in,
in the marvel movies,

1820
01:53:29,260 --> 01:53:32,920
there's Odin and Odin has two sons,
right?

1821
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:38,220
Thor and Loki,
thor is like thor is the world redeeming

1822
01:53:43,091 --> 01:53:48,091
hero and Loki is the trickster who wants
to bring everything down and you have to

1823
01:53:48,911 --> 01:53:53,911
recognize that in yourself or it's 
useful too because otherwise you 

1824
01:53:53,911 --> 01:53:58,020
underestimate.
No,

1825
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:03,750
it's maps of meaning,
positive psych.

1826
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,200
It's definitely not that.

1827
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,680
Why might you be villainous?

1828
01:54:21,730 --> 01:54:22,330
Well,
first of all,

1829
01:54:22,331 --> 01:54:25,450
because you can be.
That's a big deal.

1830
01:54:26,110 --> 01:54:28,870
You can be.
It's actually an offshoot of empathy.

1831
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:32,710
This is something that took me decades 
to figure out.

1832
01:54:33,220 --> 01:54:38,220
I figured it out when I was studying the
book of Genesis because in the book of 

1833
01:54:38,220 --> 01:54:42,511
Genesis,
people become self conscious and they 

1834
01:54:42,511 --> 01:54:44,110
immediately have the knowledge of good 
and evil and I just couldn't figure that

1835
01:54:44,111 --> 01:54:44,740
out.
It's like,

1836
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:46,870
what the hell's the relationship between
that?

1837
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:48,490
And then really,
I tell you,

1838
01:54:48,491 --> 01:54:53,491
I thought about that like for 30 years 
trying to puzzle that out and then I 

1839
01:54:53,491 --> 01:54:56,990
realized what it was.
If you're self conscious,

1840
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:00,920
you can,
you can conceptualize yourself as being,

1841
01:55:01,670 --> 01:55:06,670
you know that you are and you know what 
you're like and you know what hurts you 

1842
01:55:08,181 --> 01:55:12,050
and what does it.
And as soon as you know what hurts you,

1843
01:55:13,390 --> 01:55:14,660
you know what hurts her.

1844
01:55:16,110 --> 01:55:21,110
And so that's the knowledge of good and 
evil that comes along with being self 

1845
01:55:21,110 --> 01:55:24,161
conscious as this is something that 
distinguishes human beings from every 

1846
01:55:24,161 --> 01:55:24,900
other animal.
You know a lion will eat you,

1847
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:28,380
but it doesn't really want to tear you 
apart slowly,

1848
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,720
just for the fun of it.
Well,

1849
01:55:30,721 --> 01:55:32,850
it eats you.
It just wants to eat you and you,

1850
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:34,230
you know,
you could call that evil.

1851
01:55:34,231 --> 01:55:35,820
It sucks,
that's for sure.

1852
01:55:36,210 --> 01:55:39,420
But animals are beyond good and evil in 
that sense.

1853
01:55:39,421 --> 01:55:40,590
But human beings,
man,

1854
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:45,770
we can aim our malevolence and we're 
really good it because we can imagine 

1855
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:45,770
God,
this would hurt.

1856
01:55:45,770 --> 01:55:46,800
And if it hurts me,
man,

1857
01:55:46,801 --> 01:55:49,290
it's really going to hurt you.
So.

1858
01:55:49,291 --> 01:55:52,020
And you need to know that you're like 
that because you are like that,

1859
01:55:52,680 --> 01:55:55,470
and if you don't know you're like that,
or if you don't think you're like that,

1860
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:00,000
you're even more like that than you 
think because of the people who are most

1861
01:56:00,001 --> 01:56:04,550
like that are people who don't think 
they're like that at all and you have to

1862
01:56:04,551 --> 01:56:09,551
contend with that and that's why in many
systems of thinking the world is 

1863
01:56:09,651 --> 01:56:14,651
conceptualized as a battle between good 
and evil and it's inappropriate 

1864
01:56:14,651 --> 01:56:14,930
conceptualization.

1865
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:21,490
It's a medic conceptualization and the 
culture is the wise king in the tyrant 

1866
01:56:22,091 --> 01:56:27,091
and that's always the case and you're 
always stuck with that because as an 

1867
01:56:27,091 --> 01:56:28,450
individual with your negative side and 
your positive side,

1868
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:33,550
the negative side is the resentful side 
that is irritated that the limited 

1869
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:38,371
conditions of being and the suffering 
that entails and it's arbitrary and 

1870
01:56:38,371 --> 01:56:42,661
unfair nature and no wonder you got that
side has a case to make.

1871
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:48,580
It's not trivial in in the brothers 
Karamazov.

1872
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:54,150
That argument is laid out beautifully.
There's a character Alioscha who's a 

1873
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:55,110
monk,
monastery novitiate,

1874
01:56:55,120 --> 01:57:00,120
and not really a sparkling intellect,
but a very good person and he has a 

1875
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:04,531
brother Ivan and Ivan's a vicious genius
and Ivan just takes silly Osha apart and

1876
01:57:10,631 --> 01:57:13,140
partly he does that by telling a story 
about that.

1877
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:18,141
Dostoevsky took this from a news story.
The news story was that this mother and 

1878
01:57:18,821 --> 01:57:22,960
father had taken their young daughter 
and locked her in the outhouse overnight

1879
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:28,360
when it was like 30 below and you know,
she stayed out there crying and 

1880
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,690
screaming and froze to death and Ivan 
basically said to Lee Osha,

1881
01:57:31,691 --> 01:57:36,691
you know,
a world in which that could happen,

1882
01:57:37,171 --> 01:57:38,280
should not be.

1883
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:43,730
That's a good argument.
You know,

1884
01:57:43,731 --> 01:57:46,280
and you can multiply that by millions of
examples.

1885
01:57:47,960 --> 01:57:51,560
So the part of us that is opposed to 
being and resentful,

1886
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:54,050
it's got a point,
man.

1887
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:59,630
The problem as far as I can tell is that
if you act that out,

1888
01:58:00,500 --> 01:58:02,900
then it makes what you're objecting to 
worse.

1889
01:58:03,830 --> 01:58:06,980
Now you might be happy about that and 
you might think,

1890
01:58:06,981 --> 01:58:11,981
well,
people couldn't be consciously pursuing 

1891
01:58:11,981 --> 01:58:11,981
that,
but yes they can.

1892
01:58:12,170 --> 01:58:16,040
I would recommend a book called Pans,
Ram if you're interested in that sort of

1893
01:58:16,041 --> 01:58:21,041
thing.
It's a book written by a man who raped 

1894
01:58:21,041 --> 01:58:23,530
1200 men and killed dozens and burn 
things down to the ground every chance 

1895
01:58:23,841 --> 01:58:28,841
he got and tried to start a war between 
England and the US and who is aimed at 

1896
01:58:28,841 --> 01:58:32,630
nothing but may have and he.
He wrote an autobiography at the request

1897
01:58:32,631 --> 01:58:37,490
of a doctor who had befriended him and 
he tells you exactly what he did and why

1898
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:50,310
the story.
Heroin adversary,

1899
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:55,430
adversary order and tyranny,
destruction and creation.

1900
01:58:58,020 --> 01:59:00,720
That's the basic landscape and outside 
of that chaos.

1901
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:05,780
And so let's take a break.
Here's another way of looking at this 

1902
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:12,710
idea.
The individual is the person who pays 

1903
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:20,971
attention and explores a masters or who 
looks away

1904
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:24,660
and the

1905
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:30,900
the person who inhabits and explored 
territory and this is unexplored 

1906
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:36,721
territory and so wherever you go,
there's you and to have two halves of 

1907
01:59:38,651 --> 01:59:43,651
you that you have to contend with and 
wherever you are with people,

1908
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:49,891
there's the society with its tyrannical 
and beneficial nature and the society in

1909
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:55,840
some senses that match between what 
you're doing and what's happening.

1910
01:59:55,841 --> 02:00:00,841
It's really important to get that right 
and then unexplored territory that's 

1911
02:00:00,841 --> 02:00:04,240
wherever and whenever.
What you're doing stops working.

1912
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:08,650
And so it's not exactly a geographical 
idea,

1913
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:13,651
you know,
because when you think of explored 

1914
02:00:13,651 --> 02:00:15,061
territory,
you think of geographic landscape like 

1915
02:00:15,061 --> 02:00:15,061
that,
like the domain of an animal,

1916
02:00:15,061 --> 02:00:16,540
you know,
or like your house and you know,

1917
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:16,960
that's,

1918
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:24,040
that's definitely an element of it.
But you know,

1919
02:00:24,610 --> 02:00:29,610
if you're in your house and a snake 
comes into your living room and you're 

1920
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:29,610
in there,
it's like,

1921
02:00:29,610 --> 02:00:32,350
well that's an important difference 
between your house.

1922
02:00:32,351 --> 02:00:36,220
One second to go in your house now and 
so your house can turn into unexplored,

1923
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:38,860
unexplored territory at the drop of a 
hat,

1924
02:00:38,861 --> 02:00:43,861
and that's because we live in space and 
time and so the unexplored territory is 

1925
02:00:43,861 --> 02:00:48,750
conceptual.
It's a conceptual territory and it's 

1926
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:52,020
just wherever you are,
when things aren't working for you the 

1927
02:00:52,871 --> 02:00:57,871
way they're supposed to be and so and 
these are permanent parts of view,

1928
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:03,760
the human experience,
which is why I think they are 

1929
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:03,760
fundamental characters in our 
narratives.

1930
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,460
There's always you,
there's some subject of the story and 

1931
02:01:08,460 --> 02:01:10,870
that subject is an ambivalent person 
with many different potentials.

1932
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:15,190
You're always somewhere and with other 
people because that's our territory,

1933
02:01:15,191 --> 02:01:18,220
right?
I mean we're social beyond comprehension

1934
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:21,190
and you know,
even our primate ancestors,

1935
02:01:21,191 --> 02:01:25,840
most of their territory was other 
primates and their brains and our brains

1936
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:30,850
are specialized to view the world as an 
aggregation of personalities.

1937
02:01:31,060 --> 02:01:35,410
It's really important to us and so we 
tend to view the whole world that way.

1938
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:39,010
And then unexplored territory.
Well,

1939
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:44,630
that's where you don't know what to do 
and but you know,

1940
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:48,380
you do know what to do when you don't 
know what to do peculiarly enough.

1941
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:53,620
It's rather nonspecific.
It's this generalized stress response 

1942
02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:56,240
and so what happens is you freeze 
roughly speaking,

1943
02:01:56,241 --> 02:02:00,440
if the threat is enough,
then you produce a lot of cortisol and a

1944
02:02:00,441 --> 02:02:05,441
lot of adrenaline so that you're bloody 
well ready to move quick and whatever 

1945
02:02:05,441 --> 02:02:09,641
direction you have to and then maybe you
pay more attention and that's what you 

1946
02:02:09,641 --> 02:02:14,621
do when you don't know what to do.
And the problem with that is you can 

1947
02:02:14,621 --> 02:02:14,621
stay in that state forever.
Man.

1948
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,000
That's kind of what posttraumatic stress
disorder is.

1949
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:19,370
It's like you're just like that all the 
time.

1950
02:02:20,030 --> 02:02:22,910
And the problem with that is it's very 
uncomfortable.

1951
02:02:22,911 --> 02:02:27,911
I mean,
you stay like that for any length of 

1952
02:02:27,911 --> 02:02:27,911
time.
You're going to get depressed,

1953
02:02:27,911 --> 02:02:27,911
you're going to develop an anxiety 
disorder,

1954
02:02:27,911 --> 02:02:32,720
you're going to get old because you're 
burning up resources like mad.

1955
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:37,720
You know,
your system is shunting everything to 

1956
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:40,850
maintain that state of emergency 
preparation and it's exhausting.

1957
02:02:41,060 --> 02:02:46,060
It's not where you want to be.
So that's partly why people are so prone

1958
02:02:46,851 --> 02:02:51,851
to defend their territories.
They're familiar territory because if 

1959
02:02:51,851 --> 02:02:54,500
they're familiar territory is invaded or
disrupted,

1960
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:59,770
then they default back to the state of 
emergency preparation and that's like 

1961
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:03,110
that can unglue you if it's.
If it's profound enough,

1962
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:04,940
you know,
and you guys know this already.

1963
02:03:04,941 --> 02:03:09,941
I mean I think people experienced this 
most particularly when they're betrayed 

1964
02:03:09,941 --> 02:03:12,320
by someone they have an intimate 
relationship with,

1965
02:03:12,350 --> 02:03:13,640
you know,
when they're lied to.

1966
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:17,480
There's other ways,
the collapse of a dream or a vision that

1967
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:20,840
you've been pursuing or an illness or 
the death in the family.

1968
02:03:20,841 --> 02:03:25,841
There's lots of other ways,
but be trails is a really good one 

1969
02:03:25,841 --> 02:03:26,270
because if you're with someone for a 
long time,

1970
02:03:26,271 --> 02:03:27,080
you trust them.

1971
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:32,260
You have a representation of your past,
you have a representation of you in the 

1972
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:33,560
relationship,
you have a representation of them,

1973
02:03:33,561 --> 02:03:35,900
you have a representation of,
of relationships.

1974
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:39,260
You have a representation of the future.
You get betrayed.

1975
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:44,261
It's like poof.
Even the past isn't what you thought it 

1976
02:03:44,261 --> 02:03:44,261
was,
you know,

1977
02:03:44,261 --> 02:03:45,860
and what about you?
You know,

1978
02:03:46,250 --> 02:03:50,600
how clueless are you and maybe not at 
all or maybe ultimately gullible.

1979
02:03:50,601 --> 02:03:53,490
You don't know.
Is it your fault or you know,

1980
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:58,550
are you so clueless that you just can't 
protect yourself or was the person 

1981
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:02,171
malevolent in some subtle way that you 
failed to detect everything's up in the 

1982
02:04:02,171 --> 02:04:03,350
air,
not good,

1983
02:04:04,070 --> 02:04:09,070
and this idea that human beings traveled
to the underworld and come back.

1984
02:04:09,111 --> 02:04:14,111
It's like it's a really useful thing to 
understand because we do that all the 

1985
02:04:14,111 --> 02:04:15,170
time.
Whenever we fail,

1986
02:04:15,171 --> 02:04:20,171
it's like whip down into the underworld 
for awhile where everything's in chaos 

1987
02:04:20,171 --> 02:04:22,280
and then maybe we sort ourselves out and
bang,

1988
02:04:22,281 --> 02:04:27,281
we're back up and so one way of 
conceptualizing yourself is not as order

1989
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:33,460
and as not as chaos,
but as the thing that traverses between 

1990
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:37,220
the two domains and that I would say is 
the mythological hero.

1991
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:47,200
So I'm going to start talking to you 
about Pinocchio a little bit.

1992
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:53,190
Weirdly enough.
I hope you enjoy this and the reason I 

1993
02:04:54,821 --> 02:04:57,070
want to do it is because I want to.
I want to put some.

1994
02:04:59,730 --> 02:05:03,510
I want to bring what I told you 
abstractly down to earth,

1995
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,670
and then you can start thinking,
well,

1996
02:05:05,671 --> 02:05:07,680
does the conceptions that I've 
introduced to you,

1997
02:05:07,681 --> 02:05:09,420
are they,
are they good for anything?

1998
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:13,980
Did they help?
That's the order.

1999
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:19,530
Descend into chaos,
reestablishment of order.

2000
02:05:19,620 --> 02:05:22,590
That's paradise lost.
Profane history,

2001
02:05:22,710 --> 02:05:27,710
paradise regained.
It's the classic comedy and that's the 

2002
02:05:27,710 --> 02:05:31,230
story of life.
And so the question is how do you manage

2003
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:35,380
it?
And so that's a question you really want

2004
02:05:35,381 --> 02:05:37,440
to know the answer to.
So you'll go,

2005
02:05:37,530 --> 02:05:42,530
you'll pay money weirdly,
you'll line up and pay money to see a 

2006
02:05:42,530 --> 02:05:45,420
story about that even if you don't even 
know that that's what the story's about.

2007
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:50,780
And the reason for that is that actually
part of you does know what the story's 

2008
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:50,780
about.
You know,

2009
02:05:50,780 --> 02:05:53,100
you have your cognition has multiple 
layers.

2010
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:57,550
You understand things that you don't 
know,

2011
02:05:57,551 --> 02:06:01,000
you understand in ways that you don't 
understand.

2012
02:06:01,060 --> 02:06:02,620
And you can tell that because,
you know,

2013
02:06:02,621 --> 02:06:04,450
we,
we talked about Pinocchio a little bit,

2014
02:06:04,720 --> 02:06:07,780
how absurd it is and that it doesn't 
matter.

2015
02:06:08,020 --> 02:06:08,420
Well

2016
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:13,000
question.
So we've been talking.

2017
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:18,170
Um,
he also is when people don't do what 

2018
02:06:18,170 --> 02:06:18,170
they expect you to do it in the negative
sense,

2019
02:06:18,230 --> 02:06:23,230
something bad happens.
What if the reaction is extremely 

2020
02:06:23,230 --> 02:06:26,731
positive,
like something that you don't like 

2021
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:26,731
winning a lottery.
Does that,

2022
02:06:26,731 --> 02:06:28,030
do you also go into the stress response?
So.

2023
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:31,770
So it'd be the same thing.
No,

2024
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:31,920
it's

2025
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,720
not quite the same thing.
It's a good question.

2026
02:06:33,721 --> 02:06:36,420
And we will address that.
We will address that.

2027
02:06:36,970 --> 02:06:40,230
I mean winning the lottery is generally 
not a good idea for people,

2028
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:43,170
you know,
because it's just too much.

2029
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:47,820
It's too much for them.
Flips their lives upside down so.

2030
02:06:48,410 --> 02:06:53,410
And they tend to at,
at best to return to their original 

2031
02:06:53,410 --> 02:06:53,510
baseline level of emotion.
But yeah,

2032
02:06:53,511 --> 02:06:58,511
something remarkably good.
I mean it's a lot better than something 

2033
02:06:58,531 --> 02:07:03,150
remarkably bad obviously,
but it still can have that destabilizing

2034
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:08,390
effect.
So it depends on what elements of your 

2035
02:07:08,390 --> 02:07:09,960
life it disrupts it,
like it's some,

2036
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:15,080
some in some sense you have a map that 
you're operating within in the world and

2037
02:07:16,141 --> 02:07:19,230
that map is predicated on assumptions of
different sorts.

2038
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:24,500
Some shallow,
some profound when the profound 

2039
02:07:24,500 --> 02:07:27,861
assumptions are devastated.
Huge chunks of the map or invalidated 

2040
02:07:27,861 --> 02:07:32,600
and that can happen sometimes when 
dramatically positive things happen as 

2041
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:32,760
well.

2042
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:38,360
So,
but the fundamental rule is the more of 

2043
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,031
your axiomatic presuppositions are 
disrupted,

2044
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:45,370
the harder it is on you.
You know,

2045
02:07:45,371 --> 02:07:47,320
like maybe you quit your job because you
win the lottery.

2046
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:47,950
It's like,
Hey,

2047
02:07:47,951 --> 02:07:50,020
I'm off to the beach,
I'm going to drink Margaritas.

2048
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:53,080
So that'll work for about four days.
You know,

2049
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:54,450
you do that for three months,
you're a,

2050
02:07:54,570 --> 02:07:57,760
you're a beach alcoholic.
It's like that's a real improvement,

2051
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:59,530
you know,
so it's not that easy.

2052
02:07:59,531 --> 02:08:02,500
And often too,
if you take people out of their routine,

2053
02:08:03,710 --> 02:08:05,350
you know,
they just flounder.

2054
02:08:06,640 --> 02:08:09,250
Their circadian rhythms go.
They don't eat properly,

2055
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:11,440
they don't know what the hell to do,
you know.

2056
02:08:11,530 --> 02:08:16,090
So this is often why people have such a 
hard time when they retire.

2057
02:08:16,930 --> 02:08:21,930
I'm going to retire and relax.
It's like fire relaxed for two weeks I 

2058
02:08:23,821 --> 02:08:25,350
would die.
You know,

2059
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:28,980
I need something to do.
I need to be engaged in something.

2060
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:30,220
So,
okay,

2061
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:37,340
Pinocchio,
Disney movie and early one a 

2062
02:08:37,340 --> 02:08:40,761
masterpiece.
And so I'm going to walk you through it 

2063
02:08:40,761 --> 02:08:43,850
and I'm going to tell you what I think 
it means and you can tell me if you 

2064
02:08:44,191 --> 02:08:49,191
think that that's useful and I'm only 
going to do that for about 10 minutes 

2065
02:08:49,191 --> 02:08:50,070
today because I do want to cover some of
the details of the class.

2066
02:08:50,071 --> 02:08:53,340
And then next class we'll continue with 
this.

2067
02:08:53,820 --> 02:08:54,210
So,

2068
02:08:56,640 --> 02:09:01,640
so the movie opens with the opening 
credits which are carved wooden signs,

2069
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:04,290
which is like a hint,
you know,

2070
02:09:04,291 --> 02:09:09,291
because Japan was a carver and it starts
with this song which was actually quite 

2071
02:09:09,291 --> 02:09:13,830
a popular song and it's a bit of a,
what would you call it,

2072
02:09:15,270 --> 02:09:18,810
I don't think it's,
the poetry is particularly profound,

2073
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:22,650
but it was a song that people liked and 
people still listen to.

2074
02:09:22,651 --> 02:09:26,220
And um,
it sets the tone for the movie,

2075
02:09:26,310 --> 02:09:31,310
which is what music does.
One of the things that's really 

2076
02:09:31,310 --> 02:09:31,650
interesting about movies,
it's really mysterious is that,

2077
02:09:32,190 --> 02:09:34,560
you know,
if you go to a movie,

2078
02:09:34,561 --> 02:09:37,260
there's almost always a soundtrack,
right?

2079
02:09:37,261 --> 02:09:39,320
If you go to a movie and the reason to 
soundtrack it,

2080
02:09:39,460 --> 02:09:44,460
it kind of feels empty.
It feels like there's something missing 

2081
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:44,460
and you know,
it's as if the music,

2082
02:09:44,460 --> 02:09:45,180
you know,
when you go to a movie,

2083
02:09:45,181 --> 02:09:47,070
there's lots of things you can't see.

2084
02:09:47,070 --> 02:09:52,070
The characters are only partial and you 
don't know anything about their 

2085
02:09:52,070 --> 02:09:52,550
background.
So it's like a low resolution thing.

2086
02:09:52,770 --> 02:09:57,770
What seems to happen with the music is 
that it provides the emotional 

2087
02:09:57,770 --> 02:09:59,040
background,
the complex context,

2088
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:02,850
let's say it's like a substitute for the
context and it,

2089
02:10:03,090 --> 02:10:04,770
it guides you in,
in your,

2090
02:10:04,950 --> 02:10:07,980
in your perceptions of the movie.
It gives you hints about what's going to

2091
02:10:07,981 --> 02:10:08,600
happen.
And,

2092
02:10:09,050 --> 02:10:11,060
and,
and the funny thing about that is,

2093
02:10:11,061 --> 02:10:16,061
is that we just,
we just don't have any problem with 

2094
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:16,061
that.
You know,

2095
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:16,061
it's like,
yeah,

2096
02:10:16,061 --> 02:10:20,331
of course movie has its own track and,
and of course when there's a dramatic 

2097
02:10:20,331 --> 02:10:22,830
scene and the music gets dramatic and,
but that doesn't happen in real life.

2098
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:25,680
So you'd wonder why we would accept it 
in a movie.

2099
02:10:25,681 --> 02:10:30,681
And I think it's partly because we're 
willing to accept the amplification of 

2100
02:10:30,681 --> 02:10:34,070
reality that constitutes a movie.
And in fact,

2101
02:10:34,071 --> 02:10:39,071
we find that compelling and music is one
of the things that does that 

2102
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:39,140
amplification,
the dramatization,

2103
02:10:39,410 --> 02:10:41,330
and that's,
that's acceptable to us.

2104
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:47,470
This song I find quite interesting.
So I'm going to take it apart quite a 

2105
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:47,470
bit.

2106
02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:47,470
Um,

2107
02:10:50,550 --> 02:10:53,040
in some sense I feel foolish doing it 
because it's,

2108
02:10:53,370 --> 02:10:53,970
you know,
it's a,

2109
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:58,020
it's a childish,
childish song in some ways.

2110
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:01,320
But,
but that's okay.

2111
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:05,160
When you wish upon a star,
makes no difference who you are.

2112
02:11:06,090 --> 02:11:07,350
Well,
okay,

2113
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:12,590
there's some mysteries there people wish
upon stars.

2114
02:11:13,621 --> 02:11:14,980
That's like a little ritual,
right?

2115
02:11:17,070 --> 02:11:19,740
Why do they do that?

2116
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:22,920
Well,

2117
02:11:25,810 --> 02:11:30,810
and what exactly is the star?
That's another question because there 

2118
02:11:31,181 --> 02:11:35,110
are stars that shine in the heavens and 
there are people who are stars.

2119
02:11:36,790 --> 02:11:37,360
And so

2120
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:42,970
why are people stars?
While they're usually famous people,

2121
02:11:42,971 --> 02:11:47,971
right?
There are people that who attract a lot 

2122
02:11:47,971 --> 02:11:50,251
of attention.
And maybe there are people who have a 

2123
02:11:50,251 --> 02:11:50,251
lot of talent.
That's another possibility.

2124
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:52,090
Um,
maybe their models,

2125
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:53,950
I don't mean you know,
clothing models,

2126
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:56,890
although sometimes they are,
but there are models for emulation.

2127
02:11:57,340 --> 02:12:02,340
That's what being a star means.
That's why people magazine is full of 

2128
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:02,340
stars.
It's like they're,

2129
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:05,260
they're like,
they're like heroes brought to earth and

2130
02:12:05,261 --> 02:12:09,820
of course you know nothing about them.
All you know is their public persona and

2131
02:12:09,821 --> 02:12:14,821
of course they're usually very 
attractive and so that allows you to 

2132
02:12:14,821 --> 02:12:18,331
project upon them all of the things that
would go along with ideal humanity and 

2133
02:12:19,181 --> 02:12:24,181
so their stars and,
but still why stars will stars Beckman 

2134
02:12:24,271 --> 02:12:25,690
in the darkness,
right?

2135
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:29,290
And their other worldly.
That's the thing.

2136
02:12:29,291 --> 02:12:34,291
That's cool.
They're not of this earth and I mean 

2137
02:12:34,291 --> 02:12:36,760
that technically because obviously 
they're not of this earth,

2138
02:12:36,761 --> 02:12:37,600
but I also mean it.

2139
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:42,610
I mean it phenomenologically I mean it 
as an element of human experience.

2140
02:12:42,611 --> 02:12:47,611
So most of you are urban and so you've 
not had the experience of perhaps of the

2141
02:12:50,411 --> 02:12:52,090
full night sky,
you know,

2142
02:12:52,091 --> 02:12:57,091
and that's really too bad because the 
full night sky is one of those 

2143
02:12:57,091 --> 02:12:59,890
experiences that actually induces all 
naturally,

2144
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:04,950
you know,
and no wonder you look up there and 

2145
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:04,950
there's just stars everywhere,
right?

2146
02:13:04,950 --> 02:13:06,760
You're looking at the edge of the 
galaxy.

2147
02:13:06,761 --> 02:13:08,530
That's actually,
that's the Milky Way,

2148
02:13:08,531 --> 02:13:09,880
right?
It's the edge of the galaxy.

2149
02:13:09,881 --> 02:13:11,560
It's like,
wow,

2150
02:13:11,680 --> 02:13:16,680
there's the edge of the galaxy and 
there's just so many of them and it's 

2151
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:18,400
such an expensive.
You're looking into infinity,

2152
02:13:18,610 --> 02:13:22,150
you're looking into the unknown,
you're looking beyond yourself,

2153
02:13:22,390 --> 02:13:24,370
that's for sure.
And you know,

2154
02:13:24,371 --> 02:13:29,371
that produces a sense of awe in people 
like looking at the Grand Canyon or 

2155
02:13:29,371 --> 02:13:29,760
something like that and it's.

2156
02:13:29,850 --> 02:13:32,010
You're looking at something that 
transcends yourself,

2157
02:13:32,011 --> 02:13:34,470
but that feeling of awe,
that seems to be something that's,

2158
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:38,400
that's,
that's a natural part of our response.

2159
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
You know,
you might feel or when you meet someone 

2160
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,521
that you regard as particularly 
admirable as well because you'll feel 

2161
02:13:46,521 --> 02:13:46,650
that there's something transcendent 
about them.

2162
02:13:46,651 --> 02:13:49,050
So here's an interesting thing to think 
about.

2163
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:55,910
There are people you admire and there 
are people that you don't admire and 

2164
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:57,180
that's a clue,
right?

2165
02:13:57,181 --> 02:14:01,170
That's a clue as to your value system 
and it might be not really something you

2166
02:14:01,171 --> 02:14:06,171
can even put your finger on.
It's like if you find this person 

2167
02:14:06,171 --> 02:14:06,930
captivating,
you find this person at my admirable and

2168
02:14:06,931 --> 02:14:11,931
it's,
it's as if there's something inside of 

2169
02:14:11,931 --> 02:14:11,931
you that's looking for what's admirable,
you know,

2170
02:14:11,931 --> 02:14:14,210
assuming that you are and that person 
who's admirable has a,

2171
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:17,910
has a faculty,
some faculty that you would like to have

2172
02:14:17,911 --> 02:14:18,810
for yourself.

2173
02:14:18,990 --> 02:14:23,990
And so there are a model for emulation 
and that's part of helping people 

2174
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:23,990
develop,
you know,

2175
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:27,990
like little kids often develop little 
hero crushes on older kids,

2176
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,430
you know,
not that much older,

2177
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:34,431
but sort of the,
the person that's sort of just within 

2178
02:14:34,431 --> 02:14:35,490
their grasp and then they follow them 
around and imitate them and you know,

2179
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:37,770
so they're imitating what they find 
admirable.

2180
02:14:38,340 --> 02:14:43,340
Well,
the fact that you find something 

2181
02:14:43,340 --> 02:14:45,921
admirable as a hint,
as to the structure of your unconscious 

2182
02:14:45,921 --> 02:14:49,401
value system.
And so you could think even as an 

2183
02:14:49,401 --> 02:14:53,541
exercise,
you could take well what qualities of a 

2184
02:14:53,541 --> 02:14:56,690
human being do I find admirable?
You have to ask yourself that in a 

2185
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:57,090
sense.
You can't really think about it.

2186
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:02,300
There is a difference between asking 
yourself a question and thinking about 

2187
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:02,300
it,
you know,

2188
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:04,980
because it's more like when you're 
asking yourself a question,

2189
02:15:04,981 --> 02:15:06,480
it's contemplating,
it's like,

2190
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:08,550
well,
what do I find admirable?

2191
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:12,870
It's question you don't know,
and if you're fortunate and this happens

2192
02:15:12,871 --> 02:15:17,871
quite regularly,
an answer will float up from wherever 

2193
02:15:17,871 --> 02:15:18,790
the hell answers float up and oh yeah,
that's one,

2194
02:15:18,791 --> 02:15:23,400
and you can write that down and you get 
some idea of what your ideal is,

2195
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:28,430
you know,
and you have one likely and what your 

2196
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:30,921
counter ideal is star well,
to wish upon a star is to raise your 

2197
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:39,831
eyes above the horizon and to focus on 
something transcendent that's beyond 

2198
02:15:39,831 --> 02:15:41,940
you.
To focus on the absolute we could say to

2199
02:15:41,941 --> 02:15:44,220
focus on the light that shines in the 
darkness.

2200
02:15:44,780 --> 02:15:49,780
Now a stars,
people wear diamonds because they're 

2201
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:53,661
like stars or they're like the sun and 
they're pure and perfect and the 

2202
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:54,720
glitter,
and so there's something about the light

2203
02:15:54,721 --> 02:15:59,721
too.
There's something about a source of 

2204
02:15:59,721 --> 02:16:01,551
light.
It's a source of illumination and 

2205
02:16:01,551 --> 02:16:03,981
enlightenment and the and the light that
shines in the darkness is a deep 

2206
02:16:03,981 --> 02:16:03,981
metaphor,
right?

2207
02:16:03,981 --> 02:16:04,260
It's,
it's,

2208
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:05,880
it's,
it's what you want,

2209
02:16:05,881 --> 02:16:10,881
you want a light to shine in the 
darkness and so the star has all that 

2210
02:16:10,881 --> 02:16:14,811
and so people wish upon a star because 
they have some intuition that aiming 

2211
02:16:15,210 --> 02:16:20,130
above the mundane has the potential to 
transform themselves.

2212
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:21,870
They make a wish.
Well,

2213
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:28,130
if you're gonna make a wish.
You should aim at something high and 

2214
02:16:28,990 --> 02:16:30,010
even just aiming

2215
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,530
at that is more likely to make the wish 
come true.

2216
02:16:32,531 --> 02:16:36,400
And this is not a metaphor.
You know,

2217
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:41,480
I have this program which you guys are 
going to do called the future authoring 

2218
02:16:41,480 --> 02:16:44,770
program is one of two assignments.
One is that you write an autobiography,

2219
02:16:44,920 --> 02:16:49,920
that's the past authoring.
The other is that you write a plan for 

2220
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:49,920
the future.
That's the future authoring.

2221
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:52,300
I would recommend that you get started 
on those right now,

2222
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:57,410
like not right now,
but like really soon because they're 

2223
02:16:57,410 --> 02:16:59,740
harder than you think and some of you 
are gonna write like 15,000

2224
02:16:59,741 --> 02:17:02,530
words.
You're going to get sucked right in.

2225
02:17:02,560 --> 02:17:05,260
This happens all the time.
You're going to get sucked right into it

2226
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:10,860
and so you write an autobiography 
because you need to know where you are 

2227
02:17:10,860 --> 02:17:14,050
and who you are right now because how 
the hell are you going to plot a pathway

2228
02:17:14,051 --> 02:17:17,740
to the future unless you know where you 
are and then you need to write about the

2229
02:17:17,741 --> 02:17:20,830
future because you weren't going to hit 
something unless he aim at it.

2230
02:17:22,550 --> 02:17:27,550
That's for sure.
And lots of times people won't aim at 

2231
02:17:27,550 --> 02:17:30,821
what they want because they're afraid.
The reason they're afraid is because if 

2232
02:17:30,821 --> 02:17:34,271
you specify what you want,
you've specified your conditions of 

2233
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:37,391
failure.
You know when you fail and it's better 

2234
02:17:37,391 --> 02:17:37,391
just to keep it foggy.
It's like,

2235
02:17:37,391 --> 02:17:42,311
well,
I don't know if I'm succeeding or 

2236
02:17:42,311 --> 02:17:42,311
failing,
but you know,

2237
02:17:42,311 --> 02:17:42,311
I can't really tell while.
Great,

2238
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:45,320
except you can't hit anything you don't 
aim at.

2239
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:48,980
And so the future authoring program is 
like a.

2240
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:54,550
it's a,
an attempt to have you articulate your 

2241
02:17:54,550 --> 02:17:54,560
character.
And so as the past authoring program,

2242
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:59,920
who are you and you know,
the pastor authoring program and asked 

2243
02:18:00,171 --> 02:18:04,550
you to break your life into the parks 
and then to write about the emotional,

2244
02:18:05,030 --> 02:18:06,830
you know,
the things that you regard as important.

2245
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:08,740
Yeah.

2246
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:11,990
Important events that have shaped who 
you are and you know,

2247
02:18:11,991 --> 02:18:16,991
you may find that some of those,
some of that writing makes you 

2248
02:18:16,991 --> 02:18:19,281
emotional.
I would say if you have a memory that's 

2249
02:18:19,281 --> 02:18:19,830
more than 18 months old roughly 
speaking,

2250
02:18:19,831 --> 02:18:23,460
and when you bring it to mind it,
it has an emotional impact,

2251
02:18:23,461 --> 02:18:25,670
especially a negative emotional impact 
there.

2252
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:28,440
It's like part of your soul is stuck 
back there.

2253
02:18:29,240 --> 02:18:32,130
And I know that's a metaphorical way of 
thinking about it.

2254
02:18:32,131 --> 02:18:33,390
But what I mean is that,
okay,

2255
02:18:35,010 --> 02:18:40,010
the reason that you still experience the
emotion is because you have not solved 

2256
02:18:40,010 --> 02:18:44,010
the problem that,
that situation faced you with.

2257
02:18:44,011 --> 02:18:49,011
It might be a real problem.
Like maybe you got tangled up with 

2258
02:18:49,011 --> 02:18:49,011
someone who was really bad and that's 
rough man,

2259
02:18:49,011 --> 02:18:53,871
because you've got to come up with a 
theory of malevolence to deal with 

2260
02:18:53,871 --> 02:18:53,871
something like that.
And that's no joke.

2261
02:18:53,871 --> 02:18:58,670
But if it still produces emotion,
it means you haven't solved the problem 

2262
02:18:58,670 --> 02:19:03,380
and and your,
your brain is still pegging it as 

2263
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:03,380
threat.
It's,

2264
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:05,430
it's a part of your territory that you 
did not master threat,

2265
02:19:05,431 --> 02:19:05,970
threat,
threat,

2266
02:19:05,971 --> 02:19:06,600
threat,
threat,

2267
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:10,230
and until you take it apart and 
articulation really helps,

2268
02:19:10,231 --> 02:19:15,231
that writing really helps that then 
you're not going to free yourself from 

2269
02:19:15,231 --> 02:19:17,670
its grip and that might not be that 
pleasant.

2270
02:19:17,671 --> 02:19:20,460
I mean this is one of those situations 
were doing.

2271
02:19:20,461 --> 02:19:25,050
It tends to produce a decrement in 
people's mood in the short term,

2272
02:19:25,051 --> 02:19:28,190
but quite radical,
three to six months

2273
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,680
down the road,
you know,

2274
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:34,690
and it's often the case that you 
unfortunately have to do something you 

2275
02:19:34,690 --> 02:19:35,870
don't want to do in order to progress.
It's very,

2276
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:41,230
very common.
So in the future authoring program asks 

2277
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:42,410
you about different dimensions of your 
life,

2278
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:45,380
like because you're,
you know,

2279
02:19:45,381 --> 02:19:47,870
you can take yourself as a personality 
inside your head,

2280
02:19:47,871 --> 02:19:52,871
but your nested in systems that 
transcend you and they're just as real 

2281
02:19:52,871 --> 02:19:54,530
as whatever's in your head.
It's like,

2282
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:57,890
well,
what do you need for life?

2283
02:19:58,100 --> 02:20:00,200
Well,
that's pretty easy actually.

2284
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:03,380
Some friends,
that's a good thing,

2285
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:06,260
intimate relationship,
that's a good thing.

2286
02:20:07,070 --> 02:20:12,070
Family,
you know either the one you're going to 

2287
02:20:12,070 --> 02:20:14,921
produce or the one that you come from 
where people to some degree of love and 

2288
02:20:14,921 --> 02:20:16,790
care for one another.
That's a good thing to work on.

2289
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,640
You need,
you need some plan for your career.

2290
02:20:19,641 --> 02:20:24,641
You've got to fit in somewhere that 
people regard as important and that 

2291
02:20:24,641 --> 02:20:26,390
they'll trade with you so that you can 
live.

2292
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:31,460
You need something worthwhile to do with
the time that you're not at work and you

2293
02:20:31,461 --> 02:20:36,170
need to pay attention to your mental and
physical health and you need to regulate

2294
02:20:36,171 --> 02:20:39,200
your use of substances,
which is a strange one,

2295
02:20:39,201 --> 02:20:41,570
but alcohol does lots of people in so 
it's worth.

2296
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:43,760
It's worth thinking about.
That's why we put it in there,

2297
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:44,810
so then it's like,
okay,

2298
02:20:44,811 --> 02:20:47,960
what the hell do you want?
What do you want from your friends?

2299
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:50,990
What do you want from your family?
Or do you want from your career?

2300
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,660
If you could have what you want and 
that's what the program asks you.

2301
02:20:53,661 --> 02:20:57,080
Three to five years down the road,
you get to have what you want.

2302
02:20:58,370 --> 02:21:00,770
Now I'm assuming that you're going to 
approach this like,

2303
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:06,280
you know,
reasonable adults and not like 13 year 

2304
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:09,431
old dreamers.
I think I want the most expensive yacht 

2305
02:21:09,431 --> 02:21:09,431
in the world.

2306
02:21:09,470 --> 02:21:11,150
It's like fine,
but you know,

2307
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:17,440
that isn't really what it's supposed to 
be more concentrating on your character 

2308
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:22,770
and so then it asks you to write for 15 
minutes without thinking too much about 

2309
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:26,180
grammar or sentence structure.
Any of that,

2310
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:32,590
but what your life could be like three 
to five years down the road if you were 

2311
02:21:32,590 --> 02:21:36,131
treating yourself like someone you cared
for and you were helping them figure out

2312
02:21:36,441 --> 02:21:40,910
what they wanted and then it asks you to
do the same thing in reverse,

2313
02:21:41,300 --> 02:21:46,300
which is to think about the ways that 
you're radically insufficient and your 

2314
02:21:48,051 --> 02:21:50,750
faults and everyone knows this.
I think,

2315
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:51,980
you know,
maybe not,

2316
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:56,240
but everyone has a sense of if they were
going to degenerate,

2317
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:57,920
how they would do it.
You know,

2318
02:21:57,921 --> 02:22:00,680
some people would be an alcoholic,
some people would be a street person.

2319
02:22:00,681 --> 02:22:05,681
It's like there's some doom thing out 
there that's got your name on it if 

2320
02:22:05,681 --> 02:22:08,090
you're particularly in cautious and you 
know,

2321
02:22:08,300 --> 02:22:11,960
don't and let things fall apart.

2322
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:16,730
So I want you to write about that.
What do you not want to have happened in

2323
02:22:16,731 --> 02:22:21,731
three to five years?
And there's psychological reasons for 

2324
02:22:21,731 --> 02:22:24,671
this.
A one is you have something to aim for 

2325
02:22:24,671 --> 02:22:28,301
that's a source of positive emotion 
because your positive emotion is mostly 

2326
02:22:28,301 --> 02:22:31,050
generated by evidence that you're moving
towards something that you value.

2327
02:22:31,500 --> 02:22:34,950
It's not generated so much by 
accomplishing something because when you

2328
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:39,951
accomplished something,
you're just left with the problem of 

2329
02:22:39,951 --> 02:22:39,951
whatever you're going to do next.
So you graduate from university.

2330
02:22:39,951 --> 02:22:41,240
It's like,
you know,

2331
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:46,400
Hooray.
One day you're at the peak of your 

2332
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:49,941
undergraduate university career.
The next day you're unemployed and 

2333
02:22:49,941 --> 02:22:52,200
looking for a bad job at starbucks.
So,

2334
02:22:52,201 --> 02:22:54,620
you know,
while you see what I mean is,

2335
02:22:54,621 --> 02:22:55,010
you know,
it's,

2336
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:56,430
it's that,
you know,

2337
02:22:56,431 --> 02:22:59,340
one problem that you solve is replaced 
by another problem.

2338
02:22:59,341 --> 02:23:02,370
And so the idea that you're going to be 
happy when you solve all your problems,

2339
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:05,310
it's like good luck with that theory.

2340
02:23:05,850 --> 02:23:07,860
But,
but you know,

2341
02:23:07,861 --> 02:23:12,861
if you're aiming at something worthwhile
and you really believe it's worthwhile 

2342
02:23:12,861 --> 02:23:12,861
and you've thought it through,
you know,

2343
02:23:12,861 --> 02:23:14,610
so that you're not weak,
you're not weak,

2344
02:23:14,611 --> 02:23:16,560
you've got your damn arguments,
mustard.

2345
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:18,720
Then when you make progress even a 
little bit,

2346
02:23:18,721 --> 02:23:19,200
you think,
hey,

2347
02:23:19,201 --> 02:23:20,970
that's all right,
and you get a little kick,

2348
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,880
a little dopamine kick and that's what 
you want.

2349
02:23:23,930 --> 02:23:25,920
Cause that's where your positive emotion
comes from.

2350
02:23:26,130 --> 02:23:27,950
You can use cocaine if you want,
but,

2351
02:23:29,340 --> 02:23:34,340
but you know,
that tends to have relatively 

2352
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:35,280
detrimental medium to longterm 
consequences,

2353
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:40,400
but it activates the same system.
So you have to be aiming at something 

2354
02:23:40,400 --> 02:23:43,200
and you should be aiming at something 
that's realistic that you want,

2355
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:45,570
that you could get,
you know,

2356
02:23:45,600 --> 02:23:47,940
like,
not easily because if it's easy,

2357
02:23:48,210 --> 02:23:50,720
in some sense you've already got it.
It's got to push you.

2358
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:52,860
And that's part of the pleasure 
actually,

2359
02:23:52,861 --> 02:23:57,861
because there's two things that you want
to do when you're pursuing something 

2360
02:23:57,861 --> 02:23:59,400
that's important and one of them is to 
get the thing that's important.

2361
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:04,610
But the other is,
is to make yourself better at pursuing 

2362
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:04,610
things.
Right?

2363
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:07,260
So,
so you can get both of those at the same

2364
02:24:07,261 --> 02:24:07,890
time,
you,

2365
02:24:08,220 --> 02:24:13,220
you,
you're aiming at something and you're 

2366
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:13,220
increasing your competence.
It's like that's a good deal.

2367
02:24:13,220 --> 02:24:17,160
That's a good deal and there's a lot of 
intrinsic meaning to be felt in that.

2368
02:24:17,161 --> 02:24:20,100
And then the second half of the program,
you,

2369
02:24:21,540 --> 02:24:26,540
you write out a plan for how you're 
going to do it and how are you going to 

2370
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:27,600
keep yourself on track and you're gonna 
write about why it would be good for you

2371
02:24:27,601 --> 02:24:32,601
if you did this and why it would be good
for your family and what possible 

2372
02:24:32,601 --> 02:24:32,980
benefits it would have to the community,
you know,

2373
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:38,060
because you want to nail this thing down
and then you want to figure out what 

2374
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:42,261
kind of obstacles are going to come up 
and how you might overcome them and how 

2375
02:24:42,261 --> 02:24:42,720
you might keep yourself on track and all
of that.

2376
02:24:42,720 --> 02:24:47,720
And we know because we've actually done 
a lot of research on this particular 

2377
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:51,741
program that if university students do 
this and this is more true,

2378
02:24:52,081 --> 02:24:55,320
if they're not too well oriented to 
begin with.

2379
02:24:55,860 --> 02:25:00,860
If University students do this,
they're about 25 percent less likely to 

2380
02:25:00,860 --> 02:25:03,390
drop out,
which is lot and about their grade point

2381
02:25:03,391 --> 02:25:08,010
average increases about 20 percent.
So Hooray for that,

2382
02:25:08,070 --> 02:25:13,070
you know,
because you never know when you develop 

2383
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:13,070
an intervention,
if it's gonna work,

2384
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:14,220
there's also evidence but not from my 
lab.

2385
02:25:14,850 --> 02:25:19,850
That doing such things improves your 
physical health and I think the reason 

2386
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:23,931
for that is is that you know when you go
over your autobiography and you scour 

2387
02:25:23,931 --> 02:25:25,720
out those negative places that you're 
sort of dragging along with you,

2388
02:25:25,900 --> 02:25:29,770
it lowers your overall stress load 
because your brain is kind of.

2389
02:25:29,771 --> 02:25:34,771
I think it's calculating how dangerous 
the world is by attending to the ratio 

2390
02:25:35,501 --> 02:25:39,040
of successes to failures that you've had
in your life.

2391
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:41,200
Something like that.
And so you know,

2392
02:25:41,201 --> 02:25:44,260
if there are holes in your map that you 
could still fall through,

2393
02:25:44,261 --> 02:25:49,030
then your brain regards the territory 
still as a bit on the dangerous side and

2394
02:25:49,031 --> 02:25:52,750
then you more prepared for emergency 
action and that's hard on you.

2395
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:55,690
So you want to go back there and fix up 
those

2396
02:25:57,590 --> 02:25:59,870
experiences is to the degree that you 
can.

2397
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:05,140
Now those are going to be peer rated.
Now that's complicated,

2398
02:26:05,871 --> 02:26:07,130
but here's,
here's how you do it,

2399
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:12,760
right?
The thing so that you have written it 

2400
02:26:12,760 --> 02:26:16,841
for you and then take everything out 
that you're not comfortable sharing with

2401
02:26:17,361 --> 02:26:21,140
other people and so there's a couple of 
reasons I do it that way.

2402
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:26,260
One is just that there's just no other 
way to do it because if I want to do 

2403
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:29,450
this with you,
the grading load is too high to do it.

2404
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:31,640
So I thought,
well,

2405
02:26:31,641 --> 02:26:36,641
it's still worth doing and because this 
is a class about narrative and about 

2406
02:26:36,641 --> 02:26:40,091
self narrative,
it's the right thing to do and most of 

2407
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:40,790
you are graduating soon and it's like 
it's a helpful.

2408
02:26:40,940 --> 02:26:45,940
I think you'll find it very helpful.
That's what students report and so 

2409
02:26:45,940 --> 02:26:50,440
you'll each read three people will read 
each of your

2410
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:59,190
offerings and give you a grade and then 
you get the average of the best two 

2411
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:02,971
grades and they're.
They're supposed to provide you with 

2412
02:27:02,971 --> 02:27:05,131
constructive feedback and constructive 
feedback is sort of mostly what did you 

2413
02:27:05,131 --> 02:27:05,131
do?
Right?

2414
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:07,840
You know,
and maybe some hints about where you can

2415
02:27:07,841 --> 02:27:08,920
flesh it out.
And all that,

2416
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:12,610
but so that's that.
And you need to write an essay.

2417
02:27:13,190 --> 02:27:14,890
Uh,
this is all detailed on the,

2418
02:27:14,891 --> 02:27:19,450
uh,
on the website and that's the website.

2419
02:27:19,570 --> 02:27:22,450
If you go to Jordan Peterson.com
on the left,

2420
02:27:22,660 --> 02:27:25,120
there's classes,
if he clicked classes you get a bunch of

2421
02:27:25,121 --> 02:27:29,230
tabs and one of the towns is psych for 
34 and that's obviously this class.

2422
02:27:29,231 --> 02:27:33,030
And so the,
there's some extra readings on there and

2423
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:35,560
a list of how we're going to go through 
the course.

2424
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:39,550
The dates aren't right.
I gotta update it and I haven't finished

2425
02:27:39,551 --> 02:27:42,010
that yet,
but the rest of it's pretty much the way

2426
02:27:42,011 --> 02:27:42,370
it is.

2427
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:45,170
This writing program is an online 
program and it,

2428
02:27:45,330 --> 02:27:47,320
it guides you through the process of 
doing it,

2429
02:27:47,321 --> 02:27:52,321
but really I would really recommend that
you start like this week because it also

2430
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:58,930
works better if you do it over time.
And it seems like in bursts of writing,

2431
02:27:58,931 --> 02:28:01,690
you know,
and to sleep in between episodes because

2432
02:28:01,691 --> 02:28:04,480
that's when your brain consolidates its 
new information.

2433
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:09,570
And I would say do it meditatively,
you know,

2434
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:12,070
ask yourself,
ask yourself.

2435
02:28:12,071 --> 02:28:17,071
It's a different way of.
It's really funny what happens when you 

2436
02:28:17,071 --> 02:28:20,341
ask yourself questions because part of 
you will answer and you don't know what 

2437
02:28:20,341 --> 02:28:23,791
the answer will be,
but an answer comes almost always and 

2438
02:28:23,791 --> 02:28:24,380
you know,
like you think,

2439
02:28:24,381 --> 02:28:29,381
well what,
what happened to me when I was six 

2440
02:28:29,381 --> 02:28:31,601
around six that was important and 
through some mysterious process,

2441
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:37,510
perhaps a memory will come to mind.
So there's a test.

2442
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:42,530
So there's these two side mounts plus 
the essay.

2443
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:48,280
The essay can be in anything you want 
that's related to the class.

2444
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,650
You have to make the case that it's 
related to the class.

2445
02:28:52,130 --> 02:28:56,670
So it's an opportunity to,
you know,

2446
02:28:56,690 --> 02:28:59,870
to write about something you want to 
write about

2447
02:29:02,800 --> 02:29:05,680
and there's a final exam and the final 
exam,

2448
02:29:05,890 --> 02:29:07,660
if you read the book and you come to the
classes,

2449
02:29:07,690 --> 02:29:09,990
do you won't have any problem with the 
final exam because it's not,

2450
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:15,840
it's not tricky.
It's just a survey of what we've gone 

2451
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:18,190
through.
And so I did that.

2452
02:29:18,191 --> 02:29:20,920
I didn't have that to begin with.
But you know,

2453
02:29:20,921 --> 02:29:24,310
you need a carrot and a stick because 
you guys are busy and you know,

2454
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:29,410
you're going to treat outage and do the 
things that are crucial and perhaps not 

2455
02:29:29,410 --> 02:29:33,631
the things that aren't and no wonder.
So I had to make this crucial because 

2456
02:29:33,631 --> 02:29:36,850
otherwise you won't read it and that's 
partly because it's hard and so,

2457
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:40,420
but hopefully the course lectures will 
help guide you through it.

2458
02:29:40,990 --> 02:29:45,990
And uh,
that's about that.

2459
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:53,520
So I'm going to tell you a bunch of 
stories and I'm going to try to explain 

2460
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:57,511
what they mean.
And what I hope will happen is that the 

2461
02:29:57,511 --> 02:30:01,441
world of narrative will open up for you 
and that and like I found that 

2462
02:30:03,041 --> 02:30:08,041
incredibly useful.
It's incredibly useful to understand 

2463
02:30:08,041 --> 02:30:09,340
these things.
It situates you better.

2464
02:30:09,370 --> 02:30:14,370
And it also helps you see what people 
tell me about this course frequently is 

2465
02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:14,370
that

2466
02:30:18,660 --> 02:30:23,640
it's something like that.
They already knew what I'm telling them,

2467
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:28,350
but they didn't know that they knew it.
So it makes sense.

2468
02:30:28,351 --> 02:30:29,880
It clicks,
it clicks.

2469
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:35,540
And you know,
to me what that means is that you have 

2470
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:37,791
the information represented in you in an
action,

2471
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:42,630
in your procedures and your habits and 
in your perceptual structures.

2472
02:30:42,631 --> 02:30:44,970
It's implicit,
it's the implicit you.

2473
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:46,560
And then

2474
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:53,060
I can articulate in part what that 
implicit you is and it fits.

2475
02:30:53,090 --> 02:30:54,020
Click.
Oh yeah,

2476
02:30:54,021 --> 02:30:55,430
that's what I'm like.
That's what people are like,

2477
02:30:55,460 --> 02:30:58,820
that's where people are like.
And so well,

2478
02:30:58,821 --> 02:31:02,150
if any of that happened today during 
this lecture to you,

2479
02:31:02,151 --> 02:31:04,130
well then that's a good sign that you 
might,

2480
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:06,200
you know,
benefit from the course.

2481
02:31:06,201 --> 02:31:11,201
And if it didn't,
well you could try one more lecture and 

2482
02:31:11,201 --> 02:31:11,201
see what happens.
So,

2483
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:14,270
but you know,
this is sort of what the course is like.

2484
02:31:15,560 --> 02:31:20,560
And if that's what you want,
then this is where you get it.

2485
02:31:22,760 --> 02:31:25,400
Good to see all of you.
And I guess we're done right.
