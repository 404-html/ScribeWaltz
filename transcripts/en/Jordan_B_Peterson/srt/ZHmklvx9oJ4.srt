1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,190
And I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:03,783
Okay,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,570
so momentarily we're going to return to
the basic story

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:19,220
and I want to talk to you today about
how your brain organizes your

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,370
perceptions and then I want to talk to
you about how that's represented in

6
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:28,371
hematology.
First thing I'd like to point out is

7
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,800
that we talked about the difference
between Darwinian,

8
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,660
the Newtonian viewpoints a while back,
and one of the,

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,690
okay,

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,230
one claim that you might make if you
were a Darwinian is that whatever your

11
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:48,460
brain is adapted to his reality.
No,

12
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,680
I mean that seems to me to be the
central claim of Darwinian evolution is

13
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:58,681
that you can't define reality any more
accurately than that which selects.

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,060
Now I want to tell you about how I think
the brain is organized and then I want

15
00:01:09,281 --> 00:01:14,050
to show you,
I hope that the way fundamental

16
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:18,190
narratives work can be mapped onto that
brain structure.

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,850
And
to me that implies that there's

18
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:28,840
something right about the fundamental
narratives because otherwise why would

19
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:33,280
they map onto the brain structures that
have evolved to adapt as to the

20
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:35,860
environment?
Now you don't.

21
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,270
People think about reality.
I know subjective terms and they think

22
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:44,770
about it as decomposable into tiny sub
units.

23
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,300
But I think that that's a limited
viewpoint,

24
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,330
a powerful but limited viewpoint.
I think it's much more realistic to

25
00:01:55,271 --> 00:02:00,271
assume that whatever reality is is more
like a continual interplay,

26
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,920
a very,
very complex patterns.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,193
And

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,640
I suppose you could make the case that
those patterns are ultimately made out

29
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,620
of particles,
but that's even,

30
00:02:11,621 --> 00:02:16,621
that's not exactly true because the
particles have to be arrayed in space.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,130
So that's part of the atomic theory is
that there's not just particles,

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,290
subatomic particles and atomic
particles,

33
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:27,280
but if they're arrayed in space and if
there are rate in space,

34
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,670
that means the manner in which they're
are rate can be informative.

35
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,850
And if you reduce the phenomena to the
particle without taking into account the

36
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,770
patterning of the array of particles,
then there's levels and levels and

37
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:46,630
levels of information that you lose and
those information that those levels of

38
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,500
information are,
they may not be relevant for our

39
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,060
physical understanding of the,
of the makeup of atomic and subatomic

40
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,100
particles.
But they're definitely relevant to

41
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:58,870
whether or not we can walk across the
street.

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
And so I would say
if you're related to reality properly,

43
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,850
the kind of information that you're
processing is precisely the kind of

44
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,510
information that allows you to cross the
street properly and to do all the other

45
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:17,290
things during your day and your weeks
and your months that you have to in

46
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,290
order to stay alive and,
and,

47
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,000
and fundamentally in some sense to
propagate.

48
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,080
So,
all right,

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,050
so we'll start with the
neuropsychological argument.

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Now we've already established the idea
that these little frames of reference or

51
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,960
maps or stories or whatever you call
them,

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,620
I'll call them stories,
I think from here on in our little goal

53
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:45,040
directed units.
And there are units of conception and

54
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,660
emotion and perception and behavior,
their little subpersonalities and

55
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,970
there's some personality has an initial
starting point and a destination point.

56
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,680
And then it can implement behaviors to
transform the starting point into the

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,900
destination point.
And then you might say,

58
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:03,550
well,
what forms these little

59
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,670
subpersonalities?
And the answer to that is very complex,

60
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:11,110
but one answer is fundamental motivate
motivations.

61
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,490
And so I arranged the fundamental
motivations on this particular

62
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,470
diagram pointed out that you can roughly
consider motivations as those that

63
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,890
maintain you and those that propagate
you.

64
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,370
Now it's just a heuristic,
it's just a way of thinking about it.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,180
Um,
under self maintenance there's thermal

66
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:35,290
regulation,
thirst,

67
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,840
hunger and elimination.
There's all sorts of other things as

68
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,490
well,
but those will do for the time being.

69
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:43,900
And then under self propagation there's
affiliate of desire and sexual desire.

70
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,670
Now the thing that's quite interesting
about all this is that you know,

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,700
there are,
there are brain structures that underlie

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,800
these fundament,
the manifestation of these fundamental

73
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,680
subpersonalities.
Now people tend to think about them

74
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:03,880
either as motivations or emotions.
And I think that's a use and other

75
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:06,940
useful heuristic.
And that you could say roughly speaking,

76
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,450
that a motivation pops up,
an entire frame of reference and an

77
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:13,660
emotion tends to orient you within that
frame of reference.

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
But that's only a conceptual
simplification because what you see when

79
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:24,070
you look at the actual brain structures
is that like there isn't an emotion

80
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:28,030
center.
There are a bunch of micro units in the

81
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,810
brain.

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,470
And each of,
and there are separable micro units for

83
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,780
different emotions and different
motivations and they don't necessarily

84
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:41,560
have that much in common in terms of
their locale except that they tend to be

85
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:45,160
relatively deep in the brain.
So some are hypothalamic and summer in

86
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:48,190
the Amygdala in summer in the
periaqueductal gray,

87
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:52,210
which seems to be responsible for pain
responses and so we can classify things

88
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:55,870
as motivations and emotions,
but that doesn't map one to one on the

89
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,871
underlying brain structures.
Now I think what we'll do with regards

90
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,180
to talking about the brain is we'll
start from the bottom up and it's

91
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:09,680
appropriate to start from the bottom up
because you are more dependent on your

92
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,860
ancient brain structures.
Then you are on your modern brain

93
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,270
structures in that if you damage your
modern brain structures,

94
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:20,180
and I mean relatively modern,
let's say the ones that have really

95
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,840
evolved in great detail over the last 2
million years,

96
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,720
the cortical cap,
particular the prefrontal Cortex,

97
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,690
a lot of the visual Cortex,
if you damage that,

98
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:31,130
you can pretty much go on.

99
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,980
Now you know you're going to have one
impairment or another impairment,

100
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,320
but you can still stay alive.
However,

101
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:39,380
there are structures that are lower down
that if you damage,

102
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:41,390
that's the end of you.
So for example,

103
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,030
the ascending reticular activating
system,

104
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:46,610
which is the thing that wakes you up
when you're asleep at night,

105
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:48,620
when you,
when a noise occurs that shouldn't

106
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,600
occur,
it's,

107
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,580
it seems to be the activating center for
consciousness,

108
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,130
whatever that means.
It's way deep down in the brain.

109
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,890
It's way down at the top of the spinal
cord,

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,310
roughly speaking.
And if you twist your head in a car

111
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:05,210
accident a little bit too roughly,
and you shear off they ascending fibers,

112
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,940
then you're in a coma permanently and
nothing can wake you up.

113
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,950
And that's pretty interesting.
You know,

114
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,290
that consciousness,
which we think of again,

115
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,540
you know,
our tendency is to think about that as a

116
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:18,470
function of the higher cortical systems
is dependent completely on something

117
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,360
that's unbelievably ancient.

118
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,801
So,
you know,

119
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:25,100
and it begs the question,
well at exactly what level of neuronal

120
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,790
complexity do you have to be before you
have some consciousness.

121
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:33,230
And the answer to that is we don't know
because of the relationship between

122
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,260
consciousness and neuronal structure is
insanely complex.

123
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:41,261
So for example,
you have very neurone neuron heavy

124
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,790
structures in your brain.
The cerebellum,

125
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:47,430
which has about as many,
it has a very rough outer coding like

126
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,160
the cortex and it has about as many
neurons as the cortical she does.

127
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,730
And yet you can take it out of people.
They don't seem to show any impairment

128
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:56,960
of consciousness,
but they,

129
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,621
they,
you know,

130
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,380
they get a tax sick and they can't
control their behavior that well.

131
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,820
They have a hard time guiding it and,
but that seems to be more or less it now

132
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:07,400
it isn't because there is other things
the cerebellum does,

133
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:12,401
but my point is you can have massive
massively neuron heavy structures that

134
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,220
seem to be related in,
in very minimal ways to our experience

135
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,180
of consciousness.

136
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,580
You know,
in your autonomic nervous system is sort

137
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,500
of like that too.
There's a lot of neurons in your

138
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,800
autonomic nervous system.
But I think it's a mistake to say that

139
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,380
we're precisely conscious of our
autonomic nervous system,

140
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,930
although now and then we're conscious of
its outputs,

141
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,460
you know,
it governs our,

142
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,600
the operation of our organs and all the
things that are so complex that we

143
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:38,450
aren't allowed to mess with them as
conscious beings,

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,770
but it's not conscious.
And then while somehow some neurons are

145
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,660
conscious and we,
I tell you,

146
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,880
we don't know anything about
consciousness.

147
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,560
We really don't.
We don't have a clue.

148
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,330
And I think it's probably because we're
formulating the question wrong.

149
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,370
You know,
those people are people who are

150
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:59,490
materialists reductionists and they
believe that consciousness is an

151
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,820
emergent property of the underlying
neuronal neuronal function.

152
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,050
But the problem with that philosophy is
that it's predicated on the assumption

153
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:11,430
that they understand what the matter is
that's making up that neuronal

154
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,030
substrate.

155
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,260
And I can tell you that by the time we
were able to reduce consciousness to its

156
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,590
underlying material structure,
we'll think of whatever matter is in a

157
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,080
way that's completely different than the
way we think of it now.

158
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,480
You know,
so there might be an eventual reduction,

159
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,600
but at the same time there's going to be
a transformation of the theories.

160
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,820
You know,
it's clear that we don't understand

161
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,410
material that well,
particularly because when you go down

162
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,820
into the underlying,
you know,

163
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:39,210
the tiny underlying substructures at the
subatomic level,

164
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,280
it behaves in a very,
very peculiar manner.

165
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,770
So,
so anyways,

166
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,780
you know,
all bets are off with regards to

167
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,600
consciousness,
but it also does seem to be something

168
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,120
that's likely very ancient,
you know,

169
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:52,770
and uh,
you know,

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,830
there are people who've attributed
consciousness to insects.

171
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,650
Insects by the way,
seem to go out of their way to take

172
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,260
hallucinogenic drugs,
which is quite interesting.

173
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,200
So the,
the Flyer Garrett for example,

174
00:10:04,201 --> 00:10:06,930
is a mushroom that,
it's the famous red and white mushroom

175
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:11,400
that you always see in fairy tales and
in Super Mario brothers and like it pops

176
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:14,520
up everywhere and flies will come and
take a bite of it.

177
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:18,420
And then they fall unconscious beside
the mushroom and they stay there for

178
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:20,580
like 10 or 15 minutes and then they get
up.

179
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,760
But they'll go eat it again.
And reindeer really like them too.

180
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,510
And they get blitzed out of their mind
on m,

181
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:27,750
Anita miscarriers.
And so it,

182
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,800
and,
and there's,

183
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:33,450
there's evidence for the desire to
transform states of consciousness way,

184
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,360
way down in the animal kingdom,
way farther than you'd think.

185
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,590
So you know,
God only knows and then you think,

186
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:42,180
well,
a big brain is necessary,

187
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,460
but you consider something like,
uh,

188
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,720
Irene Pepperberg,
um,

189
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,830
African gray parrot,
which died a couple of years ago,

190
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:53,880
a famous animal which could speak better
than a three year old kid,

191
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,170
four year old kid,
and had a good,

192
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,310
good vocabulary.

193
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,010
More than 500 words.
And it could put together meaningful

194
00:10:59,011 --> 00:11:01,890
phrases.
It could speak better than a chimpanzee.

195
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,090
They use sign language of course.
But like this was one smart bird.

196
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,220
And if they think about a bird,
I mean,

197
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,370
it has no brain a bird.
It's got a brain like this big.

198
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,520
And now I know a bird isn't very big and
that actually makes a difference.

199
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,410
But the fact that that much intelligence
can be packed into that small an area

200
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,070
means as far as I'm concerned,
that we don't really understand very

201
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:28,071
much about how the brain works.
But we do understand some things and

202
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:31,590
most of the things we understand have
actually been discovered by animal

203
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,510
experimentalists,
which,

204
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:35,550
uh,
which is a useful thing to know because

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,700
of course there's lots of people who
don't think that animal experimentation

206
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:41,100
is a good idea.
Or that we could substitute computer

207
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,720
models,
which is of course a Spec,

208
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,910
spectacularly idiotic theory.

209
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,760
Because obviously if we had accurate
computer models,

210
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:50,130
we wouldn't need to do the animal
experimentation,

211
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,800
you know,
so we're not going to build a computer

212
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,090
model that's better than our current
understanding,

213
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,620
at least not,
not yet.

214
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,120
We May,
we may in the future.

215
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,750
So anyways,
you can think of the basic elements,

216
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,730
the basic structures that are producing
these little subpersonalities,

217
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,130
um,
as,

218
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:13,270
as the output of fundamental biological
systems are their motivations or

219
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:17,320
emotions and the structure that appears
to be most responsible for this sort of

220
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,500
thing.
At least initially is the hypothalamus.

221
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,020
And I should show you a little bit about
the hypothalamus,

222
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,660
just so you kind of have a sense of what
it is.

223
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Um,
it's not very big and you see in this

224
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,520
diagram that it sits right on top of
this,

225
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,950
of the spinal cord and the base part of
the brain.

226
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,320
So that's just that little bitty area
there,

227
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:38,951
which,
you know,

228
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,160
it looks from the diagram to be maybe
one,

229
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,070
1% of the entire brain mass or something
like that.

230
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:48,220
And I think I mentioned to you before
that if you take a cat and you take all

231
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:50,470
of its brain off except the
hypothalamus,

232
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:53,830
roughly speaking,
as long as it's a female cat in a

233
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,100
restricted environment,
it can pretty much live a cat life

234
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:01,390
except that it's hyper exploratory,
which I do think is quite remarkable.

235
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,160
You know,
cause you'd think it would just lay

236
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,440
there passively,
right with,

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
since it doesn't have a brain,
but,

238
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,130
um,
the hypothalamus,

239
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,340
and I'll show you some more pictures
here about types.

240
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,070
They all must.
So this is a rat hypothalamus and this

241
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:19,930
is a diagram from Larry Swanson who's a
real genius and well worth reading,

242
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,450
although very complicated.
Um,

243
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,740
he's a developmental neuro anatomist if
I remember correctly.

244
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,370
And he's interested in how the brain and
folds across the course of feet of fetal

245
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:32,200
development and all sorts of different
animals.

246
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,350
You know,
assuming that by doing that in part you

247
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,780
can track the evolution,
but you can also understand the

248
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,880
relationship between one brain part in
another.

249
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,710
Now what you see here,
you see all those little subunits of the

250
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:46,220
Hypothalamus,
they're,

251
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,600
they're,
they're um,

252
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,670
indicated in orange,
green and black.

253
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,720
And so the first thing that you can see
is that the hypothalamus is not one

254
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:57,040
thing.
It's a bunch of,

255
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,570
what do you call those?
Um,

256
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:02,860
Ganglia I think is the correct name for
the hypothalamic sub organs.

257
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,330
And so it's called a hypothalamus sort
of for convenience sake.

258
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,231
You know,
I mean,

259
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:13,180
you can identify it anatomically and it
might be a good shorthand for,

260
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,880
you know,
a rough description of the,

261
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,830
of the macro structure of the brain.

262
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,480
But of course the problem with the brain
is,

263
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:20,650
is that,
you know,

264
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:24,070
it's pattern one at this level and it's
pattern to at this level it's pattern

265
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,540
three at this level.
And you know,

266
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,770
you can go a long ways down before you
run out of complexity and a cell is an

267
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,320
unbelievably complicated thing and you
have,

268
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,350
God only knows how many of those things
in your brain I think,

269
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,190
I don't remember exactly what the latest
estimates are,

270
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:42,130
but it's in the hundreds of billions in
each of those cells is like,

271
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,830
it's complex as a,
as a factory in some,

272
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,140
like a really complex factory and it's
full.

273
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,920
They're full of these little molecular
machines that are doing things that are

274
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,960
so complicated and amazing.
You just can't believe it when you,

275
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,220
I've seen,
you know,

276
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:58,970
computer animations of some of these
structures and operation there.

277
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,730
The complexity of what they do,
you know,

278
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,490
to,
to take the DNA molecule apart and men

279
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,060
too.

280
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,230
And then to rebuild it little bit by
little bit and to do error correction at

281
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:11,540
the same time.
It's like I,

282
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,910
it just boggles the mind.
You can't,

283
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,250
you cannot,
I cannot see how you can possibly

284
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,260
account for that.
Using a straight,

285
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,140
sort of Newtonian deterministic model
of,

286
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,450
of like,
of clockwork behavior.

287
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,060
The stuff is so sophisticated,
you know,

288
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,300
it looks more like advanced robotics
than it does like the,

289
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:31,070
you know,
the interaction of tiny little

290
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,830
molecules.
There are molecules that work with the

291
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,910
DNA that can walk and as they walk,
they carry other molecules.

292
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:42,050
And not only can they think things walk,
they can walk over obstacles.

293
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,640
It's like,
and they're like,

294
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,070
they're like made out of 10 molecules.
It's like,

295
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,120
what's going on?
You know,

296
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:49,340
it just,
it's just beyond belief.

297
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,460
Okay.
So all of these little nucleus nuclei

298
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:53,930
are,
I think that's what they're called,

299
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,610
actually,
nuclei in the hypothalamus.

300
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,010
They're all doing slightly different
things.

301
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,530
So there's subserving while they're
radically different things,

302
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:02,480
although they have a commonality of
function.

303
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,400
And so roughly what you could say is
that one half of the hypothalamus is

304
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:12,290
devoted to popping up these little
subpersonalities that are devoted to

305
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,910
the,
the,

306
00:16:13,911 --> 00:16:15,320
uh,
um,

307
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,800
satiation,
the satisfaction of fundamental

308
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,410
biological requirements.
And so,

309
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,140
you know,
it's not obvious what a fundamental

310
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:27,860
biological requirement is because again,
that's a heuristic.

311
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,710
It's not a club.
It's not a category,

312
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,420
but we can agree it's a fuzzy category,
but we can agree on some of its

313
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,730
contents.
And so of course thirst and hunger and

314
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,790
the need to breathe would be in there.
And then we might also add pain and

315
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,200
sexual desire and um,
the need for play,

316
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:49,040
although that's a separate circuit and
it's not mediated by hypothalamic

317
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,320
structures.
There's a different circuit for play,

318
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,341
play,
slash,

319
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:53,174
affiliation.

320
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,900
So,
but roughly speaking,

321
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,110
the,
the what an animal basically chases and

322
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:07,361
requires on a day to day and week to
week basis is mediated in large part by

323
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:11,000
the hypothalamus.
And the hypothalamus is also a crucial

324
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,060
nexus in the brain for identifying
what's going on in the body and then

325
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,100
telling the brain what to do about it.
So for example,

326
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,980
the hypothalamus is the thing that makes
you hungry and the thing that makes you

327
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,110
thirsty.
And it does that because it monitors

328
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,650
levels of,
of,

329
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,070
of substances such as sugar in your
bloodstream.

330
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:29,990
And,
and also,

331
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,670
um,
you know,

332
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,790
the degree to which you're hydrated and
you know,

333
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:35,750
you can,
you can,

334
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,260
um,
sustain tiny little bits of damage to

335
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:42,260
the hypothalamus with unbelievably
extreme consequences.

336
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,150
So for example,
if you get unlucky,

337
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,450
you can develop hyperphosphatemia or I
don't remember the technical for it,

338
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:53,280
but uncontrollable thirst.
And so if that part of your hypothalamus

339
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,400
is damaged,
people just can't keep you away from

340
00:17:56,401 --> 00:17:57,170
water supplies.

341
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,060
He'll just drink and drink and drink and
drink and drink and drink and drink

342
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,280
until you drown and you can't control
it.

343
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,180
So the hypothalamus is no joke in
hyperphagic has the same thing except in

344
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,520
relationship to food.
So,

345
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,340
and on,
there have been reports of people who've

346
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,120
developed all,
I knew a guy in Montreal who,

347
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,880
who used to work at Harvard,
his name was Frank Irvin,

348
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,450
and he did some of the earliest studies
at,

349
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,450
in the world on the physiology of
violent crime.

350
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:27,180
And frank had identified,
um,

351
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,410
the role of epilepsy as a progenitor to
violent crimes.

352
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,400
And so,
you know,

353
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:35,250
the defensive rage circuit as part of
the hypothalamus.

354
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:36,720
And if you,
if you're unlucky,

355
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,470
you can have a particular form of
epilepsy that will activate the

356
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:43,130
defensive rage system.
I knew someone who had,

357
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,560
who had a seizure condition like that,
and then they get uncontrollably

358
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,064
aggressive.

359
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,160
Now this guy is quite an interesting
story.

360
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,400
So it first happened to him when he was
about 18 and he was out drinking in a

361
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,590
bar and alcohol lowers your seizure
threshold.

362
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,140
So it was out drinking in a bar and all
of a sudden he got up and tore his shirt

363
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:11,370
off and then his friends were coming.
Like he was in an aggressive stance and

364
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:15,030
backed into the corner and his friends
were coming close to him and he told

365
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,550
them,
go away or I'll hit you.

366
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,220
Now.
He was a very well socialized person.

367
00:19:20,221 --> 00:19:24,480
So I think what happened is that he went
into this defensive rage state,

368
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,990
but because he was so well socialized,
he could tell people to stay that way,

369
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,840
stay away from him.
But he couldn't stop himself from

370
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:33,240
hitting them and attacking them if they
got close enough.

371
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,960
So anyways,
I believe at that point he slapped a

372
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:40,170
police officer who came to rescue them
and they took him to the hospital.

373
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,170
And on the way there he hit his fingers
against the hood of the car and put

374
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,150
dents in it.
And then when he got up to the hospital,

375
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,430
now I don't remember the particulars of
this,

376
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:54,750
but he picked up a kidney bowl,
which is like an enamel covered steel

377
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,510
ball and twisted it in an in a figure
eight.

378
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:58,344
It's like,
yeah,

379
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,970
try that.
It's not so easy.

380
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,590
So in the next time it happened,
he was in another bar.

381
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,680
And so what Ha,
what the hypothesis was then was that

382
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,560
someone had spiked his alcohol with some
sort of drug gay,

383
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:13,560
but he went.
But that was never demonstrated.

384
00:20:13,561 --> 00:20:16,320
But he got off of all that because he
had no record.

385
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:20,040
He was a perfectly peaceful person.
And then the next time it happened,

386
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,460
he was in another bar and he did the
same thing.

387
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:24,360
He backed into corner,
ripped off his shirt.

388
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,130
And then he told me that when he was
looking,

389
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,400
he looked down the hallway and all he
could see was fire.

390
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,110
And then a police woman came to to get
him because of the bar phone,

391
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:38,580
the police and he hit her.
And then after that he had eeg testing,

392
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,800
which showed that he was susceptible to
seizures.

393
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,890
And so he swore off alcohol.
I've never had another drink and he's

394
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,290
like 35 now.
I never had another drink in his life.

395
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:50,140
And it never happened again.
But it's just a good example of of,

396
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,490
there was a kid at the University of
Texas at Austin about 30 years ago who

397
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,890
had seemed to have a perfectly
reasonable,

398
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,570
you know,
family life and so forth,

399
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,000
reasonable upbringing.
And he started to become increasingly

400
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,960
violent in his fantasies and he climbed
up onto a tower cause there was a high

401
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:09,100
tower at the University of Texas at
Austin and he took a high powered rifle

402
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,020
and I think he shot 16 people before
they finally got him.

403
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,390
And you know,
when they,

404
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,570
when they did an autopsy at a fast
growing tumor that was pressing on the

405
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:19,840
hypothalamus.
So the hypothalamus is no joke.

406
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:22,480
You know?
And for those of you whose introduction

407
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:26,020
to neuropsychology has made you assumed
that the Cortex is in control,

408
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,980
let me tell you,
the cortex is only con in control when

409
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,590
you,
when all of your other basic

410
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,970
requirements are satiated.
And since you're a modern person and you

411
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:40,690
live in luxury that's unparalleled in
the history of the world,

412
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,870
all of your fundamental biological sub
personalities are always satiated.

413
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:50,170
And so that's what you think you're
like,

414
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,240
but you're only like that because you've
beat,

415
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,820
you never been anywhere where you
weren't like that.

416
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,660
So,
so anyways,

417
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,570
now here's one of the things that's cool
about the hypothalamus.

418
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,450
So the first thing is,
is you have these different subsystems

419
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:07,240
say these different nuclear that are
responsible for these different

420
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,940
subpersonalities oriented towards
sexuality,

421
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:12,700
oriented towards hunger,
oriented towards Thurs,

422
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,400
oriented towards temperature regulation,
et Cetera.

423
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,400
You know,
and I think of them as sub personalities

424
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:22,120
because they have a viewpoint.
They want something that they want to go

425
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,520
somewhere,
they want to accomplish it efficiently,

426
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,800
and they have emotions that go along
with it.

427
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:27,461
So that,
you know,

428
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:31,300
if you're going for some water and you
drop a glass or somebody gets in your

429
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:32,530
way,
or the tap is working,

430
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:35,170
you're going to feel frustration and
anxiety and irritation.

431
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,500
So they come fully equipped with
emotions.

432
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,160
They have their own motor outputs,
which they basically prime.

433
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,920
And those would be the motor outputs
that are,

434
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,880
uh,
aggregations of habits that you have

435
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:53,450
been able to learn that have the eight
of you previously in your water

436
00:22:53,451 --> 00:22:55,180
searching behavior.
So for us,

437
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,014
that would be,
you know,

438
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,840
getting a glass out of the cupboard.
That's a gripping issue.

439
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:02,140
And then a transport issue.
And then you have to turn on the tap.

440
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,110
And so,
and Luria who a famous Russian

441
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:08,350
neuropsychologist called those things
kinetic melodies.

442
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,130
And so if you think about it from a p a
jetty and perspective and alluring in

443
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,720
perspective,
at the same time,

444
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,920
you can think that piaget talked about
how children put together basic,

445
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,950
you know,
motor they're not reflex is exactly

446
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:24,310
their complex sequences of what started
as reflexes.

447
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:26,530
And then those can be linked together in
a,

448
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:29,500
in a sort of,
in this sort of dance that you're always

449
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,830
doing with your body and each of those
little dances,

450
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,480
you know,
we think water seeking,

451
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,740
you're going to have a set of water
relevant dances that you can do that you

452
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:41,200
know your experiences taught you to
become expert at.

453
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,950
And when you get thirsty then knows or
liked the dis-inhibited.

454
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,010
That's my guess.
They're

455
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,120
disinhibited and prepared for execution,
you know,

456
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:53,720
and then the specifics of the
circumstance that you're in determine

457
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,750
which ones are deceiving is inhibited
enough to actually run.

458
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,710
It's like you're full of little machines
and they're all on there ready to go,

459
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,280
but they're all shut.
They're all like held in status in some

460
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,740
sense by cortical inhibition.
It's like,

461
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,350
I like to think of the brain,
sort of like a nuclear reactor,

462
00:24:09,351 --> 00:24:11,120
you know,
the core is really active,

463
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:13,670
it's on,
but then you have all these rods going

464
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:16,470
into the core to keep it from,
from uh,

465
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,850
going critical.
And the CORTEX is sort of like that in

466
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:21,790
relationship to the lower parts of the
brain.

467
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,970
Those parts of the brain,
man,

468
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,200
they're,
they're alive.

469
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,930
They're like,
they're like the titans of mythology.

470
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,520
You know,
they're sitting down there,

471
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,760
these fundamental forces and they're
ready to leap into action at,

472
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,870
at a moment's notice.

473
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,670
But the cortex basically keeps them
inhibited and it seems to do that.

474
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,750
So imagine that you have a vision of
your desired future.

475
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,990
Okay.
And then a vision of the transformation

476
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:49,991
stages that you're going to undertake to
move from where you are to that desired

477
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:51,531
future.
Okay.

478
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,640
So then what you're doing is you're
comparing your interpretation of the

479
00:24:55,641 --> 00:25:00,140
present to your interpretation of the
desired future.

480
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:02,960
And then as long as those two things
match,

481
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,670
which the hippocampus is the hippocampus
is the thing that's determining that,

482
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:11,960
it's the thing that's computing the
match between your fantasy of what you

483
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:14,840
want to happen with your fantasy about
what is happening.

484
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,960
As long as that matches,
then the hypothalamus,

485
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:22,070
the hippocampus basically and,
and we don't know exactly how this

486
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,110
works,
although it seems to work to some degree

487
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:26,630
through modulation of the reticular
activating system,

488
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,920
the match.

489
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,880
If the hippocampus matches what you want
with what's happening,

490
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:36,110
then all these other little sub systems
are basically shut off and if they,

491
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,690
if the hippocampus detects a mismatch,
which is when novelty occurs,

492
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,360
right,
rights like something went wrong,

493
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,170
then you get disinhibition of the
reticular activating system.

494
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,950
It's like you wake up and then
everything's primed for action and you

495
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:52,370
know that solves the problem of what you
should do when you don't know what to

496
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,860
do.
And that answer is you should get ready

497
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:58,190
to do everything.
You should be on alert and ready to

498
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:02,210
implement whatever actions,
whatever.

499
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,300
It's not even whatever actions,
it's more like you get,

500
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,540
you should be ready to implement
whatever subpersonalities the situation

501
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:14,090
seems to call for as soon as you're able
to identify what they are.

502
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,660
But otherwise it's sort of like an army
that's all of a sudden gone on alert.

503
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,340
You don't know who's going to be called
on,

504
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:22,520
but everybody should be ready.
That's a high stress situation.

505
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay,
so,

506
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,670
so part of the hypothalamus is,
let's say for the sake of argument,

507
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:31,550
it's popping up all these little
subpersonalities that have to do with

508
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:36,200
basic basic instincts.
The words are all wrong because they're

509
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:41,201
not like an instinct sounds like a drive
and people aren't driven.

510
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,000
We're not that simple.
We're much more flexible than that.

511
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,700
Even rats aren't driven.
There is a very,

512
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,840
um,
seminal experiment that was done at the

513
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,160
height of behaviorism.
So,

514
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,650
you know,
the idea with the behavior is perfectly

515
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:59,100
smart idea was that the way a rat
learned was it would start with a

516
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,250
reflex.
It sort of in the Piagetian sense.

517
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,650
And then you could teach it a new
routine,

518
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,800
which was an aggregation of little tiny
reflexes.

519
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:10,290
You could teach it a new routine by
rewarding it.

520
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,360
So let's say here's what you do with the
rat.

521
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,810
So you want to teach the route to climb
the ladder and go across it a little

522
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:19,390
ladder.
And so the rats sniffing around in the,

523
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,370
in the,
in the,

524
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,680
in that little rat cage,
and then it gets close to the ladder.

525
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:28,530
And so you give it a food palate and
then it hangs around close to the

526
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,900
ladder.
And just cause you've reinforced,

527
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:35,430
like you really reinforced the
manifestation of those micro behaviors

528
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:37,940
that are associated with the ladder.
And then maybe at some point the rod

529
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:40,590
puts one little paw up on the first
rung,

530
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:43,290
you give it a food pellet and then
pretty soon the rats going like this

531
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,050
fairly frequently.
And then the next thing that happens is

532
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,760
it puts two paws up there.
And you know,

533
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:50,760
if your patient using reward,
you can get that rap too.

534
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,250
You can get that damn rap to do damn
near anything.

535
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Skinner taught pigeons to navigate
guided missiles by maps in the Second

536
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:01,170
World War by packing,
which is,

537
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,750
they never did use them.
But really it's pretty impressive.

538
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:05,610
You know,
you think pigeons are stupid.

539
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,410
They're not stupid.
They can read maps,

540
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,750
which is pretty damn amazing.
So,

541
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,260
so the idea was that what the animal is
doing is chaining together deterministic

542
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,890
reflexes,
right?

543
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:20,310
But the thing about a deterministic
reflex is that it's not flexible,

544
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:22,830
right?
If it's a deterministic reflex,

545
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,480
it really is a drive action,
a initiates action be that initiates

546
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:28,320
action,
see,

547
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,370
and it's a fixed action pattern.
And some animals do seem to learn that

548
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,900
way.
So there's these little animals,

549
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,430
I think their moles that do this or
shrews shrews.

550
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,140
Let's say you teach a shrew to gill from
point a to b by a very

551
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,550
inefficient maze,
like route.

552
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,520
But the shrew could just walk straight
there.

553
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,350
But once he learns to do this,
but he can't figure out that he's going

554
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:58,200
from here to here.
Whereas if you train a right to do this,

555
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,110
the rat will figure out,
you know,

556
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:04,410
to hell with all this circuitous ness,
it's just going to go straight from

557
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:08,610
point a to point b.
And that was one of the first that that

558
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:13,611
finding was part of what indicated to
early neuro,

559
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,050
neuro psychological researchers that
animals produced a map of the

560
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,040
environment.
And you know,

561
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,310
in some sense partly what we're talking
about when we're talking about these

562
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:26,730
structures,
you know the A to b structure is a map.

563
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:29,310
That's another way you can look at it.
So anyways,

564
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,180
so you've got this rat and its behaviors
are all chained together,

565
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,770
right?
So I already told you,

566
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,480
you know,
I spoiled the story in some sense

567
00:29:36,481 --> 00:29:39,020
because I told you that the rat could
learn to take a shortcut.

568
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:44,030
But one of the earlier demonstrations of
the independence of rat learning from

569
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:47,830
the reflective conditioning was that,
so let's say you've trained to rap to

570
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,970
run down a maze.
Okay.

571
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:53,410
So hypothetically it's using its front
legs and his back legs and it's learning

572
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,660
to chain all that together.
Front leg,

573
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:56,620
back,
leg movement,

574
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:57,431
turned left,
front,

575
00:29:57,431 --> 00:29:59,050
leg back,
leg movement turned right,

576
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:00,040
et Cetera,
et cetera.

577
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,480
While so then,
well,

578
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:04,090
what if you put the little rap,
you tie up his back legs and you put

579
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:07,810
them in a little rap like wheel barrel.
So he's got wheels instead of legs.

580
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:11,410
It's like the route zooms through the
maze swell so much for the reflex

581
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:12,041
theory,
right?

582
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,041
Because obviously you didn't train the
rat to use a cart with its rear end

583
00:30:17,621 --> 00:30:19,660
stuck in,
hadn't figured that out all by itself.

584
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:21,190
So,
so,

585
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,570
so anyways,
there's,

586
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,830
there is a system in you that allows you
to chain reflexes together.

587
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,170
It's a very primordial learning system
and the behavior got that right.

588
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,810
It's fast,
very,

589
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:34,720
very fast because it requires do neuro
connections.

590
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:37,360
So there's some advantages to simple
learning,

591
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,900
but once,
once you get up into the higher,

592
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,010
even the moderately higher cortical and
subcortical functions,

593
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,210
you're past the point of a mirror
reflects chaining.

594
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,710
Okay?
So let's say for the sake of simplicity,

595
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:57,460
the hypothalamus says you need waters.
So your current state is you're thirsty

596
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:59,680
and your desired state.
As you get to go to the tap,

597
00:30:59,681 --> 00:31:01,480
you know,
you can feel your mouth dry and so

598
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,360
forth.
And then some fantasies about drinking,

599
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:07,660
some water start to come into your mind
and then all of a sudden you're kind of

600
00:31:07,661 --> 00:31:11,260
possessed by that.
And so it's starting to interfere with

601
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:13,990
your,
with your conscious goal directed

602
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:16,990
behavior at that point.
And finally it's insistent enough like

603
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:18,310
something knocking on the doors.

604
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,780
So you think,
man,

605
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:20,980
I'm,
I'm thirsty.

606
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:21,910
And,
and you know,

607
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,840
maybe you even think I'll work better if
I have something to drink.

608
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:30,520
And so you go off to the fountain and
then what your campus is doing is you've

609
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,880
got this little idea,
which is your desired future about how

610
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,400
this trip is supposed to go.
And then you're,

611
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,270
you're watching to see how the trip is
actually going.

612
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:44,620
But that's an interpretation to,
and then if there's a match between the

613
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,900
two,
the hippocampus just leaves you the hell

614
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:48,340
alone.
You don't get anxious,

615
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:50,710
you don't get,
you don't get knocked off the track.

616
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,220
You go there,
you have the water that satiates that

617
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:55,990
system,
that's a form of rewards,

618
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,450
satiation,
it's called consumer Tory reward.

619
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,710
And then that system disappears.
It goes back to the big dungeons from

620
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:04,960
which it emerged.
And then in all likelihood,

621
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:06,160
another one pops up.

622
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:11,550
Now it's an over simplification of human
behavior to assume that you just go from

623
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:15,820
one hypothalamic Lee mediated state to
another.

624
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,400
Although I would say that's what two
year olds do.

625
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,190
And in some sense that's what animals
do.

626
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,090
And you know the two year olds doing it
because that little creature hasn't gone

627
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:27,550
any more organized than hypothalamic,
you know,

628
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,680
so it's,
and you can see this if you watch two

629
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,150
year olds,
it's like they're laughing and then

630
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:33,790
they're crying and then they're hungry
and then they're hot and then they need

631
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,590
to go to the bathroom and then they want
to play.

632
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:40,591
It's like it's just one pure motivated
emotional state after another.

633
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,850
It's quite fun to watch.
And they're also relatively hyper

634
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,700
exploratory is as long as and playful,
you know?

635
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,660
But they're cycling through those things
all,

636
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,600
all the time.
So,

637
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,180
so,
so you,

638
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,830
you can't say that that's really what an
adult human gods.

639
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,030
And the reason for that is that
the problem with the,

640
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,440
with the pure,
with the reason that you need a cortex

641
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:07,010
and the other subcortical structures
that aren't hypothalamic is because the

642
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:12,011
world is too complex for those
primordial systems to solve the problems

643
00:33:12,111 --> 00:33:16,370
they're supposed to solve.
A in every possible situation,

644
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:21,580
be across multiple timeframes and see in
an environment that's consists of the

645
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:25,340
interactions between other very complex
beings.

646
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,120
So you know,
it's almost,

647
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,990
it's almost like an arms race of
complexity in some sense that's driven,

648
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:37,991
are driven our evolution.
The smarter you get in some sense,

649
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,980
the more variable you get.
And that's a problem because as I got

650
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:44,750
smarter say over the course of
evolution,

651
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:48,710
all you people got smarter too.
And so we're all competing and

652
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,260
cooperating with each other.
But the whole damn system is getting

653
00:33:51,261 --> 00:33:53,150
more and more and more and more complex.

654
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,710
So you have to grow a brain in order to
manage that and at least,

655
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,320
or you keep it simple.
Well we didn't keep it simple.

656
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,340
So we decided to grow a brain instead of
you,

657
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,840
I don't know if you know this,
but um,

658
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,230
you ever,
you've looked at a chimpanzee and feel

659
00:34:08,231 --> 00:34:10,220
like they don't look a lot like human
beings,

660
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,620
you know,
I mean there's obviously some things in

661
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,790
common,
you know,

662
00:34:13,791 --> 00:34:16,400
their hands are quite human and their
ears are quite human,

663
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:19,220
but you know,
their forehead comes down to about here

664
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,630
and uh,
they,

665
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:23,030
they're kind of shaped like this,
you know,

666
00:34:23,031 --> 00:34:26,900
they're a big round,
they've got a huge round body and

667
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,490
whereas a human being,
it's sort of like,

668
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,160
you know,
a stick with two sticks coming out of it

669
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:33,530
and two more sticks were really,
really thin.

670
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,340
Hardly any gut.
And whereas the chimpanzees like it's

671
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,200
intestinal structures are way,
way,

672
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:40,700
way,
way longer than ours.

673
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:44,000
And so it has to pack that into this
huge gut to the damn.

674
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,880
Chimpanzees sits around eight hours a
day chewing.

675
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,400
And the reason for that is it eats
leaves.

676
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:52,340
It's like you go out in the forest,
need leaves and see how damn many leaves

677
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:56,330
you have to eat before you feel full.
It's like all the chimp does is sit

678
00:34:56,331 --> 00:35:00,440
there and chew leaves and then it has
this huge guts so that it can extract

679
00:35:00,441 --> 00:35:03,530
some nourishment out of it.
We figured out how to solve that problem

680
00:35:03,531 --> 00:35:08,330
once we discovered fire and hunting
because within we could cook pays and

681
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:12,860
then we that enabled us at least in
principle to trade gut for brain,

682
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:16,460
which I think was a pretty pretty useful
trained all things considered,

683
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:18,110
although it's still might get us in
trouble.

684
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,890
So no,
cause the brain's a very energy hungry

685
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:24,110
organ and,
but we very,

686
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:28,100
very efficient food and it turns out
that cooked food is much more nutritious

687
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:30,950
from a caloric perspective than,
than raw food.

688
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,880
And so you can,
you can afford to sit around and develop

689
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,860
a brain if you've got high quality food.
Otherwise out there in the,

690
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,270
in the jungle chewing on leaves like an
idiot for like,

691
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,220
they're just about as bad as Pandis.
You know what?

692
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:46,140
You know why those things are damn near
extinct.

693
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,190
They used to be carnivores.
All they eat is bamboo shoots now that's

694
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,150
it.
Nothing else.

695
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,490
Bamboo shoots and they have no
nutrition.

696
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:58,491
So they have to like eat bamboo shoots
all day and then now and then the bamboo

697
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:01,200
crop fails and there aren't any shoots.
It's like,

698
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,270
well,
so much for the parent as it's like if

699
00:36:03,271 --> 00:36:06,950
an animal ever deserved to go extinct,
it was definitely the panda

700
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,530
hunt.
Something yet lazy bastards.

701
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,140
Anyways.
All right,

702
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:16,800
so now this,
I discovered this about the hypothalamus

703
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:20,340
when I was reading Larry Swanson is just
bloody well blew me away because,

704
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,590
well,
you'll see why at least in part.

705
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,650
So half of the Hypothalamus,
roughly speaking,

706
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:28,110
is sort,
sorta devoted to popping up these basic

707
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,100
primal subpersonalities,
the sorts of things that you share with

708
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:33,810
animals.
But then you might say,

709
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:35,580
ah,
what happens when one of those doesn't

710
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:37,740
work?
And the answer is,

711
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,870
well,
you get an anxiety response.

712
00:36:39,871 --> 00:36:44,820
Now the anxiety response is not mediated
by the hypothalamus and neither is pain.

713
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,680
So look,
if you're an idiot,

714
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:50,040
you're body tells you,
hurts you or tells you or scares you

715
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,190
basically.
But what's interesting about that is

716
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:57,630
that the pain systems and the anxiety
systems are not in the hypothalamus.

717
00:36:57,631 --> 00:37:01,230
They're separate systems.
Now the pain system is old,

718
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:02,100
old,
old.

719
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,530
It may be,
it's as old as the hypothalamus.

720
00:37:04,531 --> 00:37:08,550
It's way down there in your brain.
But the anxiety system is a lot newer

721
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,460
and you know,
that kind of makes sense because you can

722
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:14,970
imagine primordial organisms really
didn't stop until they ran into

723
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,680
something that was hurting them.

724
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,660
They couldn't think,
oh no,

725
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:20,970
I might run into something that will
hurt me.

726
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,110
Well you can't think that until roughly
you have an egg.

727
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,990
Della,
let's say,

728
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,890
cause the Amygdala seems to be at least
it's responsible for lots of things and

729
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:32,040
all these areas are interconnected.
But one of the things that seems to be

730
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,440
responsible for,
at least in part is anxiety.

731
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,890
And so when your hippocampus detects a
mismatch between what you want to have

732
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:43,860
happen and what is happening it,
this inhibits the reticular activating

733
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,780
system.
And one of the things it activates is

734
00:37:45,781 --> 00:37:48,030
the anxiety system.
The anxiety system says,

735
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,150
stop you in it.
You don't know where you are or what

736
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:53,430
you're doing.
And so you should quit before you get

737
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:55,860
into trouble.
And we don't like that feeling very

738
00:37:55,861 --> 00:37:57,270
much.
That freezes us.

739
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,650
But it's better than pain.
So you,

740
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,180
you feel anxiety so you don't have to
feel pain.

741
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,260
Now pain seems to occur when you
encounter a stimulus,

742
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,350
let's say a situation where the sensory,
the stimulus magnitude is sufficient to

743
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:18,120
damage those parts of you that are
encountering it.

744
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,610
So too bright,
a light to auto flame,

745
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,150
to cold,
a piece of metal to hot food,

746
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:25,650
whatever.
You know if it,

747
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:28,200
if it's of sufficient magnitude to
damage you,

748
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:31,980
you get a pain response out of that and
the pain response is supposed to teach

749
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:35,070
the part of you that moves forward not
to do that again.

750
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:39,310
The anxiety system responds to cues of
pain.

751
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,020
Now the pain system is pretty
complicated as well because frustration

752
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:48,700
is a pain like stimulus.
Disappointment is a pain like stimulus,

753
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,760
grief and loneliness are paying like
stimuli.

754
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:56,320
Depression is probably a pain condition.
So even though the pain system is quite

755
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:59,990
primordial,
it's grown up like a complex tree and it

756
00:38:59,991 --> 00:39:02,320
subsumes many different functions.

757
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,960
So,
but,

758
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,000
but it's,
it's still a very ancient system.

759
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:09,580
Whereas the [inaudible] system,
which is newer,

760
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,720
you've developed over time to tell you
what might hurt you so that you can

761
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,500
avoid contacting it.
And so you've got your hypothalamus and

762
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,270
it's telling you,
you know,

763
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,420
it's laying out these little
subpersonalities that are helping you

764
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,120
deal with the fundamental necessities of
the world.

765
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,010
The pain system is there to tell you
when you have encountered a situation

766
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:32,950
that is harmful,
the anxiety system is there to tell you

767
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,160
when you might be going to encounter
something harmful.

768
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:39,160
And that's the thing that's activated
when there's a mismatch,

769
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:41,380
right?
Because the mismatch says you don't know

770
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:42,940
where you're going,
where are you are,

771
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:45,700
where you're going,
and so you might get hurt.

772
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,090
Now the other thing that happens,
roughly speaking,

773
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,880
is that when the hippocampus disinhibit
the reticular activating system that

774
00:39:54,881 --> 00:39:58,390
turns the other half of the hypothalamus
on,

775
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,290
and this is quite cool because the other
half of the hypothalamus is the place

776
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:07,291
where the
ventral tegmental area is located in the

777
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:11,110
ventral tegmental area is the part of
the brain from which the dopaminergic

778
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:12,070
tracts emerge.

779
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:17,070
And those are the tracks that you use a
to explore and be to respond to cues of

780
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:23,320
conservatory reward.
So what that means in non technical

781
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,870
languages,
that when you encounter mismatch,

782
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,630
you get anxious,
which is what you should do.

783
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,760
You should stop,
something's wrong.

784
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,170
And then as long as nothing else happens
that's painful or threatening,

785
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,400
then that system starts to climatize.
Partly because you're looking around and

786
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:40,234
thinking,
right?

787
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,610
It's,
people often talk about this as

788
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:45,700
habituation.
That's a stupid idea.

789
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,130
It's habituation.
If you're a sea slug,

790
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,550
it's not habituation if you're a person,
except that very,

791
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:56,260
very primordial reflects like levels of
the nervous system at the higher order

792
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,720
levels that we're talking about.
It's learning.

793
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,660
And so if you stop and you're anxious,
what happens?

794
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:04,060
Well,
generally speaking,

795
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,250
you start thinking what the hell might
be going on?

796
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:09,310
And you're running through all of these
different theories and,

797
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:14,170
and part of the way that works is that
it's partly a consequence of state

798
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,070
dependent learning.

799
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,460
So if you,
if you're anxious,

800
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:22,960
you're going to be primed to remember
situations that you are anxious in

801
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:26,620
before and why should you do that?
And the reason for that is

802
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,680
anxious things that make you anxious is
at category.

803
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,860
It's actually a category.
Now we tend to think of categories as

804
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,110
something that exists in the objective
world,

805
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,080
but that is not how your brain
categorizes things.

806
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,380
You have to learn that really painfully
to make objective categorizations for as

807
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:50,480
far as your natural nervous system is
concerned.

808
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,230
All things that go bump in the night are
the same thing.

809
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,230
And what is that?
While it's some bloody horrible,

810
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,710
ah,
predatory Crocodilian dragon like

811
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:04,220
monster that hides under your bed and
comes out in bites you when you were

812
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,130
three.
I just ran a little paper today about

813
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,780
this kind of cat that lived back when we
were still figuring out how to use

814
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:16,430
spears and this was a particularly nasty
kind of cap and it preyed on us roughly

815
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:17,264
speaking.

816
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,160
And we didn't get eaten by too many cats
because cats really can't bite through

817
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,930
the skull so they could go for your
neck.

818
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:24,880
But that was,
you know,

819
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,640
they didn't necessarily kill you,
but this cat had a mouth that fit right

820
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:32,510
around your skull and it had two teeth
that went in here and two teeth that

821
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:37,540
went in here and it was a silent killer.
And there is evidence that even children

822
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:42,290
are capable of recognizing the motion
pattern of a predatory cat.

823
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,050
And one of the hypothesis is that we
still have,

824
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,870
you know,
all of our primate ancestors that didn't

825
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:50,960
get eaten by that particular cap,
we're pretty damn good at detecting

826
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:52,880
cats,
at least have that type.

827
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:53,860
And we seem to have,

828
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,310
what would you say,
conserve that ability at least to some

829
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:02,190
degree.
So you think about a category,

830
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:04,050
it's like,
you know,

831
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:06,480
you might think,
well there's fish and there's birds and

832
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:08,600
there's,
and there's mammals and there's this

833
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:10,530
reptiles and you know,
those are,

834
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,890
those are linnaean classifications.
They're based in some sense on,

835
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,330
on evolutionary divergence and,
and where they're not on morphology on

836
00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:22,380
the way the animals put together.
Who Cares about that?

837
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:27,650
Things that eat you.
That's a category and you need,

838
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:30,690
you need that category.
And then the other category is also

839
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,540
things that mighty you.
So things that eat you,

840
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:36,180
you know,
those are things that can hurt you and

841
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:38,460
things that you,
that mighty you are things you haven't

842
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:42,300
classified yet but might be dangerous.
And so that's your natural,

843
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:44,790
your brain's natural category one of
them.

844
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,960
And then you might think,
well,

845
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:50,190
if that's the natural category C,
that's the sort of thing that,

846
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:55,440
um,
the guy who wrote the visual,

847
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,350
an ecological approach to visual
perception,

848
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,720
he talked about as an affordance,
that was the word I couldn't remember

849
00:44:03,721 --> 00:44:06,870
last week.
So an affordance is something whose

850
00:44:06,871 --> 00:44:10,650
meaning you instantly perceived.
And so you might say,

851
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,670
well,
no,

852
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,031
no,
no,

853
00:44:12,031 --> 00:44:16,020
you see a cat and then you infer that it
might eat you.

854
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:16,571
It's like,
no,

855
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:16,830
no,
no,

856
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,320
no.
You see something that might eat you and

857
00:44:19,321 --> 00:44:21,450
then you might be able to figure out
that it's a calf,

858
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:23,340
but it's,
that might eat you,

859
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:25,710
that you see first,
not the damn cat.

860
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,810
And so this is,
this is a fascinating phenomenon.

861
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,030
It it,
it suggests like the hi to Gary Ins have

862
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:40,040
proposed that what you perceive first in
the world is meanings and out of the

863
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,920
meanings you extract objects.
It's not the other way around.

864
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,250
And so if you look at the way your brain
is organized,

865
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,060
that's how it works folks.
Because the more primordial your brain

866
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:53,630
system is,
which means the more ancient it is,

867
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,890
the mortar tied it is into your
survival.

868
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,040
The more it's perception is action
predicated,

869
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,720
you know?
So for example,

870
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:03,150
if you hear a loud noise behind you,
when you startle,

871
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,810
that's your response while you're going
into a crouch.

872
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,080
That would make it difficult for a tiger
to bite the front of your neck.

873
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,810
And you do that.
Like that's big man,

874
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:16,200
that's before your it's way before
you're thinking.

875
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,990
It's before you're perceiving.
You know,

876
00:45:18,991 --> 00:45:22,020
consciously you're not getting images or
sounds at that point,

877
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,710
it's so quick.
And that's a,

878
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:27,990
that's a category.
Things that make you go like this and

879
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,430
that's a good category.
Now,

880
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,210
the reason I'm making such a case about
that categories,

881
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,750
that's one of the mythological
categories is things that go bump in the

882
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,790
night.
And then one of the things that

883
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:41,070
primordial people were trying to figure
out is,

884
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,160
you know,
you could take up any old animal is

885
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:48,300
thinking as figuring out how to escape
from a Predator that isn't what human

886
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:49,620
beings wanting to figure out.

887
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,210
Not once we were able to abstract.
What we wanted to do instead was to

888
00:45:54,211 --> 00:45:58,290
figure out how to escape from the class
of all things that could eat you.

889
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,040
Not just any particular old thing,
but all of them at once.

890
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,270
That's the advantage to categorization.
Can we arrange things so that nothing

891
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:07,650
can eat us?
Well?

892
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:09,510
How do you go about doing that?
Well,

893
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,580
believe me,
we've been working on that problem for a

894
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:12,181
very,
very,

895
00:46:12,181 --> 00:46:15,120
very long time and one of the answers we
came up with,

896
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:19,290
we'll get into this later,
is the idea of sacrifice and sacrifice

897
00:46:19,291 --> 00:46:20,880
is a very,
very ancient idea.

898
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:23,100
But I'll,
I'll just give you a bit of a preview.

899
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,680
It took me like 20 years to figure this
out.

900
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,220
Human beings discovered sacrifice a long
time ago and they acted it out before

901
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:33,690
they understood it.
Okay?

902
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,150
Because we act out all sorts of things
before we understand it.

903
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,560
And idea is sort of,
well,

904
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:40,860
you can make a bargain with God.
You might say,

905
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:42,090
well what's God?
Well we'll,

906
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,420
we'll approach that problem later.
It's a very complicated problem.

907
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,450
But one thing you could think of God as
is God is the anthropomorphic

908
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:56,250
representation of the entire social
structure across time.

909
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,820
So you might say,
well God will reward you if you behave

910
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:01,620
property.
But what does that mean?

911
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,540
Well,
imagine that you could conceive of

912
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:07,310
everyone who wasn't you as one met a
person.

913
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:10,650
Okay,
imagine that that met a person is gone

914
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,900
and you can make a deal with that thing.
You can say,

915
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:13,920
well,
if you behave,

916
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,880
if I behave properly,
that mess have being will respond,

917
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:19,800
pause property to me in the future.

918
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,090
It's like it's true,
right?

919
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,840
You know that if you make a promise to
someone and you keep it,

920
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:27,510
then something good is likely to happen
to you in the future.

921
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,660
So that was one way that God,
that's God the father derivation.

922
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:33,700
It's,
it's far more complicated than that.

923
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:35,530
But that's,
that's not a bad point.

924
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:39,880
And we kind of figured out that we could
bargain with it across time and that

925
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:43,930
that would work.
So I read a really interesting paper by

926
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:46,990
someone who's actually a former student
of mine is iem sheriff.

927
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:51,130
And he analyzed the relationship between
criminal behavior and belief in hell

928
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:54,790
across a whole set of countries.
I don't know when it was an exhaustive,

929
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,770
you know,
if it was an exhaustive analysis,

930
00:47:56,771 --> 00:48:00,190
correlational analysis,
it's way more peaceful in countries

931
00:48:00,191 --> 00:48:04,390
where people believe in hell.
So you know and you think,

932
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:05,710
well should you believe in hell?

933
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,220
It's like okay,
well yes and no.

934
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,830
You know,
atheist arguments aside,

935
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:15,550
we're not even going to bother with them
cause they're kind of moronic so well

936
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,580
the idea here is that there are certain
views,

937
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:23,610
there are certain action patterns that
if you undertake you will be viciously

938
00:48:23,711 --> 00:48:25,450
punished in the future.
It's like,

939
00:48:25,451 --> 00:48:26,500
yeah,
that's going to happen.

940
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:30,040
You try lying to everyone that you meet
and you just see how well you do over a

941
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:31,180
20 year period,
man,

942
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,480
you're going to be in such trouble by
the end of that 20 year period.

943
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:39,040
That hell will be the only accurate way
to describe where you're situated.

944
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,400
So it's no joke,
these are real things.

945
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:44,650
And people came up with these ideas for
a reason.

946
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,300
Now Hell isn't only where other people
put you if you're bad,

947
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,490
it's a lot more profound,
the concept of that.

948
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,780
But that's not a bad start.

949
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:55,870
So anyways,
the sacrificial notion was something

950
00:48:55,871 --> 00:49:00,340
like we could not do what we want to do
right now and do something else and

951
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,840
that'll make things better in the
future.

952
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,490
I mean,
think about that people,

953
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,450
that's the most brilliant idea human
beings ever came up with.

954
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,690
There's this old story,
which is probably not true about how to

955
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:13,360
catch a monkey.
So you get this jar,

956
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,660
it's got a pretty thin neck,
just big enough for a monkey to put his

957
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:20,620
hand in.
And then you fill in with things monkeys

958
00:49:20,621 --> 00:49:23,140
like deed,
say like let's say hard candy just for

959
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:25,720
the sake of argument.
So you put that out there and then the

960
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,480
monkey goes in and sticks his hand in
and grabs a bunch of candidate,

961
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,770
can't get his damn handout because it's
only big enough for an input is,

962
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,840
and then so then you can just go pick up
the monkey.

963
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:35,711
It's like,
well,

964
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:39,010
what's the problem with the monkey?
It can't sacrifice.

965
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:44,170
It won't sacrifice its grip on the damn
candy for it's future existence.

966
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:47,050
It's like that's what your parents had
been teaching you ever since you were

967
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:50,800
little kids,
let go of the candy so that you can live

968
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,380
and you know,
that's delay of gratification,

969
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:54,970
right?
That's conscientiousness,

970
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:57,880
man.
That's the discovery of time and its

971
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:01,630
relationship to the social environment.
It's so brilliant,

972
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,850
you know?
And part of what people were trying to

973
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:06,730
figure out when they were developing
these rituals of sacrifices.

974
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:09,610
Okay.
So you think about society as a metta

975
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,010
person.
It's usually represented as male by the

976
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:13,360
way,
but not always.

977
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:18,361
It depends on the circumstances.
So what is this a person want?

978
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,440
What you've got to kind of figure that
out.

979
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,710
Partly what it wants is don't eat all
the damn grain today.

980
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,920
Save some for next year.
Right plan.

981
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:32,050
Act as if the future exists as part of
the social contract.

982
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,180
God,
that's such a discovery now.

983
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,830
You know it's,
it's not,

984
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:42,010
it's only people who figured that out.
I mean squirrels have kind of it in some

985
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,940
sense because they store up knots,
but you know,

986
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:45,860
I mean the squirrels and squirrels are
smart.

987
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,860
They just kind of got the inkling of it,
you know?

988
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,890
And I think what squirrels do is they
eat all the nuts they can possibly eat

989
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,050
right now and then they store the rest
of them.

990
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,930
It wouldn't go hungry to store nuts for
the future,

991
00:50:56,931 --> 00:50:59,810
but human beings will do that.
Don't eat the seed grain.

992
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,870
Right?
Cause then you're going to die next

993
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:03,381
year.
Okay.

994
00:51:03,381 --> 00:51:06,170
So all right,
so back to the hypothalamus.

995
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:11,410
Now you're doing something you want to
do and you're tracking how that's going.

996
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,370
Both of those are hypotheses by the way.
And all of a sudden something happens

997
00:51:16,371 --> 00:51:18,500
that you don't want to have happen.
Like you live in Flint,

998
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:21,410
Michigan for example.
And so you decided to go have some water

999
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:24,020
and it turns out it's not water at all.
It's land.

1000
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,940
I don't know if you guys know about
that,

1001
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:26,990
but it's quite,
it's quite,

1002
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:30,590
you know,
it's just the sort of thing that makes

1003
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:32,090
your jaw drops.
So you know,

1004
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,240
the state is in big trouble,
Michigan and so they appointed an

1005
00:51:37,251 --> 00:51:42,140
auditor to control finances.
I believe at the state level might have

1006
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,970
only been at a city level but doesn't
matter,

1007
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:47,090
let's say the state level.
So the auditor was looking for ways to

1008
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:52,091
save money and one way they decided to
save money was to re to hook up Flint

1009
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:55,520
Michigan's water supply to a river
instead of to the Great Lake,

1010
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:56,900
which is what it's right beside.

1011
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,770
It turns out since flint was at an
industrial center for forever,

1012
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:05,360
that the water's just plum full of lead.
So now they have like 50,000 lead

1013
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:07,430
poisoned people living in Flint,
Michigan.

1014
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:11,810
That is not a good thing.
Led lowers your Iq rapidly and it makes

1015
00:52:11,811 --> 00:52:16,811
you violent.
So it's for the $10,000 they saved,

1016
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:19,730
they probably cost themselves half a
million dollars per person.

1017
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,320
It wasn't actually that there was lead
in the water,

1018
00:52:22,321 --> 00:52:24,350
it's that the water was more acidic.
Oh,

1019
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:26,150
it took the lead out of the pipes.
Yeah.

1020
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,013
Okay,
okay.

1021
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:27,710
Right,
right.

1022
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:28,910
Good point.
Good point.

1023
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,090
Well,
I'm not here to complain about Michigan

1024
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:35,000
politicians,
but the point is is that just because

1025
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:36,830
you think you're out for a drink of
water,

1026
00:52:36,831 --> 00:52:40,900
that does not necessarily mean that's
what's going on and that's why I said

1027
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,740
you're comparing your vision of the
future to what you think is going on

1028
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:46,520
right now.

1029
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,820
Now,
if you read the the neuropsychologists

1030
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:52,490
like vinegar Nova in Socal,
often Jeffrey Gray,

1031
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,270
they're basically behaviorists.
And so what they tell you is this,

1032
00:52:56,271 --> 00:53:00,290
and this is different.
What they tell you is that you have this

1033
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:03,770
little expectancy map.
It's like the map the rat has of his

1034
00:53:03,771 --> 00:53:06,260
surroundings.
It's a spacial temporal map.

1035
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,710
And so when you're doing something,
you expect a certain outcome.

1036
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:11,210
Okay?
And then what?

1037
00:53:11,211 --> 00:53:14,570
You compare that to his reality as it
unfolds.

1038
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:17,870
Okay?
So you could say you've got this map and

1039
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:21,890
then stimuli appeared to you,
and those are objectively real.

1040
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:22,670
It's like,
no,

1041
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,380
that's wrong.
It's wrong.

1042
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:26,820
You're,
it's interpretation everywhere.

1043
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,570
You think you know what's going on right
now and you think you know what you

1044
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:32,520
want.
And the reason I'm making such a big

1045
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,900
deal out of this is because look,
if you're a rat and you're going about

1046
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:39,000
your business and something you don't
want happens,

1047
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,210
according to the gray behaviors model,
you have to revamp your map,

1048
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:46,180
your expectancy map.

1049
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,350
But according to the bottle that I'm
proposing,

1050
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,920
it's way worse than that because you
don't know where the damn mirror is.

1051
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,380
It might be in your map of what you
want,

1052
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:57,600
not what you expect.
That's a different thing.

1053
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,090
But it also might be in the map you have
that,

1054
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:05,040
that's of the present.
So it's not just the map that you have,

1055
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:07,500
it's a prediction of your actions that's
at fault.

1056
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:10,290
It could easily be the way that you're
construing the World Right now.

1057
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,110
And it could be error at any level of
behavior.

1058
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:16,020
And so what it means is that when an
anomaly you'll occurs,

1059
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,750
it spreads doubt through the entire
hierarchy that we were describing,

1060
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,310
including the future and the present and
even the past.

1061
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,720
And you,
you know this,

1062
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:30,990
you know this perfectly well,
you can see it when you encounter a

1063
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:35,600
complex and normally so a complex
anomaly would be you have a longterm

1064
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:37,710
relationship and you get betrayed.

1065
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,920
Okay?
And so betrayed means you've trusted

1066
00:54:40,921 --> 00:54:45,921
someone and they've enticed you to do so
and then they exploit that trust and her

1067
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:50,730
view for Dante that betrayers were in
the lowest circle of hell.

1068
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,720
So it's a particularly nasty thing to do
to people because in some,

1069
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,760
you know,
if you think about trust as the

1070
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:58,950
precondition for interpersonal
relationships,

1071
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,130
which it is,
then if someone acts towards you in a

1072
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:06,930
way that violates your trust in trust,
they've done you the worst disservice

1073
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,060
that someone could possibly be done.
Okay?

1074
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:10,860
So you get betrayed.
All right,

1075
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:12,480
so bang,
that's an anomaly.

1076
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:15,300
What does it imply?
Well,

1077
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,570
that's the wrong question.
The right question is what doesn't it

1078
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:22,710
imply?
It implies that you just don't have the

1079
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,400
foggiest notion of what you're doing or
what human beings are like.

1080
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,990
You know?
And that's,

1081
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,420
especially if it's a particularly
vicious betrayal,

1082
00:55:30,421 --> 00:55:32,940
maybe you know,
you've been suckered by a psychopath.

1083
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:34,140
It's like,
okay,

1084
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,870
update your model and account for that.
Good luck.

1085
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,680
Especially if you're naive,
because the probability that you'll be

1086
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:45,630
able to reach down into the depths far
enough to come up with a coherent

1087
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,240
explanation for why someone would do
that is very,

1088
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,590
very low.
You know?

1089
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:52,920
And what I've discovered in my clinical
practice is that if you get betrayed

1090
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,310
badly enough,
the only language that you can use to

1091
00:55:56,311 --> 00:56:01,170
describe it is fundamentally religious.
At some points of of betrayal,

1092
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,680
it's good versus evil.
It's malevolence and them.

1093
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:08,340
It's the malevolence that really
traumatizes people.

1094
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,400
It's the,
it's the fact that that person was out

1095
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,570
to hurt you.
It's like,

1096
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,380
oh,
well,

1097
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,510
what's a human being like when they're
capable of that?

1098
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,340
It's like,
it's an age old question.

1099
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,280
Now I'll tell you something is weird and
interesting.

1100
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:24,280
So there's this old idea in genesis,
the first idea,

1101
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,020
one of the first ideas in genesis is you
know that God made people a paradise to

1102
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:29,830
live in.

1103
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:32,350
Okay?
So let's just be wild about this for a

1104
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,220
moment and assume that you're a little
model when it's going well is a little

1105
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:37,060
paradise,
right?

1106
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:39,160
It's like the world's turning out the
way you want it to,

1107
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,700
but there's a snake in there somewhere
and that means,

1108
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,830
well,
why is there a snake?

1109
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:46,810
Well,
because there's a bunch of things you're

1110
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,360
not paying attention to while you're
going about your business,

1111
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,350
right?
In fact,

1112
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:52,990
there's almost an infinite number of
things that you're not paying attention

1113
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,420
to,
and the problem is one of those infinite

1114
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:57,400
number of things that you're not paying
attention to.

1115
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:01,840
Consumers shift on you all of a sudden,
and so there's always a snake in the

1116
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,720
garden and then you have to figure out
what to do with it.

1117
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,090
The thing is,
if you interact with the snake,

1118
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:10,660
you get more conscious,
but the problem with that is you lose

1119
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,830
your little paradise.

1120
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,530
Okay,
well it's worse than that because that

1121
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,680
story is really old,
but we have no idea how old it is.

1122
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:23,010
It's disseminated all over the world or
it emerged independently in different

1123
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:24,610
places.
We don't really know.

1124
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,200
But in any case,
it doesn't matter.

1125
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,820
It's a fundamental enough story.
Tree plus snake plus people that no

1126
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:33,940
matter where you go with,
some people have tree snake stories.

1127
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,460
So,
and I think that's because we lived in

1128
00:57:36,461 --> 00:57:40,600
trees for like 30 million years and we
got eaten by an awful lot of snakes.

1129
00:57:40,601 --> 00:57:41,680
And so,
you know,

1130
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:45,970
it's a story that really appeals to us.
And every bloody science fiction movie

1131
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:47,380
you go to,
most of the time,

1132
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,290
if the aliens are bad,
they're always reptilian.

1133
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,620
You know,
it's like you don't get Furry Little

1134
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,300
Koala aliens that are chasing you
around.

1135
00:57:55,301 --> 00:57:57,280
It's like,
it's like the ones that alien,

1136
00:57:57,281 --> 00:58:00,070
you know,
they're a reptile inside a reptile,

1137
00:58:00,071 --> 00:58:02,860
they're nasty beasts and they come out
inside of you even,

1138
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:05,800
you know,
which is another symbolic idea.

1139
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:06,881
So,
okay,

1140
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:10,300
so you've got,
you've always got the damn snake and

1141
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,420
it's popping out to all the time and
there's nothing you can do about it

1142
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:16,450
except get ready to deal with snakes.
No getting rid of them.

1143
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:19,570
So that's the first lesson.
You're not getting rid of the damn

1144
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:22,240
snakes.
You better learn to deal with them.

1145
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,650
Then the next question is,
what is the worst possible snake?

1146
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,570
Now,
one of the things that happened in

1147
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:31,360
Christianity,
and this was influenced in part by

1148
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:36,010
Zoroastrianism,
was the idea of almost an independent

1149
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,330
eval arose.
You know,

1150
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:38,800
in,
in fact there was a branch of

1151
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:43,801
Christianity called Mannequin that
construed the world as a battle between

1152
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:46,960
good and evil,
where good and evil had equal reality

1153
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,860
and they were in this eternal battle.
Now that got wiped out by,

1154
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,750
uh,
by the standard Christian theory,

1155
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,840
that evil is actually just the absence
of good,

1156
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,660
which anyways,
you can have a big debate about that and

1157
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,070
people have for thousands of years.

1158
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,870
But as Christianity developed,
there's this weird mythology that grew

1159
00:59:04,871 --> 00:59:09,871
up around the weird myth in genesis and
the weird mythology was that the snake

1160
00:59:09,971 --> 00:59:14,650
in the garden of Eden was also sake.
And then he's the king of all evil.

1161
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:15,520
It's like,
okay,

1162
00:59:15,521 --> 00:59:17,680
what does that mean?
It's pretty straight forward.

1163
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,770
What's the worst predator?
Well,

1164
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:22,670
that's easy.
The worst predators,

1165
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:26,450
a human being.
And so the worst of all possible snakes

1166
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:30,740
is the most malevolent possible being.
And that's exactly right.

1167
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,690
And that's why that association was
made.

1168
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:35,300
It's so,
and it's so interesting because it took

1169
00:59:35,301 --> 00:59:38,150
people like thousands of years to make
that association,

1170
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,430
you know?
And it wasn't really put together well

1171
00:59:40,431 --> 00:59:43,160
until Milton formalized it in paradise
lost.

1172
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:46,970
And so it's like we kind of observe this
in action.

1173
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,860
You know,
that there were bad people.

1174
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,140
Okay,
so bad is a category.

1175
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:55,910
But what is bad entail while mythologies
of eval center in on the central

1176
00:59:55,911 --> 00:59:58,750
features of what constitutes bad,
you know,

1177
00:59:58,751 --> 01:00:01,100
and carnivorous might be one of the
things.

1178
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,130
Money malevolent out to hurt,
right?

1179
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,940
Be trail lying.
All the cardinal you could take of the

1180
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:08,751
cardinal.
Great.

1181
01:00:08,751 --> 01:00:13,340
Since that's the worst snake,
while it's a psychologize aviation of

1182
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,050
the idea of the Predator.
And you know,

1183
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:20,051
it's even more sophisticated than that
because one branch of that theory is

1184
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:24,970
that the worst Predator is the evil
force outside of you.

1185
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:29,000
But the next branch of that is that the
worst proud Predator is the evil force

1186
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,710
within you.
Yeah,

1187
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:33,110
well that's when it gets really
psychologized we take,

1188
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:34,340
well that's,
you know,

1189
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:36,800
is that superstition?
It's like,

1190
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,510
hey,
that's not superstition,

1191
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,360
boys and girls.
It's a lot more intelligent than that.

1192
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,440
It's the most sophisticated theory of
the way things work that we have and

1193
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,680
it's correct.
Now what that means from a metaphysical

1194
01:00:48,681 --> 01:00:51,410
perspective.
We're not going to talk about that

1195
01:00:51,411 --> 01:00:54,260
because we can't,
but we can certainly talk about what it

1196
01:00:54,261 --> 01:00:56,780
means in practical Darwinian terms.

1197
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,800
You better know what's after you.
And the worst thing that can possibly be

1198
01:01:00,801 --> 01:01:05,120
after you is a fully motivated and
completely malevolent human being.

1199
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,020
It's like,
you know,

1200
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,110
skull crushing cats be damned.
You know,

1201
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,320
all they want to do is eat you.
They're not going to torture you.

1202
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:15,320
Whereas if you fall into the hands of
the wrong human being,

1203
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:17,450
man,
you could be an excruciating pain for

1204
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:21,380
the next 20 years.
So people are very imaginative when they

1205
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:25,640
figure out how to hurt someone and they
can keep it up for a long time and

1206
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,400
they're fully motivated to do so under
some conditions.

1207
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,850
And so you really got to watch out for
that.

1208
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,890
So,
all right,

1209
01:01:33,891 --> 01:01:38,630
so back to the hypothalamus.
So when you have a mismatch between what

1210
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:43,520
you desire and what you're after,
then the hippocampus says,

1211
01:01:43,790 --> 01:01:45,620
oh,
we don't know where we are.

1212
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:48,290
That's what it says.
You no longer know where you are.

1213
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,760
Okay,
what should you do when you don't know

1214
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:52,700
where you are?
You should stop moving and then you

1215
01:01:52,701 --> 01:01:54,980
should,
well then what?

1216
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:56,900
They should prepare to do a lot of
things.

1217
01:01:56,901 --> 01:01:57,740
Okay.
Then one,

1218
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,750
then you should explore.
Well,

1219
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,730
that's where the other half of the
hypothalamus comes in.

1220
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,110
That dopaminergic circuit that mediates
positive emotion,

1221
01:02:06,111 --> 01:02:08,120
right?
Almost all the positive emotion that you

1222
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:10,310
experience in your life,
the kind you like,

1223
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,220
which is hope and curiosity and
expectation and,

1224
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,230
and surprise.
And,

1225
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,440
and,
and that's all mediated by the

1226
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:22,200
dopaminergic systems.
It's a major league contributor to your,

1227
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,220
to the totality of your being,
especially in a positive direction

1228
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,150
that's rooted in the hypothalamus.
And so what that means is that it's

1229
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:33,360
quite cool.
You got your fundamental motivations,

1230
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,000
you know,
your basic blood biological motivations.

1231
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,110
Bang,
they fail.

1232
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,640
What happens?
Anxiety.

1233
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:43,200
That's a newer system and exploration.
That's an older system.

1234
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,140
That damn exploratory system has been
there forever.

1235
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,400
Now if you look at classic hero
mythology,

1236
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:55,401
which we're going to do in great detail,
what you see is that the typical myth of

1237
01:02:56,011 --> 01:03:01,011
it of humanity is we live in a place,
we'll say we have to live in a place and

1238
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:04,440
the place is doing quite nicely.
Thank you very much.

1239
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,730
It's like the hobbits and,
and uh,

1240
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,840
Frodo,
right?

1241
01:03:09,841 --> 01:03:11,190
The first one,
the Lord for the,

1242
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:12,300
uh,
what was it called?

1243
01:03:12,301 --> 01:03:13,650
The hobbit.
The hobbit.

1244
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:15,330
Okay,
so you've got a little shy or they're

1245
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:16,890
right.
It's all peaceful.

1246
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:19,770
It's full of these little people who are
a little on the arrogant side.

1247
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:22,470
They're kind of dopey.
They have no idea what the hell is going

1248
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:24,690
on in the outside world.
But they think that's okay.

1249
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,291
They think,
you know,

1250
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:26,850
just,
you know,

1251
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,390
peculiar people are concerned about that
sort of thing and they got their little

1252
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,430
happy paradise going.
They live a long time,

1253
01:03:33,431 --> 01:03:34,410
they eat a lot,
you know,

1254
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:36,120
they party a lot.
Um,

1255
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,170
unbeknownst to them,
which is very interesting feature of the

1256
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:42,240
story.
The only reason they have any peace at

1257
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:45,150
all,
it's because they are descendants of old

1258
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:48,330
kings continually patrolling the
borders.

1259
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:51,450
Right.
Those are the striders Eric Gordon,

1260
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:55,410
he's the member of the race of old kings
who patrols the borders.

1261
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,380
Well those are,
those are ancestral figures.

1262
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,750
It's like you can all sit here,
your little happy paradise,

1263
01:04:00,751 --> 01:04:05,670
but the only reason you can do it is
because the sons of great kings have put

1264
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:10,270
borders around your kingdom and you can
think it's funny cause in the Harbutt

1265
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:13,690
that hobbits basically despise strider.
You're like,

1266
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:15,600
they're very,
very suspicious of him.

1267
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,170
He's kind of dirty and dusty and he
looks like he's been banged around all

1268
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:20,850
over the world.
He sort of like a trout.

1269
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,310
It's like they don't know.
He's the son of a great king.

1270
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,320
Good thing for them that he is.
However,

1271
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,840
okay.
So then you've got the little Shyer and

1272
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:30,810
what happens?
Evil things are stirring.

1273
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,490
And what is it?
Well,

1274
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:35,790
fundamentally it's a great dragon.
Well that's a snake,

1275
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:37,590
except it's like medicine snake.
You know,

1276
01:04:37,591 --> 01:04:38,610
it's,
it's,

1277
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:42,510
it's snake with fire.
And you can be sure that fire was not

1278
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:45,330
only one of our greatest allies,
but one of our greatest enemies,

1279
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:47,760
especially when we lived on the belt in
Africa.

1280
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:50,460
Cause that thing would burn now in that,
you know,

1281
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:54,030
and so get the hell away from that and
on.

1282
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,130
Well,
so anyways,

1283
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,610
so one hobbit who's woken up by a
wizard,

1284
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,730
right?
The wizard is a symbol of the self from

1285
01:05:02,731 --> 01:05:05,670
the union perspective.
So there's one hobbit who's a little bit

1286
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,980
more creative and exploratory than the
rest.

1287
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:09,540
And everybody has little respect for
him,

1288
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,190
but they think he's pretty damn
peculiar.

1289
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,670
He decides that he's going to under the
tutelage of the wizard,

1290
01:05:14,671 --> 01:05:19,030
he's going to go check out this dragon.
So he leaves the borders and he goes out

1291
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,600
into that unknown.
And then the rest of it is an adventure.

1292
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,310
And one of the things that's very
interesting,

1293
01:05:24,311 --> 01:05:27,190
again,
from a union perspective is that what is

1294
01:05:27,310 --> 01:05:30,250
the hobbit have to become in order to
conquer the Dragon?

1295
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:33,503
A thief.

1296
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,110
Now that's pretty weird.
A,

1297
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:36,160
because you'd think,
hey man,

1298
01:05:36,161 --> 01:05:38,350
this guy's out to be a hero,
so you should be a hero.

1299
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,184
It's like,
no,

1300
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:42,400
he turns into a thief.
Why?

1301
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,260
Well,
it's because if you're going to conquer

1302
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:47,830
a dragon,
you better be a hell of a lot tougher

1303
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:51,850
than you are naive.
And so partly what happens is that for

1304
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:55,600
the hobbit to muster up the forces that
are necessary for him to confront

1305
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:57,880
something,
that that is that fundamental,

1306
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,240
he has to transcend his coward.
What would you call it?

1307
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,730
The,
the cowardice that he describes as

1308
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:08,140
morality.
Okay,

1309
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:09,550
so Nisha,
for example,

1310
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,560
each is often viewed as a critic,
critic,

1311
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,040
critic of morality.
It's like that's not true.

1312
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:18,310
What?
Because nature identifies morality with

1313
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:20,320
cowardice,
but that's not what he does.

1314
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:22,030
What to says is this.

1315
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,090
If you're too afraid to do something so
you won't do it,

1316
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:32,230
then you'll say that the reason that you
don't do it is because your moral.

1317
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,530
That's not the reason.
The reason is it's you're too damn

1318
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:37,720
afraid to do it.
You might want to,

1319
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,540
but you're too afraid.
That doesn't make you moral.

1320
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,200
So what happens to the Harbutt,
for example,

1321
01:06:43,201 --> 01:06:48,201
is once he gets outside the kingdom,
he asked to develop a whole array of

1322
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,390
potentials that he never developed
before because they were either not

1323
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:57,391
necessary in his civilized place or
because they were forbidden as immoral

1324
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,300
by the cultural situation that he grew
up in.

1325
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,493
Say,
well,

1326
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:07,450
think you have to be touched by the,
you have to be touched by the snake in

1327
01:07:07,451 --> 01:07:10,840
order to defeat the snake.
Where else have you seen that motif?

1328
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,630
It's Harry Potter,
right?

1329
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:15,700
I mean,
Harry Potter's a strange character

1330
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:17,020
because he's not obedient.

1331
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,370
Not at all.
In fact,

1332
01:07:18,371 --> 01:07:21,850
he's quite disobedient,
but he breaks the rules in the service

1333
01:07:21,851 --> 01:07:26,290
of higher morality and the higher
morality is that he faces down the

1334
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:29,800
dragon that paralyzes you and he frees
the virgin.

1335
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:32,920
That's what happens with Ginny Virginia
Virgin.

1336
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,410
It's the retelling of Saint George and
the Dragon.

1337
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,000
And interestingly enough,
the reason that Harry Potter revivified

1338
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:44,030
is because the double doors phoenix
comes by and cries in his wounds while

1339
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:48,430
the Phoenix is something that dies in
his reborn.

1340
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,750
And so the men have myth underlying the
second volume of the Harry Potter series

1341
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:56,740
is that the part of you that sustains
you through an encounter with the

1342
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:59,500
dragon,
that paralyzes is the part of you that

1343
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:03,490
can die and be reborn.
And what that means in a sense is if

1344
01:08:03,491 --> 01:08:06,520
you're wrong about something and you
fall into a pit,

1345
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:09,940
then you should let go of what you're
wrong about so that something new can

1346
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:10,774
arise.

1347
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:14,050
And so it's better to be,
it's better to be the thing that

1348
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:19,051
transforms in response to catastrophe,
that it is the thing that's static.

1349
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,190
Yeah.
And that's another big discovery of

1350
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,350
people.
We are,

1351
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,150
we're like,
we're agents of transformation,

1352
01:08:26,151 --> 01:08:30,050
which is of course why kids are so
bloody obsessed with magicians and

1353
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:32,600
wizards who are agents of
transformation.

1354
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,550
You know?
And that's all embedded in the

1355
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:36,130
mythology.
It's all acted out.

1356
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,600
Nobody understands this sort of thing to
speak of.

1357
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,150
Certainly the kids don't.
It just hits them,

1358
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:43,400
you know,
cause they can recognize the pattern.

1359
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,860
They know that there's something magic
about them.

1360
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:49,340
Even though they're living in a cupboard
in a London suburb where everything is

1361
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:54,020
boring and flat and under control.
That's not the real world.

1362
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,370
And it's true.
It's not.

1363
01:08:56,230 --> 01:09:01,230
Is that why we have more patients or
people including criminals who say who

1364
01:09:03,641 --> 01:09:07,360
admit their crime
selves?

1365
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,780
Oh well not only no.
Know more patients we off often have

1366
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:12,970
admiration for them.
Oh yeah.

1367
01:09:12,971 --> 01:09:17,971
I mean like how many movies feature up
attractive bad guy while or for that

1368
01:09:18,671 --> 01:09:21,100
matter it attractive bad woman.
You know,

1369
01:09:21,101 --> 01:09:23,680
it's like,
it's because it's because of the

1370
01:09:23,681 --> 01:09:28,300
Nietzschean observation.
The people who are good aren't good.

1371
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:31,360
They're just cowers where's the guy
who's bad?

1372
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:34,330
Well at least he's not a coward.
Well then you might say,

1373
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:35,140
well,
you know,

1374
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,840
yeah,
he could stop being empowered and also

1375
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,150
become a good guy.
But I mean that's often,

1376
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,510
often,
but not always the actual plot of the

1377
01:09:43,511 --> 01:09:46,120
movie.
Cause that's the redemption of the bad

1378
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,140
guy.
You know?

1379
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,860
It's also what women fantasize about in
relationship to the beauty and beast

1380
01:09:50,861 --> 01:09:53,170
mythology.
They don't want the coward.

1381
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,240
He's the guy that wants to be the
friend.

1382
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,440
It's complete bullshit.
The bad guys in advance over that,

1383
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,110
but not a big enough advance because
he's a bad guy.

1384
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,230
The best thing you want is a civilized,
bad guy.

1385
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:06,910
It's like that's what you want.
Well,

1386
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,690
no wonder because it's only a civilized,
bad guy that's going to be capable of

1387
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:15,220
dealing with the dragons.
It's right Lloyd Axworthy.

1388
01:10:15,221 --> 01:10:18,010
When he was the minister of Foreign
Affairs for Canada,

1389
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,470
we know all the massacres were going on
in Yugoslavia.

1390
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:25,130
It was front page news at one point.
It was during the ethnic cleansings.

1391
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:27,580
He said,
I don't have the imagination for that

1392
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:28,990
kind of evil.
It's like,

1393
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,580
oh,
well that's really impressive,

1394
01:10:30,581 --> 01:10:34,660
Mr. Minister of foreign affairs,
did you ever read about the Holocaust?

1395
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,610
It's like,
it's time to wake up a little bit.

1396
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:39,580
These things happen,
but he said it has a moral claim.

1397
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,100
I just couldn't imagine that sort of
thing happening.

1398
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:43,000
It's like,
well,

1399
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,770
it's,
you're a little on the naive side,

1400
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:47,440
aren't you?
And parading that around his morality is

1401
01:10:47,441 --> 01:10:49,360
not a reasonable thing to do.

1402
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,970
When you also happened to be minister of
foreign affairs,

1403
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:55,240
it's like you should be looking out for
the snakes all at the time cause they're

1404
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:59,230
definitely out there and Milosevic was
definitely one of them.

1405
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,760
And so if a naive person meets someone
like that,

1406
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:08,740
the naive person loses and that's not
good because there were lots of people

1407
01:11:08,741 --> 01:11:10,570
like that and be better if they didn't
win.

1408
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:14,550
So okay.
So the hypothalamic,

1409
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,720
the fact that the exploratory circuitry
is actually embedded right into the

1410
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:22,380
hypothalamus way down there with like
lust and thirst and hunger.

1411
01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,160
It's so great because it shows you how
the mythology works.

1412
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:27,540
It basically says,
okay,

1413
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,140
here's a bunch of things you're doing
now and then something will go wrong.

1414
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,570
Okay,
you need a system to deal with things

1415
01:11:33,571 --> 01:11:35,310
when they go wrong.
What's the system?

1416
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:37,500
While it might kill you,
bang better,

1417
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,600
have some pain and anxiety to protect
you.

1418
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,110
Well you better figure out what it is.
Okay.

1419
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,120
Better have an exploratory system so
that you can go out there and gather

1420
01:11:45,121 --> 01:11:47,670
some more information.
While that's,

1421
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,180
that's the human story.
Gather information in the face of

1422
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:54,030
danger.
That's the human story.

1423
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,910
That's what we do.
So,

1424
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:59,730
and that's the hero myth.
And the hero myth is a redemptive,

1425
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:02,700
and that's because it is redemptive.
That is what works.

1426
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:05,430
Or at least that's what we've staked our
being on.

1427
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:06,421
I mean,
who knows?

1428
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,790
Maybe all of this exploration.
We'll just get us in trouble.

1429
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:10,890
I mean,
that's another part of Genesis,

1430
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:13,770
right?
Poke around and see what happens.

1431
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:14,281
Well,
you know,

1432
01:12:14,281 --> 01:12:17,520
you're doing that all the time.
You're in your little paradise battling

1433
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:20,550
away all happily,
and then you just can't stop yourself

1434
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:23,430
from pulling on a thread somewhere.
And then you find out,

1435
01:12:23,431 --> 01:12:24,570
oh my God,
you know,

1436
01:12:24,571 --> 01:12:27,790
maybe that's when you get suspicious
about your partner cheating on using

1437
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,440
maybe this person cheating on me and you
can't leave it alone.

1438
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,540
You can't leave it alone.
You got to go look at the snake.

1439
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:36,420
It's like bang.
It turns out it's there down.

1440
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,390
You go into the underworld,
right?

1441
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:40,260
And you might think,
well,

1442
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,850
maybe ignorance.
You know,

1443
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,430
maybe the bliss of ignorance would have
been better.

1444
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,660
Well,
it's not like psychologists don't tell

1445
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:50,640
you that.
All those positive illusion people,

1446
01:12:50,641 --> 01:12:54,870
that's their whole shtick is right.
It's better to be little bit dumb about

1447
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:57,540
how things work cause otherwise there's
no way you can be happy.

1448
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,750
It's like that's an idiotic theory on
two accounts.

1449
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:05,580
A happy isn't the point and be dumb is
not the goal.

1450
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,590
So you know,
it's,

1451
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,790
it's,
it's so,

1452
01:13:09,330 --> 01:13:11,550
it's so ignorant that it's actually
corrupt,

1453
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:14,670
which is really saying something because
you have to be pretty damn making rent

1454
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:18,540
before you get to corrupt.
So it's a hell of a thing to teach

1455
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,374
people.

1456
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,540
You know,
you have to delude yourself in a minor

1457
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:23,730
way,
otherwise you can't stand being alive.

1458
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,310
Oh my God,
that's awful.

1459
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,790
That's really awful.
It's like here's a different story.

1460
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:31,920
Maybe your Dick Tough enough to open
your eyes.

1461
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,100
I'd be a much better story.
And it's possible to,

1462
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:37,080
cause people are really,
really,

1463
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,570
really tough.
It's just they live in these little

1464
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,160
protected places,
you know,

1465
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,980
and they never get out there and hammer
themselves out against the world.

1466
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:45,540
So they never discovered that they're
tough.

1467
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,880
But you know,
when you might think,

1468
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,140
well that's your opinion.
It's like,

1469
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:50,610
no,
it's not my damn opinion.

1470
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:53,640
We know that if you take someone who's
naive and and,

1471
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:58,320
and paralyzed by anxiety and you put
them in psychotherapy and you expose

1472
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:02,400
them to the things that they're afraid
of or disgusted by end avoiding that it

1473
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:05,940
isn't that they get less afraid,
they get more confident.

1474
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,070
And that's what generalizes,
you know?

1475
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,470
So you know,
if you bring somebody who's got a mouse

1476
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,080
phobia,
need them house for the year,

1477
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,410
then they're not ever afraid of a bunch
of other things.

1478
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,120
Why does that happen?
Well,

1479
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:19,960
they weren't afraid of the damn mouth.
You're afraid of their own inadequacy

1480
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,900
and then you teach them that they don't
have to be afraid and they think,

1481
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,120
hey,
I don't have to be afraid.

1482
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,250
And then they're not afraid of a whole
bunch of things.

1483
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:30,610
And so you get generalization from
behavioral exposure.

1484
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:34,750
And so it isn't,
there's no question about whether or not

1485
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:37,390
exposure to the things that you avoid is
curative.

1486
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:39,610
It's the fundamental axiom of
psychotherapy.

1487
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,530
You know that.
And figuring out what you're going to do

1488
01:14:41,531 --> 01:14:44,470
with your future.
But even in psychoanalysis,

1489
01:14:44,471 --> 01:14:46,300
it's face what threatens you,
right?

1490
01:14:46,301 --> 01:14:50,110
It's just that the psychoanalyst tend to
go after past traumas,

1491
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,420
but doesn't matter as far as your brain
is concerned.

1492
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,440
A dangerous thing in the past is exactly
the same thing as a dangerous thing in

1493
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:59,590
the president.
And it seems to be partly because the

1494
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:01,600
Amygdala doesn't have any sense of the
time.

1495
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,270
And you know,
it's interesting because one of the

1496
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:08,320
things young observed was that there's
no time in the collective unconscious.

1497
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:13,710
It's like everything is in eternal now.
So let's say you got traumatized when

1498
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:16,510
you were a kid.
Your age you're in and make the growth.

1499
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:18,790
Maybe you got bit by a spider or some
damn thing.

1500
01:15:18,791 --> 01:15:21,880
It's like you're afraid of that spider
then and now.

1501
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:26,050
And in the future it's the same.
It's outside of time.

1502
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:29,230
Hippocampus,
it's the thing that's dealing with time.

1503
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,020
So you know,
if you really learn a lesson,

1504
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:35,950
it's supposed to be timeless.
While you know you can still help people

1505
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:38,830
overcome their phobias,
but he can't get their damn Amygdala to

1506
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:39,664
shrink again.

1507
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:42,460
So you can just get it back under
control.

1508
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,150
Okay.
So that's pretty cool.

1509
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:50,680
And then we could say,
let's go up a level or two.

1510
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:52,510
Well,
let's look at the Amygdala for a minute.

1511
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:57,511
So
things about the Amygdala have probably

1512
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:01,360
changed since I updated my knowledge.
But it doesn't really matter because the

1513
01:16:01,361 --> 01:16:04,000
fundamental systems I'm telling you
about exist.

1514
01:16:04,001 --> 01:16:07,810
And they keep moving around in the brain
because we don't know exactly how they

1515
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:10,660
work.
But at a system level of description,

1516
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:11,860
you know,
and with the,

1517
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:15,550
with the,
at a system level of description and

1518
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:19,930
using slightly vague neuro psychology,
we can localize these sorts of things in

1519
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:21,100
the brain.
Okay.

1520
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:23,530
So the Amygdala gets inputs from
everywhere.

1521
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:27,850
And basically what it's looking for is
things that might threaten you.

1522
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:31,630
And I would say the,
you could say in a sense that they'll

1523
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:35,680
make the law has a inbuilt sense of the
monstrous.

1524
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,910
And let me show you,
this is a good time to show you,

1525
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:40,760
uh,
uh,

1526
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,610
a little,
a little comic.

1527
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,750
This is a great comic.
Someone stoned came up with this comic

1528
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,860
and they really did cause it's a,
it's a,

1529
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:50,890
uh,
head comic,

1530
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:52,780
uh,
underground cartoon comic.

1531
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:56,410
But I really liked this comic because it
just shows you what's going on

1532
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,250
perfectly.
Okay.

1533
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,580
So there's these hippies,
they're,

1534
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,960
they're all friends of this guy named
fat Freddy and,

1535
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:02,883
and you know,
they're,

1536
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:06,430
they're basically useless hippies and
they don't pay rent and they only do

1537
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,230
smoke pot in there,
you know?

1538
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:11,720
And so anyways,
at one point they make a bunch of money

1539
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:16,340
on some cocaine deal and they buy this
whole mouth in the country and they

1540
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:18,020
think they're going to go out there and
live in paradise.

1541
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:22,040
And so they bring their catalog,
which is fat Freddy's cow who has his

1542
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,110
own adventures with cockroaches and so
on.

1543
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,900
Anyways,
if you've ever had a cat,

1544
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:29,450
one thing you knew about cats is they
don't like to move.

1545
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,570
It makes it very upset and nervous.
And if you put them in a new house,

1546
01:17:32,571 --> 01:17:35,570
they are not happy about it.
And the reason for that is you've blown

1547
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:36,440
their map,
right?

1548
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:41,441
It's like the cat will slink around in a
new territory and map every single place

1549
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:43,550
in every hiding place,
you know,

1550
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,060
obsessively till it knows what the
hell's going on and then it'll find me.

1551
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:50,490
Relax.
So a cat in a new place is not a common

1552
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,720
cat.
A cat in a new place is a nervous cat.

1553
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,270
Okay.
Which is also indication that you don't

1554
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,720
have to learn to be afraid.
What you have to learn is how to be

1555
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,270
calm.
And that reverses the way that

1556
01:18:02,271 --> 01:18:05,990
psychologists generally talk about
anxiety because they're all hobbits and

1557
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:07,700
they think that life is safe.

1558
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,920
And so they think that because life is
safe,

1559
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:12,500
you have to learn to be afraid.
It's like that's dopey.

1560
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,220
The natural condition is terror and
curiosity.

1561
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:20,210
And if you're really lucky now and then
you're somewhere safe enough so that you

1562
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:23,990
don't have to be afraid.
And that's tenuous and delicate.

1563
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,930
And so what you have to learn is how not
to be afraid,

1564
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:31,250
not how to be afraid.
So anyways,

1565
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:33,380
they got the cat.
And so he's in his box and they take

1566
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:36,920
them out of the box and the cat thinks,
so this is the country.

1567
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:39,650
And then the cat goes real low and start
sniffing.

1568
01:18:39,651 --> 01:18:44,651
And that is what animals do when they
first start exploring both of those

1569
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:46,970
things,
they crouched down and that makes them

1570
01:18:46,971 --> 01:18:49,430
less visible to predators.
And they sniff.

1571
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:52,910
And the reason they sniff is because
like most animals are all no's.

1572
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:56,180
You can tell that with dogs for example,
their whole brains are built around

1573
01:18:56,181 --> 01:18:59,900
their sense of smell unlike us,
which most of our brain is built around

1574
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,310
vision.
But anyway,

1575
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:05,510
so the cat's slinking around there and
then it smells something that it doesn't

1576
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:10,430
know and it thinks God only knows what
this thing that I don't know is.

1577
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:14,960
And so it re it would freeze first and
then it would beat a hasty retreat.

1578
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:16,760
Okay.
So now it's underneath the porch.

1579
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:17,511
One hip,
he says,

1580
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:20,900
where'd the cap disappeared now the
other one says under the house,

1581
01:19:20,901 --> 01:19:24,890
and then the cats down there shaking,
which is what cats do after the freaked

1582
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:28,310
out like that.
And it's got this little fantasy going.

1583
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,340
You'd hide too if you'd smelled what I
did.

1584
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:34,070
And then it imagines up this monster and
a monster technically is the

1585
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:36,500
amalgamation of unrelated parts.

1586
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,450
So what's the monster?
Well,

1587
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:41,990
let's go duck feed and it's called like
bare arms and,

1588
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:46,040
and it's got a skunk tail and it's got
kind of a wolf head and it's got antlers

1589
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:48,050
and you think,
well that thing doesn't exist.

1590
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,610
It's like,
that's wrong.

1591
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,730
That thing exists.
In fact,

1592
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:55,580
it's a really accurate representation of
what's out in the forest.

1593
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:58,940
Now any one animal wouldn't look like
that,

1594
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:02,960
but the set of all possible animals
looks exactly like that.

1595
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:04,130
And then you might think,
well,

1596
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:09,490
what do you want first when you're
something you want quick and dirty

1597
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:13,730
representation of what to be afraid of?
Or do you want to hang around trying to

1598
01:20:13,740 --> 01:20:15,750
figure out whether that thing has hooves
and teeth?

1599
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:16,973
It's like,
no,

1600
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:20,850
you want it quick and dirty
representation of just what might be

1601
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:24,390
lurking out there because that's
intelligent hypothesizing,

1602
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,490
right?
It's the kind of hypothesize and it

1603
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:27,870
would be evolutionary driven.

1604
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:29,710
You ever see?
Uh,

1605
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:32,430
the far side cartoon,
uh,

1606
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,370
Monster Snorkel.
I loved that cartoon.

1607
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:40,371
So there's this little kid in his bad,
it's dark and he's under the covers.

1608
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,980
He's one of those ugly little kids that
Gary Larson always drew.

1609
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,790
And he's got this snorkel that you use
for,

1610
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:52,110
you know,
scuba diving and what do you call it?

1611
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:55,590
Snorkeling,
scuba diving and all that sticking out

1612
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,070
from under the covers is the snorkel so
that he can breathe.

1613
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:03,480
And then of course in his imagination
there's some like reptilian dinosaur,

1614
01:21:03,481 --> 01:21:06,690
like things sitting beside his bed.
And it's like,

1615
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,340
well,
why?

1616
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,460
Because that's what he's hypothesizing.
Why?

1617
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:14,280
Because that's what's in the dark.
And you think,

1618
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,570
well,
you can tell your kid,

1619
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,070
well,
there's no monsters in the dark.

1620
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:17,701
Yeah,
right.

1621
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:19,920
And then you say,
never talked to a stranger.

1622
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:21,360
It's like,
get your story straight.

1623
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:23,520
People really,
you know,

1624
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:24,630
it's so dopey.

1625
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:25,681
He's like,
yeah,

1626
01:21:25,681 --> 01:21:28,170
there's monsters in the dark.
So what are you telling your kids?

1627
01:21:28,171 --> 01:21:29,790
No,
there's no such thing as monsters.

1628
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,860
First of all,
they're driven half crazy because they

1629
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:32,490
think,
well,

1630
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,140
what am I afraid of?
Then?

1631
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,000
You know,
and second you tell them over time that

1632
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:39,750
there are monsters in the dark.
In fact,

1633
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:42,840
you're probably more paranoid about the
damn things then your kid is,

1634
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,940
you know,
so what do you tell them?

1635
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:48,180
There are monsters in the dark,
but you can probably handle up,

1636
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,360
especially with our health.
Okay.

1637
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:56,130
So now I'll tell you a story.
So my nephew,

1638
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:01,230
he was six,
he had night terrors in night terrors or

1639
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:05,610
this strange phenomena where all of a
sudden you wake up screaming is quite

1640
01:22:05,611 --> 01:22:08,100
unpleasant.
And then you might say,

1641
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:10,440
well why was this happening in the
answer as well?

1642
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:13,350
We really don't know.
But there was some instability in his

1643
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,520
household at that point.

1644
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:16,860
A,
he was just going off to kindergarten.

1645
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:18,570
So that's a big transition,
right?

1646
01:22:18,571 --> 01:22:21,600
It's out of paradise.
I would into the world and be,

1647
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,530
his parents were in the throes of
approaching divorce.

1648
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:27,960
So there was that sort of undercurrent
in the house.

1649
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:29,370
Right.
And you know what that's like.

1650
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,580
You walk into a house like that,
it's like you know something's up.

1651
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,600
It's like the error is frozen and it's
probably something that you can smell.

1652
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:38,850
I think,
but whatever,

1653
01:22:38,910 --> 01:22:40,950
it doesn't matter,
but you can certainly tell.

1654
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,570
And so anyways,
he's,

1655
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:45,630
he's waking up at night screaming away.
And so during the day,

1656
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:49,110
he's a very verbal kid.
During the days running around,

1657
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:51,240
I guess he was about four,
not six.

1658
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,610
It's got this little night hat that he
wears.

1659
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:57,030
It's a plastic night hat.
So he zooms around without all the time

1660
01:22:57,031 --> 01:22:59,580
and he's got this plastic sword and he's
doing around with that too.

1661
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:00,691
And so you think,
well,

1662
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:02,040
what's,
what's he up to?

1663
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:05,010
Well,
he's playing night.

1664
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:07,000
Just kind of weird day because you
think,

1665
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,720
why would being a night be attractive to
a kid?

1666
01:23:10,721 --> 01:23:12,580
You know,
we weren't nights for that long,

1667
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:14,440
but whatever,
it doesn't really matter.

1668
01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:19,030
He's running around playing night and he
goes to sleep and he puts his night hat

1669
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,970
and his sword right beside his bed.
So fine.

1670
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:24,940
I watched that.
I'm watching what's going on with him.

1671
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:26,500
I'm figuring out what's going on in the
house.

1672
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,930
And you know,
his mom is worried because he's having

1673
01:23:28,931 --> 01:23:29,920
night terrors.
It's like,

1674
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:30,700
yeah,
it's horrible.

1675
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,750
Wakes up screaming.
So,

1676
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:34,090
okay,
nighttime comes,

1677
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:37,450
he wakes up screaming.
We're all sitting at the breakfast table

1678
01:23:37,451 --> 01:23:40,060
the next day.
And I said,

1679
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:43,180
did you dream about anything?
Anyway,

1680
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,700
yeah.
And then got right into this dream.

1681
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:46,600
And he said,
okay,

1682
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,710
well this is what happened.

1683
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:53,190
I was out in a field and all of these
little dwarfs were around me.

1684
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:56,350
They only came up to my knees,
but they had big beaks.

1685
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:59,470
They didn't have any arms.
They have big beaks on them and they

1686
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:02,200
were covered with hair and Greece.
So they were all greased down and there

1687
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:04,080
was a cross shaped at the top of their
head.

1688
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:07,990
Wherever I went,
these beat dwarfs would jump at me with

1689
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:11,290
their feet and bite me.
So it's like a horrible image,

1690
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:12,480
right?
He said they're everywhere,

1691
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,080
so everyone stops eating breakfast and
we're like watching this thinking,

1692
01:24:16,150 --> 01:24:17,980
wow,
that's no wonder you're screaming man.

1693
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:20,110
So,
and then he said,

1694
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,610
yeah.
And it was worse than that because like

1695
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:27,460
there was smoke and at the back of the
little doors there was this dragon and

1696
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:30,040
the dragon was breathing out,
smoke and fire and the smoke and fire

1697
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,840
would turn into the dwarfs.
It's like,

1698
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:33,460
oh my God,
what do you do about that?

1699
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,170
Wiping out some dwarfs.
It's like,

1700
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:36,360
who cares?
The Dragon.

1701
01:24:36,361 --> 01:24:40,030
We'll just breathe up some more.
It's like that's life man.

1702
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:41,650
I've got this.
Excellent.

1703
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,340
I've got this excellent picture.
It's,

1704
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:47,710
let me show it to you cause it's,
it's worth finding even though it's

1705
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:49,420
going to interrupt my story a little
bit.

1706
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:12,903
Yeah.

1707
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:15,670
Well I'm not going to find it because
it'll take too long,

1708
01:25:15,671 --> 01:25:18,720
but I'll tell you what it is anyway.
So it's a Greek amphora.

1709
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,720
All right.
You Know How am fora there?

1710
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:23,130
Those,
there's like a boss sort of and they

1711
01:25:23,131 --> 01:25:26,390
just keep winding them and uh,
it's dreary.

1712
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,680
It's painted on like a,
like a cartoon.

1713
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:32,500
It's sort of black and white and it's
got this hero who I believe is Hercules.

1714
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:33,690
And anyways,
her,

1715
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:36,910
these is facing this snake and it's a
really cool snake.

1716
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,880
So first of all,
its tail is curled in a perfect circle.

1717
01:25:40,210 --> 01:25:43,180
And that's if you look at dragons and
snakes and mythology,

1718
01:25:43,181 --> 01:25:47,470
there are often their tails often curled
in a circle and it means something like

1719
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,760
it means something like infinity.
But anyways,

1720
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,390
and then there's all these snakes.
It's a high drug,

1721
01:25:53,391 --> 01:25:55,540
so it's a snake with like eight can say.

1722
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,790
And so then there's Hercules with his
sword.

1723
01:25:57,791 --> 01:25:59,770
It's like,
well what's the problem with the hydro

1724
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:03,040
cut off one hand?
What happens eight more heads?

1725
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,393
It's like,
hmm,

1726
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:07,190
quit cutting off heads.
Yeah,

1727
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:10,670
it's a good piece of foreign policy
advice for the Middle East.

1728
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:13,340
No.
So the hydrus keep growing.

1729
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:14,174
Okay.
So you know,

1730
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,130
cutting off heads isn't going to be of
any utility.

1731
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:20,210
And so here's what the story is saying.
It's like no matter how many problems

1732
01:26:20,211 --> 01:26:21,890
you solve,
there's going to be a bunch more

1733
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:24,080
problems.
And it's even worse than that.

1734
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,070
If you have a problem and you solve it,
that's going to lead to more problems.

1735
01:26:28,370 --> 01:26:30,530
So even the solution is a problem.
Right?

1736
01:26:30,531 --> 01:26:33,080
And that's the law of unexpected
consequences,

1737
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:35,540
right?
That's why automobiles have destroyed

1738
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:37,850
the atmosphere.
Everybody thought in automobile is for

1739
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:40,730
getting from point a to point b.
It turns out it's not.

1740
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:44,330
It's for transforming the world into the
world's holes,

1741
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,490
into jungles.
We didn't know that.

1742
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:50,990
So that's an unexpected consequence.
So anyways,

1743
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:54,410
the kid is faced with this horrible
conundrum,

1744
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,510
like,
what am I going to do?

1745
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,520
Go out these doors and they're biting me
and then there's this stupid dragon.

1746
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:02,210
So I said,
what could you do about that?

1747
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:07,070
Now that's called a loaded question and
it will be inadmissible in a court of

1748
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:08,690
law in a sense,
because it,

1749
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,060
what is it?
It's a question,

1750
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,040
but no one isn't right.
I'm telling him something,

1751
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,790
you could do something about that.
Well,

1752
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,210
that's a hell of a theory.
It's like,

1753
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:20,631
well,
yeah,

1754
01:27:20,631 --> 01:27:22,850
I should just lay down and let the door
of seat me,

1755
01:27:22,851 --> 01:27:23,870
you know?
No,

1756
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:25,100
no,
you could do something about it.

1757
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:26,210
I said,
what could you do?

1758
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,810
And then he said,
I put my hat on,

1759
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:30,920
I get my sword.

1760
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,800
Then I'd go get my dad and we'd go up to
the Dragon.

1761
01:27:33,801 --> 01:27:37,910
I jumped on his head and then I poke
both his eyes out with my sword and then

1762
01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:41,120
I go right down the stomach to the place
where the fire comes out.

1763
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:44,510
And I cut a piece off of that and I'd
use it as a shield.

1764
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,880
And I thought,
right,

1765
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:48,710
art and Kid,
you got it,

1766
01:27:48,830 --> 01:27:51,290
you can fight.
It was so cool because he had the whole

1767
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:51,781
thing,
hey,

1768
01:27:51,781 --> 01:27:53,510
and that's why he's running around
playing night.

1769
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:56,600
He'd almost go on it and all I had to do
was drop.

1770
01:27:56,870 --> 01:28:01,870
There's this fifth chemical phenomena
called a supersaturated solution.

1771
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:04,430
It's kind of cool.
So if you take,

1772
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:08,420
you know,
water can only dissolve so much sugar

1773
01:28:08,450 --> 01:28:10,400
until the sugar starts to crystallize
out,

1774
01:28:10,401 --> 01:28:11,630
right?
But if you're careful,

1775
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:14,120
you heat up the water,
you can dissolve a bunch of sugar in it.

1776
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:18,350
And then if you really slow,
slowly cool down the water and you don't

1777
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:21,710
tap it and there's no impurities,
you can get this sugar,

1778
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:25,100
you can get this solution super
saturated,

1779
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:28,880
which means weirdly enough,
it holds more sugar than it can.

1780
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:31,550
It's like it forgets to crystallize it
or something.

1781
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:34,250
Or maybe you know,
it needs a little impurity or a shock or

1782
01:28:34,251 --> 01:28:35,750
something to get it going.
But it's like,

1783
01:28:35,751 --> 01:28:39,050
it forgets to crystallize.
So then if you take a little crystal of

1784
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:42,680
sugar and you drop it in,
it's like he goes and instantly,

1785
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:44,370
it's all crystal.
So,

1786
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:47,570
so that's what happened to this kid.
It's like he was there,

1787
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:49,400
he was ready,
he had the answer.

1788
01:28:49,401 --> 01:28:54,230
And all I had to do is say you could do
something about this and Poof,

1789
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:57,950
instant hero myth.
And the cool thing is no more night

1790
01:28:57,951 --> 01:29:01,660
terrors.
So well,

1791
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:03,460
so you get the picture.
It's very,

1792
01:29:03,461 --> 01:29:05,080
very cool.
All right,

1793
01:29:05,081 --> 01:29:10,081
so back to our discussion now.
All right,

1794
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:24,810
so you've got the brain here.
And so this is uh,

1795
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:29,930
the brain has conceptualized by
Alexander Luria who was the Russia's

1796
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:32,130
most famous neuropsychologist and who

1797
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,340
got the big picture,
right,

1798
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:39,280
man.
So basically he said there's a bunch of

1799
01:29:39,281 --> 01:29:42,010
different ways that you can divide up
the brain.

1800
01:29:42,011 --> 01:29:42,844
You know,
it kind of,

1801
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:44,790
it depends on what you want,
you know,

1802
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:47,380
which is an interesting way of thinking
about it because you might say,

1803
01:29:47,381 --> 01:29:49,540
well,
how should you divide up the world?

1804
01:29:49,541 --> 01:29:50,410
And that's her is,
well,

1805
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:51,910
it depends on what you want,
right?

1806
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:54,490
It depends to some degree on the
features of the world,

1807
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:56,350
but it depends even more on what you
want.

1808
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:02,230
So one of the things Luria said,
it's okay if you go from the back to the

1809
01:30:02,231 --> 01:30:04,750
front of the brain,
the front of the gray part here,

1810
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:08,830
what you see is roughly speaking,
the back half of the brain does sensory

1811
01:30:08,831 --> 01:30:11,620
processing,
especially visual processing.

1812
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,230
And the front half of the brain does
motor processing.

1813
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,810
Okay.
And so if you look at the back of the

1814
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:18,130
brain,
the sensory unit there,

1815
01:30:18,131 --> 01:30:21,160
you see that there's an auditory area
and a visual area.

1816
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:24,100
And what's cool is those overlap to some
degree.

1817
01:30:24,580 --> 01:30:28,330
So there's some hypothesis that the
places where the sensory systems

1818
01:30:28,331 --> 01:30:31,060
overlap,
it are the parts that are responsible

1819
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:34,720
for your experience of a unified
perceptual field.

1820
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:38,770
So here's an example of managing the
visual cortex in the auditory cortex.

1821
01:30:38,771 --> 01:30:40,900
Overlap in one place.
Okay?

1822
01:30:40,901 --> 01:30:45,580
So it sort of be maybe hear about there,
let's say on the left side.

1823
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:46,120
Yeah,
there,

1824
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,070
that's the part used for silent reading.

1825
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:51,640
Isn't that cool?
It means you're using your eyes,

1826
01:30:51,641 --> 01:30:53,750
his ears and the way you do that is
used.

1827
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,350
The overlap between the visual and the
auditory cortex.

1828
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:58,780
It's so cool.
You can use your eyes his ears.

1829
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:00,280
So,
you know,

1830
01:31:00,281 --> 01:31:02,440
so the senses aren't as separate as
people think.

1831
01:31:02,441 --> 01:31:03,710
And you know,
when I,

1832
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:06,490
I used to wear glasses and I couldn't
hear what people were saying when I

1833
01:31:06,491 --> 01:31:08,980
wasn't wearing them.
And the reason for that is I couldn't,

1834
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:12,130
I wasn't watching their lips say.
And so a lot of what I was hearing in

1835
01:31:12,131 --> 01:31:15,550
language processing was the expression
on their face and the movement of their

1836
01:31:15,551 --> 01:31:17,260
lips.
So take off my glasses,

1837
01:31:17,261 --> 01:31:19,360
I'm deaf.
So anyways,

1838
01:31:19,361 --> 01:31:21,220
so that's the sensory unit.
Half the brain,

1839
01:31:21,221 --> 01:31:25,090
most of it's visual cortex because we're
insanely visual creatures and the front

1840
01:31:25,091 --> 01:31:27,130
half is the motor unit.
Okay,

1841
01:31:27,131 --> 01:31:28,240
why?
Well,

1842
01:31:28,241 --> 01:31:30,100
because we proceed and act.

1843
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:33,600
So it's the part of the brain that's
responsible for Zika.

1844
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:35,950
You around you,
you've got voluntary action,

1845
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:36,690
right?
You,

1846
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:41,690
you inhabit a nervous system that
enables you to navigate your way

1847
01:31:42,071 --> 01:31:44,350
throughout the world.
We're navigators fundamentally,

1848
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:49,380
we really are navigators and you don't
ask can navigate by the stars.

1849
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:53,740
Think about that.
How the hell can enact navigate by the

1850
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:56,020
stars.
They figured that out by figure,

1851
01:31:56,040 --> 01:31:57,670
you know,
watching ants is figuring out how to get

1852
01:31:57,671 --> 01:32:00,160
back.
And then up the sky,

1853
01:32:00,161 --> 01:32:03,010
and then the ants were wandering around
not knowing where they were going.

1854
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:04,540
It's like,
yeah,

1855
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,160
there's lots of things we don't
understand.

1856
01:32:06,161 --> 01:32:07,560
I can tell you that.
So anyways,

1857
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,930
the motor unit,
you've got the motor strip.

1858
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:14,440
Now if you touch that with an electro
during brain surgery,

1859
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:18,670
then people will either move or have the
impulse to move and you can map out how

1860
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:22,390
the body is represented in the brain by
touching that strip with an electrode.

1861
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:26,080
And that was done by wilder Pinfield at
the Montreal neurological institute.

1862
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,890
It was a major move forward in the
understanding of the brain.

1863
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:33,280
And he did that on epileptics before
surgery because he didn't want to take

1864
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:35,620
out parts of the brain that you know
were necessary.

1865
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:37,090
So he's trying to figure out what they
were doing.

1866
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:40,840
So that's the part that enables you to
act voluntarily.

1867
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:43,510
And in front of that,
there's the premotor strip.

1868
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,140
And then in front of that,
there's the prefrontal cortex.

1869
01:32:47,170 --> 01:32:52,170
Now what's cool is that the premotor
strip and the prefrontal cortex grew out

1870
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:55,750
of the motor strip over the course of
evolution.

1871
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:57,550
So then you might say,
well,

1872
01:32:57,551 --> 01:33:01,150
why do we think,
and the answer isn't so that we can come

1873
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:03,790
up with accurate objective
representations of the world.

1874
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:08,680
The answer is so that we can plan what
to do and what you see fundamentally is

1875
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:13,681
that as you move forward in the brain,
you go from action to planning action.

1876
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,670
And so by the time you get to the
prefrontal Cortex,

1877
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:20,740
let's say the Dorsolateral prefrontal
Cortex,

1878
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:23,710
which is the part of the brain that you
use for abstract thinking,

1879
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:28,980
what you're basically doing is conjuring
up avatars of yourself in an imaginary

1880
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:36,730
world running the mess simulations in
your imagination and the collective

1881
01:33:36,731 --> 01:33:38,500
imagination.
That's what stories are,

1882
01:33:38,770 --> 01:33:43,090
and then running the simulation to the
end to see if you live or die and if you

1883
01:33:43,091 --> 01:33:45,580
die,
then you don't implement the simulation.

1884
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:48,640
And if you live in thrive,
then you do implement the simulation.

1885
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:53,650
And so
was it Karl Popper,

1886
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,490
philosopher of science said,
the reason we think is so that we can

1887
01:33:57,491 --> 01:34:01,420
let our thoughts die instead of us.
Right.

1888
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:03,130
That's smart.
Well,

1889
01:34:03,131 --> 01:34:05,680
that also ties into the death and
rebirth idea,

1890
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:07,540
right?
It's like are you going to die?

1891
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:10,420
Are you to let your,
you know your avatars die?

1892
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:15,420
And one way of thinking about that is
that your current self is just an

1893
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:19,060
Avatar.
Now if you understand that,

1894
01:34:19,061 --> 01:34:24,061
that means you also understand the
relationship between the union self and

1895
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:26,860
the ego.
The Ego is an Avatar.

1896
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,710
The self is the thing.
Now,

1897
01:34:29,711 --> 01:34:31,870
I don't know if you know this,
but the word Avatar,

1898
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,540
it's actually a theological term.
It's from,

1899
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:39,750
it's from Sanskrit and an Avatar is the
form that God takes on earth.

1900
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,240
It's pretty cool that that turned into
the word for the thing that you use at a

1901
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:44,170
video game,
right?

1902
01:34:44,171 --> 01:34:47,530
That's your little,
you know,

1903
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:50,350
disposable self.
You throw it out there in a world and it

1904
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,540
can live or die and you're back there
like God,

1905
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:56,650
just be an eternal all along the way.
So that's a very,

1906
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:58,640
very thing.
But anyways,

1907
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:00,770
even before we had video games,
we were doing that,

1908
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:00,950
right?

1909
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,510
Cause we had fiction,
we had stories,

1910
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:06,710
we had imagination and it's,
it's decoupled from our motor systems.

1911
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,880
And so we can implement these,
you know,

1912
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:13,520
hypothetical instances of ourselves
before we implement them.

1913
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:15,680
And you know,
that's Kinda how we fight hydrus.

1914
01:35:15,681 --> 01:35:16,221
It's like,
okay,

1915
01:35:16,221 --> 01:35:18,170
you got eight snakes,
what do you do about that?

1916
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:22,520
You'll have eight potential selves.
So you multiply potential cells just as

1917
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:25,520
fast as the world can multiply snakes,
you know,

1918
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:27,500
and that's what evolution does,
right?

1919
01:35:27,980 --> 01:35:32,030
So you know,
let's say you've got a mongoose,

1920
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,470
mongoose,
mongoose,

1921
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:35,360
mongooses,
they like to eat snakes.

1922
01:35:35,361 --> 01:35:37,070
They're really good at it.
They can eat cobras,

1923
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:39,800
go mongooses.
So you think,

1924
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:42,230
well a mongoose gets killed by a Cobra.
It's like,

1925
01:35:42,231 --> 01:35:44,630
well it's not a very good mongoose,
but that doesn't matter because the

1926
01:35:44,631 --> 01:35:48,770
mongooses are generating all sorts of
Mongoose and one of them is going to be

1927
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:49,700
able to kill the snake.

1928
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:51,590
Not all that.
That's all that really matters.

1929
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,920
So there's a very funny mouse that lives
in the desert in Arizona.

1930
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:01,970
I'd like this most a lot.
And it jumps and it,

1931
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:03,710
it's so cool.
This mouse,

1932
01:36:03,711 --> 01:36:06,050
it feeds on Scorpions.
It's like,

1933
01:36:06,051 --> 01:36:08,450
how the hell did it learn to do that?
Anyways?

1934
01:36:08,451 --> 01:36:11,960
It has to teach its young to eat
scorpions and it's quite immune from

1935
01:36:11,961 --> 01:36:14,120
Scorpion Vanneman Venom,
which is quite helpful.

1936
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:16,110
But still,
you know it goes out in this,

1937
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:19,460
it's like you going out to wrestler Nile
Crocodile,

1938
01:36:19,461 --> 01:36:22,070
it's like a scarf.
He and he's a big thing compared to a

1939
01:36:22,071 --> 01:36:23,970
mouse.
The mouse will hop on the Scorpion and

1940
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:27,380
they have this terrible fight and
finding the most tears it apart and then

1941
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:30,110
it brings it back and feeds it's little
mice,

1942
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:35,111
babies pops and you know what it does.
Then it goes outside and howls at the

1943
01:36:35,631 --> 01:36:39,160
moon like a wolf just sort of,
it sounds like a mouse.

1944
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,280
So it's really squeaking out.
But if you slow it down,

1945
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,440
you know,
which is what you have to do.

1946
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:47,900
For example,
if you want to hear mouse vocalizations

1947
01:36:47,901 --> 01:36:50,660
cause they're often super,
super what,

1948
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:52,430
what uh,
above,

1949
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,720
above your threshold for hearing pay
excepted that to here or rats laugh when

1950
01:36:56,721 --> 01:36:59,300
you tickle though.
He had to slow down their vocalizations

1951
01:36:59,301 --> 01:37:02,300
because they,
they laugh at ultrasonic frequency.

1952
01:37:02,301 --> 01:37:05,180
So he had to slow down your,
their vocalizations to hear them laugh

1953
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:06,560
when you take a look.
But anyways,

1954
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:10,490
these damn nice go out in the desert at
night after eating a scorpion and they

1955
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:12,080
howl at the moon,
which is like

1956
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:14,780
go mice.
So,

1957
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,630
so anyways,
anyways,

1958
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:22,930
back to the brain here.
So there's all these terrible monsters

1959
01:37:23,121 --> 01:37:26,810
being generated and you generate avatars
of yourself to cope with.

1960
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:29,870
I'm in generally used to have to like
evolve to do that,

1961
01:37:29,871 --> 01:37:33,380
but human beings being the smart
creatures we are generated up and the

1962
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:37,370
environment in the imagination and then
populated it with imaginary

1963
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:41,960
representations of ourselves and then
try those out and then we implement the

1964
01:37:41,961 --> 01:37:43,310
ones that we think are great.

1965
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:45,980
And then you might think,
well we've been doing that for a very,

1966
01:37:45,981 --> 01:37:47,750
very,
very long time.

1967
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,320
And then you might think,
well maybe we figured out exactly what

1968
01:37:51,321 --> 01:37:53,600
thing we should implement.
And then we might say,

1969
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:57,360
well that's the savior figures in
mythology.

1970
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:01,320
That's what they are.
So what else would they be?

1971
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,300
You know,
people would be trying to figure out

1972
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:07,650
what the hell we are for forever.
And the fundamental question isn't what

1973
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,590
is reality maideb not the fundamental
question.

1974
01:38:10,770 --> 01:38:14,730
The fundamental question is how do you
act in the world?

1975
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:18,150
And that's a whole different way of
thinking about the world.

1976
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:22,950
But I think given that I'm a Darwinian,
I think it's the fundamental question.

1977
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,800
And you know what?
Obviously,

1978
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:30,690
given what I've described to you so far,
you can't fall in love too much with

1979
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:33,990
your current self.
Because what if it's wrong?

1980
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,000
Well,
you should let that sucker die.

1981
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:38,220
And so then you might think,
well,

1982
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:41,640
what part of you is it that doesn't die
when your Avatar's die?

1983
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:43,530
Well,
that's what you'd called the self.

1984
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:46,680
So let's say you got undergo a
personality transformation here.

1985
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:49,290
There's the old view,
you're all naive a and something comes

1986
01:38:49,291 --> 01:38:52,200
along and just wallops you bang into the
underworld,

1987
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,430
you fall apart.
Hey,

1988
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:56,370
and then bang,
there's a new you and maybe a little,

1989
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,950
you know,
battle weary but wiser,

1990
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:01,310
fine.
But then you know that one gets walked,

1991
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:04,020
walked out and bang into down the road
and up you come again.

1992
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:06,900
It's like fine.
What's constant across all those

1993
01:39:06,901 --> 01:39:09,810
transformations?
That's the core element of,

1994
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,220
of the,
of the person.

1995
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:14,610
That's what you called the self
brilliant.

1996
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:17,040
It's brilliant.
So smart.

1997
01:39:17,460 --> 01:39:20,270
Okay.
15 minutes and then we'll,

1998
01:39:21,130 --> 01:39:22,020
we'll go on.
