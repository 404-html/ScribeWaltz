1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,720
So I'm going to briefly review some of 
what I told you last time and then I'm 

2
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:20,700
going to walk through,
as I mentioned,

3
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,701
I'm going to walk through the Disney 
Film Pinocchio and which I presume most 

4
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,260
of you have seen.
How many of you have seen it?

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,330
Yeah.
Okay.

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,330
Well that's,
that's so as I think I mentioned,

7
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:34,950
that's something in and of itself,
right?

8
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,120
I mean the fact that you've all seen it 
means that it's a production of cultural

9
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:42,150
significance and because it's such a 
strange artifact,

10
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:47,151
that's one way of looking at it.
It might be worth trying to take it 

11
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,660
apart to understand why it is,
for example,

12
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:53,661
that you even understand it.
And so I offered you the proposition 

13
00:00:54,571 --> 00:00:59,220
last week that we view the world 
essentially through a narrative lens and

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,180
I believe that we view the world through
a narrative lens because the fundamental

15
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:08,181
problem that we have to solve as living 
creatures is how we should act in the 

16
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:08,181
world.

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,800
And that means how we should act to 
maintain ourselves,

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,040
but also how we need to act in 
relationship to other people and in 

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,241
relationship to the broader world.
In order to maintain ourselves across 

20
00:01:23,241 --> 00:01:25,500
time,
so that's a complicated problem,

21
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:27,450
right?
It's not just how you survive,

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,780
it's how you survive now and next week 
and next month and next year and 50 

23
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,120
years from now and maybe your,
your,

24
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,190
uh,
your descendants as well if the culture 

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,780
is going to stabilize and then not only 
you across all those timeframes,

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,790
but you and everyone else across all 
those timeframes so viciously difficult 

27
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,081
problems.
And so I would say that we have evolved 

28
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:55,550
mechanisms to solve that.
I think that's self evident in some 

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,811
sense because for example,
one of the mechanisms that animals have 

30
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:02,460
evolved to deal with the problem of 
social being,

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,040
even if they're not particularly social 
animals,

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,870
is the dominance hierarchy.

33
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,930
Right?
Or You could call it a hierarchy of 

34
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,821
authority or power because I think 
considering human structures,

35
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:19,011
social structures as mirror power 
structures is a terrible mistake.

36
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:25,221
It's a terrible oversimplification 
because power is by no means the only 

37
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:31,080
like force is what I mean.
Force is not a stable way of solving the

38
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,900
problem of how to live together across 
time.

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,740
The question is what is the stable way 
of solving how to live together across 

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,331
time and that really is the question and
it's part of the question that I'm 

41
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,021
trying to answer,
partly because it's a perennial problem,

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,640
right?
We,

43
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,750
we face the problem of how to organize 
ourselves in small social units without 

44
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:58,941
undue conflict and then we faced the 
larger problem of how to organize 

45
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,220
ourselves into large social units 
without

46
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,360
undue conflict and that conflict can be 
absolutely devastating and,

47
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,110
and,
and frequently is so.

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,280
So then I would also say that the first 
way of solving this problem isn't 

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,610
conscious.
You see not at all.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
And you know,
you may know and you may not know that 

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,260
there are,
there are different forms of memory,

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
right?
Really technically different forms of 

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:28,560
memory.
So for example,

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,470
there's short term working memory,
which is the memory that you use to hold

55
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,800
things like telephone numbers in your 
active imagination.

56
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:39,490
It decays very rapidly.
It's only about four to seven bits,

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,700
which is why well,
it's white phone numbers or were at 

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,480
least seven digits long.
You know,

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,600
you can kind of manage that as a loop.
That and then there's um,

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,490
episodic memory and that has two 
elements.

61
00:03:57,491 --> 00:04:01,600
One is semantic and the other is a 
episodic.

62
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,830
It's a,
what's the name of that?

63
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,500
Someone's.
Someone said something.

64
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:15,330
Yes.
Well there's procedural memory and then 

65
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,191
there's,
there's another the kind of memory that 

66
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:18,850
you use to represent your experiences to
yourself.

67
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,851
So let's say it's image Laden and the 
other one is semantic and semantic is 

68
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,380
your memory for facts and those are 
quite different.

69
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,140
So for example,
procedural memory,

70
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,650
that's how you ride a bike,
that's how you play the piano,

71
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,350
that's how you play jazz music.
If you're in a combo,

72
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,570
it's,
it's the memory,

73
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,880
it's in fact,
it's a funny kind of memory because it's

74
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,800
actually built right into you,
you know,

75
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:46,660
I mean so is so is the kind of memory 
that you use to represent your life,

76
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,670
but it's much more malleable in some 
sense.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So what that means is that in your 
procedures there is information that you

78
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,650
don't know about at patterned 
information that you don't know about.

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,900
Part of that is how to act,
you know,

80
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,480
like when you walk into a social 
gathering,

81
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,120
you don't really think through how 
you're going to act,

82
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,210
you know,
how to act and if someone asked you 

83
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,270
exactly what it is that you're doing and
why you could formulate a story about 

84
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,810
it,
but the probability that,

85
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,430
that it's the existence of that story 
that enabled you to act that way as zero

86
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:24,190
because you have to react way faster 
than that.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,280
And so you know,
you have social knowledge built into 

88
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,851
your nervous system because you've 
practiced being a social being for a 

89
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:36,010
very long period of time.
And of course then that social being has

90
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:39,910
been shaped for forever really.
And it's the right way of thinking about

91
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,610
it.
You know,

92
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,660
we know that animals organize themselves
into hierarchies and we'll say of 

93
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:50,881
dominance because it's more,
more true the farther back you go in 

94
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,760
time,
at least since the time of the 

95
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:53,760
crustaceans.

96
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,880
You know,
when we split from our common ancestor 

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,790
300 million years ago.
And so it's true for social animals and 

98
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,360
non social animals.
So even animals that don't live together

99
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,890
in groups have to organize themselves 
into a hierarchy in this space.

100
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,480
They inhabit songbirds are a good 
example and they have dominance disputes

101
00:06:10,481 --> 00:06:15,481
all the time.
Partly that's you can hear them having 

102
00:06:15,481 --> 00:06:18,581
their little dominance disputes in the 
spring when they're singing because 

103
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:21,611
basically what they're saying is I'm 
pretty damn healthy and I'm ready to go 

104
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:23,900
and if you're another bird like me,
you better steer clear of this tree.

105
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,660
And,
and the,

106
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,820
the dominant songbirds,
no,

107
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,820
they don't live together crozer social,
but most songbirds aren't.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,360
The dominant songbirds get the best nest
and the best nest is the one that 

109
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,670
doesn't get rained on and isn't,
it's not too windy and it's close to 

110
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,751
food sources and you know,
and so then they have the healthiest 

111
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:50,350
chicks and they attract the best mates 
and like it's really important where 

112
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:54,071
you're positioned in the hierarchy,
even if you're not like a flock or herd 

113
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:54,071
creature.

114
00:06:54,071 --> 00:06:56,510
Now we're more like herd creatures.
So it's even more,

115
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,940
it's even,
it's even more relevant to us,

116
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,630
but there's just no escaping a 
hierarchical arrangement in,

117
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,520
in,
in social being.

118
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,910
That is social being and,
and,

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,080
and it's evolutionarily ancient beyond 
conception.

120
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,050
So 300 million years ago there weren't 
trees,

121
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,830
you know,
I mean,

122
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,920
so the dominance hierarchies older than 
trees.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,050
So that's really something to think 
about.

124
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:26,051
And then you know,
when you're thinking about the reality 

125
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:27,140
that shaped us say from an evolutionary 
perspective,

126
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:32,141
but also from a cultural perspective,
what you have to understand is that the 

127
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:36,230
things that have shaped us most are the 
things that have been around the longest

128
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:41,231
and so you could say those are the most 
real things and you can't even see some 

129
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:41,570
of them.
Like,

130
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,600
it's not like you can come in here.
Well it's not exactly true.

131
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
You can't come in here and see the 
multiple dominance hierarchies that are 

132
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:49,720
at work.

133
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,710
You can't in a way because the chairs 
are set up to face this way and I'm 

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,420
facing that way.
That gives you some clues about the 

135
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,240
social order here and you take the cues 
instantly,

136
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,470
right?
You come down,

137
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,680
you sit in the chairs,
you organize yourselves according to 

138
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,950
mutual expectation,
and that's part of your procedural 

139
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,040
knowledge about how to behave as a 
social creature.

140
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,490
Now that knowledge is really,
really deep and a lot of it's coded in 

141
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,310
your behavior now and another people's 
behavior as well and that's you know,

142
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:24,311
that's,
that's the expectations you have of 

143
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,711
other people,
end of yourself and a lot of those are 

144
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:26,711
implicit,
right?

145
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:27,230
So when we're interacting,
there's,

146
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,260
there's a,
there's a very large number of things 

147
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,250
that you just don't get to do and you 
know that too and you won't do them.

148
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,280
And that way we can act as if we 
understand each other even though we 

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,781
don't because you're really complicated 
and I'm really complicated and there's 

150
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:45,830
lots of situations where we might really
be in conflict,

151
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,760
but because we share a map of the 
culture,

152
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,370
the cultural expectations,
it makes part of our.

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,400
It's built right into our perception.
You will act out that set of 

154
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,350
expectations and so will I,
and if neither of us can do that,

155
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,420
even if one of us can't,
we're going to stay.

156
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,480
We're either going to immediately 
devolve into conflict or we're going to 

157
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,051
avoid each other like the plague,
and that's exactly the right thing to 

158
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,561
do,
and so one of the really useful things 

159
00:09:15,561 --> 00:09:16,890
to understand in this took me a long 
time to formulate properly.

160
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,140
You know,
you hear the terror management theorists

161
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,810
for example,
and they have this idea that you're.

162
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,070
You're meaning representation.
The story you tell about the world 

163
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,050
regulates your,
your death,

164
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,610
anxiety.
It's something like that,

165
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,850
but that's not right.
I mean it's close to right and it's a 

166
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:34,850
smart idea.
It came from Ernest Becker,

167
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,441
by the way,
who wrote a book called the denial of 

168
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:39,441
death,
which is actually quite a good book even

169
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:39,441
though it's wrong,
you know,

170
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,460
sometimes a book can be very useful.

171
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,540
It can be usefully wrong in that,
and Becker's book is usefully wrong 

172
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,640
because he thought that it's the 
internal representation of your belief 

173
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:57,681
system that regulates your anxiety and 
that anxiety is fundamentally in the 

174
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,120
final analysis anxiety about death.
It's like,

175
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,230
well,
okay,

176
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:04,470
fine.
It's a reasonable proposition,

177
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,180
but that isn't how it works.
You see,

178
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,780
it isn't my beliefs right now that are 
regulating my emotions.

179
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,010
It's the fact that I'm acting out those 
beliefs which include implicit 

180
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,140
perceptions.
I'm acting them out and so are you,

181
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,920
and so what you're doing and what I 
expect more,

182
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,590
more accurately,
what you're doing and what I want you to

183
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,460
do and the way I want you to react to me
that's working,

184
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,390
so it's the match between my belief 
system and the way everyone else is 

185
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,220
acting that's regulating my emotions.
It's not the belief system.

186
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,630
It's mediated by the social culture and 
you see if you understand this,

187
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:47,631
then you understand more particularly 
why people are willing to fight to the 

188
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,170
bitter end to protect their culture.

189
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,230
It's not a psychological structure that 
they're protecting.

190
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,600
It's a psychological structure and a 
sociological structures,

191
00:10:56,601 --> 00:11:00,900
symbol tanium.
So the social contract is you have a set

192
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:05,190
of expectations and I have a set of 
expectations there actually desires.

193
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,520
They're not merely expectations because 
as living creatures,

194
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:13,521
we're desirous,
we don't just expect and so you desired 

195
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:17,280
outcome and I desired outcome and we 
agree to act in accordance with that.

196
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,700
That's the social contract,
and so people don't like having that 

197
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:22,700
disrupted.
Well,

198
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,140
it isn't because it's psychologically 
destabilizes them.

199
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Although it does.
It's because it actually destabilizes 

200
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,570
stuff,
right?

201
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:35,571
If all of a sudden we can't occupy the 
same specified domain of territory,

202
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,870
it isn't only that we're thrown into 
psychological disarray,

203
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:44,871
although we will be.
It's that will start fighting with each 

204
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:45,870
other like,
and that can kill you.

205
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,210
It's no joke.
It kills people a lot.

206
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,360
Like it happens.
It can happen very easily,

207
00:11:51,361 --> 00:11:56,361
that are cohesive.
Social Group can fragment along some 

208
00:11:56,361 --> 00:11:56,830
fracture line of identity,
let's say.

209
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,380
And all hell breaks loose.
You know,

210
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,320
that's what happened with the Tutsis and
the Hutus and in,

211
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,080
uh,
in Rwanda,

212
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,110
you know,
and those things can get out of control 

213
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,270
just so fast.
It's just unbelievable.

214
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,390
And so,
and that wasn't death anxiety,

215
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:15,820
that was death.
That's a whole different thing.

216
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:19,270
And that's the other thing that Tara 
management people don't exactly get.

217
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,700
It's like,
it isn't just that your culture and your

218
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:25,780
cultural beliefs protect you from 
anxiety and say anxiety about death.

219
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:30,781
Even it's that they actually protect you
from death as well as protecting you 

220
00:12:30,781 --> 00:12:31,520
from death,
anxiety.

221
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:32,080
I mean,
look,

222
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,580
it's warm in here.
It's cold outside.

223
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,650
The fact that the culture is intact 
means that you're not outside freezing.

224
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,180
That's a hell of a lot more fundamental 
in some sense than mere anxiety.

225
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,630
Although I'm not trying to underplay the
role of anxiety.

226
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:54,631
That's a major issue,
but there's something that's a lot more 

227
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:55,150
fundamental at stake than mere 
psychology,

228
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,480
so it's the match between your map of 
the world and other people's actions 

229
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:05,671
that regulates your emotion and it 
regulates it completely because you know

230
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:12,151
if,
if someone in here started acting 

231
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:12,151
seriously,
deranged,

232
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:16,530
like brandish a pistol,
let's say all of a sudden you would not 

233
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,540
be in the same place at all,
not a bit,

234
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,580
and so what would happen?
Well,

235
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,010
chaos would happen and chaos isn't just 
that you would get anxious.

236
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,100
That's not a good enough explanation.
What would happen is more complex than 

237
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,801
not.
What happens in some senses that your 

238
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,820
body and it does this,
does this.

239
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,850
What would happen is that you would 
react the same way that it reacts to a 

240
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,400
cat.
It's exactly that.

241
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,430
It's exactly that.
You would respond as if a terrible 

242
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,870
Predator had emerged in your midst.
And so what is that reaction?

243
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,871
Well,
it's not just anxiety because when you 

244
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:58,590
encounter a Predator,
anxiety isn't the only thing that's 

245
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,261
useful that just makes you freeze.
It's like that could be the worst thing 

246
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:04,321
you could do.
You freeze and while you're a pretty 

247
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:06,991
easy target.
So you have to be prepared for a lot 

248
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:09,871
broader range of responses.
The Mirror Mirror Mirror,

249
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,380
petro,
fication,

250
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,250
like how about a little aggression that 
might be helpful.

251
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,200
You don't know.
It also might get you killed,

252
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:22,201
but you know,
maybe you can take the guy down and 

253
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:22,201
maybe that's a good idea.
You know,

254
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:23,830
and,
and maybe you have to run.

255
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:28,831
So that's disinhibited as well and maybe
you have to think really quickly and 

256
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,550
reflexively.
So that happens.

257
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,040
That's activated,
disinhibited I would say as well.

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
It's like your whole being is thrown 
into intense concentration on the moment

259
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,320
and you're burning up physiological 
resources like mad.

260
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,300
And so what will happen after something 
like that,

261
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,930
if you don't develop outright 
posttraumatic stress disorder,

262
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:51,931
which some of you would,
is that you assuming that the situation 

263
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:54,710
was brought under control,
you'd walk out of here shaking with your

264
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:59,711
heart rate at one 70 and it would take 
you like while it might take you the 

265
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,940
rest of your life,
and maybe you would never recover,

266
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:05,540
but you can bloody well be sure that it 
would take you the rest of the day.

267
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,780
That's for sure.
And so it's no joke when someone steps 

268
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,520
steps outside the confines of the social
contract,

269
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,840
right?
And that's Kinda.

270
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,040
There's a philosopher named hobbs who I 
suppose in some sense was essentially 

271
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,160
conservative philosopher as opposed to 
Russo,

272
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,960
who's kind of his exact opposite.

273
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,820
Rousseau believed that people were 
basically good in their natural state.

274
00:15:28,821 --> 00:15:33,821
So he believed nature was basically good
and he believed that culture was 

275
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:34,830
corrupted people.
And so and uh,

276
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,560
uh,
Hobbs,

277
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,570
Thomas hobbes believed exactly the 
opposite.

278
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:43,571
He believed that in the state of nature,
let's say every person was at every 

279
00:15:43,571 --> 00:15:48,371
other person's throat.
And the only thing that prevented 

280
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:52,630
continual chaos was the imposition of a,
of a collective agreement that would be 

281
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:57,971
the social contract that essentially 
governed how people would interact and 

282
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:00,470
that would keep that underlying chaos at
bay.

283
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,710
And you know,
my contention is is that hobbes was 

284
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,210
correct and Russolo was correct.
And,

285
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:11,410
and,
and I think that if you add Russo and 

286
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,260
hobbs together,
you get a total picture of the world.

287
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:17,261
And that's really,
I think the picture of the world that 

288
00:16:17,261 --> 00:16:17,360
I'm trying to relate to you.
It's both at once.

289
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,360
It's like,
well you can't just attribute human 

290
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,640
malevolence and unpredictability to 
society.

291
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,580
It's just,
it's a nonstarter.

292
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:32,581
It's like people build society.
So all you're doing is pushing the 

293
00:16:32,581 --> 00:16:32,780
problem back.
It's like where did it come from?

294
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,130
Well,
society,

295
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,910
the society before.
Well then the one before that,

296
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,250
it's like,
well you got to tangle up the individual

297
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:43,040
in there at some point because people 
created society.

298
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,510
And so you can't just blame human 
irrationality and malevolence on 

299
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:49,850
society.
Well,

300
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,820
and also it's,
it's ungrateful for God's sake.

301
00:16:52,821 --> 00:16:56,120
It's like society obviously also makes 
you peaceful.

302
00:16:56,121 --> 00:17:01,121
Part of the reason you're a peaceful 
right now all of you is because while 

303
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,570
you're not that hungry,
you're certainly not starving to death.

304
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:07,571
You would be a very,
very different person if you were 

305
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:07,571
starving right now,
you know,

306
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:12,100
or if you were enraged or if you were 
panicking or if you were terrified 

307
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,100
because your.

308
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,810
Your future was radically uncertain.
I mean,

309
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,720
you're just not any of those people 
right now.

310
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,190
You're satiated that I mean that 
technically you're satisfied.

311
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,940
None of your biological systems except 
perhaps curiosity,

312
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:31,150
which is a rather pleasant emotion are 
activated in the least and you know,

313
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,110
because of that,
you all think,

314
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,610
well,
you're in control of yourself,

315
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,700
but don't be thinking that that's just 
not right.

316
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,090
I mean,
if you look at how the brain is 

317
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:43,090
structured,
for example,

318
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,300
the Hypothalamus,
which is a really important part of the 

319
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,300
brain,
it basically,

320
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,350
it basically establishes the framework 
of reference and the actions,

321
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,700
the framework of reference within which 
and the actions you take in order to 

322
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,751
fulfill basic biological needs.
So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty 

323
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:01,770
and the hypothalamus makes you hungry 
and it makes you sexually aroused.

324
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,430
If it puts you into a state of defensive
aggression and it,

325
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,480
it actually also makes you explore and 
be curious.

326
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,040
All of that,
hypothalamic,

327
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,260
it's an amazing structure.
And then,

328
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,560
and it's really small and it's right at 
the base of the brain.

329
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,970
Um,
and you could imagine it as something 

330
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,441
that has tremendously powerful 
projections upward throughout the rest 

331
00:18:24,441 --> 00:18:28,281
of the brain,
into the emotional systems in the 

332
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,640
cortical systems and all of that,
like tree trunk size connections,

333
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,320
you know,
metaphorically speaking.

334
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:33,810
And then the cortex has these little 
like vine,

335
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:37,290
like tendrils going down to regulate the
hypothalamus,

336
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,100
you know,
and if it's,

337
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,190
when push comes to shove man,
the hypothalamus that thing winds.

338
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,730
And so,
you know,

339
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:48,780
you get people now and then who have a 
hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them

340
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,990
produces a condition called,
I can't remember it.

341
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,580
It's not dip.
So mania,

342
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,490
although it's,
it's like that doesn't matter.

343
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,820
It produces uncontrollable thirst.
And so what will happen is that people 

344
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,820
who have this hypothalamic problem will 
drown themselves by drinking water,

345
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,320
which,
which you can do by the way.

346
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,950
Uh,
and so they just cannot get enough water

347
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,920
and there's no stopping them,
right?

348
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,290
No,
no more than there would be stopping you

349
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,450
if you were suffering from raging 
thirst.

350
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:23,451
It's like,
it's a happy day when the hypothalamus 

351
00:19:23,451 --> 00:19:23,490
is not telling you what to do and you 
know,

352
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:27,270
you live in such a civilized state that 
most of the time,

353
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,470
roughly speaking,
you're tranquil and satisfied and more 

354
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,000
or less you can imagine yourself as a 
peaceful,

355
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,390
you know,
productive well meaning entity,

356
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,420
but don't be thinking that that's what 
you'd be if you were put in the right 

357
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:47,700
situation because that's just not right 
at all.

358
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,620
So,
you know,

359
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,680
lots of times soldiers develop 
posttraumatic stress disorder because 

360
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:54,870
they go out to the battlefield,
they're kind of naive.

361
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,130
They're young guys,
you know,

362
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,000
and,
and,

363
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:57,600
and,
uh,

364
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,750
it actually is worse if they're not that
bright.

365
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,780
It turns out because having a lower Iq 
is one of the things that predisposes 

366
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:05,780
you to post traumatic stress disorder.

367
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,700
But anyways,
they go out in the battlefield and they 

368
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:10,830
see what they're capable of under 
battlefield conditions.

369
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,910
And like,
you know,

370
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,980
we,
we had been fighting wars for a very 

371
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:16,980
long time,
millions of years,

372
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,651
you know,
chimps basically have wars with other 

373
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:21,651
chimps,
the troops,

374
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:25,880
right?
Because the juveniles will patrol the 

375
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,850
perimeter,
the perimeter of their territory and if 

376
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,160
they find other chimps from other troops
that they outnumber,

377
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,790
they will tear them to pieces like in 
chimps are really,

378
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:37,791
really strong.
And so when I say they'll tear them to 

379
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:37,791
pieces,
I mean that literally,

380
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:37,791
you know,
they,

381
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:42,650
they tear them to pieces.
And Jane Goodall discovered that 

382
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,251
originally in the 19 seventies,
she didn't even report it for awhile 

383
00:20:46,251 --> 00:20:47,100
because she was so shocked,
you know,

384
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,110
she kind of assumed like most followers 
of ruth soul,

385
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,220
that the human proclivity for warfare 
was part.

386
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,340
That part.
That was something that was a uniquely 

387
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,340
human.

388
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,340
You know,
it had something to do with our,

389
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,320
our unique self consciousness or 
intelligence or something like that.

390
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,460
She had no idea that it was rooted that 
deeply,

391
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:06,920
you know,
we,

392
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,880
we split from chimps about six,
7 million years ago,

393
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:14,020
something like that.
And so we were patrolling territory.

394
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,080
We were gang members 7 million years ago
and you know at that that's minimum 

395
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:26,251
estimation because of course that 
ancestor shaded back maybe 20 million 

396
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:33,151
years into entities that were roughly 
primate like and so territoriality and a

397
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,070
and a proclivity to defend territory is 
so deeply embedded in us.

398
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,370
It's,
it's,

399
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,250
it's like,
it's,

400
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,280
it's like it's the control center for 
our whole brain and so there isn't 

401
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:49,120
anything more important to us,
I would say.

402
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:54,121
Then maintaining the match between what 
we want to have happen and what other 

403
00:21:56,951 --> 00:21:59,350
people are doing in response to our 
actions.

404
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,270
Like that's that that's what we want and
as long as that match is maintained,

405
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,630
then our emotional systems and I would 
say anxiety's probably primary in that 

406
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:10,540
regard.

407
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,780
Our emotional systems remain inhibited.
They're on,

408
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,820
they're ready,
like,

409
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,900
like a nuclear reactor.
Rods are on and the rest of the brain 

410
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,721
dampens them down.
But it's like if you don't want them to 

411
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:27,721
take time to start up,
man,

412
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,630
you want them to be on at a,
at a 10th of a second's notice when it's

413
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,870
necessary.
And so,

414
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:33,850
you know,
that's kind of why.

415
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,800
Well,
if you look like look at a wild animal,

416
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:40,801
it's like it's alert,
you know it's ready to dark this way or 

417
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,580
that way,
especially a prey animal instantaneously

418
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:47,581
and it has reflex is built into it as 
you do that will respond way before your

419
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,080
conscious.
So for example,

420
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,650
if you happen to be walking down a trail
and you detect something snake like in 

421
00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:00,001
the periphery,
you'll leap away before you even know 

422
00:23:00,001 --> 00:23:04,140
that you lapped and,
but that's because it takes a fair bit 

423
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,291
of time to actually see a snake by which
I mean form a conscious representation 

424
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,920
of the snake,
you know,

425
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:11,500
and maybe it takes a quarter of a second
or something like that,

426
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,320
or even longer,
but it doesn't matter.

427
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,820
Maybe it takes 10.
No 20th of a set a 10th of a second.

428
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:21,730
But the thing about the damn snake is 
it's way faster than that.

429
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,440
It's really fast.
That thing,

430
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:28,441
and it evolved with primates by the way.
And so it can nail you like way faster 

431
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:32,830
than you can look at it.
So you have your eyes map,

432
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,860
snake like objects,
right onto your reflexes so that the 

433
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,520
eyes go to eyes make you jump,
and then they see after that,

434
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:41,980
it's like,
yeah,

435
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:44,510
well now you can see that's no problem,
you know,

436
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,460
so.
Alright,

437
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,680
alright,
now what I would say that what we do is 

438
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,960
we live in a shared story and the story 
is a way of looking at the world and its

439
00:23:56,961 --> 00:23:58,880
way of acting in the world at the same 
time.

440
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,570
And that story has to operate within 
narrow parameters.

441
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,630
And this is something that's 
extraordinarily important to understand 

442
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,930
because,
and this is something I think that 

443
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,971
piaget figured out,
John Piaget figured out better than 

444
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:12,971
anyone else.

445
00:24:12,971 --> 00:24:13,400
I think he really got this right.
And by the way,

446
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:15,500
one of the things that piaget was trying
to do,

447
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,740
you never hear about how strange these 
great thinkers are.

448
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:21,470
But Piaget was a very strange guy and he
was a,

449
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,620
he was a hyper genius.
He was offered the curatorship of a 

450
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,830
bloody museum when he was 10 years old,
you know,

451
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,930
because he wrote this little paper on 
mollusks,

452
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:34,931
which parent was a very good and so they
offered him the curatorship of a museum 

453
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:35,840
and his parents wrote back and said,
well,

454
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,580
you know,
no,

455
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,680
probably not because he's,
he's actually ted.

456
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,610
And so that was piaget man,
the guy who was a genius and you know,

457
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:48,611
he,
he was actually motivated by the desire 

458
00:24:48,611 --> 00:24:49,130
to reconcile science and religion.
That was,

459
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,000
that was actually his entire motivation 
for what he did.

460
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:55,310
You never hear that,
but that's the case.

461
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,970
And so piaget was very interested in how
you produce structures that enable you 

462
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:04,280
to regulate yourself because you're like
a kind of a,

463
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:09,550
a colony of strange sub animals that 
have to figure out how to get along so 

464
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,841
that you can sort of be one thing.
You kind of learned that I would say 

465
00:25:13,841 --> 00:25:15,620
between the ages of two and four as 
you're being socialized,

466
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:17,750
you know how erratic two year olds are.
I mean,

467
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,060
they're a blast and it's part because 
they were erratic.

468
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:25,061
It's like they're unbelievably happy and
then they're unbelievably hungry and 

469
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:27,470
then they're really hot and then they're
really upset and crying,

470
00:25:27,471 --> 00:25:28,820
you know,
and then they're really scared.

471
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:31,670
It's like,
and all of that just untrammeled.

472
00:25:31,671 --> 00:25:33,380
And so it's really fun to be around 
them,

473
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:36,050
especially when they're happy because 
they're so happy that it's just,

474
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
you know,
you don't ever get to be that happy and 

475
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,471
so it's nice to be around the two year 
old because you can kinda feel that 

476
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,270
again,
you know,

477
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,180
in a lot of what the.

478
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,190
One of the horrible things about being a
parent is that you spend a tremendous 

479
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,360
amount of your time making your child 
less happy.

480
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,890
And the reason for that is that positive
emotion is a very impulsive,

481
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,870
you know,
and you know because everybody says,

482
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,860
well,
you should be happy.

483
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:02,330
It's like,
well no,

484
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,790
when you're happy you're actually quite 
stupid.

485
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,610
And so because happiness makes you 
impulsive,

486
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:09,710
happiness makes happiness says,
hey,

487
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:14,711
things are really good right now.
Get what you can while the getting's 

488
00:26:14,711 --> 00:26:15,140
good.
And so as a,

489
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,060
like,
if you're hyper optimistic,

490
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,510
manic will say it's like every stock 
investment looks like a really good 

491
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,140
stock investment.
It's like you won't spend all your money

492
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:29,141
because look at those wonderful things 
everywhere and you could do such great 

493
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:29,330
things with them and then,
you know,

494
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,320
you spend all your money and then you 
crash and you think,

495
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,820
Oh God,
my life's over,

496
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:35,750
you know,
because I just,

497
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,290
I just spent all my money on all this 
useless stuff.

498
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,900
And it's all under the grip of 
impulsive,

499
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,740
positive emotion,
you know?

500
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:48,741
And so when,
when you're telling your kids to be 

501
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:50,850
quiet and settled down,
it isn't because they're making a lot of

502
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,550
noise.
Being in pain is because they're running

503
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:58,500
around like wild baboons having a blast 
and disrupting things like mad,

504
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:00,090
you know,
and you got kids,

505
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:01,380
you got to settle down,
you know,

506
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:06,381
like quit having so much fun and it's,
it's kind of awful that you do that,

507
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
but what you do.
And that's because the emotions and the 

508
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:17,091
motivations have to be brought into a 
relationship with one another within the

509
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,660
person.
So that,

510
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,110
you know,
one thing I remember with my son who is 

511
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,110
quite,
he's quite disagreeable by temperament,

512
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,220
which is actually a good thing as far as
I'm concerned,

513
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:31,221
although it brings its own challenges.
And so with my daughter when she was 

514
00:27:31,221 --> 00:27:35,100
misbehaving,
she was pretty agreeable and uh,

515
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,850
you know,
if she was misbehaving I could basically

516
00:27:38,851 --> 00:27:41,250
just look at her and then she'd quit,
you know,

517
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:44,390
but my son was like,
that was just nothing.

518
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,450
You're looking at me.
It's like,

519
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:47,460
no,
that's not gonna go anywhere man.

520
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,790
And so then I'd tell him to stop and 
that really wasn't having much of an 

521
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,751
effect either.
He just sort of maybe laugh or runaway 

522
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:56,751
or whatever.
I mean,

523
00:27:56,751 --> 00:28:00,471
he was a tough little rat and you know,
what I would do with him is he would be 

524
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:04,500
doing something and it interfered and 
he'd get upset and you know,

525
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,770
angry.
And so then I get them to sit on the 

526
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:09,770
steps and I told him when he was about 
to,

527
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,650
I said,
look,

528
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:12,450
you're going to sit on the steps.
That's time out.

529
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,480
You're going to sit on the steps until 
you've got control of yourself and you 

530
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,610
can come back and be and play the family
game again.

531
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I basically said,
be a civilized human being and then 

532
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,130
you're welcome again,
and so he'd sit on the steps.

533
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,970
It was so interesting to watch because 
he was just enraged.

534
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,100
He'd sit there like,
have you ever seen a two year old have a

535
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:35,040
temper tantrum?
It's really quite the bloody phenomena.

536
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,470
If you ever saw an adult do that,
you'd like,

537
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,480
you'd call nine one one right away.
And it's like,

538
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:41,910
Oh my God,
I've seen adults do that.

539
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,940
You know,
because people say with borderline 

540
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:46,940
personality disorder will have temper 
tantrums,

541
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,640
and it's like,
man,

542
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,100
you want to be about 30 feet away from 
that person.

543
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,480
That's for sure.
It's really.

544
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,600
But in kids it's like,
well first of all,

545
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:59,601
they're only this long,
so how much trouble can they really 

546
00:28:59,601 --> 00:28:59,601
cause?
But it's like,

547
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:00,210
you know,
they're just completely gone there.

548
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:04,530
Like on the floor of their face is red.
They're just furious,

549
00:29:04,531 --> 00:29:09,531
like way more furious than you ever get.
If you are even vaguely socialized 

550
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:09,531
there.

551
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,840
Just outraged and they're kicking and 
hitting the ground and like,

552
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,690
it's like a little epileptic fits of 
anger,

553
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:20,691
you know,
they're completely controlled by their 

554
00:29:20,691 --> 00:29:22,750
rage and we took care of one kid for 
awhile who he was actually a pushover,

555
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,990
that kid you could get them to behave 
by,

556
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,670
you know,
kind of shaking your finger at him.

557
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:29,460
But his mother thought he was really 
tough because he had her,

558
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,820
he had her figured out and one of the 
things he would do is have a temperature

559
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,880
temper tantrum and during the temper 
tantrum he would hold his bloody breath 

560
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,000
until he turned blue.
It's like,

561
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,530
try that,
like you know,

562
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:45,531
as that's your homework.
Go home and go home and have a temper 

563
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:47,260
tantrum and while you're doing it,
hold your breath until you actually turn

564
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:49,270
blue.
It's like you won't be able to do it.

565
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,430
You don't have the willpower of a two 
year old,

566
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,420
that's for sure.

567
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,700
That little varmint man,
he just had a fit.

568
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,920
Then he'd hold his breath and then he 
turned blue.

569
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,820
It was like,
wow,

570
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,110
that's,
that's amazing.

571
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,030
And we would just like,
let them do it.

572
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,540
You know.
He turned blue and everybody would be 

573
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,540
gone and he'd come out of it,
you know,

574
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,610
and it didn't work.
So he just quit doing it.

575
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,010
I think he did it like twice and he 
figured out,

576
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:15,460
oh well that's a lot of work for very 
little outcome and you know,

577
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:17,380
it's not like two year olds are stupid.
They're,

578
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,470
they're not stupid.
They're probably smarter than you,

579
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,710
but they're not civilized by any stretch
of the imagination.

580
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:25,210
And so anyways,
back to my son,

581
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,490
I'd put them on the steps and he'd be 
like,

582
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,920
oh,
it's just like aged and trying to get 

583
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:32,920
himself together,
you know?

584
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,720
And I wait a few,
few,

585
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,860
I got a strict rule which was as soon as
you're done,

586
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,690
you're welcome again.

587
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,290
So it's completely under your control.
You,

588
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,090
you get yourself calmed down,
you come and talk to me again.

589
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,250
If you're calm enough,
so I like you,

590
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,190
then you're welcome back in the family.
No grudge or nothing.

591
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,180
And so it's harder than you think.
Like people think they liked their kids.

592
00:30:55,181 --> 00:31:00,181
It's like,
don't be thinking that they're hard to 

593
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:00,181
like they're little monsters and they're
very,

594
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:04,561
very pushy.
And provocative and so lots of parents 

595
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:07,351
do not like their children and they do 
terrible things to them their whole 

596
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:11,341
life.
So it's no joke and it's a very common 

597
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,280
and you know,
that was Freud's observation,

598
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:17,281
fundamental observation that a lot of 
psychopathology is rooted in the family 

599
00:31:17,281 --> 00:31:18,520
and you can be sure of that,
you know,

600
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:23,521
and when you hear about some mother 
who's done something terrible to her 

601
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:24,190
child,
which happens reasonably frequently,

602
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:28,780
you know perfectly well that she has a 
very terrible capacity to discipline.

603
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,780
The child is just provoked her and 
provoked or unprovoked or and provoked 

604
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,021
or unprovoked or.
And it just happens to be a day where 

605
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,750
her new boyfriend left and she's quite 
hung over and she got fired and it's 

606
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,591
like that was the wrong data provoker.
And then she does something that is not 

607
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,580
good and you read about it and you 
think,

608
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:46,780
well,
how could that happen?

609
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,250
How could anyone do that?
Well,

610
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,830
that's how they do it.
And so,

611
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,710
and kids are very provocative,
just like little chimps.

612
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,280
Chimps will.
The adolescents will like throw little 

613
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,031
pebbles and sticks at the sleeping 
larger males and bug them and that 

614
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:04,420
teasing,
which it is,

615
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,330
that teasing turns into full fledged 
dominance,

616
00:32:07,331 --> 00:32:10,210
challenged behavior.
Once the adolescent males get big enough

617
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:15,211
to do it.
And so when you're being provoked by a 

618
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:15,211
child,
which they provoke your time,

619
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,380
you're trying to figure out,
well,

620
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,590
just where are you exactly?
What happens if I do this?

621
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:22,030
What happens if I do this,
you know,

622
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:24,040
and how else are they going to figure it
out?

623
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,780
Anyways,
he'd sit on the steps and just,

624
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,310
he's just enraged and trying to control 
himself.

625
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:32,410
And I'd watched that and then,
you know,

626
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:36,660
I come back after about two minutes or 
whatever and he'd still be around.

627
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,750
I'd say,
well are,

628
00:32:37,751 --> 00:32:40,010
you know,
have you got yourself under control?

629
00:32:40,011 --> 00:32:41,210
Are you ready to get it off the steps?

630
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,500
And then,
you know,

631
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:48,900
he'd get himself under control and then 
he'd come back and you know,

632
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,770
he'd be contrite and then I would like 
them right away.

633
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,270
You know,
you go to watch that,

634
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:58,271
you know,
because you don't like being dominated 

635
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:58,271
by a two year old.
No one does,

636
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:02,620
and so if the child hasn't mastered 
himself and started to act in accordance

637
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:07,760
with the prevailing social norms,
you won't like them while you think,

638
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:12,761
oh yeah,
I will because you know I'm a good 

639
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:12,761
person.
It's like,

640
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:12,761
no,
you won't,

641
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:12,761
and no,
you're not a good person,

642
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:14,540
so don't be thinking about that at all.
It's just not true.

643
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,900
So when he was contrite,
then he'd come and then we just go on 

644
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:22,610
like nothing had happened because that's
what you want to do,

645
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:25,010
right?
As soon as you get compliance,

646
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,980
especially if the compliance is in the 
best interest of the child,

647
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,410
you want to reward it instantly,
right?

648
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,310
That's the right thing to do because.
So then and,

649
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,340
and you could just see him gaining 
control over himself.

650
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:41,750
And so really what was happening is his,
in his mind,

651
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,040
in his brain will say there was a war 
between the psyche,

652
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:51,041
the ego that was starting to become 
integrated and starting to become a 

653
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,400
continuous person,
an identity,

654
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,510
and it's fragile in two year olds and it
can be disrupted all the time and it is.

655
00:33:56,511 --> 00:33:59,360
That's why they're so hyper emotional.
It's fragile,

656
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:04,361
that little eagle and it doesn't have a 
lot of power and so what you want to do 

657
00:34:04,361 --> 00:34:06,720
is reward it when it wins,
when it,

658
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,290
when he gets control over the underlying
motivations,

659
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:09,920
you want to say,
hey,

660
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:11,750
good work man,
good work kid.

661
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:12,860
You did it.
You know,

662
00:34:12,861 --> 00:34:15,470
you guard yourself under control way to 
be.

663
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:20,650
And the kids really happy about that 
because it's actually not that much fun 

664
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,560
to have a temper tantrum.
It's exhausting.

665
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,260
You know,
it takes you over question.

666
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,220
Oh,
just pat on the head or you know,

667
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,390
that's good.
That's a kind word,

668
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:33,020
you know,
or,

669
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,870
or whatever earth.
Yeah.

670
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,200
Notice it,
pay attention.

671
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,160
That's it.
That's it.

672
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:42,190
Pay attention and that's a great.
It's a great thing to know with people 

673
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,660
like in your relationships here.
Here's the key to a good relationship.

674
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:49,580
It's not the only one,
but watch your person carefully,

675
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,020
carefully,
carefully,

676
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,170
and whenever they do something that you 
would like them to do more of,

677
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,440
tell them that that was really good and 
mean it.

678
00:34:57,441 --> 00:35:00,290
And it's not manipulative because if 
it's manipulated it won't work.

679
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,030
It's like you have to say,
wow,

680
00:35:02,031 --> 00:35:04,340
I'm so glad you did that.
Did you have to be precise?

681
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,120
Here's what you just did that I thought 
was great and Oh boy,

682
00:35:08,121 --> 00:35:10,970
that's so nice that you've noticed.
I can't believe they can notice.

683
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,050
It's like,
you know,

684
00:35:12,051 --> 00:35:15,110
you do that 20 times and the person will
be like the rat.

685
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,150
That's just pushing the lever for 
cocaine.

686
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,050
You know,
so,

687
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:19,130
but no,
I'm serious.

688
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:22,970
It's a skinner established this bf 
skinner noticed this a long time ago.

689
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,410
Reward is intensely useful in terms of 
modifying behavior,

690
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:32,411
but the problem is is that it's really 
hard to notice when things are going 

691
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:33,230
right,
right?

692
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:38,231
Because of your kind of primed to notice
when things are going wrong and so you 

693
00:35:38,231 --> 00:35:41,430
use threat and punishment more often as 
agents of,

694
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,570
of shaping the people that you're around
because you know when everything's going

695
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,320
right,
it's like,

696
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,430
what are you going to say?
Everything's going right.

697
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,580
It turns to zero.
You just assume it and that's,

698
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,620
that's not good.
That's not good.

699
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,290
You want to pay attention and if the 
person,

700
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,550
your children,
your wife,

701
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:01,830
your whoever,
your mother,

702
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,860
your sister,
if you want them to,

703
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,090
if you want to rectify your 
relationships with them,

704
00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:11,300
and I'm not saying to do this in a 
manipulative way,

705
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,370
won't work,
but if they do something that's 

706
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:16,370
promoting harmony and peace and 
goodwill,

707
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,820
it's like attend to it.

708
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:21,270
Tell them that you noticed.
It's like it's so useful and you have to

709
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,970
get rid of your grudges and your 
resentment to do that,

710
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,240
right?
Because you don't want you to kind of 

711
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,240
mad at your sister and then you know she
does something good.

712
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,200
You think there is no god damn way,
I'm going to reward you for that.

713
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:33,480
So you ignore her.
When she does something good.

714
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,100
It's like,
that's brilliant.

715
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:38,580
That is because then you've just 
punished her for doing what you want,

716
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,190
and people do that with their kids all 
the time,

717
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,620
you know,
because they let the kids dominate them.

718
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,220
Then they get resentful.
Then the kid will run up to them to show

719
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:52,221
them something that's kind of 
spectacular and they'll they're not 

720
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:52,221
happy.
They'll like,

721
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:52,221
oh yeah,
that's,

722
00:36:52,221 --> 00:36:52,620
you know,
I'm,

723
00:36:52,621 --> 00:36:53,460
I'm,
I'm working,

724
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:59,290
you know,
little kid has all sad about that and 

725
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,511
he's just learned something so,
and it's not perhaps what you want them 

726
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:02,511
to learn.

727
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:07,940
And so you have to keep your,
your relationship with your children 

728
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,391
pristine.
And that means that you can't hold a 

729
00:37:11,391 --> 00:37:15,021
grudge or resent them and that means 
that you have to help them learn how to 

730
00:37:15,021 --> 00:37:17,640
behave so that you liked them and that 
way if they,

731
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:22,641
if you like them and you're kind of 
sensible and maybe your partner also 

732
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:22,650
likes them.
So you know,

733
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:27,651
you got to consensus going there,
there's a reasonable possibility that 

734
00:37:27,651 --> 00:37:29,820
other people will actually like them to 
including other children.

735
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,850
And then the world will open up to them,
you know,

736
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,880
then you'll bring them to people's 
houses and the people will actually 

737
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,050
smile at them and given them a pat on 
the head and instead of thinking,

738
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,060
oh my God,
that brands coming to visit again,

739
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:44,210
I wonder what he'll break this time.
You know?

740
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:49,250
And that's just a horrible thing for 
your child to experience repetitively in

741
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,720
situation after situation.

742
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,750
All they learned is that adults have a 
false smile,

743
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,720
but they're really lying all the time.
God,

744
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,680
it's like a bit of hell and there's a 
lot of children who are trapped in that.

745
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:06,681
It's really awful to see.
I can see kids like that when I walked 

746
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:06,681
down the street,
you know,

747
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:10,410
it's like their little doomed things and
there they are and you know,

748
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,770
they're screwed in 15 different ways and
there's no way out of it.

749
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:18,771
It's really awful.
So I would not recommend that you do 

750
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:22,881
that.
It's better to notice that you're a bit 

751
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:24,981
of a monster or a lot of a monster and 
notice that you are much happier with 

752
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:31,521
the people around you when they behave 
in accordance with reasonable source 

753
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:34,740
social norms and then you actually feel 
genuinely connected to them and you want

754
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:37,360
to work their behalf so that everything 
works out.

755
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:42,870
But if you think you're a good person 
and that you'd never do anything that 

756
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,811
was harmful to your children,
then you can just forget about that 

757
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:47,050
because you'll never take it seriously 
enough to actually learn.

758
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,590
So.
Alright.

759
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,690
So anyways,
we live inside this story as far as I 

760
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,170
can tell and you know,
we kind of put the story together inside

761
00:38:56,171 --> 00:39:01,171
us to begin with and that happens 
between two and four when you're 

762
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:04,530
integrating those motivations and 
emotions into a relatively functional 

763
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,040
unity,
right?

764
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,720
And,
and,

765
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:11,721
and,
and that does happen between two and 

766
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,591
four.
If you don't have your kids socialized 

767
00:39:13,591 --> 00:39:15,751
by the time,
therefore you might as well just forget 

768
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:18,031
it.
And I know that sounds terribly 

769
00:39:18,031 --> 00:39:20,281
pessimistic and all of that,
but I know the literature on trying to 

770
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,960
rectify antisocial behavior in children 
and after the age of four,

771
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:25,030
it's virtually impossible no matter what
you do.

772
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,530
And the reason for that is that kids who
are still acting like two year olds when

773
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,360
they're for that,
you know,

774
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,410
they're twice as old as a two year old.
That's a lot of difference.

775
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:39,010
Like a four year olds in adult as far as
a two year old is concerned.

776
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,710
And so if the four year old is still 
acting like a two year old,

777
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:46,711
that's really not good.
And other four year olds will come up 

778
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:50,041
and you know,
do a little play invitation like a dog 

779
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:50,041
and you know,
the,

780
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:54,700
the kid a two year old,
four year old has no idea how to react 

781
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,090
to that.
And so the more mature kid thinks,

782
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,450
oh,
well how about a play with you?

783
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,660
And then that kid is isolated from the 
peers and after four year mostly 

784
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,210
socialized by your peers.
And so you just fall farther and farther

785
00:40:07,211 --> 00:40:08,080
and farther behind.

786
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,080
You're more and more alienated.
You're more bitter and angry and no 

787
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,370
wonder and it's just not.
You can't rectify it.

788
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,800
So,
so,

789
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,400
so that's useful to know.
It's like your job from two to four is 

790
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,031
to turn your child,
help turn your child into a functional 

791
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:30,391
unity and buy three.
They should be functional enough as a 

792
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:34,531
unity within themselves so that they can
concentrate on a voluntary goal for some

793
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:40,801
reasonable length of time.
Which is also why it's useful to let 

794
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:42,790
them spend some time alone so that they 
can learn to amuse themselves.

795
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,380
Because if they can either be used 
themselves,

796
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:49,381
they're not going to be able to play 
with other kids and then by three 

797
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:50,770
they're sorted together enough.
So if another three year old comes along

798
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,690
they can at least play in parallel and 
may also start,

799
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,710
may be able to start playing a 
cooperative game.

800
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,400
And so that's often a fantasy game,
you know,

801
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:06,000
pretend.
And so what the kids will do it,

802
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:10,480
sometimes they mediated verbally,
but sometimes it's more acted out.

803
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,750
It's a combination of the two.
They'll assign each other rules,

804
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,430
they'll do this with you too.
It's like,

805
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,830
let's have a tea party.
Well what does that mean?

806
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:23,610
Well,
it means let's sit down and act out the 

807
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,390
act of sharing food and see if we can 
get that right.

808
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,910
That's what the is saying.
I have a little tea party,

809
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:33,270
you know,
it's very important because he wouldn't 

810
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,270
being shared food like this is a major 
thing to get right man.

811
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:38,230
And so the kid will say,
well you be the mom and the dad and you 

812
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:42,161
know,
we'll make little fort and that'll be 

813
00:41:42,161 --> 00:41:43,811
our house.
And we'll go in there and we'll run our 

814
00:41:43,811 --> 00:41:45,491
roles and you know,
we're acting out or acting out family 

815
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,670
and,
and if,

816
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,580
if were both reasonably civilized as 
three year olds,

817
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,740
we can concentrate on that goal.

818
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,320
We can establish that little fictional 
world.

819
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,740
We can,
we can negotiate a mutual goal and then 

820
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,881
we can run the simulation.
And that's what kids are doing when 

821
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:03,881
they're pretending it's bloody 
brilliant.

822
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:04,550
That's play man.
It's like,

823
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,550
it's brilliant.
It's absolutely unbelievable because you

824
00:42:09,551 --> 00:42:11,270
know,
if you're going to play a mom,

825
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,480
let's say it isn't like you,
you,

826
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,530
it isn't exactly like you imitate your 
mom because invitation would be,

827
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,010
you know how annoying it is when someone
copies you so you know you're sitting 

828
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:24,920
like that.
And then I do the same thing.

829
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:26,150
It's like,
that's really annoying.

830
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,480
And if that isn't what kids do,
they don't act out the precise actions 

831
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:37,610
that they've seen,
the target of their fantasy display.

832
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,410
There are way more sophisticated than 
that.

833
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,850
They watch their mother,
let's say like hawks and then they start

834
00:42:43,851 --> 00:42:46,370
to extract out regularities in their 
behavior,

835
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:47,630
which is mum behavior.

836
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,630
Let's say that's what makes you mom 
whatever that is and then so it's like 

837
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:57,490
they,
they look at you across time and they 

838
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,771
extract out the regularity that makes 
you mother and then they try to embody 

839
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,460
that regularity in there,
pretend play,

840
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:05,810
and then they sort of encapsulate or 
incorporate the spirit of being a mother

841
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:10,960
or being a father or whatever,
or an animal because they'll play it 

842
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,090
that.
And so that's what they're doing.

843
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,570
They're using their body and their mind 
is dramatic forums.

844
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:16,100
It's really amazing.
You know,

845
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:20,450
it's so sophisticated and no other 
animal does that as far as we know.

846
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,120
And it's the platform on which language 
is based,

847
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:28,121
you know,
first of all we imitate and languages 

848
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:28,121
imitation,
right?

849
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:29,180
Because we use the same words,
right?

850
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:31,550
So it's imitation,
it's a big deal.

851
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:36,551
So you can act out someone else and then
you can conceptualize them in fantasy 

852
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:39,470
and it's only way after that that you 
could maybe articulate it like what does

853
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:40,520
it mean to be a mother?

854
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,470
So I could have you write an essay about
that.

855
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,120
Well,
you'd have to think about it,

856
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,610
right?
You wouldn't just automatically know,

857
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:51,970
but if someone hands you a baby and you 
know you're not completely socially 

858
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:57,221
blind,
you're roughly know what to do after 

859
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:57,221
you're done with your initial 
nervousness,

860
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,660
you roughly know what to do.
Don't drop it.

861
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,090
That's a good rule.
You've probably figured that one out.

862
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:04,280
At least you know,
don't yell at it,

863
00:44:04,281 --> 00:44:06,320
don't startle it.
Give it a little pack,

864
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:09,200
maybe try hugging it.
Maybe you go like this,

865
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,430
you know,
we make eyes out it,

866
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,750
you know what to do.
It's built into you.

867
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,810
You know it's built into you,
but that doesn't mean you could lay it 

868
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:18,890
out as a series of rules about how to be
a mother.

869
00:44:18,891 --> 00:44:21,260
It's like you could write a whole damn 
book about that.

870
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,240
So,
all right,

871
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:26,180
so anyways,
you live in this story and first of all,

872
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:31,181
you get your own story together and 
that's by integrating your motivations 

873
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:33,420
and emotions together under social 
influence.

874
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,020
You know,
Piaget states that before the age of 

875
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:43,311
three kids can't really play.
They're egocentric and it's not exactly 

876
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,681
right because you're actually playing 
with your mother from the time you're 

877
00:44:48,681 --> 00:44:49,620
born.
So even with breastfeeding that that's a

878
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:54,621
social interaction and it's a complex 
cooperative endeavor and it's often hard

879
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:59,400
for mother and infant to get that right 
because it's complicated and it requires

880
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,490
a lot of social interaction,
like while the child has to learn not to

881
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:03,630
bite,
for example,

882
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,960
you know,
and the mother has to learn not to be 

883
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:08,960
too nervous and there's a lot of social 
bonding.

884
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,290
It's really complicated social 
interaction.

885
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:15,291
So the child,
the infant even at the earliest stages 

886
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:18,020
is already engaged in a complex social 
dynamic that's essentially play 

887
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:20,150
oriented,
but it's,

888
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,040
you know,
it's pretty primordial.

889
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,110
It has to do mostly with the mouth and 
child's mouth and tongue are already 

890
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:28,560
hard wired at birth.

891
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,190
So your child is most Mrs.
Friday and observation as well.

892
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:37,191
Your child is almost all mouth and 
tongue when it's born and the rest of 

893
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:37,860
it's body.
While you watch infants,

894
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:41,640
like even when they're,
how old?

895
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,620
Seven months,
six months,

896
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,120
four months.
I can't even remember now.

897
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,390
You know,
they'll move their arm and they kind of 

898
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,040
go like this.
It's like they have got no fine control 

899
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,170
there.
It's more like they have,

900
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,540
you know,
clubs on the ends of sticks.

901
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:59,541
It's like that.
Their nervous system isn't thoroughly 

902
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,960
myelinated.
They don't have control over themselves,

903
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,140
but their mouth and tongue are already 
wired up and so otherwise they wouldn't 

904
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,041
be able to swallow or or nurse.
So the oral element is extraordinarily 

905
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:14,451
important for a young child.
That's why kids put everything in their 

906
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:14,451
mouth,
you know,

907
00:46:14,451 --> 00:46:15,500
even when they're a bit older,
it's like they're.

908
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,390
They see with their tongue,
which of course everyone can do.

909
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,610
You know,
if you put a block in your mouth,

910
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:25,611
you can tell that it's a like a cube.
You can tell that it's a cube without 

911
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:29,211
looking at.
So you can see with your tongue and see 

912
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:32,160
with your hands can even see to some 
degree with your ears anyways.

913
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,490
So there's social interaction right from
the beginning,

914
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:37,620
but for the point of simplification,
you might say,

915
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:42,300
well first the child organized this 
themselves into a functional unity under

916
00:46:42,301 --> 00:46:46,830
the pressure of social dynamics.
And then they get unified enough so that

917
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,831
they can attain unity with another child
by setting up a fictional world and 

918
00:46:51,831 --> 00:46:56,600
cooperating and competing within that.
Because that's quite interesting to a 

919
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,350
because you know,
people often juxtapose cooperation and 

920
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,880
competition as if they're opposites,
but that they're not opposites at all.

921
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,700
In another Piagetian observation.
So you say,

922
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,380
well there's hockey,
a competitive game.

923
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,450
And people would say,
well yeah,

924
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,190
but then you think,
well really,

925
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,660
really no one brings a basketball,
right?

926
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,710
So we're going to play by the rules.
That's cooperation.

927
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:24,711
Well,
are the teams competing against each 

928
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:24,711
other?
Well,

929
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,261
yes,
but they agree to compete within a 

930
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,130
particular landscape and they all 
cooperate to maintain that landscape.

931
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,290
And so you do the same thing when you're
playing monopoly.

932
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:35,200
It's like you're trying to win,
but at the same time you're cooperating.

933
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:36,300
That's what,
that's.

934
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,250
That's society man.
That's society right there.

935
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,660
You're cooperating,
that's the big enclosure.

936
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:47,170
And within that there are regulated 
competitions,

937
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,960
but to separate those artificially and 
say,

938
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:51,340
well,
one's come competition.

939
00:47:51,341 --> 00:47:52,840
And the others cooperation has just.

940
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:57,970
It's just,
it's just not very smart.

941
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,040
It's not observant.
That isn't how it works and,

942
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:05,650
and Games are intensely cooperative.
Even if they're intensely competitive.

943
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,280
I mean the hockey teams are playing the 
same game.

944
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,500
That's the cooperation.
Then each team,

945
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:16,090
there's competition within the team to 
be the best player let's say,

946
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:19,570
but everyone wants that because everyone
wants good players to emerge,

947
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:24,571
but you still cooperate like mad with 
your teammates and if you don't pass 

948
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:24,700
and,
and you know,

949
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:29,701
play like a reasonable person,
then they're going to not be happy with 

950
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,410
you.
And so even within that competition,

951
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:36,160
cooperation is regulating the 
interactions and then you can think this

952
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,110
is a really good thing to think too.
It's like,

953
00:48:39,290 --> 00:48:41,050
you know,
people often say to their kids,

954
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,290
it doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose,

955
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:49,291
it's how you play the game.
And the kid who of course has no idea 

956
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:49,291
what that means.

957
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:49,291
It's like,
what do you mean,

958
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:50,410
ah,
I'm trying to win.

959
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,100
And the parents says,
no,

960
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,960
it matters how you play and the kid 
pushes them and the parents really can't

961
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,300
come up with a good explanation of why 
that's the case.

962
00:48:58,301 --> 00:48:58,900
They might say,
well,

963
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:02,170
other kids won't play with you if you're
there you go,

964
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,450
because you could say this is something 
to think about.

965
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:12,430
So there's a game and there's a victory 
within the game,

966
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,240
but then there's the set of all games 
and there's victory across the set of 

967
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,891
all games and the victory that you 
attained across the set of all games 

968
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:27,451
isn't winning all the games.
It's being invited to play all the 

969
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:29,290
games.
And so if you play fair,

970
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,570
then you're playing a metagame and the 
metagame is how to win across the set of

971
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:39,571
all games.
And so if you teach your child how to 

972
00:49:39,571 --> 00:49:41,170
behave properly,
then they always get invited to play and

973
00:49:41,171 --> 00:49:42,280
that makes them winners.

974
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,790
And that's that.
And so if you understand that,

975
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:50,791
you understand something phenomenally 
important about the emergence of 

976
00:49:50,791 --> 00:49:51,590
morality,
you know,

977
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:56,640
because people moral relativists in 
particular think that morality is 

978
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:56,770
relative,
you know,

979
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:01,840
and of course human beings are diverse,
just like languages are diverse and 

980
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:07,050
there's more than one playable game,
but there's not really more than one 

981
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:11,161
playable metagame.
It's like you're either the kind of 

982
00:50:11,161 --> 00:50:12,040
person that other people want to play 
with or you're not,

983
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,220
and if you're not the kind of person 
that other people want to play with,

984
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,560
then you're a loser.
It's as simple as that,

985
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
and that's true of all cultures.
They might be playing different 

986
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,030
individual games within their culture.
Undoubtedly they are,

987
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,420
but the set of all games that they play 
is still common across cultures.

988
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:33,830
That's part of what makes us human.
And then you could say as well,

989
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:39,280
we're actually evolved to detect people 
who are good at playing the set of all 

990
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,740
possible games and we actually know that
that's not theoretical.

991
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,270
We know,
for example,

992
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:47,690
some things are easy to remember and 
some things are hard to remember.

993
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,720
You know,
here's something that's easy to 

994
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:52,720
remember.
You play with someone in need,

995
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,110
cheat man.
You will remember that.

996
00:50:54,111 --> 00:50:57,230
That's like in your mind that's not 
going anywhere.

997
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:02,620
And so you're great at detecting 
cheaters and you remember and that's 

998
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:05,600
because you can't trust a cheater and 
you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a

999
00:51:05,601 --> 00:51:10,601
game with you because they might cheat.
And so that's part of the innate 

1000
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:15,130
morality system.
You remember cheaters because they 

1001
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:15,830
aren't good at playing the metagame.
And of course your evolved,

1002
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:21,820
of course you're adapted to the metagame
because you're the product of this 

1003
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:22,580
immense evolutionary history,
right?

1004
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:27,581
And whoever your ancestors were,
which is an unbroken string of 

1005
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:30,440
successful reproducers going back three 
and a half billion years,

1006
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:35,441
you think about that,
every single one of your ancestors 

1007
00:51:35,441 --> 00:51:37,320
successfully reproduced it's mind 
boggling,

1008
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,600
the chances against that are so it's 
billions,

1009
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:41,900
billions to one.

1010
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,900
And here you are,
the line of three and a half billion 

1011
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,411
years of success.
The whole world was trying to kill you 

1012
00:51:50,411 --> 00:51:50,900
that whole time.
And here you are.

1013
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,600
It's like,
and but you know,

1014
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,890
you're still only gonna last about eight
years.

1015
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,810
So,
but that's,

1016
00:51:56,811 --> 00:51:57,500
you know,
still,

1017
00:51:57,501 --> 00:51:58,580
you know,
good for you.

1018
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:03,610
So anyways,
there were lots of games that your 

1019
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,660
ancestors were playing across that 
immense span of time.

1020
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,950
Many,
many,

1021
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,670
you know,
Lizard Games and tree dweller games and,

1022
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,590
and,
and what,

1023
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,690
and,
and Crustacean Games,

1024
00:52:14,691 --> 00:52:19,691
you know,
that huge set of games and you're 

1025
00:52:19,691 --> 00:52:21,110
adapted to win across those games.
All of them.

1026
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:22,850
And that's built into you,
man,

1027
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:24,890
that's,
that's your central human nature.

1028
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:29,891
That's what makes you social.
And it's not some mirror cultural 

1029
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:31,790
construct.
Quite the contrary.

1030
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:34,280
It's,
it's so deeply embedded in you.

1031
00:52:34,281 --> 00:52:36,430
It's what you are.
Alright.

1032
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,770
So,
well this is a story.

1033
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,110
It's a game too.
That's another way of thinking about it.

1034
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,730
You know,
like that's a monopoly game.

1035
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:49,030
Well,
what's the frame while that's the rules 

1036
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:50,540
of the game and are they,
why do you accept them?

1037
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,280
Well,
it's kind of arbitrary,

1038
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:54,710
right?
It's like that happens to be the rules.

1039
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:57,920
Hockey has different rules,
basketball has different rules,

1040
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:00,500
but what they share is that they have 
rules.

1041
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,350
Okay.
So there's a frame that's the rules.

1042
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:08,351
And then within the frame there's a goal
and the goal is whatever the rules 

1043
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:08,630
dictate,
you know,

1044
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:13,631
there's usually,
it's usually the construction of a 

1045
00:53:13,631 --> 00:53:15,851
hierarchy of success within a frame.
And so that's what you play.

1046
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,880
And so you play monopoly and it's like,
well we'll accept the rules.

1047
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:22,130
That's the social contract.
And then we'll each try to win.

1048
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:24,650
And that'll be fun.
We find that amusing.

1049
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,030
And if you lose,
what do you say?

1050
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,350
Why you say,
well,

1051
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:31,140
there's always said another game and so 
that's great.

1052
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,020
So if you have that attitude and you 
play fair,

1053
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:35,880
then it doesn't matter that much that 
you,

1054
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:41,150
whether you win or lose,
although you still want to try to win 

1055
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:41,150
because otherwise you're not a good 
player,

1056
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,380
but you accept defeat gracefully because
you can play again and so and you'll win

1057
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:47,910
some and you lose some.
And so that's not so bad,

1058
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,070
you know,
and even if you lose,

1059
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:55,190
well maybe you learn something and,
and you're doing a lot more than one 

1060
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,620
thing while you're playing monopoly,
you know,

1061
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:58,830
you're having a conversation and 
learning how to interact with people and

1062
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,920
learning how to regulate your emotions.
And so even if you lose,

1063
00:54:01,921 --> 00:54:03,360
if you have any sense,
you win.

1064
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,600
And if your kids have any sense,
they know that and so that way you 

1065
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,120
buffer them against defeat.

1066
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,690
It's like,
yeah,

1067
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:12,390
yeah,
I get them next time.

1068
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:14,470
It's like,
so okay,

1069
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:17,250
you should try,
but it's okay.

1070
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,690
And,
and that's,

1071
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,720
that's,
that's useful information for people to 

1072
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:23,720
know.
So.

1073
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,760
Alright.
So you're always in one of these little 

1074
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:28,760
frameworks and there's just no getting 
out of it.

1075
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:28,760
So,
and that's because,

1076
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,120
you know,
at any given moment,

1077
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,160
this is like,
it's like field theory.

1078
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:37,161
There used to be psychological theories 
that talked about the field of human 

1079
00:54:37,161 --> 00:54:37,320
experience,
something like that.

1080
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:39,690
And this is kind of what that is.
This is a field.

1081
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:44,580
And basically what happens is you parse 
out a little part of the world say,

1082
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:50,150
and so you can handle.
So let's say it has some duration.

1083
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,830
You're not aiming at something 50 years 
in the future.

1084
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,600
It's because how the hell are you going 
to do that?

1085
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,310
You,
there's too many variables,

1086
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:01,340
you know,
so you're aiming at some handleable 

1087
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,311
amount of time and you pause it,
a goal in there and you plot your route 

1088
00:55:04,311 --> 00:55:08,751
and then that tells you what's up and 
tells you what's down because up moves 

1089
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:10,830
you towards the goal and down moves you 
away from the goal.

1090
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,830
And that sets up your motivational 
framework so that you have some worth 

1091
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:15,830
attaining.
You know,

1092
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,790
that's a really interesting thing to 
know too.

1093
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,030
It's like why have a goal?
While it's easy,

1094
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,430
no goal,
no positive emotion,

1095
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,740
because you experienced positive emotion
by noticing that you're moving towards a

1096
00:55:28,741 --> 00:55:33,741
goal and so if you don't have to have a 
goal while you can't have any positive 

1097
00:55:33,741 --> 00:55:35,550
emotion,
so you better have a goal,

1098
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:37,290
and so you might say,
well,

1099
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,240
what should the goal be?
Well,

1100
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:40,500
we could start by saying,
well,

1101
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,350
any goal is better than none,
and then we might say,

1102
00:55:43,351 --> 00:55:48,351
well,
it should be a goal that other people 

1103
00:55:48,351 --> 00:55:50,480
will let you pursue because otherwise 
it's gonna be kind of difficult and 

1104
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,750
maybe there'll be even happy to help you
pursue it.

1105
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,780
That would even be better and maybe it's
a goal that would enable you to learn 

1106
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,860
how to pursue other goals while you 
pursue that goal.

1107
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:00,600
Boy,
that would really be good,

1108
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:04,290
and so you can see that your goal is 
parameterized,

1109
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:06,960
but that doesn't mean that any old goal 
works.

1110
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:10,560
It means there's some goals that were 
nicely and some not so nicely.

1111
00:56:10,561 --> 00:56:13,110
There are playable games and non 
playable games.

1112
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,770
That's a good way of thinking about it 
and you want to have a playable game and

1113
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:18,750
there's a lot of them.
Lawyer,

1114
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,340
plumber,
you know,

1115
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,530
actor,
whatever,

1116
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,010
they're playable games and,
and it's not obvious which ones better,

1117
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:31,330
but it's certainly obvious which ones 
are sustainable and which ones are worth

1118
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,590
and so there's a set of playable games 
and you need to extract from that set of

1119
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:40,591
playable games,
a game that suits you and that would be 

1120
00:56:40,591 --> 00:56:40,591
partly due to your temperament,
you know,

1121
00:56:40,591 --> 00:56:45,571
because extroverted people want to play 
an extroverted game and highly neurotic 

1122
00:56:45,571 --> 00:56:48,910
people want to play a safe game and 
agreeable people want to play a generous

1123
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:52,840
game and disagreeable people wanting to 
play a game that's highly competitive so

1124
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:55,240
they can win and you know,
fine,

1125
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,360
but they're all within the realm of 
playable gates and that means they're 

1126
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,660
socially acceptable as well.

1127
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:06,430
And so that means it isn't just 
arbitrary,

1128
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:09,820
it isn't just relative what you decide 
to do.

1129
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,190
It's heavily parameterized.
There's only,

1130
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:15,670
there's a set of playable games and it's
large.

1131
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:17,410
The set is large,
but it,

1132
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,610
there are commonalities within it.
And that's why there are commonalities.

1133
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:25,600
That's why morality has a common basis 
fundamentally.

1134
00:57:25,601 --> 00:57:29,420
And so that's partly what we're trying 
to investigate is like what's up?

1135
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,720
What does that mean?
What does it mean?

1136
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:33,580
Is there such a thing?
Now,

1137
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,180
one thing to remember is that if you 
don't have direct a hierarchical 

1138
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,471
structure with to he matt,
you got no positive motivation because 

1139
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:47,890
you experience positive motivation in 
relationship to a goal,

1140
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:52,891
not from attaining the goal,
that satisfaction and besides it's 

1141
00:57:52,891 --> 00:57:53,770
fleeting.
You know perfectly well,

1142
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,600
you graduate from university,
Poof,

1143
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,870
next day you have a problem which is 
what do you do next?

1144
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,060
And that's a,
that's a tough problem.

1145
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,160
So it's not like you've solved your 
problems.

1146
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:08,161
By winning that game,
you just introduced the problem of 

1147
00:58:08,161 --> 00:58:11,311
having to introduce another game.
So it's unreliable as a source of 

1148
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:15,511
positive emotion.
But what's reliable is you set a goal 

1149
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:17,320
and you try to attain it and then that 
gives your life.

1150
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,190
That literally provides your life with 
meaning.

1151
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,160
That's what meaning is.
Now it's more than that,

1152
00:58:24,161 --> 00:58:25,600
but that's,
that's what it is.

1153
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:27,430
And so then you might ask yourself,
well,

1154
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,420
what's a really good goal?
Well,

1155
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,060
that's what we're trying to figure out.
What's a really good goal?

1156
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,440
And now,
okay,

1157
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:40,441
so you got that.
So now I'm going to walk through at 

1158
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:40,441
least partly through,
we'll see how far we get.

1159
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:45,331
I'm going to walk through Pinocchio with
you because that's what the movie's 

1160
00:58:45,331 --> 00:58:45,331
about and it's,
uh,

1161
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:51,030
it's hard to say how it came about.
Like it was written the story by a guy 

1162
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,230
named cody I,
c o l l O v I,

1163
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,520
and it's quite a bit different.

1164
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,870
The story,
that story,

1165
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:00,871
the written one from the Disney version,
the Disney version was a product of the 

1166
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,730
collaboration of geniuses,
of animation essentially.

1167
00:59:03,731 --> 00:59:08,731
So they were artistic geniuses,
great at capturing motion and emotion 

1168
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:12,931
and all of that be stellar at that and 
imaginative,

1169
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,450
tremendously imaginative,
but collectively imaginative.

1170
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,080
And so they put together a collective 
product and you might say,

1171
00:59:20,081 --> 00:59:21,070
well,
how did they do that?

1172
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,920
Exactly?
It's like,

1173
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,680
well,
they were good storytellers.

1174
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,210
What does that mean?
Well,

1175
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,190
it means you don't want the story that 
works and the story that doesn't.

1176
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,700
And maybe partly what you do is you kind
of think out a story and you think,

1177
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,080
well,
what if this happens?

1178
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,640
Well,
maybe this should happen.

1179
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:39,590
Oh,
that's the thing.

1180
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,090
Oh,
that would work.

1181
00:59:41,091 --> 00:59:42,920
It's like the little flash of 
inspiration,

1182
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:47,921
right?
It's like you got a piece of the puzzle 

1183
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:47,921
that fits you think,
yeah,

1184
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:51,011
that would work there,
and then you talk to the other people 

1185
00:59:51,011 --> 00:59:51,410
and you generate ideas and someone says,
well,

1186
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:51,830
what if.

1187
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,870
What if they do this?
And everyone goes now,

1188
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:56,660
now that's just not believable.
No one's going to buy that,

1189
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,030
and someone else has a little 
revelation.

1190
00:59:59,031 --> 00:59:59,570
They said,
well,

1191
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,390
you know,
it makes some sense somehow with if they

1192
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:03,590
do this,
and everybody goes,

1193
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:04,150
oh yeah,
that,

1194
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,510
that really,
that really,

1195
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,130
that really works.
It's like,

1196
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,260
why?
Why?

1197
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,790
Why?
Why?

1198
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,950
You don't know.
You don't know why it works,

1199
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:18,200
but it works because it works because 
it's the right story.

1200
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,840
And so what does that mean?
Well,

1201
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:23,660
it's kind of associated with this 
metagame idea.

1202
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:29,020
You know,
it's like there's a story that you 

1203
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:29,870
should be acting out that works across 
games and you have an inkling of it.

1204
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,750
You have a notion of it.
You have a vague apprehension of it.

1205
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,910
It's sort of built into that's 
archetype,

1206
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,940
that's an archetype.
And so then when you read a story that 

1207
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:43,121
works,
you're just entranced by it and you all 

1208
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,611
know that you go to a movie and it's a 
great movie and it's like you're just 

1209
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:45,611
blown away.

1210
01:00:45,611 --> 01:00:46,040
You know,
it's a movie,

1211
01:00:46,041 --> 01:00:51,041
can pull you in and turn you into one of
the screen characters and like run you 

1212
01:00:51,041 --> 01:00:55,931
through a huge set of emotions.
I saw this movie once about South 

1213
01:00:55,931 --> 01:01:00,400
America.
It started with this guy running out of 

1214
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,901
a subway naked and he didn't know where 
he was and it turned out that he had 

1215
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:05,441
been absconded by the totalitarian death
squads and he couldn't remember anything

1216
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,960
about himself.
And he went back to his village.

1217
01:01:08,961 --> 01:01:13,961
And basically what happened was that he 
ended up back in the totalitarian death 

1218
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,760
grip.
And it was.

1219
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:22,580
It showed how the fascist state had 
saturated the village completely.

1220
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,930
And so it was a tragedy.
And you could see with every action that

1221
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,480
this guy,
this amnestic guy,

1222
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:32,990
as he recreated him himself and 
remembered his identity,

1223
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:36,680
was going to travel down exactly the 
same road because nothing had changed.

1224
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,850
And by the time I wish I've looked for 
what that movie was for years,

1225
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:44,630
I've never been able to find it again.
But when the movie was over,

1226
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:49,220
every single person in the theater was 
crying and not just a little bit.

1227
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:52,460
It was like they were just out of it.
It was brilliant,

1228
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,520
terrifying movie.
And that meant there was some write 

1229
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,300
about it man.
And it got people and you might say,

1230
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:04,990
you know,
you have dim apprehensions about the 

1231
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,691
world and some of those are instinctual 
and some of them are a consequence of 

1232
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:08,570
your,
of your experience.

1233
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:13,571
And it's like the pieces are fragmented.
But if you get away from them a long 

1234
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:15,920
way,
as you could see how they fit together,

1235
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,130
but they're fragmented.
And then you go see a story and those 

1236
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,130
pieces go click,
click,

1237
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,130
click,
click,

1238
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:21,240
click.
And you think,

1239
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,290
wow,
that's what,

1240
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,490
that's how that works out.

1241
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,080
That's,
that's what that means.

1242
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,570
And that produces that overwhelming 
emotion.

1243
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:32,571
And,
and that's partly how you make yourself 

1244
01:02:32,571 --> 01:02:33,720
transparent to yourself.
You know,

1245
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:36,450
you go experience the story,
who watched the story,

1246
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:39,330
you tell a story and you start to find 
out who you are by doing that.

1247
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:45,860
My nephew had a dream at one point 
someone made a little animated thing out

1248
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,310
of it and put it on the intranet,
which is quite cool.

1249
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:51,630
So anyways,
he,

1250
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,660
he,
he was having night terrors and he ran 

1251
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:56,660
around like a little night,
uh,

1252
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:56,880
you know,
Kai,

1253
01:02:56,970 --> 01:02:59,370
Connecticut,
k and Igh t night,

1254
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,470
and he had little,
you know,

1255
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:06,710
armor and a sword and he run around the 
house with little white hat on being the

1256
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,030
night.
And he was only like four or something.

1257
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:10,980
And he'd watched his lot of Disney 
movies,

1258
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:13,410
lot of movies.
So he kinda got the night idea was,

1259
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,550
it was at his acting that out and he was
having these terrorists at night.

1260
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:22,610
Right.
And so he'd go to bed with his little 

1261
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:22,610
night hat and his sword and he put them 
on is bad.

1262
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:24,600
And then at night he'd wake up 
screaming.

1263
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:28,110
And that happened for a very long time.
And so when I went to visit,

1264
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:28,520
uh,
you know,

1265
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,100
I found out that this was happening and 
he had a night terror,

1266
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,160
so the kid wakes up with night terrors 
screaming but can't remember anything 

1267
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,670
generally speaking.
So anyways,

1268
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:41,140
this was happening.
And so what happened one day?

1269
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,500
And I was sitting with him and his 
family at the,

1270
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,810
at the breakfast table,
and I said,

1271
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:46,940
uh,
did you,

1272
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:48,120
did he have a dream?
And he said,

1273
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,530
Oh yes,
I had a dream.

1274
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:50,400
I said,
well,

1275
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,630
you know,
what was your dream?

1276
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:52,440
And He,
and he said,

1277
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,960
well,
I was out on this field and,

1278
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,810
and,
and I was surrounded by these dwarfs.

1279
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,970
And they came up to my knees and they 
were,

1280
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:05,120
they didn't have any arms,
they had big feet and they were covered 

1281
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,991
with hair and there was a cross shaved 
at the top of their head and they were 

1282
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:11,571
all greasy and they had huge beaks.
And everywhere I went they jumped at me 

1283
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:12,390
with their beaks and there was lots of 
them.

1284
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,690
And everybody was very quiet after he 
said this because it was like that,

1285
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:19,680
oh,
that's why you're screaming at night.

1286
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:20,610
It's like,
yeah,

1287
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,230
okay,
and so,

1288
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,210
so and,
and,

1289
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,320
and then he said,
but,

1290
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:30,410
but at the background there was a dragon
and the dragon would blow out smoke and 

1291
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:32,280
fire and then it would turn into these 
dwarfs.

1292
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,420
So it's like,
man,

1293
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:34,770
that kid had a problem,
right?

1294
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:35,730
It was like,
well,

1295
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,320
what are you gonna do you fight off a 
dwarf?

1296
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:37,980
Who Cares?

1297
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,980
It's like puff 10 more.
That's life,

1298
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,540
man.
That's life.

1299
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,580
Really.
That's the Hydra.

1300
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:46,950
You cut off one head,
seven more grow.

1301
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:50,460
That's life snakes everywhere and you 
get rid of one,

1302
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,730
there'll be more.
And so he figured that out.

1303
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,610
It's a hell of an existential shock when
you're four.

1304
01:04:56,910 --> 01:04:58,410
And so he's like,
he's a knight.

1305
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:03,411
He's thinking,
what do I do about these dwarfs while 

1306
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:03,411
there's too many of them,
but there's a dragon also.

1307
01:05:03,411 --> 01:05:03,870
So I said,
well,

1308
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:06,990
what could you do about that?
Right?

1309
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:12,050
Loaded question.
It implies that you could do something 

1310
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,450
about that.
Well,

1311
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:17,451
he kind of knew that which is why he was
running around like a night and he kind 

1312
01:05:17,451 --> 01:05:18,610
of figured out and he said,
well,

1313
01:05:18,611 --> 01:05:23,611
I get my dad and I jump up on the dragon
and I poke out both of its size with my 

1314
01:05:23,611 --> 01:05:26,530
sword and then I go right down in 
stomach to the place where the fire came

1315
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:31,531
out,
the firebox and then I carve a piece of 

1316
01:05:31,531 --> 01:05:31,531
the firebox out at.

1317
01:05:31,531 --> 01:05:33,100
I'd make a shield and that would be the 
end of that.

1318
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:34,630
And I thought,
wow,

1319
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,350
good work kid.
Like you really got it right.

1320
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,080
It's the,
it's the central human story.

1321
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,840
There's the terrible unknown,
right?

1322
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:47,020
Fire-Breathing generating trouble.
And what do you do?

1323
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:52,021
You confront that,
you confront that and by confronting it 

1324
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:53,380
you get stronger.
That's the shield and that's,

1325
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:57,190
that's what a human being is and that's,
that's right.

1326
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,320
It's exactly right.
And that was the end of his night 

1327
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:02,320
terrors by the way,
which seems too good to be true,

1328
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:07,290
but it is actually true because I 
followed up with his mother for a long 

1329
01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:08,830
time and that was that.
He catalyzed that part of his identity.

1330
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:14,250
He adopted the role of the mythological 
hero and that's what he needed to do 

1331
01:06:14,250 --> 01:06:16,570
because like there was lots of drag.
There's a dragon and a bunch of dwarfs.

1332
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,630
Like,
what the hell are you going to do about 

1333
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:21,630
that?
That's not going to help.

1334
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:22,570
You know,
if you run into dream like that,

1335
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,500
the doors multiply and they get bigger 
and you get smaller as you run.

1336
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:30,700
It's like that's not a good.
That is not a good solution.

1337
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:33,100
And people do that in their life all the
time.

1338
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,520
And so the dwarves get bigger until 
they're giants and they get smaller 

1339
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,940
until there's nothing left of them.
And then,

1340
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:44,810
then there's no recovery.
That is not good.

1341
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:47,000
No.
Okay.

1342
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:48,180
So now.
Alright.

1343
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:53,060
Also propose to you that there there's a
symbolic structure to the world.

1344
01:06:53,630 --> 01:06:55,340
It's a metal structure.
I would say.

1345
01:06:55,490 --> 01:07:00,080
I think these categories are truly real 
and they're there basically this,

1346
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:05,130
there's unexplored territory.
There's explored territory and there's 

1347
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:10,151
you and unexplored territory is the 
source of great riches and it probably 

1348
01:07:10,881 --> 01:07:15,881
will kill you and explored.
Territory is your culture and it 

1349
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:19,031
crunches you into submission and 
conformity and turns you into a 

1350
01:07:19,031 --> 01:07:23,501
civilized being and you're stuck with 
both of those and then there's you and 

1351
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,760
you know you're kind of admirable and 
cool and you do a lot of decent,

1352
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:30,790
wonderful,
amazing things and there's things about 

1353
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,570
you that are just horrible and you're 
and you know about them and you're stuck

1354
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:35,690
with them and that's the world and 
that's the,

1355
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:40,490
that's the landscape of the world.
And what you'll see if you pay attention

1356
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:45,230
is that people who aren't ideologues 
like Rousseau or say like hobbs,

1357
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:50,530
but it doesn't matter,
idiot logs will tell you part of that 

1358
01:07:50,530 --> 01:07:50,960
story.
So environmentalist's for example,

1359
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:55,490
we'll say nature,
that's pristine beauty,

1360
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:00,020
natural harmony,
a French landscape,

1361
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,000
be it,
it's a paradise,

1362
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:04,250
especially if there are no people.
It's a paradise.

1363
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:09,580
And then culture is a rapacious monster,
and human beings driving that culture 

1364
01:08:10,731 --> 01:08:11,870
against nature are

1365
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,370
monsters of a sort that,
and perhaps

1366
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,930
there should be fewer of them.
It's like,

1367
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:18,350
yeah,
yeah,

1368
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,670
that's all true.
Exactly.

1369
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:20,600
Dead.
Dead on.

1370
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:22,220
Right on.
Exactly right.

1371
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,240
Um,
is that movie called Avatar?

1372
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,210
Yes.
That's James Cameron's movie,

1373
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:30,680
right?
That's that story.

1374
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:32,610
Yeah.
And uh,

1375
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,000
hey,
it's good story.

1376
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:38,210
It's even a mythological story,
but it's only half the story.

1377
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:43,360
The other story,
you could think about it as a frontier 

1378
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:45,650
myth that star trek or star wars for 
that better mostly star Trek.

1379
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:46,100
It's like,

1380
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:54,500
but we'll,
we'll put it in context to the frontier 

1381
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:54,780
myth.
The myth that drew settlers into America

1382
01:08:54,781 --> 01:08:55,590
say it's,
well,

1383
01:08:56,040 --> 01:09:01,040
there's a wild savage landscape out 
there that can be conquered by unsettled

1384
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:06,690
and stabilized by civilization and it'll
be the heroic pioneer who does it.

1385
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,870
It's exactly the opposite story of the 
environmental story,

1386
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:14,871
which is actually why I think the 
environmental story of eventually 

1387
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:17,481
emerged.
It was the frontier story called how to 

1388
01:09:17,481 --> 01:09:21,981
lack and it missed half of the world.
And so the other story I had to come up 

1389
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:23,550
and it did,
and if you take both of those stories,

1390
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:26,400
even though they're exactly opposite to 
one another,

1391
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:31,730
if you know both of those stories,
then you know the whole story and it's 

1392
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:31,730
really weird,
you know,

1393
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:36,681
because one of the propositions of 
formal logic is it's a fundamental 

1394
01:09:37,441 --> 01:09:42,441
proposition is that something can't be 
itself and its opposite at the same 

1395
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:42,441
time.

1396
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:45,450
It's like that's true for some sorts of 
things.

1397
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:50,480
It's true for logical claims,
but it's completely wrong in this 

1398
01:09:50,581 --> 01:09:55,581
particular situation because things are 
that what they are and they're opposite 

1399
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:57,240
at the same time.
And that makes it very,

1400
01:09:57,241 --> 01:10:00,660
very difficult to.
That's why a dragon hordes gold.

1401
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:02,730
It's like,
what's up with that?

1402
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:06,030
Well,
it'll eat you and it will,

1403
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,640
but it has gold.
Well,

1404
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:10,950
so what do you do about that?
Because it's,

1405
01:10:10,951 --> 01:10:13,080
it's,
it's paradoxical demands.

1406
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:18,500
Well,
what you want to do is face the dragon 

1407
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:18,500
and get the damn goal.
That's what you want to do.

1408
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:23,570
Well,
you have to be a paradoxical being even 

1409
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:23,570
to do that.
So,

1410
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,190
you know,
in,

1411
01:10:24,191 --> 01:10:26,550
in the Hobbit,
for example,

1412
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,020
when,
what's his name,

1413
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:29,340
Frodo,
right,

1414
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:30,240
isn't,
it's not,

1415
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,010
or it's Bilbo,
Bilbo in the Harvard,

1416
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,980
you know,
he's kind of this little underdeveloped

1417
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,840
overprotected shire dweller and he's 
called on a great adventure to go and 

1418
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:48,501
find the dragon and he has to become a 
thief in order to manage it.

1419
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,210
Well,
that's pretty weird,

1420
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,110
you know,
it's like,

1421
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:52,740
well,
it's,

1422
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:57,741
it's because as a good citizen,
he's just not enough to conquer a 

1423
01:10:57,751 --> 01:11:00,900
dragon.
He asked to also become a bad citizen in

1424
01:11:00,901 --> 01:11:05,901
some sense.
He has to incorporate the part of 

1425
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:05,901
themselves that's monstrous,
let's say,

1426
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,570
and develop that and hone it.
And that's to say that,

1427
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:10,950
well,
if you are harmless,

1428
01:11:10,951 --> 01:11:14,310
you're not virtuous,
you're just harmless.

1429
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,670
You're like a rabbit.
Rabbit isn't virtuous.

1430
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:21,630
It's just,
just can't do anything except get eaten.

1431
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,960
It's not virtuous.
If you're a monster and you don't act 

1432
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,010
monstrously,
then you're virtuous.

1433
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,920
But you also have to be a monster while 
you see this all the time.

1434
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:34,080
Harry Potter's like that too.
It's like he's,

1435
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,370
he's flawed,
he's hurt.

1436
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:37,380
He's got evil in him.
He can talk to snakes.

1437
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:39,570
Man,
he breaks rules all the time,

1438
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,050
all the time.
He's not an obedient at all,

1439
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,320
but you know,
he has a good reason for breaking the 

1440
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:48,320
rules and if he couldn't break the 
rules,

1441
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,250
him and his little clique of rule 
breaking,

1442
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:51,420
you know,
troublemakers.

1443
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:55,920
If they didn't break the rules,
they wouldn't attain the highest goal.

1444
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,440
So it's very peculiar,
but it's very,

1445
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,220
very.
It's a very,

1446
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:00,090
very,
very,

1447
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:03,530
very common mythological notion.
You know,

1448
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,620
the hero has to be,

1449
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:10,780
the hero has to be a monster,
but a controlled monster.

1450
01:12:10,781 --> 01:12:12,430
Batman is like that,
you know what I mean?

1451
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:13,210
It's,
it's everywhere.

1452
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:18,230
It's tour story.
You always hear meaning.

1453
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,570
We have to be more precise.

1454
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,230
Well,
that's a good,

1455
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:32,060
that's a good question because one 
question is,

1456
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:37,640
you know,
you're kind of implicitly moral insofar 

1457
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:37,670
as you're socialized,
but that's sort of procedural.

1458
01:12:37,671 --> 01:12:39,710
It's just built into you.
This is different.

1459
01:12:39,711 --> 01:12:44,711
This is also becoming conscious of it 
and expanding out your personality into 

1460
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:45,950
dimensions that it wouldn't normally 
occupy.

1461
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:50,180
So this happens to people all the time.
So for example,

1462
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:55,390
lots of my clients,
my clinical clients are too agreeable 

1463
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:58,480
and I'm,
they're generally women because women 

1464
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,181
are more agreeable than men,
but not always because I've had 

1465
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:01,181
agreeable man,
his clients as well,

1466
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:05,620
and what happens is they're resentful 
and they don't know how to stand up for 

1467
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:07,580
themselves and it's because they're very
compassionate by nature.

1468
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:10,670
And so if you're entering into a 
negotiation with them,

1469
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,620
they'll let you win.
Well,

1470
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,960
that's not so good because you know you 
need to win too.

1471
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:20,090
Especially if you're in an organization 
of adults where there's,

1472
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:21,580
there's a struggle,
right?

1473
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,810
When you have kids,
you can let them win,

1474
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:29,200
especially infants like you have to let 
them win and that's partly why 

1475
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,100
compassion is so necessary.
But as a,

1476
01:13:31,670 --> 01:13:34,910
as a basis for negotiation between 
adults,

1477
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:36,320
it's like,
sorry,

1478
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,090
it's insufficient.
You have to.

1479
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,480
You have to be a bit of a monster so 
that you can say no.

1480
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:46,870
And so a lot of what you do in 
psychotherapy is treat people's anxiety 

1481
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:47,780
and depression.
That's a huge chunk of it.

1482
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,910
Help them straighten out the way they 
think.

1483
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:52,100
That's a huge chunk of it,
but another chunk of it is,

1484
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,110
well,
let's toughen you up.

1485
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:59,260
You know,
let's put you in a position where you 

1486
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:00,881
can bargain,
let's teach you how to assert yourself 

1487
01:14:00,881 --> 01:14:03,821
and stand up for yourself and that's 
assertiveness training and it's a huge 

1488
01:14:03,821 --> 01:14:04,280
chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.

1489
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:09,340
You need to learn it.
It's like because part of how you 

1490
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:14,021
regulate your interactions with other 
people to negotiate and you cannot 

1491
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:17,080
negotiate unless you can say no,
you can't do it,

1492
01:14:17,530 --> 01:14:20,650
and its causes conflict to say no,
and if you don't like conflict,

1493
01:14:20,651 --> 01:14:22,960
which is basically the definition of 
being agreeable,

1494
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:28,140
then you can't tolerate the conflict and
so then you can't negotiate on your own 

1495
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:30,790
behalf and so then you keep losing and 
you're bullied and you know it's,

1496
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:32,920
it's not good.
Then you get resentful and,

1497
01:14:32,921 --> 01:14:37,921
and it's really not good.
So you have to develop your inner 

1498
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:41,950
monster a little bit and,
and then that makes you a better person.

1499
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:43,810
Not a worst person.
It's weird.

1500
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,640
It's weird,
but,

1501
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:51,990
but that's just how it is outside of 
that diagram is chaos itself and that's 

1502
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,250
the chaos from which things emerge.
Now,

1503
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,940
I can't tell you much about that yet 
because it's too damn complicated,

1504
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:07,930
but I think the best way to think about 
chaos is as potential.

1505
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,740
That's one way of thinking about it.
It's also that place you end up when you

1506
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:12,730
don't know what to do.

1507
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,720
It's the source of all things,
but it's also the terrible Predator,

1508
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:23,830
the terrible eternal Predator that lurks
beyond the explored domain.

1509
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,400
It's a winged dragon and it's weighing 
who knows why matter and spirit.

1510
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:31,990
That's partly what it is and I'll 
explain that later.

1511
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:37,140
It's also potentially the predatory 
beast that's been after us for for 

1512
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:41,590
forever and the winged Predator that 
picked us up from the sky.

1513
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:43,450
So primates,
for example,

1514
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:47,410
monkeys have some monkeys have three 
specialized alarm cries,

1515
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:52,330
one is for snakes,
and that usually means hit the trees and

1516
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:57,331
then one's for leopards and that means 
hit the trees and go out on a skinny 

1517
01:15:57,331 --> 01:15:57,331
branch because the leopard can't get to 
you.

1518
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:59,560
And then there's one for like birds of 
prey,

1519
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:03,070
which means hide somewhere on the ground
so that you don't get picked off.

1520
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:04,510
And it's like,
well,

1521
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:07,750
that's what that is.
That's what that is.

1522
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:13,710
And that's chaos.
And it's expanded into much more than 

1523
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:14,530
that.
And then I showed you,

1524
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:16,480
I don't remember if I showed you this,
but this is.

1525
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:21,720
This is a symbolic representation of 
mother nature for their culture and the 

1526
01:16:22,751 --> 01:16:25,630
suffering individual.
But it's all that's all positive.

1527
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,500
There's no negative elements there,
but that's okay.

1528
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:34,710
That's a partial representation.
And those things are sacred in some 

1529
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:37,801
sense because they are representative of
an ultimate reality of an ultimate 

1530
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:42,871
reality.
The sacrificial individual hear the 

1531
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:42,871
suffering individual.
Well,

1532
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:43,780
that's pretty straightforward.
It's like

1533
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:47,120
that's what,
that's life,

1534
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,520
that's suffering,
that's life,

1535
01:16:50,090 --> 01:16:54,140
that's what happens to the individual.
And so everyone is looking at that.

1536
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,240
There's a.
It has power,

1537
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,700
that idea.
Well,

1538
01:16:58,701 --> 01:17:02,270
it's because you know,
culture supports the suffering,

1539
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:05,660
individual cultures nested inside 
benevolent nature.

1540
01:17:05,661 --> 01:17:08,540
And that's part of the story of the 
world.

1541
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:11,930
And this part of the story we're trying 
to figure out and make articulate.

1542
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:16,931
We'd been doing that for thousands of 
years trying to make this story 

1543
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:19,820
articulate and it's not yet articulate 
it.

1544
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:23,130
It's only we're only getting it.
We're only getting it and we.

1545
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:28,190
We basically do that now mostly with 
movies and stories and fiction and that 

1546
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,450
sort of thing.
We still don't have it articulated.

1547
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,720
I think young when he came closer than 
anyone else,

1548
01:17:32,721 --> 01:17:35,030
young and an Eric Norman who was one of 
his students,

1549
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:40,180
came closer than anyone else ever has to
actually articulate about and that's 

1550
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,080
what you and was trying to do,
is to take all these images,

1551
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:45,320
archetipal images,
instinctual images and say,

1552
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:46,160
well,
what do they mean?

1553
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,660
What do they mean?
What do they mean?

1554
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,020
And he got a long ways on that.
Although his writing is quite obscure 

1555
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,081
and it's obscured because how the hell 
are you going to explain an image like 

1556
01:17:56,081 --> 01:17:59,771
that without being obscure?
It's like it's insanely complicated and 

1557
01:18:00,501 --> 01:18:05,501
it's not linear.
It's not a linear thing that that's why 

1558
01:18:05,501 --> 01:18:08,270
it's in a picture because a picture 
presents everything at once and you want

1559
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:10,220
to take that apart linearly.
Jesus,

1560
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:12,320
it's just,
it's just impossible,

1561
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:14,300
but we've been struggling to do that.
Really.

1562
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:18,320
We'd been struggling to do that from the
time we became self conscious,

1563
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,870
you know,
what is the world about?

1564
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:24,170
How should we live in it?
While that's a partial answer,

1565
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:26,750
and it's a culture bound answer 
obviously,

1566
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,430
but you see archetypal representations 
like this and many cultures,

1567
01:18:31,431 --> 01:18:36,431
so for example,
the image of the Virgin and child that 

1568
01:18:36,431 --> 01:18:36,860
way predates Christianity.

1569
01:18:37,370 --> 01:18:39,470
Like the Egyptians,
that was isis and horace.

1570
01:18:39,471 --> 01:18:40,870
That goes back.
Whoa.

1571
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:45,910
We have no idea how far thousands and 
thousands of years before the emergence 

1572
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:50,861
of Judaism and Christianity way back 
before that and no doubt back into 

1573
01:18:51,381 --> 01:18:56,381
prehistory itself because a culture that
doesn't hold the mother and child as 

1574
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:03,011
sacred dies obviously because obviously 
so it has to be held as it has to be 

1575
01:19:08,781 --> 01:19:13,781
held as something that you revere,
which at least means you don't kill 

1576
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,400
mothers and children and at least means 
that.

1577
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,010
And that's an instinct.
You know,

1578
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:21,890
it's an instinct and violates you to do 
that.

1579
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:25,450
And thank God.
All right,

1580
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:31,120
let's take 15 minutes.
So I told you about this a little bit 

1581
01:19:34,141 --> 01:19:35,340
last week,
but you know,

1582
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:40,430
one of the motivations I had for 
thinking the things that I've thought 

1583
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,960
through the motivation I had for 
thinking them through was because,

1584
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:45,920
well,
I,

1585
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:47,180
I,
it,

1586
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:47,800
it,
it,

1587
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,700
it seemed self evident to me,
let's say,

1588
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:56,450
and I think that was partly from reading
you but not that just helped me clarify,

1589
01:19:56,490 --> 01:20:01,490
was that it was sort of humans 
contention that we had an organic 

1590
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:08,481
development of a metaphysical ethic that
was embedded in,

1591
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:11,940
in religious tradition and that 
basically unfolded,

1592
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:15,090
let's say in the West until about 1600,
1500,

1593
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:15,900
something like that.

1594
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:20,900
And then science emerged and we got 
unbelievably technologically powerful 

1595
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,030
art and using a certain view of the 
world.

1596
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:29,050
You know,
we're so technologically powerful but 

1597
01:20:29,050 --> 01:20:32,190
we're still not very wise and that just 
seems to me to be a bad combination.

1598
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:35,010
And I thought about that a lot.
It's like,

1599
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:40,011
okay,
well how do you handle the combination 

1600
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:41,310
of exceptional technological power and 
and an impaired ethic,

1601
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:44,640
let's say something like that under 
developed ethic or one even in which you

1602
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:49,641
have no faith because you know it,
it seems that the foundational elements 

1603
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,530
of it are irrational.
They're there in mythology,

1604
01:20:52,531 --> 01:20:57,531
there in religion,
they don't fit well with the scientific 

1605
01:20:57,531 --> 01:20:58,320
worldview.
How do you rectify that problem?

1606
01:20:58,470 --> 01:21:01,140
And while that's a tough problem,
you know,

1607
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:04,710
it's a crazy problem and certainly it 
was the problem that young was trying to

1608
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:06,240
address.
There's no doubt about it.

1609
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:09,360
And along with that,
with an associated problem which,

1610
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:10,270
which was,
you know,

1611
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:15,330
what happened in the 20th century,
which was so awful and in so many 

1612
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:20,061
places,
it was just so unbelievably brutal and 

1613
01:21:20,061 --> 01:21:23,211
terrible and it was perpetrated by 
millions of people and they were 

1614
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:26,580
individual people and they weren't that 
much different from normal people.

1615
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:28,200
In fact,
they were normal people.

1616
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:32,100
And so the other thing that struck me 
was that it would be better if that sort

1617
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:37,101
of thing didn't happen anymore.
And so I was trying to figure out what 

1618
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:37,980
the hell could possibly be done about 
that and you know,

1619
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:41,730
part of humans contention was while you 
had to understand yourself as a monster,

1620
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:46,731
if you were ever going to maintain some 
control over the fact that you are in 

1621
01:21:46,731 --> 01:21:49,500
fact the monster and that that could 
come forth if the situation is correct.

1622
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,610
It's like,
okay,

1623
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:55,611
that seems reasonable and so,
well it seemed to me that,

1624
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:01,110
you know,
people had to become wiser and of course

1625
01:22:01,111 --> 01:22:06,111
that's a very difficult thing to figure 
out because you can even question 

1626
01:22:06,111 --> 01:22:06,370
whether there is such a thing as wisdom,
you know?

1627
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,820
And,
and then I thought,

1628
01:22:08,821 --> 01:22:10,620
well that's what the universities are 
supposed to do.

1629
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:13,380
Especially the humanities mostly in 
particular,

1630
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:16,110
it's supposed to make you wise.
That's what it's for.

1631
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,650
And it's doing a terrible job of that.
In my estimation.

1632
01:22:19,651 --> 01:22:24,651
It's,
it's more decimating people as far as I 

1633
01:22:24,651 --> 01:22:27,321
can tell and undermining whatever ethic 
they have rather than making people 

1634
01:22:27,321 --> 01:22:29,730
wise.
And.

1635
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:33,840
But I think that we have to become wise.
I don't think there a choice.

1636
01:22:33,841 --> 01:22:38,841
I think it's a matter of survival and 
it's more than that because if you're 

1637
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:42,201
wise in your own life,
you're going to have a way better life 

1638
01:22:42,201 --> 01:22:45,230
like incomparably better because you're.
You're gonna sleep soundly with a good 

1639
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:50,961
conscience at night and you know people 
say that's worth more than money and 

1640
01:22:50,961 --> 01:22:54,680
that's worth more than money.
I know lots of people who have lots of 

1641
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:55,770
money and let me tell you,
money protects you.

1642
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,920
Your as well protected from the world by
money right now as you ever will be for 

1643
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:04,731
the rest of your life because there's 
most of life's fundamental problems 

1644
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:05,830
can't be solved with money.
You know,

1645
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:08,650
like rich people get divorced.
They have affairs.

1646
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:13,651
Their children get sick that they have 
all the problems you have and that's 

1647
01:23:13,651 --> 01:23:15,040
partly because you're already rich and 
so

1648
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,750
you might think that if you had a bunch 
more money,

1649
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:21,670
things would be better,
but it's just not true.

1650
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:26,671
In fact,
in some ways that they might be worse 

1651
01:23:26,671 --> 01:23:28,300
because money can open up,
can open up the possibility of all sorts

1652
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:31,120
of temptations to you that you just 
can't afford at the moment.

1653
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:36,040
So well.
So like economic economics,

1654
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:41,220
we've already solved that problem 
fundamentally and we're rapidly solving 

1655
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:41,220
it everywhere in the world,
right?

1656
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:45,811
I mean,
the world economy is growing so damn 

1657
01:23:45,811 --> 01:23:47,260
fast that you can't even imagine how you
could possibly make it grow any faster.

1658
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:52,261
It's crazy.
We've lifted hundreds of millions of 

1659
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:53,110
people out of poverty in the last 15 
years.

1660
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,930
You know,
the UN set a goal by 2015,

1661
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:59,860
I think it was to cut poverty by half if
I remember correctly.

1662
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,680
And they reached it two years early,
you know,

1663
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:04,630
it's like,
it's unbelievable.

1664
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:05,230
So.

1665
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,360
Well.
So then I started to try to understand 

1666
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:15,540
what it might be to,
to live and,

1667
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:20,541
and really what I was looking forward to
was not so much to live a life that was 

1668
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:23,781
wise,
but at least to live a life that wasn't 

1669
01:24:23,781 --> 01:24:26,210
pathologically unwise and I thought of 
the sorts of things that people were 

1670
01:24:27,031 --> 01:24:32,031
doing to one another in Auschwitz camps 
and in the Gulag archipelago and all of 

1671
01:24:32,031 --> 01:24:36,861
that horror that was perpetrated on,
on people as definitely unwise.

1672
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:40,380
Whatever else you might say about it.
It was unwise.

1673
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:41,310
And so then I thought,
well,

1674
01:24:41,311 --> 01:24:43,980
maybe there's a way to figure out how 
you could not do that.

1675
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:50,190
And so that's,
and I think that that's my sense is that

1676
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,510
when you come to university to learn how
to be a civilized person,

1677
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:56,820
which is what supposed to happen at 
university,

1678
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,120
otherwise it's just a trade school and 
you might as well go to trade school as 

1679
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:04,110
far as I'm concerned.
If you want to learn something that will

1680
01:25:04,111 --> 01:25:09,111
get you a job,
it's like it's a lot faster and it's 

1681
01:25:09,111 --> 01:25:11,370
more certain and,
and it's useful.

1682
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:14,670
If you're not being taught to be a 
citizen at university,

1683
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:14,970
then

1684
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:22,030
why bother with it so well.
So that's what we're trying to figure 

1685
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,280
out.
And,

1686
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:28,110
and that's part of that cloud of 
mythological fantasy that surrounds our 

1687
01:25:28,110 --> 01:25:32,921
culture.
That's it's part of it's deep history 

1688
01:25:32,921 --> 01:25:35,150
that we're trying to grapple with the 
humanities and with art and all of that,

1689
01:25:35,151 --> 01:25:40,151
that you're trying to.
You're trying to master and incorporate 

1690
01:25:40,151 --> 01:25:40,151
and,
and,

1691
01:25:40,151 --> 01:25:44,580
and pull into you so that you're 
situated properly in history and,

1692
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,950
and you're not just floating in the void
of,

1693
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:48,800
of,
you know,

1694
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:53,300
this tiny individuality that's divorced 
from everything else.

1695
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,170
You're weak in that circumstance.
Alright.

1696
01:25:57,650 --> 01:25:58,130
So

1697
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:07,900
that's more of an explanation of why I'm
trying to puzzle through these things 

1698
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,270
and trying to puzzle through them with 
you.

1699
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:10,870
So anyways,
we talked about this,

1700
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:13,430
this,
this song last week.

1701
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:15,020
And you know,
I,

1702
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,160
I made a hypothesis to you.
We'll go through this quickly.

1703
01:26:19,380 --> 01:26:21,680
Um,
it's Doggerel,

1704
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,720
it's not great poetry,
but it's irrelevant.

1705
01:26:24,310 --> 01:26:26,570
Um,
it was a very popular song.

1706
01:26:26,571 --> 01:26:31,571
It's quite beautiful in the movie.
It's actually sung by like a heavenly 

1707
01:26:31,571 --> 01:26:31,640
choir.
That's what it sounds like.

1708
01:26:31,641 --> 01:26:35,510
So it's got this cathedral.
You could imagine people singing it in a

1709
01:26:35,511 --> 01:26:38,180
cathedral essentially.
And so that's not accidental.

1710
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,130
It's purposeful,
you know,

1711
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:40,460
it,
it,

1712
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:44,340
it partakes of that,
what would you call it?

1713
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:47,300
It,
it partakes of that aesthetic,

1714
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:47,930
that,
that's,

1715
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:52,931
that's it.
So the filmmakers are are implying that 

1716
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:58,540
what is about to be shown to you has 
this divine element essentially,

1717
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:05,081
and that that's signified by the choir 
of voices that sings the song and the 

1718
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:13,031
song says so fundamentally something 
like this is that if you lift up your 

1719
01:27:13,281 --> 01:27:16,640
eyes above the temporal,
into the transcendent,

1720
01:27:16,641 --> 01:27:21,230
and so that's what exists in the 
heavenly world.

1721
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,480
In the stars.
If you pick a,

1722
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,690
an ultimate goal,
if you pick the right ultimate goal,

1723
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:30,260
then anyone can do this.
That's the other thing.

1724
01:27:30,261 --> 01:27:32,840
It's democratic.
It's anyone can do this.

1725
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:35,840
So that's the second proposition.
It doesn't matter who you are,

1726
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:41,140
you can do this.
And so I think that's a reflection of 

1727
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:41,270
the idea of the divinity of the 
individual.

1728
01:27:41,271 --> 01:27:45,110
It's like there's something about each 
individual that's valuable regardless of

1729
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:50,111
their idiosyncrasies and and so they 
have this potential that they can 

1730
01:27:50,111 --> 01:27:50,570
manifest.
And how do you manifest it?

1731
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:53,360
You pick the right goal and what's the 
right goal?

1732
01:27:53,361 --> 01:27:53,640
Well,
it's,

1733
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,850
it's high,
it's elevated,

1734
01:27:55,851 --> 01:27:58,910
it's above the mundane.
Now what does that mean?

1735
01:27:58,911 --> 01:27:59,990
Well,
you don't really know.

1736
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:05,050
You don't really know.
That's why it signified by a star and a 

1737
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:05,270
star is something that glimmers in the 
night,

1738
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:10,330
right?
So it's a source of light in the 

1739
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:10,330
darkness and so there's a metaphor 
there.

1740
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:14,240
Obviously there's a metaphor there and 
the star is the star,

1741
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:17,810
that star of Hollywood,
you know the person that you emulate.

1742
01:28:17,811 --> 01:28:22,811
That's part of it because it's an ideal 
is going to be a human ideal of some 

1743
01:28:22,811 --> 01:28:24,920
sort that you're aiming out and so the 
ideal human being is,

1744
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:28,310
is the star that you're aiming at.
Maybe it's something like that.

1745
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:30,740
If that's what you're aiming at,
you might say,

1746
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:32,630
well,
what should you aim out in life?

1747
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:37,631
And wanting to answer as well,
why don't you aim at being whatever you 

1748
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:39,920
could be.
That would be the best.

1749
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:45,400
No,
you don't know what that is exactly 

1750
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:45,400
because how do you know?
You know,

1751
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:50,111
but you could think,
well that would be really good if I 

1752
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:50,111
could have it.
And then you could say,

1753
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:54,191
well,
can I think of anything better than 

1754
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:54,191
that?
And if the answer is no,

1755
01:28:54,191 --> 01:28:55,160
then well why not go for that?

1756
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,170
You know?
And you might say,

1757
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:58,700
well,
it's too ambitious,

1758
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:00,410
it takes too much responsibility.
It's like,

1759
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:00,920
yeah,
yeah,

1760
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:02,820
that,
those are definitely problems.

1761
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:07,821
And one of the things that I've figured 
out over the years is that if you 

1762
01:29:07,821 --> 01:29:07,821
offered the person the opportunity,
you know,

1763
01:29:07,950 --> 01:29:08,790
because people say,
well,

1764
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:11,280
life doesn't really have any ultimate 
meaning.

1765
01:29:11,281 --> 01:29:12,300
It's like,
yeah,

1766
01:29:12,301 --> 01:29:13,050
okay,
fine.

1767
01:29:13,051 --> 01:29:15,450
So fine.
Let's say it has an ultimate meaning,

1768
01:29:16,640 --> 01:29:20,850
but that in order to experience that 
ultimate meaning,

1769
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:24,960
you have to take on ultimate 
responsibility for what you do.

1770
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:27,030
Well,
that's a heavy price to pay,

1771
01:29:27,031 --> 01:29:29,280
to have a meaningful life.
You know?

1772
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:29,960
And you might say,
well,

1773
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:31,620
there's no damn way I'm going to do 
that.

1774
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:34,200
I'll just go for the pointless.

1775
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:40,850
I'll go for that.
The trivial pointless perspective,

1776
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:43,220
which you know was kind of hard on me 
existentially,

1777
01:29:43,221 --> 01:29:45,980
but it frees me up.
I can do whatever the hell I want moment

1778
01:29:45,981 --> 01:29:50,981
to moment.
I don't have any ultimate 

1779
01:29:50,981 --> 01:29:50,981
responsibility.
And so then you think,

1780
01:29:50,981 --> 01:29:52,220
well that's kind of a good deal.
And then then.

1781
01:29:52,221 --> 01:29:54,530
But that raises this weird specter of 
doubt,

1782
01:29:54,531 --> 01:29:58,310
which is why when you hear people talk 
about the ultimate futility of life,

1783
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:03,610
is it because life is ultimately futile 
or is it because they've decided that 

1784
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:08,680
they would just as soon not adopt the 
responsibility and they use that real 

1785
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:13,691
decision,
which is to not adopt the 

1786
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:15,281
responsibility.
They rationalize that by proposing that 

1787
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:16,880
life is ultimately meaningful,
meaningless,

1788
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,290
and like,
you know,

1789
01:30:18,291 --> 01:30:20,780
I kind of by that I really do think 
that's what's going on.

1790
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:24,290
So,
but maybe not.

1791
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:30,670
But it could be that if you want to have
an ultimately meaningful life that you 

1792
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:33,320
have to adopt ultimate responsibility.
Makes Sense.

1793
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:37,780
What might that mean?
Well,

1794
01:30:37,781 --> 01:30:41,400
one thing it might mean is that,
and I do think it means this is it.

1795
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:45,770
I think it was Alexander Pope,
but I might be wrong about that.

1796
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:50,540
Who said nothing human is foreign to me.
And that's a hell of a statement,

1797
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:55,570
right?
Because if you think about all the 

1798
01:30:55,570 --> 01:30:56,450
things that human beings are capable of,
they're capable of some,

1799
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,540
like if you really want to know what 
people are capable of,

1800
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:02,120
you should read about read about unit 
seven slash 31,

1801
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:04,580
but I would not recommend it because if 
you read it,

1802
01:31:04,581 --> 01:31:07,490
you will never forget it and you will be
sorry that you read it,

1803
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:13,210
but you'll know anyways to say that 
nothing human is foreign to you.

1804
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:19,301
That's a hell of a thing to say because 
that means that what other people have 

1805
01:31:19,301 --> 01:31:23,351
done you could do.
And that also means you need to take 

1806
01:31:23,351 --> 01:31:25,520
responsibility for that.
That's no joke.

1807
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:30,610
You know,
it's a big deal to do that and even the 

1808
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:32,960
trivial manner anyways.
So the idea is that you can elevate.

1809
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:37,220
If you elevate your viewpoint to some 
transcendent ethic,

1810
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:40,310
you want what's ultimately good.
You really want that.

1811
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:45,340
Whatever that is you don't know,
but that's what you're even out says 

1812
01:31:45,411 --> 01:31:50,411
that,
well then it says this strange thing 

1813
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:50,411
that,
well,

1814
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:50,411
what you want,
we'll all of a sudden come to you.

1815
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,900
Well,
that's a proposition.

1816
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,440
The proposition that's basically played 
out in the movie,

1817
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:58,100
it's a hypothesis,
the hypothesis is the best way to Orient

1818
01:31:58,101 --> 01:32:00,040
yourself in life is to orient yourself

1819
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,040
towards the highest good that you're 
capable of imagining and then aim at 

1820
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:07,210
that and then things will work out the 
best way they can for you.

1821
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:09,670
And I think,
I believe that's correct.

1822
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:13,120
My,
my observation of life has led me to see

1823
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:16,030
that that seems to be correct.
So for example,

1824
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:21,660
you don't get something you don't aim at
that just doesn't work out and so lots 

1825
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:21,970
of people are not thinking that's what 
they get.

1826
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:27,330
So if you aim at something,
you have a reasonable crack at getting 

1827
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:27,330
it,
you know,

1828
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:31,500
you tend to change what you're aiming at
a bed along the way because like what 

1829
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:31,500
are,
you know,

1830
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:31,500
you know,
the aim there,

1831
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:35,911
you're wrong but you get a little closer
and then the aim there and you're still 

1832
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:36,010
wrong.
You get a little closer to the aim there

1833
01:32:36,011 --> 01:32:39,310
and you know as you move towards what 
you're aiming at,

1834
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:44,530
your,
your characterization of what to aim at 

1835
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:44,530
becomes more and more sophisticated.

1836
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:46,660
And so it doesn't really matter if 
you're wrong to begin with,

1837
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:51,661
as long as you're smart enough to learn 
on the way and as long as you specify a 

1838
01:32:51,661 --> 01:32:55,381
goal.
So I specify a vague what I want things 

1839
01:32:55,381 --> 01:32:56,740
to be the best they could be,
and I'm willing to learn what best means

1840
01:32:56,741 --> 01:32:58,240
as I go along.
Okay?

1841
01:32:58,241 --> 01:33:03,241
So fine.
And then you get what you truly need 

1842
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:03,241
will say,
well,

1843
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:06,100
maybe not know if your heart is in your 
dream.

1844
01:33:06,580 --> 01:33:08,740
What does that mean?
Well,

1845
01:33:09,070 --> 01:33:12,310
that to me reflects this idea of a kind 
of integrated viewpoint.

1846
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:15,190
One of the things young proposed was 
that as you,

1847
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,310
as you integrate yourself 
psychologically,

1848
01:33:18,311 --> 01:33:22,390
what happens is that your rationality 
integrates with your emotions.

1849
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:26,230
They stopped being opposed forces like 
the enlightenment ideas.

1850
01:33:26,231 --> 01:33:30,220
That rationality and desire are 
opposites and enemies in a sense.

1851
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:33,190
And the young Ian notion is,
and the psychoanalytic notion,

1852
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:38,191
I would say in general and the humanist 
notion even perhaps is the thought 

1853
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:38,191
that's not right.

1854
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:43,140
What you want to do is you want to 
integrate irrationality with your 

1855
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:46,681
emotions and your motivations.
They're not separable even in 

1856
01:33:46,681 --> 01:33:51,001
technically they have to work together 
and that all has to be integrated with 

1857
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:53,440
your body.
Not only do you have to take your,

1858
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:58,690
your heart into account and notice what 
it is that you want and don't want,

1859
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,380
but you also have to embody that.
You have to act that out in the world.

1860
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,270
So fine.
So that's what that means.

1861
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,770
And if you do that,
then well then your horizons open up.

1862
01:34:08,980 --> 01:34:10,900
And I also believe that's true.
You know,

1863
01:34:10,970 --> 01:34:14,410
I've known people in my life who were 
insanely successful,

1864
01:34:14,411 --> 01:34:19,000
like insanely successful and those 
people are like,

1865
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:22,300
they're there,
are pretty damn together about,

1866
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,890
you know,
like they're tough,

1867
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,650
smart,
strategic,

1868
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,970
generous,
you know,

1869
01:34:27,971 --> 01:34:29,800
they're always given people 
opportunities,

1870
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:33,020
honest,
like they've got it all and oh,

1871
01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:34,200
and,
and sometimes they're not.

1872
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:39,240
Now I'm not saying that everyone who's 
wildly successful is wildly successful 

1873
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,530
because they've got themselves together,
but you know,

1874
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:46,531
because there are crooks and you know,
there are people who gained status one 

1875
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:53,521
way or another by nefarious means.
But that's a lot more unstable than you 

1876
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:56,740
might think.
And I can't say exactly if that,

1877
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,420
if pursue that route,
you're going to pay for it,

1878
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,730
like you'll have your money or whatever 
it is,

1879
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:06,731
but it's not gonna do much good for you.
So and so it does seem to me to be the 

1880
01:35:08,511 --> 01:35:13,511
people that have integrated themselves 
and that and that are pursuing a noble 

1881
01:35:13,511 --> 01:35:14,630
goal,
high goal,

1882
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:19,960
who,
who actually are able to do remarkable 

1883
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:20,870
things and remarkable things can be done
at every level.

1884
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:25,871
You know,
it isn't like you'd have to change the 

1885
01:35:25,871 --> 01:35:27,791
world as a whole.
It could be that you do something 

1886
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:28,130
remarkable within your family,
you know,

1887
01:35:28,131 --> 01:35:30,560
and that's,
that can be tremendously admirable.

1888
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:35,590
You know,
someone's got to take care of a family 

1889
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:35,590
member if they're sick,
you know,

1890
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:35,590
you know,
like there's,

1891
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:37,790
there's heroic acts that you can 
undertake in the local environment.

1892
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:42,350
And maybe that will go on an heralded,
let's say.

1893
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:44,450
But that doesn't mean that it isn't 
remarkable.

1894
01:35:44,451 --> 01:35:47,240
I mean,
I've met people who are so damaged,

1895
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:49,100
you just can't imagine it.
And,

1896
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:51,560
and yet,
well,

1897
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:55,880
one person I met when I was at in 
Montreal was this woman and she was just

1898
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:56,660
ruined,
man.

1899
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,920
She,
she looked like a street person and she 

1900
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,731
was so shy,
she couldn't even look at you like she 

1901
01:36:03,731 --> 01:36:06,071
basically looked at the ground because 
it was like there was light emanating 

1902
01:36:06,071 --> 01:36:08,330
from everyone else and she was way too 
timid and humbled to even bear it,

1903
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:13,800
you know,
and partly what I was doing was trying 

1904
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,371
to get her to straighten up and not look
so street person because it wasn't going

1905
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:17,300
very well for her in social 
interactions,

1906
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:17,630
you know.

1907
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:23,050
But it turned out that that isn't what 
she came to the behavior therapy unit 

1908
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:23,210
four.
And she had her,

1909
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,240
I think she lived with her attitude was 
like schizophrenia.

1910
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:31,330
And,
and then her aunt's boyfriend was an 

1911
01:36:31,330 --> 01:36:34,511
alcoholic who like went on long 
harangues about the devil and it's like 

1912
01:36:34,511 --> 01:36:36,560
really mad and she wasn't bright.
This woman,

1913
01:36:36,561 --> 01:36:37,640
she really wasn't.
And,

1914
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:38,720
and,
um,

1915
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:44,260
you know,
she didn't really have a job and it was 

1916
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:44,260
just like,
it was just not good in every way.

1917
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:48,560
And then she also had this unbelievable 
humility and,

1918
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,040
but then,
you know,

1919
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:55,160
it turned out what she wanted.
I just couldn't bloody well believe 

1920
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,671
this,
that she had this dog and she used to 

1921
01:36:57,671 --> 01:36:59,861
walk it around.
She took care of the dog and now you 

1922
01:36:59,861 --> 01:36:59,861
know,
that was a good thing and she'd actually

1923
01:36:59,861 --> 01:37:00,470
been an inpatient at the Douglas 
Hospital,

1924
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:05,471
which is where I was working and the 
Orient Patients in the Douglas Hospital 

1925
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:07,310
and this was back in the eighties and 
those people were like,

1926
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:11,300
she was like super woman compared to the
inpatients at the Douglas Hospital.

1927
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:15,800
Those people looked like they were from 
a Hieronymus Bosch painting because they

1928
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:20,801
had deinstitutionalized everyone that 
could possibly be deinstitutionalized.

1929
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:26,020
And so the only people that were left 
were people who couldn't be dns to 

1930
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:29,500
institutionalized.
And so those would have been people who 

1931
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:29,500
are in the sight words for like 30 
years.

1932
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,191
And all of the hospitals were connected 
by tunnels underground in the patients 

1933
01:37:33,191 --> 01:37:35,030
used to hang out down there by the coke 
machine and so forth.

1934
01:37:35,031 --> 01:37:36,470
And one day I took my brother down 
there.

1935
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:41,471
He was visiting and like,
it was just like he just turned white 

1936
01:37:41,471 --> 01:37:43,010
because it was just really,
I don't know if,

1937
01:37:43,011 --> 01:37:44,330
you know,
Hieronymus Bosch,

1938
01:37:44,331 --> 01:37:46,550
he's very,
an interesting painter to say the least,

1939
01:37:46,551 --> 01:37:48,440
but that's what it was like.
And so,

1940
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:50,420
so here was her idea.
She,

1941
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:52,640
she'd come to the behavior therapy unit 
because she had been,

1942
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,240
she'd been in the inpatient ward for 
awhile and she met some of these like 

1943
01:37:58,240 --> 01:37:59,490
ruined people and she tried to get the 
hospital.

1944
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,080
She thought,
well I'm walking my dog,

1945
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:01,830
you know,
what,

1946
01:38:01,831 --> 01:38:04,080
maybe I could take one of these patients
out for a walk,

1947
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:09,320
you know,
and she'd been talking to the hospital 

1948
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,941
administrators trying to get her,
allow her to go take out one of these 

1949
01:38:10,941 --> 01:38:14,571
patients and go for a walk with her dog.
And basically she had come to the 

1950
01:38:14,571 --> 01:38:15,410
behavior therapy unit because that's 
what she wanted to do.

1951
01:38:15,411 --> 01:38:16,680
It's like,
man,

1952
01:38:16,681 --> 01:38:18,400
that person,
she just blew me away.

1953
01:38:18,401 --> 01:38:21,930
I like,
it's like I just couldn't believe it.

1954
01:38:22,050 --> 01:38:25,200
Like she had nothing going for her,
like nothing.

1955
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:27,530
And yet she wanted to,
you know,

1956
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:32,540
help some people that were worse off.
And like there just weren't that many 

1957
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:36,561
people that were worse off than her mind
boggling mind boggling and I never 

1958
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,450
forgot it.
And it really,

1959
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:41,630
it really blew me away.
So you know,

1960
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:46,640
there are opportunities for,
for elevating your sites within your 

1961
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:49,710
realm of capability,
wherever you happen to be.

1962
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,780
And,
and that's interesting.

1963
01:38:51,781 --> 01:38:54,780
It's,
it's strange that that's the case.

1964
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:02,810
She brings those who love,
that's what that should say,

1965
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:06,980
the sweet fulfillment of their secret 
longing like a bolt out of the blue fate

1966
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:11,300
characterized here as feminine.
And that's what happens in the movie.

1967
01:39:11,301 --> 01:39:15,020
The movie's got a Christian underbelly,
like it's quite pronounced,

1968
01:39:15,021 --> 01:39:17,210
but it's really a pagan movie in many 
ways.

1969
01:39:17,211 --> 01:39:20,650
So for example,
there's no blue fairy in,

1970
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:22,430
and the reason I'm speaking of 
Christianity,

1971
01:39:22,431 --> 01:39:27,431
of course,
is because this movie was created in a 

1972
01:39:27,431 --> 01:39:28,120
culture where Christianity was still 
reasonably intact.

1973
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,710
And of course it was fully informed by 
that.

1974
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:34,610
But the underlying mythos is not 
precisely Christian,

1975
01:39:34,611 --> 01:39:36,890
even though it's informed by Christian 
imagery.

1976
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:42,340
There is this old idea,
I think it's a gnostic idea that the 

1977
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:43,190
wisdom of God is feminine,
something like that.

1978
01:39:43,191 --> 01:39:48,191
And Anima,
which means soul is feminine and so 

1979
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:48,191
there's,
there's,

1980
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:48,860
there's an idea like that lurking here.

1981
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,890
And anyways,
that's fate and that's the blue fairy in

1982
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:52,930
this particular movie,
you know,

1983
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:57,230
she comes down from the star which kind 
of makes her an Avatar of God.

1984
01:39:57,231 --> 01:39:58,370
That's,
that's the idea.

1985
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:02,510
And she's the transformative agent.
She's really mother nature,

1986
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,370
you know,
in her positive guys.

1987
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:09,371
And that's why she can animate to 
animate something means to infuse it 

1988
01:40:09,371 --> 01:40:10,520
with soul.
That's what it means.

1989
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:12,440
And she animates Pinocchio,
right?

1990
01:40:12,441 --> 01:40:17,441
She's the,
the forest that frees him from his 

1991
01:40:17,441 --> 01:40:17,441
strings.
And so that's her fate,

1992
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:22,570
like a bolt out of the blue.
The blue faith steps in and sees you 

1993
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:22,570
through.
Well,

1994
01:40:22,570 --> 01:40:27,360
what that means,
it means something like mean something 

1995
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:27,710
like this is that,
you know,

1996
01:40:27,711 --> 01:40:32,711
if you orient yourself properly in the 
world and we'll say that you do that by 

1997
01:40:32,711 --> 01:40:34,730
trying to attain the ultimate goal,
whatever that happens to be,

1998
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:38,240
then it's as if the world is on your 
side and,

1999
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,880
and,
and things go well for you.

2000
01:40:40,881 --> 01:40:45,881
And I also believe that's true because 
certainly one of the things that's more 

2001
01:40:45,881 --> 01:40:47,180
or less self evident is that generally 
speaking,

2002
01:40:47,181 --> 01:40:49,400
if you tell the truth,
things go a lot better for you.

2003
01:40:49,401 --> 01:40:51,200
And the reason for that is,
well,

2004
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:54,220
you want to be,
you want to reality opposed

2005
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:57,100
to you or do you want to have reality 
backing you up?

2006
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:59,200
It's like it's a pretty straightforward 
question.

2007
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,320
If you're truthful to the degree that 
you can be truthful,

2008
01:41:02,321 --> 01:41:07,321
then reality is on your side.
That's a good thing because there's a 

2009
01:41:07,321 --> 01:41:07,510
lot of it.
There isn't a bunch of you.

2010
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:10,150
Whereas if you take a deceitful approach
to things,

2011
01:41:10,151 --> 01:41:15,040
then while then you're.
You're challenging reality.

2012
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:15,690
It's like,
good,

2013
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:19,750
good luck with that man.
It's like you're holding a plastic ruler

2014
01:41:19,751 --> 01:41:24,490
in front of your face and bending it and
at some point you're going to let go and

2015
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:29,491
it's going to all that force that you've
stored up and it's going to snap back 

2016
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:34,351
and nail you and that that happens.
Or like I've just never seen anyone in 

2017
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:38,170
my clinical practice ever get away with 
anything.

2018
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:41,020
Nothing.
And it's not surprising.

2019
01:41:41,021 --> 01:41:44,080
It's like if you're going to mess with 
the structure of reality,

2020
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:49,410
like it's gonna mess back and it does 
and it might not happen for years and 

2021
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:53,641
you might not even notice the connection
being part of what you do in 

2022
01:41:53,641 --> 01:41:55,270
psychotherapy is to actually make those 
connections.

2023
01:41:55,270 --> 01:42:00,270
It's like,
why did this horrible thing happened to 

2024
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:00,270
me?
Well,

2025
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:01,660
who knows?
It's like let's take it apart while May,

2026
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:05,620
who knows how far back we have to go.
It might even have things to do,

2027
01:42:05,621 --> 01:42:10,621
not even with you.
It might have things to do with the 

2028
01:42:10,621 --> 01:42:13,020
errors in your parents' relationship.
Like you just can't mess with the 

2029
01:42:13,511 --> 01:42:14,850
structure of reality.
It,

2030
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:20,320
it,
it stays warped until you straighten it 

2031
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,690
out and it is not good.
So,

2032
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,690
so there's an injunction here,
which is that,

2033
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:28,120
you know,
if you've followed this path,

2034
01:42:28,121 --> 01:42:31,810
you pick a high goal and you put your 
heart in it,

2035
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,580
you know,
you commit to it,

2036
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:37,840
believe in it.
Believe means to love,

2037
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,150
believe and beloved.
It's the same thing.

2038
01:42:40,151 --> 01:42:42,820
It means to act out.
And that's what the belief means.

2039
01:42:42,821 --> 01:42:47,821
Like we think belief means to accept a 
set of propositions as true or that is 

2040
01:42:47,821 --> 01:42:51,700
one form of belief,
but that's more like factual knowledge,

2041
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:56,701
right?
Belief is more like you decide that 

2042
01:42:56,701 --> 01:42:59,041
you're going to act something out,
you make a decision and then you act it 

2043
01:42:59,041 --> 01:42:59,830
out and that's a reflection of your 
belief.

2044
01:43:00,370 --> 01:43:00,790
You know,
it's,

2045
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:03,850
you're staking yourself on something.
Do you know?

2046
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:06,040
Well no,
because you can't.

2047
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:09,460
You can't know you're bonded by 
ignorance.

2048
01:43:09,461 --> 01:43:14,461
You can make your best guess and move 
forward and you can do that with 

2049
01:43:14,461 --> 01:43:17,461
commitment,
but you have to believe in order to do 

2050
01:43:17,461 --> 01:43:17,461
that.

2051
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:20,950
I guess that's why it's a wish.
Okay,

2052
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:25,951
so fine.
Well then we have jimminy cricket that 

2053
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:29,140
south southern US Slang for Jesus Christ
by the way.

2054
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:32,680
And the initial overlap isn't a fluke.
I mean,

2055
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:37,681
I'm sure the animators thought that was 
funny and of course it is funny and you 

2056
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:37,870
know,
in the lion king,

2057
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:42,610
you know that that at boone who is the 
Shaman basically?

2058
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:43,900
Well,
to begin with,

2059
01:43:43,901 --> 01:43:46,300
he was kind of just a comic relief 
character,

2060
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:47,530
like a fool,
you know.

2061
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:50,290
But one of the things you mentioned 
about the fool,

2062
01:43:50,530 --> 01:43:52,340
the fool tends to turn into the savior.

2063
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:53,840
It's an,
it's an archetypal reality.

2064
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:55,670
Bugs bunny is sort of like that,
you know,

2065
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:58,130
he's a trickster.
And as the,

2066
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,250
as the movie developed,
the character of the fool,

2067
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:03,690
baboons took on the full fledged,
you know,

2068
01:44:03,691 --> 01:44:05,730
Shaman,
priest element and,

2069
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:07,460
and you know,
okay,

2070
01:44:07,461 --> 01:44:09,540
well Jimminy cricket,
he's this little cricket and,

2071
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:12,920
and he turns out to be the conscience,
which is pretty damn weird.

2072
01:44:12,921 --> 01:44:17,270
It's like a bug is your conscience and a
bug is JC.

2073
01:44:17,271 --> 01:44:21,020
And it's like that's a very strange 
juxtaposition of ideas,

2074
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:22,910
conscience,
insect,

2075
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:25,370
savior.
It's like,

2076
01:44:25,371 --> 01:44:26,690
what,
what's up with that?

2077
01:44:27,110 --> 01:44:28,070
And so,
well,

2078
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:30,710
what bugs you?
That's part of it.

2079
01:44:31,490 --> 01:44:36,490
While your conscious conscience 
certainly bugs you and you should pay 

2080
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:38,150
attention to.
It's just little niggling annoying thing

2081
01:44:38,151 --> 01:44:40,280
that you can't quite,
you can override it,

2082
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:41,870
right?
Obviously,

2083
01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:45,410
but it's this swell.
And he says,

2084
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:48,980
when he talks to Pinocchio later,
he says it's that still small voice,

2085
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:51,020
you know,
and I've asked people before,

2086
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:52,530
like in my personality class,
like,

2087
01:44:53,190 --> 01:44:54,880
because conscience is a weird thing.

2088
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,530
And,
and like if I said to you,

2089
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:01,430
if you're about to do something that you
know you shouldn't do,

2090
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:05,450
do you have a voice in your head that 
tells you that you shouldn't do it?

2091
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:07,490
So how many people have had that 
experience?

2092
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:09,020
Okay,
okay,

2093
01:45:09,021 --> 01:45:09,650
good.
Now,

2094
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,290
so other people have a feeling instead 
of a voice.

2095
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:15,440
And so is there anybody here who's 
willing to admit it?

2096
01:45:15,530 --> 01:45:17,990
Who has neither the feeling nor the 
voice.

2097
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,420
Okay.
So,

2098
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:25,510
and you know,
it's a very understudied phenomena in 

2099
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:25,510
psychology.
This conscience.

2100
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:29,441
I mean people can be conscientious and 
maybe those are people who listen to 

2101
01:45:29,441 --> 01:45:30,170
their conscience more.
I don't know,

2102
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:35,290
but nobody's ever investigated it.
And the fact that you do have this 

2103
01:45:35,290 --> 01:45:35,810
little voice,
whatever it is inside your head,

2104
01:45:35,811 --> 01:45:37,580
it's like,
what the hell's up with that?

2105
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,280
You know?
And it doesn't tell you what you want to

2106
01:45:40,281 --> 01:45:42,770
hear least as far as I can tell.

2107
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:47,770
Now you could say,
well that's the internal representation 

2108
01:45:47,770 --> 01:45:48,680
of society operating within you.
That'd be a Freudian view.

2109
01:45:48,681 --> 01:45:51,860
That's the Super Ego.
And certainly there's something to that,

2110
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:56,630
but I don't think it's necessary to 
presume that that's all there is to it.

2111
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:59,120
And even if it is,
you still wouldn't have the voice.

2112
01:45:59,121 --> 01:46:04,121
It's if you didn't have the biological 
potential to have that voice embedded 

2113
01:46:04,121 --> 01:46:08,661
itself in you.
So even if it is socio culturally 

2114
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:08,720
constructed,
which it is in part,

2115
01:46:09,080 --> 01:46:14,080
it's like language,
it's like your language associated 

2116
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:16,590
culturally constructed.
But the reason you can speak is because 

2117
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:17,090
human beings can speak and if you have a
conscience,

2118
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:22,091
it's because human beings have a 
conscience and the contents of that 

2119
01:46:22,091 --> 01:46:23,930
conscience might differ.
But the fact that it exists,

2120
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,950
what seems to me to be a universal.
Okay,

2121
01:46:27,951 --> 01:46:29,630
so,
well that's the conscience.

2122
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:35,080
And that's Jimminy cricket.
And then crick the cricket opens this 

2123
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:37,130
book and then you look at the book and 
you think,

2124
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:38,780
well what kind of book is that?
Well,

2125
01:46:38,781 --> 01:46:41,990
it's got a spotlight on it.
So it's being highlighted.

2126
01:46:41,991 --> 01:46:44,210
This is an important book.
And what kind of book is it?

2127
01:46:44,211 --> 01:46:45,590
Well,
it's leather bound.

2128
01:46:45,591 --> 01:46:47,000
It has a lock on it,
you know,

2129
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,070
it's not something cheap book.
It's kind of like a,

2130
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,010
you might think about,

2131
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:53,550
it looks like something from an old 
library or maybe it looks biblical,

2132
01:46:53,551 --> 01:46:56,130
whatever.
It's a major league book and this bug is

2133
01:46:56,131 --> 01:47:01,131
the introduction to the book.
So it does that mean your conscience is 

2134
01:47:01,131 --> 01:47:03,420
the introduction to the book?
Well maybe that is what it means.

2135
01:47:03,421 --> 01:47:08,421
It's certainly what's being played out 
in the movie while then the cricket 

2136
01:47:08,421 --> 01:47:09,150
opens the book and so then what do you 
see?

2137
01:47:09,151 --> 01:47:10,260
Well,
what does that look like?

2138
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:15,250
What does it look like?
What does it remind you of?

2139
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,990
Okay,
so that's the van Gogh painting.

2140
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:24,470
It's a nativity scene.
It's the,

2141
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:28,700
it's the Christmas star and you know 
that because what's going to happen?

2142
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:30,410
Well,
the hero is going to be born.

2143
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,950
That's what happens.
And so a star signifies that.

2144
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:37,340
Why does this star signify the birth of 
an infant,

2145
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:38,630
let's say?
Well,

2146
01:47:38,631 --> 01:47:43,180
because there's something miraculous 
about the birth of an infant and,

2147
01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:47,330
and why would the infant be a savior,
which is the Christian notion say,

2148
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:52,660
well,
because that's what the infant is 

2149
01:47:52,660 --> 01:47:54,670
potentially every infant.
And so that's how you should act about 

2150
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:55,220
them.
And you know,

2151
01:47:55,221 --> 01:47:57,920
one of the things that really is 
interesting about having little kids,

2152
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:03,400
and I loved having little kids,
is that you have this opportunity to 

2153
01:48:03,400 --> 01:48:05,420
have this pristine relationship with 
someone like,

2154
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:10,660
like a relationship you've never had 
with anyone because the kid really is 

2155
01:48:10,660 --> 01:48:10,700
just there to love you.

2156
01:48:10,730 --> 01:48:12,170
You like,
if you don't screw it up,

2157
01:48:12,171 --> 01:48:15,320
you've got that.
And then you can keep that going.

2158
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:20,380
You know,
and you can try to keep that 

2159
01:48:20,380 --> 01:48:20,510
relationship like pristine.
And that's so fun.

2160
01:48:20,511 --> 01:48:22,370
It's so fun to try to do that.
It's,

2161
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,880
it's really,
it's amazing.

2162
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:29,840
It's an amazing thing and you know,
kids get a bad rap in our society,

2163
01:48:29,841 --> 01:48:34,841
but it's an amazing thing to have little
kids and they are remarkable and they 

2164
01:48:35,900 --> 01:48:38,930
give you back far more than they require
from you.

2165
01:48:38,931 --> 01:48:41,540
And partly because they treat you like 
you're,

2166
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:46,900
you're valuable beyond belief.
That's what the kid thinks about you.

2167
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,670
It's like,
that's pretty good.

2168
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:55,480
So yeah,
it's like something divine is going to 

2169
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:55,480
happen and so,
okay,

2170
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:55,480
fine,
you know,

2171
01:48:55,480 --> 01:48:58,240
fair enough.
Well,

2172
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:03,241
there's The star signifying that and,
and that's associated in some way with 

2173
01:49:03,241 --> 01:49:04,450
this star that you're supposed to wish 
upon.

2174
01:49:04,750 --> 01:49:05,710
Well,
that's Kinda odd.

2175
01:49:05,711 --> 01:49:10,711
Like there's this,
there's this relationship that's 

2176
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:13,261
implicit,
that star that signifies the birth of 

2177
01:49:13,261 --> 01:49:13,261
the hero is the same star that you wish 
upon.

2178
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:13,770
Well,

2179
01:49:15,730 --> 01:49:20,730
perhaps the star that you're wishing 
upon is the wish that the hero will be 

2180
01:49:20,730 --> 01:49:22,090
born in your soul.
It's something like that.

2181
01:49:22,091 --> 01:49:24,880
You're aiming at an ideal.
It's the ideal you,

2182
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,980
whatever that would be.
Well,

2183
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:30,040
you can certainly figure out what it 
isn't.

2184
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:32,800
That's where you start as far as I can 
tell,

2185
01:49:33,010 --> 01:49:33,610
you know,
you know,

2186
01:49:33,611 --> 01:49:38,611
what you shouldn't be doing and you 
could at least stop doing those things 

2187
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:39,130
and then see what happens.
You know,

2188
01:49:39,131 --> 01:49:41,680
and if you ask yourself,
it's a meditative exercise,

2189
01:49:41,681 --> 01:49:46,681
you know,
and you do this with the autobiography 

2190
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:46,681
to some degree.
It's like,

2191
01:49:46,681 --> 01:49:50,010
okay,
sit down for minutes and have a little 

2192
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:50,010
dialogue

2193
01:49:50,010 --> 01:49:53,430
with yourself.
Like you actually wanted to know the 

2194
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,430
answer,
you know?

2195
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,430
So yeah,
ask,

2196
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:55,390
well,
I'm probably doing something stupid that

2197
01:49:55,391 --> 01:50:00,391
if I quit doing my life would be better.
That I could quit doing that I would 

2198
01:50:00,391 --> 01:50:04,201
quit doing and maybe it's not a very big
thing because you're not very 

2199
01:50:04,201 --> 01:50:07,651
disciplined,
but maybe there's something to ask 

2200
01:50:07,651 --> 01:50:07,651
yourself that question,
man,

2201
01:50:07,651 --> 01:50:09,430
you'll have an answer no time flat.
Like,

2202
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:10,600
well,
I should start doing this.

2203
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:11,080
It's like,
yeah,

2204
01:50:11,090 --> 01:50:13,600
I know I didn't,
you know,

2205
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:14,560
I won't,
but.

2206
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,930
Or maybe I would,
but if I did,

2207
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:22,410
I know my life would be better.
It's like you can figure that out 

2208
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:23,200
immediately and if you do that 100 
times,

2209
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:27,520
well you'll be in way better shape.
So if you don't know what to do,

2210
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:32,521
that's good.
You could at least figure out what you 

2211
01:50:32,521 --> 01:50:33,070
shouldn't do.
That's just moronically pathetic and you

2212
01:50:33,071 --> 01:50:35,440
can be sure you're doing like a dozen of
those things.

2213
01:50:35,441 --> 01:50:38,640
At least you know,
procrastinating or you know,

2214
01:50:39,910 --> 01:50:42,760
you know everyone.
That's what the conscience tells you and

2215
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:47,761
if you ask,
they'll just tell you why you're stupid 

2216
01:50:47,761 --> 01:50:48,520
and insufficient.
And so who wants to hear that?

2217
01:50:48,580 --> 01:50:48,820
But

2218
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:52,280
what?
Maybe you could do something about it.

2219
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:58,920
Okay.
So the cricut comes into the village 

2220
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:00,811
there and he sees this,
this little house and there's a little 

2221
01:51:00,811 --> 01:51:02,020
fire in it and so it's Kinda got a 
welcoming place.

2222
01:51:02,021 --> 01:51:03,640
It's a light in the darkness,
this house,

2223
01:51:03,641 --> 01:51:08,641
just like the star.
And so he hops towards it and then he 

2224
01:51:08,641 --> 01:51:11,431
ends up inside it and you know,
there's a nice fire and you get to see 

2225
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:12,460
the inside and the insights.
It's cozy,

2226
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:17,760
it's welcoming.
And then when you look around you see 

2227
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,011
that everything's kind of in its place.
It's not hyper organized or anything 

2228
01:51:20,011 --> 01:51:21,310
like that.
It's friendly and welcoming and it's,

2229
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:26,490
there's a lot of wood and there's a nice
fire and then there's toys everywhere 

2230
01:51:26,490 --> 01:51:30,360
and they're well constructed.
So you know that whoever lives there 

2231
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:30,640
likes children.
And so if someone likes children,

2232
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:35,720
well if someone doesn't like children,
it's like you should run away from them 

2233
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:35,720
very rapidly.

2234
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:39,390
But if they liked children,
well then that's a good sign that you 

2235
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:39,390
know Jesus there,
at least human.

2236
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:40,300
It's a start,
you know?

2237
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:44,650
And then these things are all high 
quality.

2238
01:51:44,651 --> 01:51:46,960
They're made very well.
And then there's,

2239
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:49,120
and he's looking around to see all of 
this and there's,

2240
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:54,340
there's toys and there's clocks and 
they're all handmade and so he sort of 

2241
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,420
infers that maybe there's a woodcarver,
who,

2242
01:51:55,450 --> 01:51:57,850
who lives there and a woodcarver.
Someone who,

2243
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:03,180
who can build things.
And if you build things that work and 

2244
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:03,180
that are beautiful,
that's,

2245
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:03,700
that's a kind of truth,
right?

2246
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:06,010
It's like it's built right into the 
object.

2247
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,060
That's what quality is.
Quality is the,

2248
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:12,700
the building into an object of truth.
The thing works.

2249
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:15,130
It does what it's supposed to.
It has integrity.

2250
01:52:15,131 --> 01:52:19,070
And so you see that everywhere inherent.
So you're getting a sense of that.

2251
01:52:19,090 --> 01:52:22,960
The filmmakers are setting the stage and
so while.

2252
01:52:22,990 --> 01:52:27,990
So they set the stage by showing you the
stage and the cricket tells you what he 

2253
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:28,510
sees and he's pretty happy to be there 
because.

2254
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:31,450
And this is also someone who's concerned
about time,

2255
01:52:31,451 --> 01:52:33,280
right?
Because there's a lot of clocks,

2256
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:36,400
there's a lot of clocks.
And so time turns out to be an important

2257
01:52:36,401 --> 01:52:40,840
sub element of this story.
And then he sees the puppet marionette.

2258
01:52:40,841 --> 01:52:43,720
And so what's a marion out?
Well,

2259
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:45,710
a marionette.
He's sitting on the shelf.

2260
01:52:45,880 --> 01:52:50,880
A marionette is something that's 
[inaudible] animated because it can 

2261
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:51,830
move,
it doesn't really have a soul,

2262
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,530
but it sort of acts like it has a soul 
it in,

2263
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:55,070
in,
in,

2264
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:57,620
in the sense of anima and soul.
It animated and.

2265
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:02,830
But a Marionette is something that is 
being manipulated by something else 

2266
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:03,650
behind the scenes,
right?

2267
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:06,050
It doesn't have its own volition.
It's,

2268
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:11,170
it's dependent on the will have 
something behind the scenes and so 

2269
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:15,401
there's a strong implication that 
whatever this thing is is half formed 

2270
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:20,620
and that it's being manipulated by 
unseen forces behind unseen forces 

2271
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,070
behind the facade.

2272
01:53:25,340 --> 01:53:26,190
Well,
that's a Friday.

2273
01:53:26,240 --> 01:53:28,430
An idea that's you.
That's all of you.

2274
01:53:28,431 --> 01:53:33,431
You know,
you're polled hither and fro by 

2275
01:53:33,431 --> 01:53:37,090
unconscious forces and some of those are
biological and some of them are 

2276
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:37,090
cultural.
You know,

2277
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:41,531
and you think about people who are swept
up in great ideological movements like 

2278
01:53:41,531 --> 01:53:44,660
the Communists or the fascist is like 
those people are marionettes.

2279
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:48,050
That's exactly what they are.
They all say the same thing.

2280
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:53,051
They all mount the same words.
They all act the same way and some 

2281
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:55,160
things behind it.
And the question is what will,

2282
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:58,010
that is the question and that's partly 
what this movie tries to figure out.

2283
01:53:58,011 --> 01:54:01,760
So you see this Marionette,
he's at half formed,

2284
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:05,870
wouldn't headed puppet and he has a 
little bit of potential,

2285
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:10,900
you know,
and the cricket goes up and interacts 

2286
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:10,900
with them and sees that he's made out of
pretty good.

2287
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:13,460
Would it makes a little joke about 
having a wooden head and you know,

2288
01:54:13,461 --> 01:54:15,170
that's kind of obvious what that means.

2289
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:18,440
And you noticed the cricket is dressed 
like a tramp.

2290
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:21,830
And,
and when you first saw him he wasn't,

2291
01:54:21,831 --> 01:54:23,720
he was dressed like in 19 twenties,
millionaire.

2292
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:25,270
So,
but now,

2293
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,560
but here he's a tramp and this is so 
interesting.

2294
01:54:27,561 --> 01:54:29,030
It's like,
so this bug,

2295
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:32,960
that's a messiah,
that's the introduction to the book,

2296
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:36,110
that's the conscience is also a tramp 
with no home.

2297
01:54:36,350 --> 01:54:41,350
It's like what does that mean?
And it took me a long time to sort that 

2298
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:43,040
out.
And it's like he's been everywhere.

2299
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:45,610
This tramp,
he's been everywhere and,

2300
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:50,760
and he knows he's,
he's traveled the world and anybody who 

2301
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:51,980
doesn't have a place,
he doesn't have a home.

2302
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:55,220
He hasn't made a relationship with 
anything real yet.

2303
01:54:55,221 --> 01:54:56,990
He's.
He's kind of a potential,

2304
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:02,290
and this is one of the things that's 
really interesting about this movie 

2305
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:04,841
because if you think about the cricket 
as a fragment of the of the hero and say

2306
01:55:05,151 --> 01:55:08,120
a,
a reflection of the of the savior,

2307
01:55:08,121 --> 01:55:10,910
which is his relationship with JCC of 
course,

2308
01:55:10,911 --> 01:55:15,911
and the person who introduces the book,
then the story gets strange because if 

2309
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:19,670
it was merely a representation of the 
perfect person,

2310
01:55:19,671 --> 01:55:24,671
the archetype of the hero,
then the conscience would know 

2311
01:55:24,671 --> 01:55:24,671
everything,
right,

2312
01:55:24,671 --> 01:55:27,530
and it would just tell the puppet what 
to do and that would be the end of it,

2313
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:28,910
but that,
first of all,

2314
01:55:28,911 --> 01:55:29,990
that's adult story.

2315
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:31,640
It's like perfect conscience comes 
along.

2316
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:35,840
Puppet does everything.
It says Bingo perfection,

2317
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:41,410
but that isn't what happens.
There's this weird idea that this thing 

2318
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:44,280
that's got all these attributes needs a 
home and has

2319
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:49,280
to enter into a learning relationship 
with the thing that it's trying to 

2320
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,660
transform.
It's so sophisticated because you know,

2321
01:55:51,661 --> 01:55:54,300
I could say you should do what your 
conscience tells you.

2322
01:55:54,980 --> 01:55:55,800
It's like,
well,

2323
01:55:55,801 --> 01:55:58,470
maybe not.
Maybe that's not exactly how it works.

2324
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:01,680
Maybe your conscience isn't omniscient 
and omnipotent.

2325
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:04,860
Maybe it's not gone right.
It's a guide,

2326
01:56:05,130 --> 01:56:05,720
but it's.
It's,

2327
01:56:05,790 --> 01:56:08,370
it's,
it's maybe smarter than you sometimes.

2328
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:13,610
Maybe because it's society in your head 
and obviously it's smarter than you 

2329
01:56:13,610 --> 01:56:17,571
sometimes because it tells you not to do
something and you go do it and then you 

2330
01:56:17,571 --> 01:56:18,960
get into trouble and he's like,
what if I would've just listened?

2331
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:20,970
But you don't.
And that's interesting too.

2332
01:56:20,971 --> 01:56:23,580
It's something that you don't have to 
listen to,

2333
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,350
which is seems to be associated with 
freewill.

2334
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:31,430
It's weird.
It's like if your conscience knows what 

2335
01:56:31,430 --> 01:56:33,620
to do,
why aren't you just a deterministic 

2336
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:34,890
puppet of your conscience Christ?
That would work a lot better.

2337
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,650
You wouldn't have to torture yourself 
and you would make any mistakes.

2338
01:56:37,651 --> 01:56:40,440
So why the separation?
Well,

2339
01:56:40,441 --> 01:56:42,840
maybe it's because of the conscience is 
generic

2340
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:47,730
and so it has to be taught.
It has to learn to.

2341
01:56:47,731 --> 01:56:50,250
And so what you do is you have a 
dialogue with your conscience.

2342
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:55,430
It's something like that and then you 
expose yourself to more and more of the 

2343
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:56,220
world and you get wiser in your 
conscience.

2344
01:56:56,221 --> 01:57:01,221
Gets wiser and you,
you mature together and that's what 

2345
01:57:01,221 --> 01:57:03,930
happens in this story because the 
cricket starts out as a tramp that,

2346
01:57:04,210 --> 01:57:09,210
you know,
is smarter than the puppet but not as 

2347
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:09,210
smart as he thinks he is.
That's for sure.

2348
01:57:09,210 --> 01:57:11,640
And when he first starts to operate as a
conscience,

2349
01:57:11,641 --> 01:57:13,200
he's completely useless.
Added.

2350
01:57:13,201 --> 01:57:18,201
He babbles off a lot of cliches about 
morality and then he's late the first 

2351
01:57:18,201 --> 01:57:20,100
day for his job and he's just not very 
good at it.

2352
01:57:20,101 --> 01:57:22,800
And so there's this weird idea that the 
conscience,

2353
01:57:22,801 --> 01:57:25,830
which is part of what puts you towards 
redemption,

2354
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:31,100
is something that you actually have to 
interact with over the course of your 

2355
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,370
life in order for it to develop as you 
develop.

2356
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:35,820
And so then I would also say that the 
cricket represents,

2357
01:57:35,821 --> 01:57:38,220
at least in part what you described as 
the self,

2358
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:43,250
which is like the potential fully 
developed human being that sort of 

2359
01:57:43,250 --> 01:57:45,780
exists within you as a possibility,
but it has to be.

2360
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:49,200
It has to be manifest in the actual 
conditions of your life.

2361
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:53,580
And so the conscience has to learn how 
to position itself here and now.

2362
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:56,940
And it's got generic advice and that's 
not good enough.

2363
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,280
And so that's why the cricket is looking
for a home.

2364
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:04,400
And so he needs a home even though he's 
all these other things we already said 

2365
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,600
he was,
he has to find a specific home before he

2366
01:58:06,601 --> 01:58:10,560
can become who he could be.
Well,

2367
01:58:10,561 --> 01:58:11,400
so then Japan,
oh,

2368
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:16,430
shows up and he's a kindly old guy,
which is pretty much exactly what you'd 

2369
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:16,430
expect.
And you know,

2370
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:20,740
he,
he's a careful craftsman and he likes 

2371
01:58:20,740 --> 01:58:20,740
kittens and you know,
that's always a good thing.

2372
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:27,090
And he has some fish and I know he's.
And He's good at making things and he's 

2373
01:58:27,371 --> 01:58:29,230
got a sense of humor and he's kind of 
playful.

2374
01:58:29,231 --> 01:58:30,040
And so he's,
he's a,

2375
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:31,990
he's a good father.
Fundamentally.

2376
01:58:32,140 --> 01:58:37,140
He's the wise king.
He's the positive archetype of the 

2377
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:37,140
masculine.
That's what he is.

2378
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:39,730
And so he's culture and it's positive 
manifestation.

2379
01:58:39,731 --> 01:58:43,360
And he gives rise to this creation,
which is his puppet,

2380
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:46,360
which is what culture does because 
you're a puppet of your culture,

2381
01:58:46,361 --> 01:58:51,361
you're a Marionette of your culture.
And so maybe you could be more than 

2382
01:58:51,361 --> 01:58:51,361
that.

2383
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:54,540
And that's the other thing that's 
strange about this movie,

2384
01:58:54,541 --> 01:58:59,541
and it's strange about the mythological 
way of looking at the world because 

2385
01:58:59,541 --> 01:59:02,391
scientifically deterministically,
there's nature and there's culture and 

2386
01:59:03,781 --> 01:59:07,740
you are the deterministic product of the
interaction between nature and culture.

2387
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:10,800
There's nothing else to you than that.
That's that.

2388
01:59:11,370 --> 01:59:13,530
But the mythological world doesn't say 
that.

2389
01:59:13,531 --> 01:59:18,531
It says something different.
It says that there's nature and culture 

2390
01:59:18,531 --> 01:59:18,570
and then there's you

2391
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:24,910
and the you that's in there has choices 
and the destiny and that you actually 

2392
01:59:24,981 --> 01:59:29,981
affect the interplay of nature and 
culture in determining your own 

2393
01:59:29,981 --> 01:59:30,920
character.
And it insists upon that.

2394
01:59:30,921 --> 01:59:35,921
The oldest stories we have,
there's always the hero and the 

2395
01:59:35,921 --> 01:59:36,800
archetypal mother and the archetype of 
father.

2396
01:59:36,801 --> 01:59:39,710
There's always those three things.
There's never just two.

2397
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:44,980
So from a narrative perspective,
there's always the implication that 

2398
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:49,721
there is something autonomous about the,
the hero of the story and you know,

2399
01:59:50,630 --> 01:59:55,630
you can't account for that.
We don't have a good way of accounting 

2400
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:55,670
for that.
From a scientific perspective.

2401
01:59:55,970 --> 01:59:58,400
I was having a discussion with Sam 
Harris the other day,

2402
01:59:58,401 --> 02:00:00,380
which was very.

2403
02:00:03,720 --> 02:00:06,510
What would you say?
He said we got wrapped around an axle,

2404
02:00:06,511 --> 02:00:09,570
which is pretty much has.
Sam Harris is one of the four famous,

2405
02:00:09,571 --> 02:00:12,780
you know,
atheists along with Christopher Hitchens

2406
02:00:12,781 --> 02:00:16,890
and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett.
Yeah.

2407
02:00:16,891 --> 02:00:19,210
And so we were having a discussion and 
um,

2408
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:22,410
he's a determinist just right down to 
the bottom.

2409
02:00:22,411 --> 02:00:24,720
It's like you're determined,
you're determined,

2410
02:00:24,721 --> 02:00:27,630
there's no freewill.
You're a deterministic machine.

2411
02:00:27,631 --> 02:00:32,631
And you know,
if you're a coherent scientist and 

2412
02:00:32,631 --> 02:00:32,631
you're a Newtonian,
roughly speaking,

2413
02:00:32,631 --> 02:00:34,440
you don't really have much choice other 
than to think that way,

2414
02:00:34,441 --> 02:00:38,970
but that isn't how it seems to people 
and we don't treat each other that way.

2415
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:44,180
And our entire legal system is 
predicated on the idea that you do in 

2416
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,000
fact have freewill.
So.

2417
02:00:45,001 --> 02:00:46,410
Well,
can we account for it?

2418
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:47,310
Well,
no.

2419
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:49,470
And do we have a scientific model for 
it?

2420
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:52,320
No,
but then I would also say we do not have

2421
02:00:52,321 --> 02:00:54,060
a scientific model for consciousness.

2422
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:56,760
We don't know a damn thing about 
consciousness,

2423
02:00:57,030 --> 02:01:02,030
which is why Dan Dennett book,
which was called consciousness 

2424
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,030
explained,
was referred to.

2425
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:05,310
It's by it's critics as consciousness 
explained a way,

2426
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,760
which is exactly right as far as I'm 
concerned because he took a mechanistic 

2427
02:01:10,760 --> 02:01:14,091
approach and I just don't think you get 
to do that because there's something 

2428
02:01:14,091 --> 02:01:17,871
really weird about consciousness.
I mean the phenomenologists Heidegger,

2429
02:01:18,210 --> 02:01:22,110
who tried to radically transformed 
Western philosophy right from the bottom

2430
02:01:22,111 --> 02:01:23,160
up.
He basically said,

2431
02:01:23,161 --> 02:01:24,210
well,
you know,

2432
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,960
you can treat the world as if 
consciousness is primary and that human 

2433
02:01:29,960 --> 02:01:33,150
experience is reality.
That's reality and that he doesn't exist

2434
02:01:33,151 --> 02:01:36,720
independently of consciousness in any 
explicable way.

2435
02:01:36,810 --> 02:01:37,410
It's like,
well,

2436
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:40,340
what's out there?
If there's nothing to experience

2437
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,060
it,
well,

2438
02:01:41,061 --> 02:01:43,330
everything at once.
It's something like that.

2439
02:01:43,520 --> 02:01:48,520
It's not really comprehensible as 
without a subject that subject defines 

2440
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:48,920
it.
It makes it real.

2441
02:01:48,921 --> 02:01:50,470
Now you don't have to believe that,
but,

2442
02:01:50,810 --> 02:01:55,810
but at least I'm telling you that there 
are thoroughly coherent philosophical 

2443
02:01:56,211 --> 02:02:01,211
positions that make that case very 
strongly and that that allow 

2444
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:06,221
consciousness to exist as a phenomena 
and to take it seriously and you 

2445
02:02:06,221 --> 02:02:07,150
certainly act like you take it 
seriously.

2446
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:12,160
You Act like there's a you and that you 
make choices and you certainly treat 

2447
02:02:12,160 --> 02:02:14,330
other people that way.
Deterministic or not,

2448
02:02:14,331 --> 02:02:19,331
you're still gonna get angry when 
they're being rude to you and you're 

2449
02:02:19,331 --> 02:02:19,610
going to act as if they had some choice 
in the matter.

2450
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:22,070
Now,
maybe that's an illusion possibly,

2451
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:27,280
but maybe it's not.
And I would say the oldest stories that 

2452
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:30,380
we have always include that as not only 
as a fundamental element,

2453
02:02:30,381 --> 02:02:33,710
but even as the fundamental element so.

2454
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:39,910
Well,
so you can think about that however you 

2455
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:39,910
want.
But anyways,

2456
02:02:39,910 --> 02:02:40,790
so Japan comes along and he's going to 
finish off the puppet.

2457
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:43,700
And so what does he do to finish off the
puppet?

2458
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:45,980
He gives it a.
It gives it a voice.

2459
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:47,900
It gives it a mouth.
Well,

2460
02:02:47,901 --> 02:02:49,550
that's really,
really interesting.

2461
02:02:49,551 --> 02:02:52,370
So in Genesis,
in Genesis,

2462
02:02:52,810 --> 02:02:54,050
this is a,
this is a very,

2463
02:02:54,410 --> 02:02:59,410
very,
very complex idea and it took people 

2464
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:02,081
thousands of years to figure this idea 
out and it's something like this is so 

2465
02:03:02,081 --> 02:03:06,700
at the beginning of everything,
there was chaos and that was like 

2466
02:03:06,700 --> 02:03:08,330
potential.
It was something like potential,

2467
02:03:08,810 --> 02:03:12,260
the potential for being and God who is 
God.

2468
02:03:12,261 --> 02:03:16,130
The father in the genesis account uses a
faculty that he has,

2469
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:21,190
which is the word to call being from 
chaos and that's the creation of Ba,

2470
02:03:24,740 --> 02:03:25,490
right?
It's the.

2471
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:29,810
It's the manifestation of order from 
chaos and it's the word,

2472
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:32,450
the logos that it's.

2473
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,600
It's the logos.
That's the tool that God uses to do that

2474
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:39,200
and that logos in Christianity is 
associated with Christ,

2475
02:03:39,201 --> 02:03:44,201
which is a very weird thing,
but the reason for that is that there's 

2476
02:03:44,201 --> 02:03:47,621
an idea that the divine element of the 
individual is the thing that uses 

2477
02:03:49,850 --> 02:03:53,690
language,
communicative language to call the world

2478
02:03:53,691 --> 02:03:58,691
into being,
and that is what we do as far as we can 

2479
02:03:58,691 --> 02:03:58,691
tell.
It's like you make a decision,

2480
02:03:58,790 --> 02:04:00,950
you think it through and talk it over 
with your friends.

2481
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:05,210
You plot a course and the world 
manifests itself in relationship to your

2482
02:04:05,211 --> 02:04:10,211
choice and it's for that reason and it 
is for that reason that in genesis and 

2483
02:04:10,211 --> 02:04:14,561
in many other accounts that that logo's 
capacity is identified with human 

2484
02:04:14,601 --> 02:04:19,601
beings.
It's like you have a small bit of that 

2485
02:04:19,601 --> 02:04:19,601
in you.
Whatever that means,

2486
02:04:19,601 --> 02:04:23,350
and you participate in the process of 
continually generating order out of 

2487
02:04:23,361 --> 02:04:28,100
chaos and and sometimes the reverse,
you mediate between them and so and that

2488
02:04:28,101 --> 02:04:29,260
is that in our,
in,

2489
02:04:29,290 --> 02:04:29,810
in,
in,

2490
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:33,470
in Western culture and certainly the 
case at other cultures as well,

2491
02:04:33,740 --> 02:04:36,710
that that's why you have rights.

2492
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:39,660
Fundamentally.
That's why the law has to respect you is

2493
02:04:39,661 --> 02:04:44,550
because you've got this spark of 
divinity in you that's transcendent that

2494
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:47,670
nobody gets to transgress against and 
you say,

2495
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,810
well,
do you believe that?

2496
02:04:48,811 --> 02:04:49,530
It's like,
well,

2497
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:55,010
you act like you believe it.
You treat other people like you believe 

2498
02:04:55,010 --> 02:04:59,931
it or they're not very happy with you.
So it depends on what you mean by 

2499
02:04:59,931 --> 02:05:00,780
believe you act it out.
Well.

2500
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,020
Do you accept it as a proposition?
Oh,

2501
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:06,660
I don't care if you accept that as a 
proposition frankly,

2502
02:05:06,661 --> 02:05:10,080
because I think the best indicator of 
what you believe is how you act.

2503
02:05:10,130 --> 02:05:13,380
Not what you say because what do you 
know about what you know?

2504
02:05:13,920 --> 02:05:18,920
Hardly anything and so actions speak 
louder than words and if you want to be 

2505
02:05:19,501 --> 02:05:24,501
treated properly by someone,
what that means is that you want to 

2506
02:05:24,501 --> 02:05:26,040
treat them,
you want them to treat you as a valuable

2507
02:05:26,041 --> 02:05:27,480
autonomous entity.

2508
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,930
That's what you want.
And so maybe you're not that.

2509
02:05:30,931 --> 02:05:35,931
Maybe you're a deterministic puppet and 
what this strange movie suggests is that

2510
02:05:35,971 --> 02:05:40,380
you are kind of a deterministic puppet,
but you don't have to be all right,

2511
02:05:40,850 --> 02:05:44,970
well you the mouth goes on and then 
Japan was happy about that and then they

2512
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:46,020
have a little dance,
you know,

2513
02:05:46,021 --> 02:05:51,021
they,
they turned the music on and all these 

2514
02:05:51,021 --> 02:05:53,781
little music boxes and they all play 
together and it's like harmony of some 

2515
02:05:53,821 --> 02:05:58,260
sort has been established because that's
what the music represents and the layers

2516
02:05:58,261 --> 02:06:03,261
of reality that are communicating with 
one another because that's what the 

2517
02:06:03,261 --> 02:06:06,741
music represents.
And then they have a little dance and 

2518
02:06:06,741 --> 02:06:06,741
the idea is that,
well,

2519
02:06:06,741 --> 02:06:09,570
it's a good thing to let this puppet 
habits own voice.

2520
02:06:10,440 --> 02:06:15,440
Well,
that's an interesting idea because what 

2521
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:15,440
the hell does it?
No,

2522
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:15,440
it's a wooden headed marionette.

2523
02:06:15,440 --> 02:06:17,250
Why the hell would you want something 
like that to talk?

2524
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:22,820
Well,
it's the same question you have in 

2525
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:24,030
relationship to your children.
It's like what do they know there two or

2526
02:06:24,031 --> 02:06:25,470
three,
you know,

2527
02:06:25,471 --> 02:06:27,150
they don't know anything.
Well,

2528
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:31,090
so should you just like tyrannized them 
and make them do everything you want?

2529
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:32,910
Are you going to let them have a bit of 
a voice?

2530
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:35,460
And the question is,
it depends on whether do we want them to

2531
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:40,461
be a puppet or not.
And if you don't want them to be a 

2532
02:06:40,461 --> 02:06:44,090
puppet,
if you want them to grow up atonomous 

2533
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:45,450
then you let them have a voice and you 
facilitate the development of that voice

2534
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:47,470
and so and,
and,

2535
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:50,340
and that's.
And that's what you do if you don't want

2536
02:06:50,730 --> 02:06:55,730
a marionette.
So in Japan who doesn't want a 

2537
02:06:55,730 --> 02:06:59,030
Marionette?
So he gives the puppet a voice even 

2538
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,030
though he knows it's just a puppet and 
that it's,

2539
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,790
it doesn't know anything.

2540
02:07:00,570 --> 02:07:04,230
And then this is fantastic.
So the cricket sitting up there watching

2541
02:07:04,231 --> 02:07:05,490
that,
he's pretty happy with it.

2542
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:09,000
That's the first little CDC there and 
he's sitting by this other thing that is

2543
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:12,750
just not happy at all and that's the 
terrible father.

2544
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:16,860
And you see it's a character that 
repeats throughout the entire movie.

2545
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:21,861
You see manifestations of the tyrannical
father continually through the movie in 

2546
02:07:21,861 --> 02:07:23,880
different characters like he's played 
out by different roles.

2547
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:27,240
And so first of all,
the cricket is so thrilled about this.

2548
02:07:27,241 --> 02:07:31,290
And then he looks at the frowning king 
there who's,

2549
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:34,290
who is not happy that the puppet has 
been given a voice.

2550
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:39,291
He's a tyrant.
He's the representation of a tyrant and 

2551
02:07:39,291 --> 02:07:39,291
a tyrant does not want you to have a 
voice.

2552
02:07:39,291 --> 02:07:40,900
And so the cricket looks at him and 
says,

2553
02:07:41,200 --> 02:07:43,270
well,
you can't please everybody all the time.

2554
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,510
And it's just this tiny little fragment 
of a joke,

2555
02:07:46,511 --> 02:07:46,780
you know.

2556
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:48,670
But it's,
there's this old idea.

2557
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:54,390
I think it comes from checkoff and,
and the idea is that if you set a 

2558
02:07:54,390 --> 02:07:54,390
playoff and,
and there's a gun,

2559
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:57,250
a rifle or a pistol on a table in the 
first act,

2560
02:07:57,490 --> 02:08:02,490
it better have been used by the third 
act or it shouldn't have been there at 

2561
02:08:02,490 --> 02:08:06,301
all.
And the idea is you don't put anything 

2562
02:08:06,301 --> 02:08:08,740
in your play that it's random,
you never do that.

2563
02:08:08,770 --> 02:08:11,410
It's like,
because this isn't life,

2564
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:13,330
that,
that this isn't life.

2565
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:16,370
This is a work of art and everything is 
connected and it's caught,

2566
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:16,810
you know,
it's,

2567
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:21,840
it's there by intent.
And so this isn't accidental that this 

2568
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:25,150
little king character doesn't like 
what's going on or that he shows up.

2569
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:28,170
So anyways,
all,

2570
02:08:28,220 --> 02:08:33,220
all the clocks go off and the music 
boxes go and they have a little dance 

2571
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:33,220
and everybody's happy about it.

2572
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:36,520
And,
and then Japan notices what time it is.

2573
02:08:36,521 --> 02:08:41,521
And so there's a tremendous emphasis on 
time in this part of the movie because 

2574
02:08:41,521 --> 02:08:43,390
there are all these clocks are going off
and they're all telling him what time it

2575
02:08:43,391 --> 02:08:44,920
is,
like 30 clocks go off.

2576
02:08:44,921 --> 02:08:48,580
And then he takes us,
watch out and notices what time it is.

2577
02:08:48,581 --> 02:08:53,581
It's like the idea that there's 
something about time going on is like 

2578
02:08:53,581 --> 02:08:55,030
whacked at you,
you know,

2579
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:59,680
dozens of times so that you get it.
And it's a little joke that he pulls out

2580
02:08:59,681 --> 02:09:01,870
his watch and he figures out it's time 
for bed.

2581
02:09:03,040 --> 02:09:05,230
While.
So now we're making a transition between

2582
02:09:05,231 --> 02:09:07,150
the conscious world and the unconscious 
world.

2583
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:08,560
Okay.
So,

2584
02:09:08,561 --> 02:09:13,561
so there's an intimation in the movie 
that everything that happens now is in 

2585
02:09:13,561 --> 02:09:16,270
the unconscious world.
And the way you know that is that it's,

2586
02:09:16,280 --> 02:09:20,830
it's strange because the movie moves in 
and out of this underworld.

2587
02:09:21,070 --> 02:09:24,610
But at the very end when Pinocchio 
transformed into a real boy,

2588
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:29,940
the last thing Japan does is I think 
it's Japan always hit one of the 

2589
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:31,780
pendulums and start all the clocks 
again.

2590
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:37,150
So it's as if what happens from here 
onwards is part of a dream.

2591
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:42,600
Now it's,
it's murky because Pinocchio goes to 

2592
02:09:42,600 --> 02:09:43,840
school and you know,
there's the next day and all of that.

2593
02:09:43,841 --> 02:09:48,841
But.
And so those are sort of realistic 

2594
02:09:48,841 --> 02:09:51,001
elements.
But then there's also the whole going 

2595
02:09:51,001 --> 02:09:51,001
down into the ocean to find the whale 
thing,

2596
02:09:51,001 --> 02:09:54,811
which seems completely dreamlike and,
but there's an intimation that we're in 

2597
02:09:54,811 --> 02:09:55,730
a different kind of world.
And,

2598
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,060
and so we go to,
they all go to sleep,

2599
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:03,120
including the cricket.
And so then Japan notices the star and 

2600
02:10:04,030 --> 02:10:06,380
because he's a good guy,
he makes a wish on the start.

2601
02:10:06,410 --> 02:10:10,150
We've already explained why you might 
wish on a star and what that might mean,

2602
02:10:10,360 --> 02:10:12,890
and he makes a very interesting wish.
Um,

2603
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,360
it's,
it's not a self serving wish.

2604
02:10:16,530 --> 02:10:18,100
In fact,
it's quite the contrary.

2605
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:21,850
He doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an 
obedient son.

2606
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:25,150
He doesn't wish that he's produced 
someone who will work for him.

2607
02:10:25,390 --> 02:10:29,110
He doesn't wish any of that.
He wishes what a good father would wish,

2608
02:10:29,440 --> 02:10:34,100
which is that the creation that he's 
brought forth would develop

2609
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,760
its capacity for autonomy.
He wants them to become real.

2610
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:42,761
He wants him to become an actual living 
creature and not a wooden headed 

2611
02:10:42,761 --> 02:10:44,300
marionette.
And so you'd say,

2612
02:10:44,301 --> 02:10:46,760
well,
that is what your father should wish for

2613
02:10:46,761 --> 02:10:47,420
you.
You know,

2614
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:51,050
and I have clients frequently whose 
fathers weren't like that at all.

2615
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:53,300
They were tyrannical or they were 
neglectful or,

2616
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:55,970
or they punished this.
Then the person,

2617
02:10:55,971 --> 02:10:59,600
every time they did something good,
that's a real fun game.

2618
02:11:02,070 --> 02:11:05,040
They competed with them and undermining 
them at every opportunity.

2619
02:11:05,070 --> 02:11:07,770
They didn't want to produce someone 
strong and autonomous.

2620
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:12,920
They wanted to give birth to a slave and
then diminish it as much as possible.

2621
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:19,950
And so that's bad,
it's not good and not so Japan was not 

2622
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:19,950
like that.
So he says,

2623
02:11:19,950 --> 02:11:24,761
well,
I'm going to wish for something 

2624
02:11:24,761 --> 02:11:25,130
completely unreasonable,
which is that part of that ideal idea,

2625
02:11:25,131 --> 02:11:30,131
right?
And they're unreasonable thing is that 

2626
02:11:30,131 --> 02:11:32,891
this puppet could become real,
could actually take on its autonomy and,

2627
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:38,000
and move forward.
And so that's what he wishes.

2628
02:11:40,140 --> 02:11:41,190
And then they go to sleep

2629
02:11:42,880 --> 02:11:47,080
and then the cricket starts to become 
driven mad by the noises of the clock.

2630
02:11:47,081 --> 02:11:50,950
And so it's like he's going into this 
sort of state of hyper alertness and the

2631
02:11:50,951 --> 02:11:54,700
clocks are clanging out.
Him in Japan was snoring and,

2632
02:11:55,060 --> 02:11:59,020
and that he can even hear the little 
grains of sand falling out of the,

2633
02:11:59,410 --> 02:12:02,290
out of the hourglass.
He's becoming hyper alert,

2634
02:12:02,291 --> 02:12:04,090
hyper alert,
and then he yells,

2635
02:12:04,091 --> 02:12:07,030
stop.
And all the clock stop.

2636
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:09,370
Which is a pretty good trick for a 
cricket.

2637
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:11,590
You know,
it's like he's the master of time.

2638
02:12:11,591 --> 02:12:15,460
But also we're in a place now where time
has come to a stop or outside of time.

2639
02:12:16,060 --> 02:12:18,430
And one of the things that Freud pointed
about,

2640
02:12:18,431 --> 02:12:20,980
dreams is that dreams are kind of 
outside of time.

2641
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,830
Now,
here's what that means is,

2642
02:12:23,860 --> 02:12:26,110
is first of all,
they draw and eternal themes.

2643
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:26,680
That's part of it.

2644
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:28,540
But you know,
he must have had this experience.

2645
02:12:28,541 --> 02:12:33,541
And Freud noted this carefully in the 
interpretation of dreams where you know 

2646
02:12:33,541 --> 02:12:37,100
you're sleeping and the alarm goes off 
and the alarm noise is incorporated into

2647
02:12:37,361 --> 02:12:42,361
your dream.
And it's like the dream has been going 

2648
02:12:42,361 --> 02:12:45,361
on for an hour in subjective time and 
you wake up and you realize that it's 

2649
02:12:45,361 --> 02:12:45,361
the alarm clock.
It's like.

2650
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:50,430
And there's no reason why your dream 
time should be the same as real time 

2651
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:51,340
because it's all going on in your 
imagination.

2652
02:12:51,341 --> 02:12:56,341
But it's amazing in some sense how much 
can happen in such a short period of 

2653
02:12:56,341 --> 02:12:59,740
time in your imagination.
And so it's outside of time.

2654
02:12:59,741 --> 02:13:02,860
The world of fantasy is in some sense 
out of outside of time.

2655
02:13:02,861 --> 02:13:06,820
And so the cricket tells time to stop 
and it does.

2656
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:13,290
And then the star enlarges and it turns 
into this blue fairy who's got a 

2657
02:13:18,131 --> 02:13:21,280
celestial Gao covered with stars.

2658
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:25,000
And who's got wings,
so she's kind of some ethereal being and

2659
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:28,090
like you don't have a problem with that 
in the movie.

2660
02:13:28,091 --> 02:13:28,720
It's like,
yeah,

2661
02:13:28,721 --> 02:13:29,320
sure.
I mean,

2662
02:13:29,321 --> 02:13:30,910
you know,
it's a,

2663
02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:33,030
it came from a star.
That makes perfect sense,

2664
02:13:33,031 --> 02:13:36,090
which of course it does.
It makes no sense whatsoever.

2665
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:37,800
Right.
It makes no sense,

2666
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:41,940
but you're willing to go along with it 
because on the one hand it makes sense.

2667
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
No sense.
And on the other hand it makes perfect 

2668
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:47,000
sense.
It's like the fairy godmother idea.

2669
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:47,000
It's like,
yeah,

2670
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:47,380
yeah,
fairy Godmother,

2671
02:13:47,430 --> 02:13:52,430
no problem.
We got back and it's in the idea there 

2672
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:53,550
is that,
well nature comes to your aid.

2673
02:13:53,551 --> 02:13:54,860
It's something like that.
It's,

2674
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,710
it's the benevolent force of nature is 
on your side now,

2675
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:02,700
not obviously only on your side because 
it opposes you as well,

2676
02:14:02,970 --> 02:14:07,970
but then there's your own mother as well
who's also nature who's on your site.

2677
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:13,100
And so there's an idea here and the idea
is that if the father gets the wish 

2678
02:14:13,861 --> 02:14:16,710
right,
the aim right for the child,

2679
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:20,640
then nature will cooperate.
Right?

2680
02:14:20,670 --> 02:14:22,380
And that's true,
I believe that's true,

2681
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:27,381
is that if you set up your relationship,
your cultural relationship with your 

2682
02:14:27,381 --> 02:14:31,341
child properly,
then they're far more likely to 

2683
02:14:31,341 --> 02:14:33,951
flourish.
And so you get the magic of nature on 

2684
02:14:33,951 --> 02:14:35,040
your side by establishing the proper 
aim.

2685
02:14:35,250 --> 02:14:36,690
And so that's what happens.
Japan.

2686
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:37,260
Oh says,
well,

2687
02:14:37,261 --> 02:14:42,261
this is what I.
This is what I'm aiming at and because 

2688
02:14:42,261 --> 02:14:44,520
he's aiming at at it and because it's 
within the realm of possibility,

2689
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,690
nature comes to his service and that is 
how it works.

2690
02:14:48,720 --> 02:14:52,260
And that's exactly how it works.
Because when you aim at something,

2691
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:57,590
then you muster your biological forces 
towards that goal and if the goal is 

2692
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:04,940
feasible and attainable,
then you will cooperate with yourself.

2693
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,580
And so that's quite cool.
Carl Rogers would call that.

2694
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:13,890
What's the word for that?
I think he called a genuineness,

2695
02:15:13,891 --> 02:15:16,500
which is kind of weak,
but I think.

2696
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:18,600
I think that's still what he called it 
and he started meant that,

2697
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:20,370
well,
that's sort of what happens when your,

2698
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:25,760
when your goals and your physiological 
and biological being are aligned well 

2699
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:30,890
and you're and you can communicate both.
You're not full of internal 

2700
02:15:30,890 --> 02:15:33,831
contradictions,
and so your conscious aims and your 

2701
02:15:33,831 --> 02:15:38,361
biological possibilities are manifesting
themselves in the same direction and so 

2702
02:15:38,540 --> 02:15:40,560
while that would be good,
so anyways,

2703
02:15:40,561 --> 02:15:42,960
the fairy shows up and she's quite 
sexually attractive.

2704
02:15:42,961 --> 02:15:47,961
She's quite provocative and she,
she charmed the cricket and who gets all

2705
02:15:48,510 --> 02:15:50,420
blushes and like is all,
you know,

2706
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:56,090
embarrassed and overwhelmed by this 
figure of celestial beauty and decides 

2707
02:15:57,600 --> 02:16:02,600
to cooperate.
The conscience decides to cooperate and 

2708
02:16:02,600 --> 02:16:05,661
get some responsibility.
And so the ferry allows the puppet to 

2709
02:16:06,811 --> 02:16:09,450
move without strings.
So that's kind of interesting.

2710
02:16:09,451 --> 02:16:13,650
So it's the intervention of nature.
Culture focuses the aim,

2711
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:18,820
then it's the intervention of nature 
that produces the autonomy and that 

2712
02:16:18,820 --> 02:16:18,930
seems to be right.
I mean,

2713
02:16:18,931 --> 02:16:20,490
even though it's not that 
understandable,

2714
02:16:20,491 --> 02:16:25,491
it seems to be right.
And then so she takes the strings off 

2715
02:16:25,591 --> 02:16:27,390
Pinocchio and you might say,
well,

2716
02:16:27,391 --> 02:16:29,890
that's partly because your child is not 
certainly

2717
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,980
not just a creature of culture.
By no means your child has a 

2718
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:38,071
temperament.
You'll see that right away and that 

2719
02:16:38,071 --> 02:16:40,561
temperament will unfold and hopefully 
it'll unfold in a cultural context 

2720
02:16:40,561 --> 02:16:45,001
that's amenable to it.
And that the combination of those two 

2721
02:16:45,001 --> 02:16:45,001
things will produce something new,

2722
02:16:47,480 --> 02:16:48,200
you can talk,

2723
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:55,170
he could walk.
And so the good fairy basically tells 

2724
02:16:55,170 --> 02:16:58,771
him that he's got a bit of autonomy and 
now it's up to him to like clue in Tibet

2725
02:16:59,201 --> 02:17:04,201
and act properly and learn the 
difference between good and evil and to 

2726
02:17:04,201 --> 02:17:06,280
speak truthfully and all that.
It's a bit a propaganda stick.

2727
02:17:06,281 --> 02:17:08,740
That part of the movie I would say,
but it doesn't really matter.

2728
02:17:08,741 --> 02:17:13,480
It's kind of inculcation of conventional
morality and there's a fair bit to it,

2729
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:15,400
especially that he's supposed to tell 
the truth.

2730
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:17,130
And uh,
you know,

2731
02:17:17,140 --> 02:17:19,180
he says he will and the crickets 
listing.

2732
02:17:19,181 --> 02:17:22,470
And then the puppet asks,
well,

2733
02:17:22,471 --> 02:17:26,020
what does consciousness mean?
Because the ferry says,

2734
02:17:26,021 --> 02:17:28,120
always let your conscience be your 
guide.

2735
02:17:28,121 --> 02:17:29,770
And he says,
what is conscience mean?

2736
02:17:29,771 --> 02:17:33,370
And then the bug who's like all puffed 
up because he wants to impress the ferry

2737
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:38,520
pops down and gets on his little 
matchbox and gives this like horrible 

2738
02:17:38,520 --> 02:17:39,820
little lecture about how to behave 
properly.

2739
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:43,840
That's just like ideological chatter.
You could hardly even stand listening to

2740
02:17:43,841 --> 02:17:45,430
it.
And it's supposed to be like that.

2741
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:50,730
It's generic moral advice that anyone 
could give that's kind of dull and,

2742
02:17:51,640 --> 02:17:56,080
and also puffed up and grandiose and 
he's just not very good at it.

2743
02:17:56,740 --> 02:18:01,740
So,
and that's why he's on his little 

2744
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:01,740
matchbox there with his chest puffed 
out.

2745
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:03,640
And so he says that's just the travel 
with the world today.

2746
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:06,040
And uh,
and I think that's his opening line,

2747
02:18:06,041 --> 02:18:11,041
you know,
he's diagnosing the whole world and you 

2748
02:18:11,041 --> 02:18:11,041
know,
the ferry,

2749
02:18:11,041 --> 02:18:13,420
she thinks he's kind of funny because he
is and you know,

2750
02:18:13,421 --> 02:18:18,421
it's sort of,
there's a real interesting thing here 

2751
02:18:18,421 --> 02:18:18,700
going on because he's male and he's,
he's all puffed up with,

2752
02:18:18,790 --> 02:18:20,920
with his knowledge,
which is completely shallow.

2753
02:18:20,921 --> 02:18:25,921
And then he's put in contact with this 
celestial feminine ideal and he just 

2754
02:18:25,921 --> 02:18:27,460
turns into a complete moron.

2755
02:18:27,460 --> 02:18:30,610
And that's exactly what happens to men.
It happens to them all the time.

2756
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:36,090
So anyways,
she decides to give him a chance and 

2757
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:39,450
turns them into this conscience and all 
of a sudden he's this like 19 twenties 

2758
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:39,450
millionaire.
So He's been,

2759
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:42,190
he's been unknowable.
But then she tells him that,

2760
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:47,370
you know,
he has to journey along with Pinocchio 

2761
02:18:47,370 --> 02:18:50,700
in order for things to go properly and 
he promises that he'll be a good 

2762
02:18:50,700 --> 02:18:54,751
conscience and do it and he already 
thinks that he can do it and that's why 

2763
02:18:54,751 --> 02:18:56,170
he's on the matchbox podium,
you know,

2764
02:18:56,830 --> 02:19:01,830
espousing his morality.
But the reality turns out to be much 

2765
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:01,830
more complex

2766
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:02,660
so

2767
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,670
the bog has a little talk with the 
cricket.

2768
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:12,360
The bug has a little talk with the 
puppet and the Bug tries to tell 

2769
02:19:12,360 --> 02:19:16,141
Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be
good and he gets completely tangled up 

2770
02:19:17,141 --> 02:19:19,480
in the explanation because what the hell
does he know?

2771
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:22,990
And the puppet doesn't understand 
anything that he says anyways.

2772
02:19:22,991 --> 02:19:27,991
And so there's a message there and the 
message is the kind of knowledge that 

2773
02:19:28,071 --> 02:19:33,071
the conscience is that the conscience 
and the puppet are supposed to cocreate 

2774
02:19:33,071 --> 02:19:36,200
is not something that you can articulate
easily as a table of rules.

2775
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:41,260
It's not like that because life is too 
complicated to just have fought five 

2776
02:19:41,260 --> 02:19:45,851
rules that you live by and that will 
solve every problem partly because the 

2777
02:19:45,851 --> 02:19:47,870
rules will conflict.
That's a huge part of the problem,

2778
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:52,900
right?
One moral guideline contradicts another 

2779
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:52,940
into situations like you don't know what
to do.

2780
02:19:53,930 --> 02:19:55,620
So anyways,
they decide that they're.

2781
02:19:56,920 --> 02:20:00,020
They decided that they're just going to.
He says,

2782
02:20:00,021 --> 02:20:00,770
Pinocchio says,
well,

2783
02:20:00,771 --> 02:20:02,900
I'll be a good boy,
and the cricket says,

2784
02:20:02,901 --> 02:20:04,340
well that's the spirit,
and then,

2785
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:09,700
well then Japan gets wind of it and they
have a little like horror episode and 

2786
02:20:10,070 --> 02:20:15,070
and then he finds out that the public 
can is autonomous and they have a little

2787
02:20:15,141 --> 02:20:20,141
party which tells you exactly what Japan
goes up to is the autonomy emerges and 

2788
02:20:20,361 --> 02:20:25,361
he's happy about it.
So it's stamping home the notion that 

2789
02:20:25,361 --> 02:20:27,710
you pedo is in fact a good guy and that 
that is in fact what he wants.

2790
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:32,860
So it's like the encouragement of your 
father is a precondition for the 

2791
02:20:32,860 --> 02:20:37,361
emergence of your individuality and,
and it also allows the feminine to play 

2792
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:40,430
a role both as nature and perhaps as 
mother.

2793
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:45,730
And so and the combination of those two 
things produces the autonomous 

2794
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:45,730
individual.

2795
02:20:45,730 --> 02:20:47,030
It's like,
well that seems perfectly reasonable.

2796
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:52,600
So off they go to sleep,
next day they wake up and it's a new day

2797
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:55,400
and,
and a Pinocchio is off to school.

2798
02:20:55,401 --> 02:20:57,640
And that's a good thing too because 
Japan,

2799
02:20:57,641 --> 02:20:58,100
oh,
isn't,

2800
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:03,340
and he's really excited about it and so 
what that means is that he's been 

2801
02:21:03,340 --> 02:21:08,050
parented properly and,
and he's going to go out into the world 

2802
02:21:08,050 --> 02:21:08,060
of his peers,
which is where he belongs.

2803
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:10,340
And Japan isn't too worried about it.
In fact,

2804
02:21:10,341 --> 02:21:11,870
he,
he's pushed them out the door,

2805
02:21:11,871 --> 02:21:13,040
you know,
it's like go,

2806
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,680
you can do it,
this is the next thing.

2807
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:20,830
The kid isn't cowering in the corner and
overcome by terror with the parents 

2808
02:21:20,830 --> 02:21:22,280
freaking out about all the things that 
are going to go wrong.

2809
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:24,540
It's,
there's some faith in his,

2810
02:21:24,590 --> 02:21:29,590
his ability.
So he sees all the kids wandering by 

2811
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:33,701
and,
and Japan Eto dresses them up and sends 

2812
02:21:33,701 --> 02:21:34,790
them off to school and so and so.

2813
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:37,040
That's good.
So that's a happy family story.

2814
02:21:37,041 --> 02:21:40,040
It's like mom and dad got together.
They decided that there,

2815
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:45,280
the kid was going to be competent and 
autonomous and ready to face the world.

2816
02:21:45,891 --> 02:21:50,891
And so our egos.
And so he's like five years old at this 

2817
02:21:50,891 --> 02:21:51,110
point or something like that and that's 
where we get,

2818
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:56,800
that's where we're at in the story and I
think that's a good place to stop 

2819
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:02,350
because the next thing that happens is 
normally essentially it's like Pinocchio

2820
02:22:02,661 --> 02:22:07,661
goes off to be a good boy,
but it turns out that's a hell of a lot 

2821
02:22:07,661 --> 02:22:10,721
more complicated than he might think 
because there are actually complications

2822
02:22:11,421 --> 02:22:14,240
in the world,
but also malevolence right?

2823
02:22:14,390 --> 02:22:19,390
The desire for things not to go right.
There are people who are not oriented 

2824
02:22:19,390 --> 02:22:23,711
towards the ideal in any way at all.
And Pinocchio's young and naive.

2825
02:22:25,770 --> 02:22:29,730
And so he has no defense whatsoever 
against this malevolence.

2826
02:22:29,730 --> 02:22:31,460
And that's,
you know,

2827
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:36,150
that's not an expect,
not unexpected.

2828
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:39,300
And it also turns out that the 
conscience,

2829
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:44,390
the cricket,
who is still not very clued in over 

2830
02:22:44,390 --> 02:22:46,350
sleeps.
And so he's just not there at a critical

2831
02:22:46,351 --> 02:22:48,420
moment.
But I think we'll pick that up.

2832
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:53,870
We'll pick that up next week because 
this is a good point in the plot to 

2833
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:57,711
stop.
The child has entered the broader world 

2834
02:22:57,711 --> 02:23:01,280
and has to cope with it.
And so he's prepared because he had a 

2835
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:05,541
wonderful father and he had a magical 
mother and so he's as prepared as you 

2836
02:23:05,541 --> 02:23:09,261
can be.
He's not even completely a marionette 

2837
02:23:09,261 --> 02:23:09,261
anymore,
but,

2838
02:23:09,261 --> 02:23:11,490
but,
but now it's up to him.

2839
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:16,580
That's the thing.
Now it's up to him and his parents have 

2840
02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:16,680
done basically what they could.
And that's really about right.

2841
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:17,790
You know,
um,

2842
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:19,560
it's,
it's wise,

2843
02:23:19,561 --> 02:23:22,140
I would say psychologically.
So.

2844
02:23:23,180 --> 02:23:25,800
Alright,
that's,

2845
02:23:25,801 --> 02:23:26,130
that.
