1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,263
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,130
So I want to talk about some more 
attributes of this structure.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,590
Okay.
Now,

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,283
broadly speaking,
what we're going to say is that a 

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,280
motivation sets up one of these 
frameworks.

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,710
I'm going to call this framework a 
story.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,463
Nope.
There's a lots of things you could call 

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:26,930
it.
You can call it an expectancy model.

9
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,890
You could call it a game.
I'm going to call it a story,

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,761
and we're going to say,
well,

11
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:32,594
what you do is you,
you have a life story and your life 

12
00:00:34,491 --> 00:00:37,100
story is composed of nested some 
stories.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,020
You could also think of it as a 
personality,

14
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:41,150
but a story is like a personality 
action.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,440
So we'll just stick with story.
The story has a starting place.

16
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,840
That's where you are,
and the story has an end point.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,720
That's where you're going and you're 
always in one of those stories,

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:51,680
or you're asleep.

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,563
So you're either pursuing something in 
the real world that is a value or your 

20
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,500
pr,
like that's directly motivated,

21
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:01,334
or you're pursuing another situation 
where the reason you're pursuing it is 

22
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,504
because it fulfills a bunch of 
motivational states now and into the 

23
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:09,200
future.
So that's what you're doing.

24
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:14,060
Say when you pursue a career,
and if you're not doing that,

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,923
then your mind is wandering.
And what it's doing is it's wandering 

26
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,644
through the space of hypothetical worlds
where you could play hypothetic 

27
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,140
hypothetical roles.
And if you're not doing that,

28
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,960
then you're asleep.
So you're in one of these all the time.

29
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,723
Now the shift and that,
that's one of the things that's quite 

30
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:34,160
interesting about them.
The shift can take place on all sorts of

31
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:34,994
levels.
You can differently conceptualize the 

32
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:38,804
way where are you are you can different,
we conceptualize where you're going and 

33
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,334
you can different,
they conceptualize how you're going to 

34
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,460
get there.
Now

35
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,550
I won't go into that for the moment.

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,953
So let's say you're going from point a 
to point B and at the highest level of 

37
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,330
resolution,
that means that you're acting.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,840
And then other things that happened is 
not only are you acting,

39
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:04,674
you're configuring your perceptions,
we already talked a little bit about 

40
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,734
this.
You know what you should highlight what 

41
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:10,524
you should bring your high resolution 
thinking to bear on and you know what 

42
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,584
you should ignore and what you should 
ignore is those things that are likely 

43
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,304
to remain constant as you pursue this 
set of transformations and or that 

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,930
aren't going to interfere with what 
you're doing.

45
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,603
And so you just have to concentrate,
especially if you set your environment 

46
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:30,300
that properly.
And that's another thing,

47
00:02:30,301 --> 00:02:31,134
part of the way that people deal with 
the complexity of the world is by just 

48
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,420
not having it around,
you know?

49
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:38,910
So for example,
even if you look in this room,

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,990
a lot of things are radically simplified
so that you don't get overwhelmed.

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,690
How many of you have computers here?
Okay,

52
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,800
now what does your computer look like?
Keyboard screen.

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,200
What about the rest of it?
Flat.

54
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,020
Shiny aluminum.
Why?

55
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,323
Because you want to act like that's one 
thing you don't want to act like it's 

56
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,500
how many transistors are on a chip now.
Okay.

57
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,883
Billion or more.
A lot like they're down to molecular 

58
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,080
size.
Those things say they're so small.

59
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:12,490
Now,
this is a really funny,

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,613
there are so small now that,
so imagine electrons reading along the 

61
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:19,120
wire.
Now the weird thing about an electron is

62
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:20,890
it might be there and it might be 
somewhere else.

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,040
So it's got this vague nonlocality about
it.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,730
You know,
like maybe it's supposed to be there,

65
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,190
but it's actually over there.
That would happen now and then,

66
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,803
but the wires are so damn thin now that 
there's some good probability that the 

67
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:38,680
electron will be outside the wire and 
that causes short circuits.

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,060
So that's quite well.
So you got quantum level complexity,

69
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,340
mucking up your,
your circuitry in your computer.

70
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,361
But look,
look,

71
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,250
the computer is designed this way,
right?

72
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,050
It's designed so you can ignore it.
The outside of it's a flat shell.

73
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,080
It's a low resolution image and not the 
keyboard because you have to move it,

74
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,800
not the screen,
but everything else.

75
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,020
It's like flat.
The designer,

76
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,950
the primate designer of this computer 
does not want your poor primate brain to

77
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,784
be overwhelmed by the fact that this 
thing is incomprehensibly complex cars 

78
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,580
are the same.
They have that nice shiny shell on them.

79
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,330
And so that you can just sort of low 
resolution at and that's good enough.

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,790
The walls painted roughly the same 
color.

81
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,350
Like we're doing a lot of things around 
us to to reduce the sensory load.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,350
Plus there are people beating away at 
the background,

83
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,020
like mad,
making sure the lights stay on,

84
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:30,850
making sure the heat stays on,
you know,

85
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,380
making sure that you have Aaron here.

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,213
The place isn't burning down,
there aren't crazy people wondering 

87
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,614
around here with shotguns and rifles and
like there's a lot going on so that you 

88
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:43,270
can sit here and pretend that you know 
enough to stay alive.

89
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,150
So we're also removing a tremendous 
amount of complexity as a consequence of

90
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:51,970
social cooperation.
Okay,

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,953
so,
so these are all parts of the way that 

92
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:56,554
you simplify the world.
You're in a radical simplification 

93
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,670
structure.
That's the external society.

94
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,920
Then within that there's only certain 
things you want.

95
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,590
And then within that there's only 
certain things you can detect.

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,633
And then with it in that there's only 
certain features that pop out is 

97
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:15,370
necessary to contemplate in the realm 
that you're dealing with.

98
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,260
Now,
one thing you might ask is,

99
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:18,094
well,
what time span are you usually dealing 

100
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:20,380
with?
You know,

101
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:22,840
cause what the world's made of depends 
on the timestamp.

102
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,183
And that's a tough one.
We know that it's more than one 10th of 

103
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,720
a second,
but you can think years into the future,

104
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,370
right?
So I might say,

105
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,580
well why are you going to university?
Or I might say,

106
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,360
what are you doing right now?
And then the answer would be,

107
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,883
well,
I'm sitting in class and then the 

108
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:41,830
question would be,
well why are you sitting in class?

109
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,000
And the answer to that would be,
well,

110
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,440
because I,
I want to take this course and why?

111
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,940
Well,
it's because I want to get my degree.

112
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,900
I said,
why?

113
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,823
Well,
because I want to be prepared for a 

114
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,740
career and uh,
you know,

115
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:56,710
a productive and high quality life when 
I get out.

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
Well,
why?

117
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,251
Well,
you know,

118
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,520
you can keep saying why pretty much 
indefinitely.

119
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,413
And as you answer,
you go farther and farther out you and 

120
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,720
timescales.
Now,

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,080
it's a tricky thing because one of the 
things I might tell you,

122
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,310
this is a very complex cognitive problem
is,

123
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,950
well,
where should you stop?

124
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,820
Okay,

125
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,850
so for example,
um,

126
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,440
I could say to you,
do you want $100 an hour?

127
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:23,350
Do you want 50,000 years?
In 75 years you're going to think,

128
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,770
wow,
probably take $100 now.

129
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,750
Well,
how about 200 years?

130
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,310
It's like,
well I'm not going to be there.

131
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,870
I'll take the hundred bucks now let's 
all,

132
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:33,300
obviously thinking out 200 years is not 
that helpful.

133
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,980
Now you might think,
well no,

134
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:38,280
you should calculate the effects of your
actions on a,

135
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,143
the Va,
the fastest time spam possible and 

136
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,960
include the largest number of people if 
you're really good and calibrate it.

137
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,340
But the problem is you can't do the 
computations cause you get,

138
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,220
you get this thing called combinatorial 
explosion happening,

139
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,050
which is that it's like a chess board.

140
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,740
You make one move,
okay fine.

141
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,783
But then you could make four and then 
with each of those you could make four 

142
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,424
more.
And then with each of those you could 

143
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,744
make four more.
And soon if you're looking 20 moves 

144
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,960
ahead,
it's like there's so many moves that the

145
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,794
other person could possibly make.
That looking that far ahead is 

146
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:10,614
pointless.
You can't do the computations and so we 

147
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:15,780
don't know how far you should look into 
the future.

148
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,000
It depends on how stable your 
environment is,

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
but one month seems okay.
A year.

150
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,330
Yeah,
three to five years.

151
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,640
That's what I'll have you do when you do
the future authoring program.

152
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,870
20 years.

153
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,613
Hmm.

154
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,840
Probably not.
And the reason for that is the margin of

155
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:34,674
error in your prediction grows so large 
that your prediction is worth anything 

156
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,633
and you can really see how that's the 
case now cause like what's going to be 

157
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:44,760
like in 20 years when I was a kid,
I used to read science fiction.

158
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,670
It was like plausible accounts of the 
potential future.

159
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,990
It's like now who knows?
Anything could happen.

160
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,270
Anything could happen.
You know,

161
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:56,490
you could be three quarters robot in 20 
years.

162
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,380
You could have a lifespan of 10,000 
years.

163
00:07:58,381 --> 00:07:59,214
I mean we just do not know.
We could be living in caves again with 

164
00:08:02,161 --> 00:08:02,994
everything in ruins.
We don't have a clue what's going to 

165
00:08:04,561 --> 00:08:07,470
happen.
So 20 year span I would say,

166
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,090
you know,
get friendly with computers,

167
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,880
20 year spans too long.
So okay.

168
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,710
Anyways,
what I'm,

169
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,860
what I'm pointing out is that you have 
to calculate,

170
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,533
you have to calculate what you're doing 
across multiple spans of time and in 

171
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,050
that combination in combination with 
many,

172
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,570
many people.
And that makes things very complex.

173
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:28,404
But that's how he,
that's how you're building the 

174
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:32,010
structures that you live with it.
All right.

175
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,850
So back to this,

176
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,470
you're ad point a,
you're going to point b.

177
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,160
So you are somewhere now that's 
interesting.

178
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,540
You are somewhat now generally what 
people think about when they think about

179
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,230
being somewhere is that they're in a 
place but you're not just in a place,

180
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,270
you're in a place at a time.
And I really want to stress that because

181
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,373
we know that universe,
we know that the environment is for 

182
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,160
dimension,
not three dimension.

183
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,713
And that's important because you can,
you can be in the same place and in the 

184
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:05,634
next second you're still where you were,
but you were in a completely different 

185
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:09,030
place.
So,

186
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,220
for example,
if someone walked in here with a,

187
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,060
with a pistol,
this would not be the same place.

188
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,343
Okay?
So there's a reason I'm telling you 

189
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:19,464
that.
And then there's the future and that's 

190
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:23,850
also a place in time and a place in 
space.

191
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,610
Okay,
now you're getting from one point to the

192
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:31,080
other and you're going to do that by 
implementing certain behaviors.

193
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,420
Now you might say,
what can happen while you're doing that?

194
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,970
Well,
here's three things that can happen.

195
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,380
The thing you want that can happen,
something you don't want,

196
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,040
but that you understand and something 
you don't understand at all.

197
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,620
Something completely beyond your 
comprehension,

198
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,920
and that would generally be a 
traumatizing event of some force.

199
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,120
So you can even know what's going to 
happen or you can not know,

200
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:57,954
but still be able to cope with it or you
can not know and not cope with it and 

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,840
have the negative ones,
they correspond to that hierarchy,

202
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,273
right?
If it's a little thing that you don't 

203
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,180
understand,
you just modify a little behavior.

204
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,910
If it's a big thing that you don't 
understand,

205
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,480
well then what?
Well then everything falls apart.

206
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,703
You don't know where you are,
don't know where you're going and all 

207
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,700
the behaviors you have are not helpful 
and that's when your world falls apart.

208
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,910
Okay,
so generally that doesn't happen.

209
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,720
So I want to walk to the,
let's say I set my target on the door,

210
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:34,170
I'm going to walk through the door.
So here's what happens instantly.

211
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:38,130
I'm slightly,
I have slight negative emotion about the

212
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:38,964
fact that any of you people in the way 
exist because what my brain is doing is 

213
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:47,340
reconfiguring the world to chart a 
straight path and anything that's in the

214
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,860
way is going to make me uneasy,
frustrated,

215
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:51,630
disappointed,
anxious.

216
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,690
And you can think about this when you do
house designed by the way.

217
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,853
So when you're setting up a room,
what you want to do is figure out what 

218
00:10:58,321 --> 00:10:59,154
the room is for.
Then you want to clear the paths for 

219
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:03,450
that because then when you walk into the
room,

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,690
the room will say,
welcome.

221
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,150
You can do the things you want to do 
here easily.

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,250
And if you don't do that,
it's all cluttered up.

223
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,113
It's like
there's no difference between that and 

224
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,280
being confused mentally.
It's exactly the same thing.

225
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,713
So,
okay,

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,620
so let's say now I stand up and not 
works and then I walk that way.

227
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,454
And that way,
in that way I keep my eyes on the door 

228
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,800
and I'm getting towards the door while 
I'm more modest,

229
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,900
Ma moderately positive about that 
because I'm getting where I'm going.

230
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,734
But I'm also moderately positive about 
it because the fact that I'm getting 

231
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:40,590
where I'm going validates my whole 
theory.

232
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,713
So one of the things that the 
behaviorists didn't get right when they 

233
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:48,390
were thinking about punishment,
like if an animal lays out a behavior,

234
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,180
new punish,
it will stop manifesting that behavior.

235
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,280
But,
but that isn't all that happens.

236
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,620
You think about punishing a human being 
and they start manifesting the behavior,

237
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,290
but the behavior isn't the whole damn 
thing.

238
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,780
The thing you're in is this.
It's the whole thing.

239
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:05,614
It's a conception of where they are to 
conception of where they're going and 

240
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,760
it's all the behaviors that they might 
need to get there.

241
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:10,481
So,
you know,

242
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:12,910
maybe they'll try to circumvent the 
punishment,

243
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,300
walk around it,
maybe they'll try a few more behaviors.

244
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,820
But what happens,
you know,

245
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,040
so I'm tied by a chain and I don't know 
what,

246
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,010
I'm tied by a chain to the wall.
I started walking that way and I figured

247
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,450
out that I'm chained.
Well,

248
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,390
so much for that stupid theory.
I'm not getting to the door.

249
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,340
I'm going to let that view of the world 
disintegrate.

250
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,174
I'm going to be very upset about that.
And then I have to come up with another 

251
00:12:36,251 --> 00:12:37,300
one,
which might be,

252
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,700
well,
how do I get rid of the chain?

253
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,060
So when you fail,
two things happen.

254
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,180
The behavior that you're manifesting 
doesn't work.

255
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,043
That's the old behavior is routine.
But it's worse than that because the 

256
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:56,131
whole little personality that you're 
using to construe the world falls apart.

257
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,170
And the more important the thing is that
has fallen apart,

258
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,990
the more of a catastrophe it's going to 
be for you.

259
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:05,824
Okay?
So let's say you're going to medical 

260
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,420
school.
That's what you want to do.

261
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,180
All right?
So you're taking the course to write the

262
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:12,940
exam,
to pass the course with an a to apply to

263
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,500
medical school,
to get into medical school,

264
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,510
to become a doctor.
You've failed the test.

265
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,520
What just happened?
Well,

266
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,960
did your whole future fall apart?

267
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,690
Okay,

268
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,310
or did you just failed the task?
Well,

269
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,144
who knows?
Right?

270
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,130
Maybe your whole future just fell apart.
It's like now you have a gpa of 3.3 it's

271
00:13:31,131 --> 00:13:31,964
like,
nope,

272
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,863
you have to go to,
you have to go to the Caribbean to a 

273
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:35,564
private medical school.
You're not going to get in anywhere in 

274
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:38,960
Canada or the United States.
It's like,

275
00:13:38,961 --> 00:13:40,040
okay,
so your life over,

276
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,420
you jump off a bridge.
Well,

277
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:46,421
sometimes people do and it's because the
little subpersonality that they created,

278
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,340
which is the me that will be a doctor.
It's one of these things,

279
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:50,174
a little story.
It's so integral to their entire 

280
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,264
identity that when it collapses,
they're done and people get suicidal 

281
00:13:57,681 --> 00:14:00,170
when that sort of thing happens.
Okay,

282
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:00,561
so,
well,

283
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:02,180
what are you supposed to do when that 
happens?

284
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:04,340
Well,
that's something that we'll talk about.

285
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,370
You know,
from the perspective of mental hygiene.

286
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,880
One of the things I would recommend is 
that when things go wrong for you,

287
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:11,714
will you start at the highest level of 
resolution in your hierarchy and work 

288
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,350
upward.
You don't say,

289
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,300
well God,
now everything's over.

290
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,710
You know,
you might say,

291
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:22,820
okay,
what can I do to ensure that I do better

292
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,380
on the next test?
So then you could,

293
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,790
you could analyze your sub routines,
your micro sub routines,

294
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:31,220
like how much do you study a day?
Well,

295
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,190
sometimes people will tell me I study 
six hours a day.

296
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:34,671
It's like,
no,

297
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,820
you don't.
You sit in front of what you're supposed

298
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:38,654
to be doing for six hours a day.
But if you actually study for more than 

299
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:41,744
three,
I would be shocked because I've met 

300
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,024
almost no one in my entire life who can 
sustain high level concentration for 

301
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:53,480
more than three hours for more six days 
a week for more than a year,

302
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,340
you'll just burn yourself to a crisp.

303
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,173
So No,
you're deluding yourself into thinking 

304
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:58,610
that you're studying for six hours a 
day.

305
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,540
You'd be way better off to cut it down 
to two and a half and actually do it.

306
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,390
Like there's micro routine analysis that
you can do,

307
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,540
so that might be helpful.
Then you can implement that and run it.

308
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,440
That's what you do.
If you're a behavioral psychologist,

309
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,530
hey,
someone comes and says my life's over.

310
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,440
And you say,
well let's go for the micro routines.

311
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,960
What do you mean when they say,
well I can't be a doctor?

312
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,363
Well,
okay,

313
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,340
could you be a nurse?
Would that work?

314
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Could you be like a medical technician?
You know,

315
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,360
could you be,
what else could you be?

316
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,970
Could it be a social worker?
Et cetera.

317
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,150
Like okay,
so your,

318
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:36,470
your domain is helpful.
Medical type of person.

319
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,900
Well,
one element of that is doctor,

320
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:42,260
but it doesn't exhaust the entire realm 
of possibility.

321
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,260
So I'd say like slacks up a bit,
you know,

322
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,213
it's not the only path.
And so that would be a more high level 

323
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,024
adjustment.
That'd be more cognitive adjustment if 

324
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:52,760
you were in cognitive behavioral 
therapy.

325
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:54,620
It's like let's check out your sub 
routines,

326
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,810
make you more effective at studying.
But you know,

327
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,180
let's loosen up your top level 
abstractions.

328
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,290
You should be a good person.
Let's say whatever you decide that means

329
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,513
one element of that is be productively 
employed in a way that doesn't make you 

330
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,980
bitter and nasty.
Okay.

331
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,963
Doctor might be one way of solving that,
although I wouldn't be so sure about 

332
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:16,310
that,
but it's not the only way of solving it.

333
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,420
So all right,
you go from point a to B,

334
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,290
you go from point a to point b and 
things can happen along the way.

335
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,680
Things you like,
positive emotion you're getting there.

336
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,790
Plus you write things that produce 
negative emotion,

337
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,710
you're not getting there.
Okay?

338
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,573
You can either solve them easily,
small behavioral adjustment or you have 

339
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,024
to go up the hierarchy of value and 
adjust it with the least possible 

340
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:47,840
damage.
Generally speaking,

341
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,880
cause that's another rule of thumb in 
therapy.

342
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:50,714
It's like

343
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,090
I can't be a doctor so I'm going to be a
an engineer.

344
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,010
It's like,
well no,

345
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,550
you've got three years behind.
You don't just throw it away,

346
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,833
you know,
use what you've already got and make a 

347
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:06,380
minor course deviation.
If you can do it.

348
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,643
And you know,
maybe we could talk about broader scale 

349
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,910
transformations,
but they're costly.

350
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,550
You know,
stick as close to the path as you can,

351
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,790
well altering it enough so that you 
proceed on to your final goal.

352
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,860
And so,

353
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,460
and that leads us and they think this is
where we'll stop today.

354
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,410
That leads us to the next part of the 
story.

355
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,710
So here's the kind of story that someone
can tell.

356
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,170
I was at point a and I went to point B 
and here's how I did it.

357
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,940
And you're pretty happy about that 
story.

358
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,750
Maybe you go on to youtube.
And I found this a year ago,

359
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:41,300
I had this old car and I wanted to put a
stereo in it.

360
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,493
And so I typed in how to put a stereo in
x old car and there was some helpful 

361
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:48,080
retired southern guy who'd,
you know,

362
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,710
made a youtube.
And I was interested in his little story

363
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,020
cause I,
well he put a car stereo,

364
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,570
he didn't have a car stereo in his car 
and he wanted one.

365
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,240
And I didn't have a car stereo in my 
care and I wanted.

366
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,690
So here's a little story about how to do
that was very interesting to me.

367
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,140
So I ran that little tape and I did it.
It's like,

368
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,240
great.
Not particularly

369
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,570
transformation,
but good enough.

370
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,430
Good enough.
I got some information.

371
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,140
All right,
so that's an all right story.

372
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:21,040
And you're running around all the time 
interfacing with other people and you're

373
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:24,130
telling them your little story and 
they're telling you their little story.

374
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,443
But you know,
so that's one thing that interests 

375
00:18:27,221 --> 00:18:28,780
people,
how to do something successfully.

376
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,360
But in a lot of what people talk about 
is something different,

377
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:35,290
which is I was trying to get from point 
a to B and it didn't work and now I'm at

378
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,170
a place where it didn't work.
And so it's a problem,

379
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,033
right?
It's like the world's opened up around 

380
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:41,710
me.
I don't know what to do.

381
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,293
And the reason you talk to people about 
that is because they have brains and so 

382
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,404
to you,
and you might as well have two brains 

383
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:50,620
working on the problem if you can.
And if you're reciprocal,

384
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,280
you know you're in trouble.
You come to me and we talk it out,

385
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,390
maybe I can help.
And then because we're playing a

386
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,620
okay

387
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,260
iterative game,
now you owe me a favor.

388
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,783
Now you know,
I'm not going to be too restrictive 

389
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:07,850
about that.
But you know,

390
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,210
socially intelligent people are 
reciprocal.

391
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,170
And Ben Franklin once said,
you're new to the neighborhood.

392
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:15,671
What,
what,

393
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,270
what should you do to get integrated?
He said,

394
00:19:17,271 --> 00:19:20,180
ask a neighbor for a favor.
A small favor.

395
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,810
It's right.
It's like,

396
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,670
don't,
will you build me a new house?

397
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,181
It's like,
no,

398
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,410
that's not gonna work.
But you know,

399
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,543
um,

400
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,240
okay,

401
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,630
would you watch my,
here's my is on the law.

402
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:32,280
And when you watch them for two minutes 
while I run down to the corner store,

403
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:32,881
it's like,
okay,

404
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:33,714
they can do that.
Well why would you do that while it 

405
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,290
opens up the possibility of reciprocal 
exchange,

406
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,423
it's very,
very smart because now they can ask you 

407
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,760
for a favor.
So you got the,

408
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,594
you get the train thing going.
And people who are highly social are 

409
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:45,894
really good at Maine,
identifying and maintaining reciprocal 

410
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:49,584
obligations.
So we use each other as problem solving 

411
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,004
resources.
And a lot of our communication is 

412
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,524
exactly that.
And so basically the story you're 

413
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,564
telling isn't,
I was at point a and I went to point b 

414
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:02,520
and everything worked.
The story is this.

415
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:07,050
Instead
it's half of this,

416
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,250
okay,
I was at point a,

417
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,084
that's the top left hand corner.
I was at point and I was going to point 

418
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,714
b,
but something didn't work and then 

419
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,620
things collapsed,
you know,

420
00:20:19,621 --> 00:20:23,990
to a greater or lesser extent depending 
on the severity of the event you're,

421
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,630
you know,
and the closeness of your friendships.

422
00:20:26,631 --> 00:20:27,464
So you're telling the story,
you're not going to tell cause 

423
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,490
catastrophic stories to someone on a bus
that you just sat down beside unless you

424
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,590
have a mental illness.
And sometimes,

425
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,000
well,
really it's the truth.

426
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:36,834
Sometimes you'll sit down on a bus and 
someone who has a mental illness will 

427
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:40,794
come and sit beside you and they will 
immediately tell you horrible things 

428
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,124
about their life.
And the reason for that is that they 

429
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,040
have to,
they don't anyone to talk to,

430
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,860
they can't sort out their brains.
They're so desperate,

431
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:53,620
they're soul ruined any chaos.

432
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,573
They're so rude that they're,
that the proclivity to proclaim the 

433
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,820
chaos absolutely overwhelms them.
And you're,

434
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:04,654
you know,
you just can't deal with someone like 

435
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,184
that most of the time because the 
magnitude of the problem they're facing 

436
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:11,170
you with is way beyond your capacity to 
solve.

437
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,970
So it's just awkward.
It's not good.

438
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,140
Anyways.
You say,

439
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:16,690
I was going from point a to point b 
didn't work.

440
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,583
Now I don't know where I am.
I don't know where I'm going and I'm 

441
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,540
lost.
And you say,

442
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,374
well,
I know what I experienced when I was in 

443
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:24,994
a situation like this.
I did this and I know someone else who 

444
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:29,920
in that situation did this.
And maybe you could try those.

445
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,310
Or maybe you just shut up and you let 
the person talk.

446
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,653
And that's often extremely useful.
And the reason you do that is because 

447
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:40,030
they're thinking because people think 
they think,

448
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,893
but they don't.

449
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,020
They talk.
Thinking is hard,

450
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,420
right?
It's a very complex,

451
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,254
abstract cognitive operation.
And I don't think that there are many 

452
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,574
more people who can think.
Then there are people who can really 

453
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,940
read.
And that's probably two,

454
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,913
two to 5% of the population at most.
And so most of the way that people deal 

455
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,680
with that is that they talk and that's 
their thinking.

456
00:22:02,681 --> 00:22:05,980
And so they have some ideas about what 
might be going on,

457
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,963
but they're mixed and muddy.
So they're basically throwing out these 

458
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,750
ideas,
you know,

459
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:13,390
did this happen?
Is He liked this as she liked that.

460
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,620
It's like,
did I do this?

461
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,870
It's like,
and then they watch you and you know,

462
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,704
if you,
if you're nodding about one and they 

463
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:19,331
think,
oh well,

464
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,164
you know,
that seems plausible and they allowed 

465
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,560
another and you go,
you don't even notice.

466
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:24,251
And they think,
no,

467
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:25,180
that's off the table.

468
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,620
I didn't think that was a very good 
idea.

469
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,750
But now I've got some social,
um,

470
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,060
what do you call it?
Validation.

471
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,230
And soon they talk it out.
And instead of having 60 vaguely defined

472
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:36,064
problems,
now they have like five fairly tightly 

473
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:40,900
defined problems.
They're feeling a lot better about that,

474
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,940
right?
Cause it's five snakes instead of 60.

475
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,950
And maybe they can deal with five 
snakes.

476
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,980
So you've already helped them a whole 
bunch just by listening,

477
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,323
you know?
And then maybe you can be an active 

478
00:22:50,231 --> 00:22:53,080
listener and they lay out their story 
and you say,

479
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,670
well,
he said something here that doesn't make

480
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:57,010
any sense with this thing that you said.
So you know,

481
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,380
how would you reconcile those?
And you know,

482
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,333
it's this dialectical process and so the
person collapses into chaos and they 

483
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:04,954
come and tell you about it and then you 
rescue them if you can out of the chaos 

484
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:09,640
and then they pop back up the other 
side.

485
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,313
Clinical practice as actually a 
formalized version of an ideal 

486
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,870
relationship.
So the ideal is you think,

487
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,000
what's an ideal relationship?
Well,

488
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,313
I would say it,
the ideal relationship is where both of 

489
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:26,390
you are trying to get better than you 
are and you're helping each other do it.

490
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,750
It's something like that and the lines,
because you know,

491
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:30,584
if I have a good relationship with you,
I would rather that you're the best you 

492
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:34,160
you can be.
And Vice,

493
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,970
I would assume that you would also like 
that for me.

494
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,193
I mean,
things interfere with that because he 

495
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:40,821
might say,
well,

496
00:23:40,821 --> 00:23:41,654
if,
you know,

497
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,490
given how horrible I am,
if if my partner of a sudden got a clue,

498
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,470
they'd leave.
So I bet her interfere with that as much

499
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,690
as I possibly can.
And people do that all the time.

500
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,853
You know,
one of the things they'll do is make 

501
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:56,090
sure their partners and to attract it,
but you're so attracted,

502
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,440
why are you with someone like me?

503
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,670
It's like all criticized.
He wouldn't,

504
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,260
you look attractive and that'll fix 
that.

505
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,930
So if people do that sort of thing all 
the time,

506
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,100
this is the revolutionary story.
This is the real story.

507
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:07,934
People tell I was here,
I got bloody well knocked off my perch 

508
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,870
and then for a while things were not 
good.

509
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,183
And then,
you know,

510
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,490
I reconfigured myself.
I learned some things,

511
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,343
I did some exploration,
I made some changes and poop off the 

512
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:24,410
other side.
I come and I'm a better person for it.

513
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,680
And if you listen to the way people talk
about their pasts,

514
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,110
especially with regards to traumatic 
events,

515
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,550
they'll often tell you that.
They'll say,

516
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:31,971
well,
you know,

517
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,804
in retrospect,
that was the best thing that ever 

518
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:34,484
happened to me.
It's like those are the people who come 

519
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,040
out the other side,
I'll tell you,

520
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,173
because lots of people,
they fall into the belly of the beast 

521
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,040
and they never come out.

522
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,850
You see that in fairytales sometimes say
so there'd be a hero and heal,

523
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,713
conquer,
some sort of dragging or some sort of 

524
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,030
monster.
And when he cuts it open,

525
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,040
a bunch of people who come out,
it's like,

526
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:53,780
yeah,
they're the ones who've got swallowed by

527
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,970
the thing and it isn't till that person 
came,

528
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:58,730
comes along and solves the problem that 
all those other people get to come out.

529
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,133
So I have to revolutionary store.
It's the archetypical revolutionary 

530
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,030
story and it's the story of human 
progress socially,

531
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,010
politically,
economically,

532
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,530
and psychologically.
And you see that reflected.

533
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:14,480
For example,
one of the things I could tell you about

534
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,493
Christianity is that it's a 
revolutionary narrative at the 

535
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:18,644
beginning.
So if you look at the Bible structured 

536
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:23,270
as a piece of literature at the 
beginning there's a fall.

537
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,930
Everyone was doing fine.
Then they wake up and they find out that

538
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,520
the bottom has dropped out and then the 
whole rest of this book is about,

539
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:32,750
okay,
how do you get back there?

540
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,220
And actually it is in this all Italian,
partly what the Bible is,

541
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,690
is the attempt by broadly speaking,
Western civilization.

542
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:43,430
So that would be all the way from the 
Middle East,

543
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,353
West.
It's the west attempt to figure out 

544
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,730
what's wrong with life and how to fix 
it.

545
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,280
And it's,
it's,

546
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,970
it's the collaboration of thousands of 
people over thousands of years.

547
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,660
Of course you can say that about any 
ancient moral tradition.

548
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,970
So the question is,
well,

549
00:26:01,971 --> 00:26:04,460
is there an answer to the question?
Well that's,

550
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,100
that's one of the next things we're 
going to try to figure it out.

551
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,641
Well,
let's say,

552
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:13,201
okay,
you're,

553
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:15,310
you're driving down the floor of one car
breaks down,

554
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,110
you're off by the side of the road.
It's like,

555
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,850
that's not,
maybe it's snowing.

556
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,470
I was like,
how bad is that?

557
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,760
Well,
you don't know.

558
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,240
Like maybe someone slides on this.
No one runs over you with your dad.

559
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:28,480
It's really bad.
So you're freaking out.

560
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:31,270
Maybe your phone isn't working,
so can check your phone.

561
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:32,104
That's not working.
It's like all of a sudden things have 

562
00:26:33,071 --> 00:26:33,904
got worse.
So this person drives up behind you and 

563
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,514
they stop.
You're a bit nervous about them because 

564
00:26:37,661 --> 00:26:38,950
what are they up to?
And they come up,

565
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,350
they opened the,
they open the hood and they say,

566
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,000
well this thing is loose.
And they put it in there.

567
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,010
It's like,
are you happy?

568
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,683
Well,
yes,

569
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,610
because what's happened to you?
It's magic.

570
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,444
So first of all,
you're not in a car as soon as it stops 

571
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:50,790
working.

572
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,070
By the way,
it's only a car when it's working,

573
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,100
when it's not working,
it's a,

574
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,270
it's a bag of snakes,
right?

575
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,260
It's like,
oh,

576
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,810
this car isn't working.
What could be long wrong with it?

577
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,940
Oh,
an infinite number of things.

578
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:06,210
None of which I understand.
And then those things are on attached to

579
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:08,250
people who are going to fix the car and 
like,

580
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,470
can I trust them?
Do I even know who they are?

581
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Are they going to empty my wallet?
Do I need to have a new car?

582
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,450
You know?
So you don't know.

583
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:18,120
And then while your day's gone,
and then,

584
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,460
you know,
so all of a sudden what happens is your,

585
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,803
your environment complexifies radically 
and you get all nervous because there's 

586
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:26,094
a lot of paths in there that you might 
have to traverse to get back to where 

587
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:30,930
you're going.
Someone comes along and goes tap.

588
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,153
It's like you're happy.
It's all the complexity has collapsed 

589
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,050
and the one path and Poof,
you're poof,

590
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:42,051
your story is now implementable again.
And you'll pay people for that.

591
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,520
You do it all the time.
It's like you got a problem,

592
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:46,320
you take it to an expert and they say,
well,

593
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,430
it take you an infinite amount of time 
to traverse all these possible paths.

594
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,040
So you're basically screwed.
But if you give me $100,

595
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,540
I can tell you how to do it in five 
minutes.

596
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:55,620
You think,
yes,

597
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,480
that's worth it.
So,

598
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,033
so,
you know,

599
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,560
of course it's efficient.
That's why we trade.

600
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,150
It's exactly why we trade.
It's like things are gonna go wrong with

601
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,880
you that I could help and vice versa.
What a deal.

602
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,580
That's partly why we're social and why 
we maintain it.

603
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,020
Like,
as a collective,

604
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:15,210
we're way more intelligent than we would
be,

605
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,920
you know,
as one person.

606
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,740
So,
all right,

607
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,903
that's a revolutionary story.
That's a collapse into the underworld 

608
00:28:24,811 --> 00:28:28,050
and rebirth.
And so as soon as you know that,

609
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:32,220
it's so cool to know that because now 
whenever you read a classic story of any

610
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:32,910
sort,
you can think,

611
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,470
oh,
that's a voyage to the underworld.

612
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,980
I've been there and you have,
everyone's been there.

613
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,820
The underworld is where that's chaos.
It's chaos.

614
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,890
It's where you go when your life falls 
apart.

615
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,023
It has a structure.
And what's even cooler about that is 

616
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,820
once you know this,
there's actually guides through it.

617
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:51,654
It's like,
okay,

618
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,030
your world fell apart.
What do you do about it?

619
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,570
Well,
dying of stress is a bad idea.

620
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,673
You don't have to do that.
So I was talking to one of the students 

621
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,233
during break and uh,
we were talking about character and I 

622
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,014
said,
well,

623
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,090
the best thing you could do is build 
your character.

624
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,480
Here's a test of character.
It's like a family members dying.

625
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,570
Okay,
are you useful or useless?

626
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,960
That's the first question.
And then a deeper question is,

627
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,390
do you make it as good as it can be,
which isn't going to be that good by the

628
00:29:24,391 --> 00:29:25,224
way?
Or do you turn it into hell because he 

629
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:29,130
can,
and lots of people do.

630
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,650
So one of the tests of character is,
okay,

631
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,000
there's a crisis.
Like,

632
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:33,834
really?

633
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,670
Are you going to respond?
Are you going to be helpful?

634
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,680
Are you going to be useless?
Or even worse,

635
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,630
are you gonna make it worse?
I would say helpful.

636
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,800
And the thing that's so cool about human
beings is that we can do that.

637
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,383
People are so tough,
it's insane as long as they put 

638
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:53,284
themselves in a position.
My sister in law works is a palliative 

639
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:56,524
care nurse.
It's like all she does is work with 

640
00:29:58,241 --> 00:29:59,770
people who are going to die at two 
weeks.

641
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:04,480
Like she's a happy person,
partly cause she goes home and thinks,

642
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,310
hey,
this isn't a palliative care ward.

643
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,010
Well really man,
you know,

644
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,380
things can be worse.
So,

645
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,930
and she knows that and she's reminded of
it every day.

646
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,870
It's like that's a person who does not 
take things for granted.
