1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,470
Hi there.
So I thought I'd update you with regards

2
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:11,670
to what has been going on at the 
University of Toronto in the last week.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,103
Um,
since I released my three videos 

4
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,960
starting on September 27th dealing with 
political correctness,

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,170
uh,
at the legislative level and in terms of

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,990
certain policy decisions at the 
University of Toronto,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,363
most particularly the mandatory 
requirement that the human resources 

8
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,550
staff take a antiracism and antibiotics 
training.

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:36,384
So on October 3rd,
I received the first of two warning 

10
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:40,910
letters,
um,

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
telling me that I was required to act in
accordance with university policies and 

12
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,443
with the relevant law.
I'm not going to read you the first 

13
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,130
letter.
Um,

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,490
but I'll read you the second one,
which I got on October 18th.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,593
So dear Professor Peterson,
we are writing in followup to professor 

16
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,040
ferber's letter to you of October 3rd,
2016.

17
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,620
Professor Ferber is the chair of the 
psychology department and um,

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,960
she gave me the first letter,
um,

19
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,853
as a consequence of her interactions 
with a variety of administrators at the 

20
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:17,484
university
regarding the ongoing concerns related 

21
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,314
to your videos and complaints that have 
been made to the university by members 

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,514
of the university community,
including transgendered persons and the 

23
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:34,290
organizations that represent and support
them on campus about some of the content

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:35,220
of those videos.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,953
First,
let us be clear that the university is 

26
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:41,214
committed to the protection of freedom 
of speech as a core value for our 

27
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:48,180
community and for any university in a 
democratic society.

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,943
The university is likewise committed to 
protecting the academic freedom of our 

29
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,334
faculty members,
including their right to criticize the 

30
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:00,240
university and society at large with 
freedom from institutional censorship.

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,613
As articulated in article five of the 
Memorandum of agreement between the 

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,040
University of Toronto and the University
of Toronto Faculty Association,

33
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,293
the University's commitment to 
protecting these core values includes 

34
00:02:11,851 --> 00:02:12,684
your right to express and debate views 
that may be discomforting or even 

35
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,460
offensive to others.
However,

36
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:19,800
as professor ferber has already pointed 
out to you,

37
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,350
these rights are not without limitation 
and must be exercised in accordance with

38
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,540
your responsibilities as a faculty 
member,

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,183
including upholding applicable laws.
You have continued to state public 

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,283
publicly that if a student or colleague 
or staff member requests that you 

41
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,050
referred to the music,
gender neutral pronouns,

42
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,003
you will refuse to do so and that you do
not recognize the rights of others to 

43
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,490
tell you which personal pronoun to use 
when addressing them.

44
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,343
The law of Ontario,
specifically the Ontario Human Rights 

45
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,033
Code protects against discrimination 
based on gender expression and gender 

46
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,530
identity.
Depending on the context,

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,790
if personal pronouns are being used,
the refusal by a teacher or colleague to

48
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:04,624
use the personal pronoun,
that is an expression of the person's 

49
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,600
gender identity can constitute 
discrimination.

50
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,023
In many situations.
It is not necessary to use personal 

51
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:16,994
pronouns at all,
but where it is the personal pronoun 

52
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,624
that is chosen as the person's gender 
identity related and gender expression 

53
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:24,824
related identifier should be used.
Your statements that you will refuse to 

54
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,044
use transgendered your statements that 
you will refuse to refer to 

55
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,114
transgendered persons using gender 
neutral pronouns if they ask you to do 

56
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:39,194
so are contrary to the rights of those 
persons to equal treatment without 

57
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:47,030
discrimination based on their gender 
identity and gender expression.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,673
You should also be aware that many 
members of the university community are 

59
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:52,034
concerned and distressed about the 
declarations of your discriminatory 

60
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,484
intentions.
The university has received 

61
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,154
communications from individual student 
groups and employee groups that find my 

62
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:06,941
comments to be unacceptable,
emotionally disturbing and painful.

63
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,303
Some members of the university community
report that the statements and the 

64
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,640
invective that has followed in the 
ensuing commentary and debates on social

65
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:20,990
media have caused them to fear for their
safety on the university campus.

66
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,603
Some students have reported being the 
target of specific and violent threats 

67
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,170
including threats of assault,
injury,

68
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:30,800
and death against them individually and 
as members of the Trans Community.

69
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,263
We trust that these impacts on students 
and others were not your intention in 

70
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:37,160
making these remarks.
However,

71
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,350
in view of these impacts as well as the 
requirements of the Ontario Human Rights

72
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,183
Code,
we urge you to stop repeating these 

73
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:48,224
statements.

74
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,663
As professor ferber informed you,
your responsibilities as a faculty 

75
00:04:56,221 --> 00:05:00,270
member at the University of Toronto 
include an obligation to uphold the law,

76
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,913
including the Ontario human rights code 
and to do so as you exercise your 

77
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:06,810
academic freedom or freedom of 
expression,

78
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:07,883
your responsibilities as a faculty 
member also include dealing with other 

79
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,094
members of the university community in 
ways that provide equal treatment 

80
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,603
without discrimination.
Article Five of the memo of agreement 

81
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:18,474
between New Toronto and and the U 
Toronto Faculty Association not only 

82
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:24,840
recognizes that faculty members have the
right to academic freedom,

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,393
but also notes the responsibility of 
faculty members to establish fair and 

84
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:32,460
ethical dealings with students as well 
as with colleagues.

85
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,093
The impact of your behavior runs the 
risk of undermining your ability to 

86
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:42,480
conduct essential components of your job
as a faculty member,

87
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,243
and we urge you to consider your 
obligations as a faculty member to act 

88
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:52,551
in a manner that is consistent with the 
law and with university policy.

89
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,593
You have referred to allegations of 
criminal behavior by some in at the 

90
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:58,394
Rally of October 11th,
2016 the university deplores acts of 

91
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,280
violence and it's just rupture of civil 
debate.

92
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,990
The allegations of criminal behavior are
being investigated by the Toronto Police

93
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,390
Service.
The university continues to emphasize to

94
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,224
its community members the obligation to 
engage in civil nonviolent interactions 

95
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
at all times,
including when difficult topics are 

96
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:20,420
discussed on campus.
Yours sincerely,

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,660
David Cameron,
Dean Faculty of Arts and Science.

98
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,980
See your band,
Nelson,

99
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:25,814
vice provost,
faculty and academic life copied to 

100
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,720
professors,
Suzanne Ferber,

101
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,650
chair of the Department of Psychology.
So

102
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,330
I'm being urged to stop saying what I'm 
saying.

103
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,643
Well,
the next video I'll post and hopefully 

104
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,130
today will be my response to that.
