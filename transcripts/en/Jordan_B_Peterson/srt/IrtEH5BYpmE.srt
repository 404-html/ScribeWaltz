1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,060
Everyone could please take their seat 
again.

2
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,280
Can everyone please take their seats?

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,893
All right,
so I would now like to introduce our 

4
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:33,120
second speaker,
Dr.

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,953
Arthur Hansen.
Now when I was reading through is 

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,740
through the accomplishments of Dr.
Hansen,

7
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,200
I have to admit that I was a little 
intimidated.

8
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,060
One of the first questions that came to 
my mind was what was he doing at my age?

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,800
Well,
the answer is selling 75,000

10
00:00:49,801 --> 00:00:52,560
pins with a slogan on them that he came 
up with.

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,370
Give Earth the chance.
Dr.

12
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,203
Arthur Hanson is an officer of the order
of Canada and distinguished fellow with 

13
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:00,414
the International Institute for 
Sustainable Development following his 

14
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,074
term as president and CEO from 1991 to 
98 he has worked with a number of 

15
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,630
organizations around the world providing
initial guidance,

16
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,710
conducting research and advising on 
innovation for sustainable development,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,010
environment and economy relationships,
biodiversity,

18
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,680
oceans and international development.
Dr.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,513
Hanson has a strong interest in linking 
science to public policy and works 

20
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,410
closely with government bodies in 
Canada,

21
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,570
the United States and Asia.

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
On specifics on specific problems 
related to environmental management and 

23
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,840
mechanisms of accountability and 
governance.

24
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:42,810
For sustainable development.
In recent years.

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,900
Much of his professional time has been 
spent working in with China.

26
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,593
He initiated some of the largest 
environmental capacity building efforts 

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,353
currently underway in Indonesia,
simultaneously working with the 

28
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,740
government,
ngos,

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,840
universities,
and the private sector.

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,393
Much of this effort has involved 
establishing graduate degree programs 

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,980
such as environmental law and 
environmental studies.

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,743
He served two terms on Canada's national
round table on the environment and 

33
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:10,884
economy and was Canada's ministerial 
ocean ambassador with the Department of 

34
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,370
fisheries and oceans and for years.
Dr.

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,203
Hanson served for 10 years as a member 
of the Canadian Foundation for 

36

Innovation and as a mentor in the 
Trudeau Foundation.

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,550
He has provided advice to the office of 
the auditor general of Canada since 1990

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,623
and has chaired various national and 
international initiatives from 1978 to 

39
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,054
1991 he was professor and director of 
the school for Resource and 

40
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:42,330
environmental studies at Dalhousie 
University.

41
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,823
Dr.
Hanson holds a phd from the University 

42
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:47,484
of Michigan in the field of fisheries,
ecology and natural resources and a 

43
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:54,960
master's degree in zoology or fisheries 
from the University of British Columbia.

44
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,020
Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Arthur Hansen.

45
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,050
[inaudible]

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,360
thank you very much.
When you were speaking earlier about how

47
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:17,560
much it should cost to come to the 
lecture or whether you had mortgage your

48
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:18,394
house,
I have known people that have mortgaged 

49
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,680
their houses for the emotions.
Um,

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
but I just want to tell you one little 
story about this teaching on the 

51
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,060
environment at the University of 
Michigan,

52
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,350
which the opening session of it was,
eh,

53
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,303
had attracted 18,000
people to an auditorium and we had to 

54
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,544
turn people away.
But we had a special secret deal with 

55
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:42,520
the president of the university because 
nobody got this place for free.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
And I was a fundraiser for all of this.
And uh,

57
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
uh,
it was a big week long event that I 

58
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,624
won't go into details on.
But the funny thing about it was one 

59
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,044
night at home,
I get this phone call from a guy who I 

60
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,970
didn't know and tall,
and he introduced himself and he said,

61
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,150
you know,
I think it is a,

62
00:03:59,151 --> 00:03:59,984
he had read our perspectives,
which had been published in some books 

63
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,064
and that,
and,

64
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,973
and he said,
I think it's a righteous at the 

65
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,510
university,
wants you to chart,

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,820
wants to charge you $5,000
for one night.

67
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,760
And I explained to him,
all of the university said,

68
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,160
nobody,
but nobody gets this for free.

69
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,250
And,
uh,

70
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,980
you're no exceptions.
We've,

71
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,500
our group was called an act 
environmental action now.

72
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,300
And so,
uh,

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,730
we were preparing to raise the money and
he said,

74
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:26,440
well,
I really like what you're doing.

75
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:29,080
I'm prepared to give you $5,000
to support it,

76
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,310
but I want you to go to the university 
president and say my name,

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,410
and then say,
uh,

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,700
he would give $10,000
if the university agreed not to,

79
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,750
uh,
to,

80
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,360
uh,
uh,

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,740
charges 5,000
for the [inaudible].

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,370
So I phoned up the head of the 
university development,

83
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,740
uh,
who is president for that.

84
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,020
And he immediately said,
oh,

85
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,220
he's,
he phoned you.

86
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,493
Yes,
please come and see the president 

87
00:04:57,491 --> 00:04:58,324
tomorrow.
And so I go and the president of the 

88
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:05,371
University of Michigan,
it was a labor negotiator and lawyer,

89
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,840
I guess a very nice man.
But,

90
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,060
uh,
I walked into his office and I have this

91
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,894
kind of sheepish grin on his face.
I knew before he opened his mouth that 

92
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,134
we'd won and it turned out this was one 
of the biggest benefactors to the 

93
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,880
university.
And in fact,

94
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,630
his,
uh,

95
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,463
his family on guy,
his wife's family owned a newspaper 

96
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:28,351
chain running out of Chicago.
And apparently her mother didn't want to

97
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,480
give any money away.
Her father wanted to give money away.

98
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,300
So instead they gave it to the kids who 
gave it to good causes,

99
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,770
like the University of Michigan.

100
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,490
And so we got our money.
But the funny thing about all those pins

101
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,380
and that and also the,
uh,

102
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,071
enough,
this spin,

103
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:46,780
but those things that they,
the funny thing about that was that the,

104
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,540
um,
university put a condition that we could

105
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:53,140
charge no more than 50 cents admission 
to this events event.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,710
So between selling the pins and the 50 
cent admissions,

107
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,730
I was the financial finances,
uh,

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,810
uh,
chairman.

109
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,770
So everyday I would go around campus and
we had this great network of people that

110
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,960
were selling pins and selling tickets 
for the event.

111
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,343
And I had a suitcase,
which I think we still have our own 

112
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,830
little silver suitcase.
And there was a normal little suitcase,

113
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,270
wasn't too big because it was filled 
with coins.

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,070
So every afternoon I would try and 
casually walk across for fear of getting

115
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:19,940
robbed because it was

116
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,853
fairly close to a rough city in Detroit.
And I be trying to be casual and my arm 

117
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,710
was beginning,
but

118
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,000
there was a Latin and I,
I just gave a talk last night at,

119
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,943
uh,
w Pearson College on the West Coast to 

120
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:37,180
phd students from Royal Roads University
and needs very,

121
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,014
very bright and competent young people 
that go into the baccalaureate program 

122
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,240
and have the privilege of attending 
Pearson College.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,380
And so I tried to give them a talk on 
leaders,

124
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,214
laggards in the rest of us.
And I've been thinking about that 

125
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:52,650
already in what you're saying.
Uh,

126
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,583
Jordan,
because in the oceans area we deal with 

127
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:56,524
leaders and there's lots of them and we 
deal with lots of laggards who see the 

128
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,370
world in very narrow sorts of ways.
And,

129
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,263
uh,
we also see the rest of us who are the 

130
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:06,934
people in this room that you and me,
because we can't all be experts in the 

131
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,580
oceans and I'm not expert on all sorts 
of things.

132
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,414
I go out for a frequent kayak,
writes and talks with a guy who's a 

133
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,633
physical oceanographer,
one of the best in the field that this 

134
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,540
in Victoria.
And,

135
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,420
and uh,
you know,

136
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:25,690
he gets into discussions with me that I 
have no idea what he's talking about.

137
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,743
And I try and

138
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,870
like 200 foot waves and things like this
and I just don't understand because it's

139
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,190
all

140
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,000
mathematical and it's all been said.
So we're all learners.

141
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,560
We're all people who want to do good,
but we have to deal with some people who

142
00:07:40,561 --> 00:07:43,900
really have very strong vested interest 
as well and who are,

143
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,900
it'd be happy to take the last fish out 
of the,

144
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:49,230
see if they can put it into the money 
from that into their pocket.

145
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,920
So I'm going to,
I thought,

146
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,754
first of all,
I think we should give a Jordan and 

147
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,230
honorary something

148
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,280
in ocean studies,
the ocean

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,620
sciences.
But Ocean studies is different and we do

150
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,454
need psychologists and people with human
behavior understandings to bring the 

151
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:13,040
message out about the oceans.
That's been one of the problems.

152
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,903
Scientists don't do a very good job even
though they're very good scientists and 

153
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,554
some of them do fortunately.
And then there's people like Jacques 

154
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,560
Cousteau and so forth and many others 
like that and organizations,

155
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:25,190
uh,
that,

156
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,620
that really try hard.
Many of the big foundations,

157
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,160
conservation international,
a whole range of ocean oriented,

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,420
uh,
bodies and so forth.

159
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,070
But it's still not enough and it won't 
be enough,

160
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,440
I think until people,
uh,

161
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,830
who actually have a lot of interest in 
oceans but wa but still lack feel.

162
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:48,380
They lack the means to do things about 
it.

163
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,151
And,
uh,

164
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,960
and I would include,
uh,

165
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,823
not the MPs and that are members of 
parliament tend to understand the 

166
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:56,550
oceans.

167
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,710
And some people say to me,
they turn,

168
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,544
if people,
some people in some places in Canada to 

169
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,870
turn their backs in the oceans are more 
interested in agriculture and the things

170
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:04,704
that happened on land.
And that's a strong feeling that people 

171
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:08,964
have that uh,
our parliamentarians have not risen to 

172
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:14,040
the challenge even though they've 
signed,

173
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,023
the government has signed those things.
And one of the things that 

174
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:21,960
differentiates us from Australia is that
the Australians generally,

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,910
they all live in the course is one 
thing,

176
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,890
surf on it,
fish from it,

177
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,650
do everything near the water and,
and,

178
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:29,484
uh,
they actually have the strong political 

179
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,390
will.
There's politicians there,

180
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,140
uh,
who have taken the oceans as a cause and

181
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:38,310
who are very powerful,
uh,

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,140
politicians.
That's helped a lot.

183
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,770
And I'll come to that later in the talk,
but I want to start off.

184
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,591
Um,
and I,

185
00:09:44,591 --> 00:09:45,900
I've got a lot to say.

186
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,930
I'm going to try and say it as concisely
as I can in watch the clock.

187
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,660
So we'll have some time for discussion.
Um,

188
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,733
and I want to start generally looking at
the global situation and then I want to 

189
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:01,470
home in on Canada because we as Canadian
sitting here and,

190
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:04,650
and maybe some students who are not from
Canada here.

191
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,783
Uh,
this is the country where you're trying 

192
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,600
to understand right now how we do things
and that's very,

193
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,070
very important.
Uh,

194
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,740
I think we're going to learn a lot from 
other countries.

195
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,540
Some of the Asian countries,
good and bad,

196
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,460
we'll learn that.
I've worked with,

197
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,770
have some very interesting models for 
fisheries management.

198
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,604
China for example,
they say they laugh at our fisheries 

199
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,840
models.
Let me tell you the,

200
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,010
and the,
and the LLC for example,

201
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,873
and they say,
we haven't got the money or the time to 

202
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,910
be able to debate the finer points of 
the models that you have.

203
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,020
What we do is we just stop all fishing 
during the spawning season for about two

204
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:37,854
or three or four months.
I forget exactly what it is in the 

205
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,650
summertime.
Oh.

206
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,590
And it isn't that they're doing it 
perfectly,

207
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,890
but a lot of elements of that simple 
mechanism worked for them.

208
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,023
Maybe sometimes we need simpler things 
rather than the very involved debate 

209
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,423
that goes on between the scientists,
the fishery scientists who tend to be 

210
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,580
all concerned about fishing and 
population dynamics.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,833
People like myself that deal with 
ecosystems and think about food chains 

212
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:06,270
and think about habitat destruction and 
so forth.

213
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,733
And,
and then others who take yet another 

214
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,284
point of view,
which is the fisheries economist who 

215
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,070
said they get the price rate,
uh,

216
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:14,904
individually transferable quotas and all
sorts of exotica that I think are often 

217
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,110
useful.
But there is no simple answer.

218
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,183
So I'm going to be filling in the blanks
here that Jordan has left me plenty to 

219
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,894
fill in.

220
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,711
Um,
and,

221
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,544
and I'm going to be focusing a lot on 
habitat a lot on the ecosystem because 

222
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:37,830
it's my belief that in addition to 
worrying about fishing,

223
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,830
you have to worry about what's happening
to where fish live,

224
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:41,664
which is in the water feeding on things 
that in that marvelous food chain there 

225
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,220
was described there.
And,

226
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,940
and,
uh,

227
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,773
indeed,
if we don't take that into account in 

228
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:51,294
our decision making about fisheries,
then we only know about a quarter of 

229
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,320
what's really happening out there.
So I just want to remind us first of all

230
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,330
that,
uh,

231
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,100
it's fair to say that our planet is 
about water and the water is saltwater.

232
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
Uh,
70% of the,

233
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,660
uh,
the earth's surface is covered by it.

234
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,890
We depend on every single person in this
planet,

235
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,780
whether or not they live in Afghanistan,
whether they live in British Columbia,

236
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:23,230
Canada,
or Indonesia or any of the other places.

237
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,543
Um,
we depend on a variety of ecological 

238
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,550
services from the oceans.
I won't go into that right now.

239
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,463
Uh,
but it's very important to recognize 

240
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,150
that.
Secondly,

241
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,780
it is a history book of the Earth.
We look at the sediments,

242
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,614
we know,
understand where we get our oxygen from 

243
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,670
and so forth.
And it's complex,

244
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:43,504
but we can understand that.
And we also depend on that as we look 

245
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:52,210
for the resources we explained.
Where do we find out about how anchovies

246
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:56,710
go up and down because of El Nino and La
Nina from the ocean sediments.

247
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,620
And we looked for the scales of the 
sometimes essential meets there.

248
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,630
Sometimes they're not there.
Um,

249
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,500
and,
and our use sediments and so forth.

250
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,363
Well,
all that oil that we use is basically 

251
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:11,470
from phytoplankton from the sea and 
other sea creatures.

252
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,533
It.
So,

253
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,583
um,
we have to do understand that it's a 

254
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:18,280
basis of natural wealth and of our 
prosperity,

255
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:23,050
half the people in the planet live close
to the ocean and that is always going to

256
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:23,884
be the case.

257
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,620
Um,
their prosperity through trade,

258
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,130
through fishing,
through all sorts of different things we

259
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:30,964
know about it.
So the oceans government's trade 

260
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:37,630
settlement patterns and it,
we now know and understand where they're

261
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:38,464
clearly,
it also governs climate and therefore 

262
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,270
climate change.
But it's also the source of conflict,

263
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:47,380
calamity and crises.
And I don't like to talk about crises,

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,820
but I have to.
Uh,

265
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,943
and particularly in this talk,
people say the ocean is in crisis and I 

266
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,140
think it's true,
frankly,

267
00:13:56,141 --> 00:13:58,990
despite all what we said at the 
beginning of your talk,

268
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,990
Jordan and I would like to think that 
uh,

269
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,010
um,
uh,

270
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,000
things are nice out there on the 
environment globally.

271
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,863
They're in a downhill turn for sure,
but there's a way of looking at crisis 

272
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,800
that I think it's very important.
And I,

273
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:15,634
again,
I go back to some of the experiences 

274
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:17,740
that has been a lot of time in China.

275
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,280
China doesn't like to talk about 
barriers,

276
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,560
about not being able to do things and so
forth.

277
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,990
What they cautioned me and say,
look,

278
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,940
talk about crisis.
Yes.

279
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:28,774
If you wish,
we understand we face crisis for a long 

280
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:32,470
time.
We face crises.

281
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,840
How do you turn crisis into opportunity?
And that's very important.

282
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,123
Chinese do that all the time.
Crisis to opportunity and they actually 

283
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,484
do it often.
They're able to solve the crises and 

284
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:46,900
they're better off open new 
opportunities.

285
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,070
I talked about what I call [inaudible] 
crisis to sustainability.

286
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,520
How do we turn these things into a 
sustainable development pattern?

287
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,470
Not easy,
but not impossible.

288
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,873
And particularly when I'm talking with 
an audience and includes people of the 

289
00:15:02,571 --> 00:15:03,404
next generation,
we're going to have to solve all the 

290
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,014
messes and problems and open the new 
opportunities that come with new 

291
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,930
technologies,
etc.

292
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,940
Um,
I don't want to leave you with a message

293
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:18,710
of failure and a message of 
impossibility.

294
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,950
It has to be a message of opportunity 
and then a message of hope and so forth.

295
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,980
And I think we can apply that to the 
ocean.

296
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:28,814
So some of the examples that I'm going 
to present or things that seem to be 

297
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:35,600
going better now than they were,
say 10 years or 20 years ago.

298
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,400
So please keep that in mind if it gets 
too gross and just remember,

299
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,423
uh,
I'm basically an optimist and want to 

300
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:44,714
see hope for the future and hope that 
the people who carry the burden forward 

301
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,473
and the institutions that I hope Finn 
can become as at one of those can make 

302
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,030
real contributions to that.
I'm looking at Youth Finn,

303
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,903
like that person over there and some of 
the others that I met earlier this 

304
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,343
afternoon.
I really am honored that I can be here 

305
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,223
to

306
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,760
kick off what I hope will be a 
successful effort on the part,

307
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:14,880
not just a view of t students but 
students across the country.

308
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,013
Because we need,
we need this kind of support and 

309
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,613
understanding and real action that can 
come out of the bigger people who carry 

310
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:27,090
challenges forward into the next 
generation.

311
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,340
The reason I was speaking at Pearson and
happy to do so here's in college is that

312
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:35,190
I am going further and further down the 
food chain.

313
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,870
Um,
I feel that,

314
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,723
uh,
we have to be working in a very 

315
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:44,550
intelligent way and communicating with 
people that are still in high schools,

316
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:48,730
junior high schools and elementary 
schools so that they come into the,

317
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,290
the university world with an attitude of
responsibility to some extent,

318
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,933
but understanding particularly of things
where they can make a difference in the 

319
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,290
years ahead.
So those are some preliminary,

320
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:03,124
the points.

321
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,630
Okay.
So now we get into the nasty stuff.

322
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:07,763
Ocean health and decline.
You're going to hear these things and 

323
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,243
there's a new index and I've given a,
there's a lot of words in some of these 

324
00:17:13,831 --> 00:17:15,990
slides.
Don't even try and read them all,

325
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,760
listened to me,
but I'm just,

326
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,083
we're trying to take a videotape of this
and we're going to intersperse some of 

327
00:17:23,341 --> 00:17:25,590
the slides.
So I want a little bit more detail.

328
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:26,424
That's why I put it in here.
And also a ways that you can find this 

329
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:29,874
information easily.
So there's this new thing that people 

330
00:17:32,611 --> 00:17:35,130
have been trying for some time to get an
integrated,

331
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,350
uh,
overview of ocean health.

332
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,230
And you can see it's not very good 
overall in the world.

333
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:43,430
60 out of 100.
And if you go on the website,

334
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,290
you can find what each country,
uh,

335
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,980
where it's good and not good.

336
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,560
Interestingly,
Canada gets 70 out a hundred.

337
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:50,870
So,
um,

338
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,480
uh,
maybe we can a trumpet a success in some

339
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:57,090
areas,
but I would say that,

340
00:17:57,091 --> 00:17:57,924
uh,
certainly I don't see things in great 

341
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,650
shape right now in Canada in the same 
way that Jordan,

342
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:03,360
uh,
uh,

343
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,430
an artist as well.
And so let's,

344
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,470
let's talk about health for just a 
second.

345
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,890
Two quick examples.
Beautiful place,

346
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,900
a broken archipelago,
uh,

347
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,070
broaden archipelagos where,
uh,

348
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,520
Alexandra Morton and others,
uh,

349
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,510
feel that,
uh,

350
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,511
the cage salmon that are aquaculture 
there are carrying an excessive parasite

351
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:24,414
load,
that the wild salmon coming down the 

352
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:28,140
pink Simon for very remote rivers,
uh,

353
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,700
on the BC coast are picking up the 
parasite load and dying off.

354
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,960
This is a big tussle between science and
citizen science.

355
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,510
Um,
and,

356
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:39,344
and,
uh,

357
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,220
I must say it's not a resolved issue.
I'm kind of on Alexandra Morton side,

358
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,054
I think on this.

359
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
But in general,
the health of the oceans,

360
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,820
the health of ecosystems and what it 
means to us,

361
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,733
uh,
brings it back right into economic 

362
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:53,700
terms.
Now,

363
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,350
this is another big puzzle.
Uh,

364
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,340
this man who I spend a day with,
uh,

365
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,760
several years ago took this picture and 
his doctor,

366
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:00,594
Peter Ross,
who's just lost this job because the 

367
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,170
whole group of people and toxicology,
the deal with ocean toxicological issues

368
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:11,150
paid for often by people from other 
countries like the United States or a,

369
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,860
and give us data that's absolutely 
essential.

370
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,993
Um,
from monitoring different Adam mainly 

371
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:20,370
seals,
but up and down the coast so you can see

372
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,323
where pollutants are coming across from 
Asia because of they hit the northern 

373
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:24,624
stuff.
You can find out the effects of drugs 

374
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,200
and diseases that come out in their 
sewage from cities like Vancouver.

375
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,710
And then if you go down towards,
um,

376
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,893
uh,
the southern part of what's now called 

377
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:36,534
the sailor's sea puget sound where 
they've been building naval ships and 

378
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,310
you can find all that heavy metal issues
and so forth.

379
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,511
So,
you know,

380
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:42,344
I get a feeling for things.
So there was a network that he was 

381
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:45,980
involved with,
um,

382
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,093
and they've all lost their job.
We don't seem to want that information 

383
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,990
anymore.
So,

384
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:51,843
uh,
are we getting the right kind of 

385
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:54,800
information on the health of the oceans?
And I would submit if,

386
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,270
if we don't have people like Peter Ross,
um,

387
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,860
then it's quite difficult to get that 
information.

388
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,420
I should also add,
it's a hilarious working with him.

389
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,633
He goes,
I'd wearing a hockey helmet because 

390
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,173
there's two ways that you get the seals 
and you don't really want to be the 

391
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:11,610
seal.
The seal is going to live,

392
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,444
but it's going to have a few scars after
he's been visited or she from Peter 

393
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,230
Ross.
So the,

394
00:20:18,231 --> 00:20:19,064
the one way he likes to do it,
as you quietly go up in your boat and 

395
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:22,854
you,
uh,

396
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,110
put on your hockey helmet and then you 
run like hell into the water and uh,

397
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,093
under the shore and grabbed the seal,
they have to be of a certain size and 

398
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:31,964
they're standardized.

399
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,173
Uh,
if you're lucky you don't got your head 

400
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:36,560
on the rocks,
slippery rocks with lots of LG.

401
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,990
The other way in which he doesn't want 
to do it,

402
00:20:38,991 --> 00:20:39,824
but it also works is that a,
the seal school in the water and then 

403
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,060
you,
uh,

404
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,970
he's got a thin nylon net out set out 
and the seals go into the nab,

405
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,760
their startle and,
and he tries to get the,

406
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,833
uh,
one or two sales and make sure that no 

407
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:55,174
others are in there and you get about 
five minutes before the steels that are 

408
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,080
struggling and maybe withdrawn.
So,

409
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,213
but he has been very,
very good scientist and it pains me 

410
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:03,580
greatly.
He'll do fine.

411
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,950
Whether that network can continue its 
work properly is beyond me.

412
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:11,344
I don't see how it can,
health is also about people in 

413
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,910
communities.
Um,

414
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,950
if you live on the west coast or on the 
east coast,

415
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,790
this is a prime thing that people feel 
the loss,

416
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:25,750
they feel the loss of livelihood,
the loss of integrity,

417
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:26,584
of work,
that they felt important over the years 

418
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:31,180
as fishermen or various other ocean 
related,

419
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,014
uh,
uh,

420
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,003
activities.

421
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,083
And whether it's in Prince Rupert,
in northern British Columbia or whether 

422
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,420
it's,
uh,

423
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,370
in communities in the south shore of a 
newfoundland or Nova Scotia.

424
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,900
Um,
this is this very serious issue and it's

425
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:51,610
one that we don't seem to do as good a 
job in Canada as places like Norway,

426
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,760
uh,
and maybe Australia and handling.

427
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,010
Um,
and we can come back to that point,

428
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,473
a new line,
new livelihoods and merge Lunenburg a 

429
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,160
school of sailing school.
That beautiful schooner,

430
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,080
um,
sea kayaking,

431
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,440
a summer thing we'll watching.
Um,

432
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,650
and interestingly if you were into music
folk festivals and the the folk festival

433
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:15,354
and part of it is held right on the uh,
on the seashore and boats come and go 

434
00:22:18,521 --> 00:22:21,040
like this beautiful big one in the 
background in middle of the picture,

435
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,320
but this also calamity in the oceans and
calamity takes many forms.

436
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,230
Um,
the cyclone Nargis for example,

437
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,830
uh,
in,

438
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:34,830
in Burma where over almost 140,000
people were killed by terrible Maldives.

439
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,690
The prime spokes country for climate 
change,

440
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,180
melt ice basically disappear with sea 
level rise in that given amount of time.

441
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,373
And,
and then there's the insidious kinds of 

442
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:53,470
things like ocean acidification,
and I won't go through this slide,

443
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:58,180
but just to say that oceans and climate 
change are intimately related,

444
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,570
but don't get nearly as much attention 
as the atmospheric side of things.

445
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,563
I happen to think that on both the 
mitigation side and just the general 

446
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:10,174
scientific knowledge base,
that the oceans are basically still 

447
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:16,180
largely ignored compared to their 
significance.

448
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,303
Then we go on to things,
and this is an area that I'm very 

449
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:22,810
familiar with and this brings me to 
tears sometimes.

450
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,410
There's an area of the world called the 
Coral Triangle,

451
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,590
Indonesia,
Philippines,

452
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,300
parts of Malaysia and parts of Papua New
Guinea area.

453
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,240
And,
and this is the leading center for ocean

454
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,470
biodiversity in the world.

455
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,813
It's the thing that drove me first to 
live in Indonesia was the fact that I 

456
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:47,480
was working in the Caribbean on 
something for my master's thesis.

457
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,990
And I realized that for every species of
this little crab that I was looking at,

458
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,420
there was a six or seven species and the
coral triangle area,

459
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,883
if you go to that area,
that reefs are being destroyed at an 

460
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:04,160
incredible rate.
Partly it's stupidity,

461
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,030
it's greed,
it's market demand for certain things.

462
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,270
I could go on Fisher poisoned so he can 
get maybe a 10th of them for aquarium,

463
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:14,961
fish,
salt water,

464
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:17,360
aquarium,
fish that's coming under control a bit.

465
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,973
People go off and risk their lives to 
have in the last decades risk their 

466
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:26,930
lives to go into old munitions dump,
uh,

467
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,610
dumps in,
uh,

468
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,200
west Papuan in Papua New Guinea to,
to uh,

469
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,133
take the explosives to take them out of 
the shells and then go back and blow up 

470
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:37,064
reese with them.

471
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,610
And I've seen these raves in some cases,
small islands for example,

472
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:43,870
in South Sulawesi where,
where the,

473
00:24:43,871 --> 00:24:44,704
the very lives of people depend on the 
integrity of the reef because they 

474
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:50,600
protect the small islands around where 
people live.

475
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,973
And still people will come in from 
outside and blow off the reefs just to 

476
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:55,760
get the fish done,
the fish,

477
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:58,040
take the fish goodbye,
go to another reef.

478
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,280
And the damage that's rigged and that 
process is,

479
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,123
is quite incredible.
We'll come back to the coral triangle 

480
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,490
because the countries now recognize 
that,

481
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,563
that it's urgent.
That is a crisis situation and they're 

482
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:13,190
trying their best to do a number of 
things.

483
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:17,120
One of the,
one of the important points is that they

484
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,940
talk about a blue carbon budget.
In other words,

485
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,760
the reefs,
if they're properly managed and not will

486
00:25:22,761 --> 00:25:27,650
extract a great deal of a greenhouse 
gases as a consequence of the reef being

487
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,330
there and more or less do it 
permanently.

488
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,380
So there's always good news and there's 
lots of bad news,

489
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,770
West Africa,
uh,

490
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,930
the fishing the,
the term,

491
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,213
which I don't really like,
but it's a illegal unreported and it's 

492
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:46,580
unsustainable as well.
But,

493
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:47,414
uh,
fishing.

494
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,543
Um,
and this is one of the prime areas that 

495
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,730
is um,
um,

496
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,640
bringing people in from the surrounding 
countries and taking fish,

497
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,830
cod,
taking fishing illegally.

498
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,570
And then these fish will be transported 
office as a Korean vessel on the bottom.

499
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,920
So it will be transported to Korea I've 
possibly through Europe,

500
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,710
uh,
and,

501
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,730
and some sold in theU as well on the 
bottom.

502
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,591
Uh,
it's a,

503
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:12,424
a mothership with a illegal trawlers 
that are out there and there's now 

504
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,670
spotting mechanisms where the local 
populations,

505
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:23,420
because as was already said,
people now have access to equipment like

506
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,254
this waterproof cameras and this,
that and the other access to the 

507
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:29,660
internet to know exactly which chip it 
is.

508
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,503
It's a fishing and people that go out in
their canoes and take pictures and then 

509
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:34,964
report that.
So this was one of the interesting 

510
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:39,350
things that technology can be very 
helpful in this process.

511
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:40,963
And then finally I'm going to talk quite
a bit this evening about the Arctic 

512
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,420
changing environment and development 
pressures.

513
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:49,110
These are some photos I wish I had been 
in a nice position to be able to fake.

514
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,960
These are taken by department of 
fisheries and oceans staff,

515
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,363
but in our whales and um,
belugas coming up in the little areas 

516
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,910
that are open in the Arctic.
Well,

517
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,090
we know there's going to be lots more 
areas open in the future,

518
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,550
but we don't know what the fate of these
animals will be.

519
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,480
Now,
I did this diagram to try and understand

520
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,990
the overall governance of ocean use.
Um,

521
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:13,824
and I know a lot about that mainly 
because I've worked with some very 

522
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:17,700
interesting layers and others,
uh,

523
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:21,300
people involved with fisheries 
management and [inaudible] management.

524
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,830
And don't worry about all the details I 
find I did this diagram,

525
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,720
but the year 2000 hasn't really changed 
much except that now there's a,

526
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,810
not just the 1992 Rio,
but as was pointed out,

527
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:36,270
we're up to 2012,
Rio plus 20.

528
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,350
Um,
and the,

529
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:39,184
the important point here is that 
whatever we do with the oceans now 

530
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,413
doesn't just involve Canada,
doesn't just involve a province in 

531
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,950
Canada.
It involves international management,

532
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,000
the use of global consensus documents 
like the law of the sea.

533
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,860
It involves trade in an investment,
a activities of various sorts.

534
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:02,670
And I'm going to talk about some of 
these national and local interests,

535
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:07,050
which are often very vested interest and
not in the best interest of the ocean,

536
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,003
but sometimes they are and they're not 
listened to and the generation of 

537
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,010
knowledge,
uh,

538
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,370
which comes not just as knowledge from 
scientists,

539
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,204
but it comes from people that have a 
flame in their belly like we heard in 

540
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:22,260
our last talk and,
uh,

541
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,320
people that are in native communities,
first nations community groups,

542
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:30,270
and many,
many other interests.

543
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,270
So knowledge now is drawn from many 
places.

544
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,790
How do we put that knowledge together?
And so we have things like a very,

545
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,933
very,
very good thing called the global ocean 

546
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,870
forum.
But don't have time to go into the AE,

547
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,063
but I suggest you take a look at it.
And this has become kind of a pressure 

548
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:50,700
group at the international level.
And you can see,

549
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:52,070
don't worry about all of them,
but,

550
00:28:52,071 --> 00:28:54,300
uh,
there's a lot of different areas and all

551
00:28:54,301 --> 00:28:55,134
of these areas relate back to the 
fundamentals of Aquatic Resource 

552
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,683
Management,
fisheries.

553
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,060
There's also a new,
uh,

554
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:03,894
yet another I hasten to add and I don't 
know what they're going to be able to 

555
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,334
do.
A global ocean commission that's been 

556
00:29:09,991 --> 00:29:13,890
established launched just a few weeks 
ago with a focus on the high seas.

557
00:29:13,891 --> 00:29:16,150
Those areas of the deep blue that,
uh,

558
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,590
Jordan correctly pointed out are not 
necessarily all the productive areas,

559
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:23,850
but they do play a major role still in 
our use of the oceans.

560
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,880
And one of the big questions is what,
who should,

561
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,640
how should high seas,
uh,

562
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,180
marine protected areas be set up and how
should they be managed?

563
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,660
Because all those neat things like fin 
tuna,

564
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,063
that goal in a big circle around from 
the Gulf of Mexico up to east coast of 

565
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:42,454
Canada,
across the West Africa and then across 

566
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:46,630
it here.
And if they face a gauntlet of fisheries

567
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:47,464
boats,
a tremendous number of each of those 

568
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,104
fishes worth $50,000.
One or two of those fish means the 

569
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,250
difference for Canadian fishermen 
between a good year and a bad year.

570
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,400
Uh,
and so the incentive to keep fee to have

571
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:01,234
sustainability of the harvest,
but there's also Japanese in the high 

572
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,280
seas and those people in the 
Mediterranean side,

573
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,420
et Cetera.
And there's a lot of,

574
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,850
some illegal fishing.
So anyways,

575
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:13,030
Paul Martin's a Canadian number of this 
and I wish him luck,

576
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,193
but we frankly have had lots of very 
good advice from global ocean 

577
00:30:19,121 --> 00:30:23,230
commissions and we haven't seen the 
uptake of that advice nearly as strongly

578
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,064
as we should.

579
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,250
And that's a troubling,
uh,

580
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,270
matter.
So I'm entitled the,

581
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:29,230
uh,
Talk,

582
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,480
uh,
not just for the taking.

583
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,250
And I really mean that the oceans are 
not just there for us to take.

584
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,130
We have to give,
we have to give a lot.

585
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:43,960
You have to give our best to make the 
uses of the ocean sustainable.

586
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,273
We have to understand that other 
creatures on this planet have a strong 

587
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,170
rationale for being included in the list
of voters of the ocean and the people,

588
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,450
the creatures that have some take on 
that,

589
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,050
a massive set of resources up there.
So,

590
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:02,884
but for us,
we at least can talk back and forth as 

591
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,670
humans to each other.
Uh,

592
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:07,660
and,
uh,

593
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,733
we have to devise what I'd call a 
responsible care approach for 

594
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,593
candidates.
And so I'm going to go through some of 

595
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,713
what I consider the elements of that to 
be including some of the things that 

596
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:19,780
directly relate to fisheries.

597
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,720
First question.
And this comes from,

598
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,800
uh,
John Fraser,

599
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:28,750
who I think a lot of former minister of 
fisheries and oceans candidate who lives

600
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,820
in the west coast.
And he talks,

601
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,043
um,
as a person who is totally and 

602
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:38,890
absolutely committed to the health and 
the wellbeing of the oceans and says,

603
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,460
who speaks for the oceans and what are 
they doing about it?

604
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,190
And I think that for your group,
Finn,

605
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,263
you should ask that question.
You should be one of the groups that 

606
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:51,820
speaking for the oceans,
but what are you going to do about it?

607
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,060
What is it that you can do to make a 
difference?

608
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,150
And that question should be first and 
foremost in your mind.

609
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,250
Here's a couple of Canadian authors do 
add to the very good list.

610
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,950
Uh,
and that was a short list by the way,

611
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:06,370
that,
uh,

612
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,203
Jordan,
uh,

613
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,860
mentioned there.
There's lots of others,

614
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,960
but the book's Seasick,
uh,

615
00:32:10,961 --> 00:32:13,930
written by Ilana Mitchell,
former global mail writer.

616
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,650
She put a couple of years of her life 
into writing this book and it's very,

617
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,410
very good and it's been highly 
acclaimed.

618
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:21,820
In fact,
uh,

619
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,713
and it's based on science,
but she's not a scientist first and say 

620
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:27,014
that she's a journalist trying to 
explain things about the oceans and you 

621
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,470
can see from our title of what her 
conclusion is.

622
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,340
Uh,
Farley Mowat,

623
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,660
who's often a controversial figure,
but his book,

624
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:38,494
Sea of slaughter.
We'll go more detail about the things 

625
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,354
that Jordan was talking about,
about this unending slaughter of 

626
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:47,530
creatures from the ocean over the last 
500 years in Canada.

627
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,033
Um,
I once showed a film about sea of 

628
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:54,700
slaughter at Dalhousie University and 
the graduate students that,

629
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:55,534
uh,
asked me to stop it in the middle and 

630
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:57,464
they said,
we can't take anymore if this is what 

631
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:02,600
the situation is.
Why are you spending your time on this?

632
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,150
Why don't you just give up and try and 
do something simpler?

633
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,060
That's enough the way I'm constructed,
I guess.

634
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,690
But the point is,
it's not pleasant greeting,

635
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:15,050
but it's a reality check about what we 
have done in the past.

636
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:19,580
And I'd also like to pay tribute to some
people who,

637
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,930
uh,
you know,

638
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,793
Canada as a nation has produced some of 
the best fisheries and ocean scientists 

639
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:26,544
in the world at one point in time.
We were probably with along with a few 

640
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,040
European countries,
um,

641
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,133
having the best scientific journals and 
so forth and paying the most attention 

642
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:41,210
in terms of free access to the 
information and,

643
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,180
and good research codes of ethics and 
funding in,

644
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,370
in the ocean sciences.
And,

645
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:49,204
and uh,
I've only put three names up here of 

646
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:55,310
people who are involved as an ocean 
studies or ocean science,

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,593
uh,
people that have regrettably passed 

648
00:33:57,981 --> 00:33:59,180
away.
I,

649
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,550
if they were still alive and there's 
many,

650
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:04,070
many of my colleagues that I could put 
up here,

651
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,880
I'd be hard pressed to choose which 
ones.

652
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,020
But let me just give you this very brief
profile of these people ran,

653
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:16,010
ran myers ransom,
Myers worked for the government and left

654
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:18,230
the government wanting to be more 
independent,

655
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,363
became a leading.
I'm a professor at Dalhousie University 

656
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:28,990
and got a great following from the 
world's press because he told it like it

657
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:31,364
was using his accurate scientific 
approaches as best he could about the 

658
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:37,454
state of fisheries in various parts of 
the world and including those in the 

659
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:44,330
east coast of Canada.
Elizabeth Matador,

660
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:45,243
Gazer who many people worship around the
world and she is the daughter of Thomas 

661
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,823
Mann,
the great author and a wonderful person 

662
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,690
who gave herself over completely to the 
oceans,

663
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,553
also at Dalhousie University,
but head at the International Oceans 

664
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,483
Institute and trained and got the money 
to train by hounding people like Bureau 

665
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,640
Trudeau and others in Canada saying,
please give me money.

666
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:09,290
And then using that money to get more 
money.

667
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,513
And so thousands of people now have been
trained in understanding the 

668
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:16,370
complexities of oceans because of her 
work.

669
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,410
She was also a great author,
uh,

670
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,190
on the oceans as well.
And the third person who died recently,

671
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,400
who I had the good fortune to work with,
who is a psychologist.

672
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,400
So not all is lost for you in this 
field.

673
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,350
He sorted out how to,
um,

674
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,120
reduce the damage from the interaction 
between fishermen and Wales and,

675
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:37,963
and,
uh,

676
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,430
Newfoundland that was his first claim to
fame.

677
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,293
Many more things since then.
But he learned how using basic 

678
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,524
behavioral things that involve both the 
behavior of the whales and the behavior 

679
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,140
of the fishermen,
so that when whales got,

680
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,003
which is very frequent,
which when whales got caught in the 

681
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,180
fisherman's traps,
we called traps.

682
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:58,620
Um,
the,

683
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,330
um,
and these are big whales,

684
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
really big whales.
And,

685
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,140
and everybody got upset at the Wales,
got upset enough from,

686
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:04,974
died fishermen put themselves in danger 
but lost a great deal of money and who 

687
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,390
wants to kill a whale?

688
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,523
So anyways,
he worked that out and had teams that 

689
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,520
could actually go out and do it.
So,

690
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,380
uh,
but he did many more things.

691
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,410
Um,
and,

692
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,323
and these are people who made a 
substantial contribution in their 

693
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:26,301
lifetimes and serve as an inspiration 
for me and for many others.

694
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,890
Um,
getting down,

695
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,753
and again,
I'm just suggesting maybe if you're 

696
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,813
serious about wanting to understand what
we should be asking as research 

697
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,134
questions,
here's what some of the nation 

698
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,350
scientists in Canada and are talking 
about,

699
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:46,200
and they bring,
they bring in these four areas.

700
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,483
Yes,
bray improve the fundamental scientific 

701
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:49,764
understanding,
but we've got to have the information 

702
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:52,284
about monitoring and how you use that 
information and you have to look at 

703
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,650
really understanding the impacts of 
human activities.

704
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,843
And then you've got to bring this 
information back into governance and 

705
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:02,634
management.
So it isn't just about managing a 

706
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,870
specific fish stock.

707
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:10,890
We've gone beyond that now because when 
you try and do it,

708
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,450
we find often it's almost impossible 
because there's big questions that,

709
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,810
that are ignored in that approach.
Um,

710
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,820
this is a rather interesting,
uh,

711
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,720
new,
uh,

712
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,310
and document this just come out,
but it gets to the,

713
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,110
what I'm going to try and say in some of
the things tonight.

714
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,280
Then there's other people that,
so there's this,

715
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,310
the scientific community speaks.
Then there's all these folks,

716
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,293
um,
uh,

717
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,030
see pause.
Canadian parks and wilderness society.

718
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,820
The Vancouver aquarium is a great place.
Uh,

719
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:43,710
ecology action center,
Nova Scotia,

720
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:45,630
the living ocean society in the west 
coast,

721
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,553
wwf,
that major programs that relate back to 

722
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:49,680
this.
And,

723
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,030
and I would really,
really strongly underlying first nations

724
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,900
and all three coast of Canada for coast,
if we include the maritimes,

725
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,113
we include the Great Lakes.
They have an incredibly important role 

726
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:06,690
because they have constitutional rights 
that relate back to the oceans.

727
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,363
So we have this opportunity,
we've got the longest coastline in the 

728
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:15,690
world and our maritime estate people 
don't often recognize is about,

729
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,610
uh,
depending on how you count it,

730
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,060
but it could be as high as 70% of the 
land area.

731
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,660
So that's,
that's an important figure to remember.

732
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,570
And then we have this,
uh,

733
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,653
purple exclusive economic zone,
which from 1977 onwards has been the 

734
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:33,984
opportunity side for Canada has been as 
if we only had our hands on the 

735
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,404
management of that.
And now we haven't had it for since 

736
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:42,520
1977.
We could do much better,

737
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,940
get much more value from our use of the 
ocean.

738
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,220
Uh,
we could make it much more sustainable.

739
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,830
Reality is sometimes been a little 
different now.

740
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,713
Uh,
if you'll allow me a little bit of a 

741
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:55,600
West Coast Navitas,
um,

742
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,550
from coast to coast to coast to coast.
So we started in Vancouver,

743
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:03,780
but the one I like here is just near my 
home in Oak Bay,

744
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,340
Victoria,
um,

745
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,250
boxing day.

746
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,380
And you think of boxing day sales while 
the people in and uh,

747
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,410
and uh,
Oak Bay,

748
00:39:13,411 --> 00:39:14,244
think of sailing in a different sort of 
way of boxing day and they are out and 

749
00:39:17,711 --> 00:39:21,160
the water in their wetsuits and their 
boats with my baker in the background.

750
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,910
But here's another amazing thing.
The western Arctic,

751
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,153
um,
that ice highway goes 40 kilometers and 

752
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,863
it comes up from the new vick.
You've traveled all along the Mackenzie 

753
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,103
River,
and then you'd go to little hamlet of 

754
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,323
Tuktoyaktuk,
which is important strategically for a 

755
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,024
number of reasons.
And the last 40 kilometers you're 

756
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:44,470
actually traveling on the Arctic Ocean,
the frozen ocean.

757
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,783
So they've just announced this week that
they are going to put in an all season 

758
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:52,810
road,
which will be $300 million.

759
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,883
And of course,
one of the reasons for that is simply 

760
00:39:55,991 --> 00:39:58,960
that they won't be able to use ice 
highways up there much longer.

761
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,110
This becomes a seasoned becomes too 
short and tenuous.

762
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,693
Um,
and this was one of a person that I did 

763
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,590
a lot of mentoring with Janell Kennedy,
uh,

764
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,890
on the eastern Arctic where of course 
this is a primary or for what's going to

765
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:18,010
happen in the future with icebergs and 
so forth.

766
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,363
Um,
but also one of the most interesting 

767
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:21,424
areas,
um,

768
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,080
because we don't know very much about 
the continental shelf and that area.

769
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:31,140
Some people say it's better known on the
surface of the moon than it is on the,

770
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:34,560
along the bottom of that area.
Um,

771
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,793
people are already looking at it though,
for oil and gas exploitation for 

772
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:42,340
shipping purposes.
And they're also looking for,

773
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:46,720
I'm a fisheries surprising how many 
things are happening in the Arctic right

774
00:40:46,721 --> 00:40:49,420
now where people want to go up and test 
fish and the east coast.

775
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:51,670
It's for things like cod and the west 
coast.

776
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:52,683
There's already salmon moving around 
into all of this at Pacific salmon are 

777
00:40:56,951 --> 00:41:01,570
now found in some Arctic rivers to the 
other coast.

778
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,393
Gander.
I was in a narrow small airplane with 

779
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,420
John Lean,
the person they will,

780
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,210
men Gander and Fogo island,
uh,

781
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,900
all covered in ice at that point.
And then to a place where,

782
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,480
uh,
I really enjoy being,

783
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,920
which is Lunenberg Nova Scotia,
one of the great shipping,

784
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,020
a wooden ship building and so forth,
uh,

785
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,170
basis.
And it happened to be there the day they

786
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:30,460
were relaunching the bluenose to um,
almost newly built.

787
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,350
And it's kind of interesting if you look
along that shoreline,

788
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:35,720
there is the sea shepherd,
you would know the sea shepherd,

789
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:38,660
Paul Watson's both,
which has been pounded by Canada,

790
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,250
um,
for,

791
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,410
for reasons that I won't explain it 
right now.

792
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,760
And then you can see these other large 
boats.

793
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,673
Um,
and you can see the dartmouth ferry and 

794
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:49,640
the small naval vessel and dry dock 
there as well.

795
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:50,983
It really is an active little spot,
but don't forget that the oceans 

796
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,370
influence extends to uh,
Ontario,

797
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,473
not only directly through the New 
Orleans region and particularly 

798
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,670
therefore for Quebec,
but also the water comes out of Ontario,

799
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:09,290
the quality of the water and so forth.

800
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,523
Uh,
creatures from the ocean come up into 

801
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,840
the Great Lakes,
uh,

802
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,303
including those El wives and some other 
little things that are really nasty and 

803
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:23,270
cost us billions of dollars in 
management of these species.

804
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:24,643
But,
uh,

805
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:25,903
uh,
it's also officially considered in 

806
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:28,724
Canada that these are inland seas that 
deserve to fall under the purview of 

807
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:34,004
fisheries and oceans for some things.
And then we think of the Gulf of Saint 

808
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:38,023
Lawrence.
Now,

809
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,873
uh,
it's a very interesting body of water 

810
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,143
there,
but what I'd like you to look at is 

811
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:45,740
those little circles and then I'm going 
to show you some more circles.

812
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,053
Um,
one of the most interesting things for 

813
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:52,280
me,
I've tried to simplify my understanding,

814
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,143
a very complex oceanography is to look 
at the things that go round and round 

815
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,120
and dryers and circles of one sort or 
another.

816
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:00,263
The simple example is when you go see 
kayaking and you're out there straining 

817
00:43:02,931 --> 00:43:06,020
against the current and so forth,
maybe the tides against it and there's a

818
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:08,000
strong current and maybe a wind blowing 
against you.

819
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,433
So you go in and shore and then you find
a countercurrent and then you're just 

820
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,323
swept along because that countercurrent 
is going this way while the main 

821
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:17,804
currents going that way.
So you get a free ride instead of being 

822
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:23,240
out at.
So lots of other things get free rides.

823
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:24,074
So if you look at what's called the 
Haida Eddie here and see these little 

824
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,870
swirls out in the going out into the 
ocean there,

825
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,183
well they're driven by the fresh water,
which is all that red stuff coming down 

826
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:36,230
from the rivers,
like the Skeena river and some others.

827
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:37,860
And,
and um,

828
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:38,893
those swirls are,
are driven by the current patterns of 

829
00:43:42,051 --> 00:43:42,884
the ocean and they go out and they 
transport all the larvae from the 

830
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:50,150
insurer and the nutrients out to the 
offshore.

831
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,180
So you talked to Jordan about the,
the Simone's and one of these.

832
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,520
Now Boys,
Sema is just out there,

833
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,740
up near the top end of it.

834
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,750
Uh,
uh,

835
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,530
that second set of swirls off there.
And,

836
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,220
and uh,
um,

837
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:06,163
that's how it gets all the fish that,
that are out there that make it very 

838
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,830
special and why it's a high productivity
area.

839
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,143
Another one is in the beaufort gyre up 
in the Arctic and that's a collection 

840
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:21,500
point for the whales in the Arctic and 
some of the,

841
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:23,570
uh,
fish species as well because of the high

842
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:26,240
productivity,
same when the Gulf stream.

843
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,750
And here's a good example of how little 
we understand.

844
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:31,183
For a long time the oceanographers 
didn't understand that there were these 

845
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:36,810
dryers and,
and that area of the Gulf stream.

846
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:39,990
So the Gulf stream is going off,
coming up the coast of the United States

847
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:40,824
and heading off to Europe.
And then there's all these counter 

848
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,104
currents that are swirling around just 
like the ones I'd be looking for on a 

849
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,230
kayak.

850
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,063
And then they're warm water,
they're drinking warm water in off the 

851
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:51,270
ocean.
So if these,

852
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,203
um,
countercurrent is happened to be in 

853
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:59,451
place just at the time that the scallops
which are down on the Georges Bank shelf

854
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,620
are spawning,
then the little creatures coming up,

855
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,920
it gets swept away by the warm water 
cause they're cold water creatures and,

856
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,930
and uh,
you don't get a good spa in that year.

857
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,930
So if you're going to try and understand
the management of things,

858
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,660
you have to understand phenomena like 
the,

859
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:18,840
uh,
the gyrus and the eddies and the oceans.

860
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,620
And this is my first introduction here.
If things,

861
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,300
ecological,
physical,

862
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:25,134
ecological phenomena that that won't 
come out through an examination of 

863
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:33,180
studying fishing pressure cause their 
environmental and focus.

864
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,490
And there's lots of those kinds of 
things in the oceans.

865
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,690
So this is led to great tusks.
You can't believe,

866
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,850
it's just like among economists,
they,

867
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:42,860
you know,
it,

868
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,890
what's the saying that if you get a 
three economists in the room,

869
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,060
you'll get four opinions,
you know,

870
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:48,894
or something like that.

871
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,480
And it was the same is true with a 
fisheries biologist.

872
00:45:51,481 --> 00:45:55,230
I've actually sat in the office of an 
ecological,

873
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,860
uh,
ocean scientist in British Columbia.

874
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,230
I just happened to be there when he was,
uh,

875
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,360
uh,
this is after the cod disaster.

876
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,523
And he had just published a,
an article with some others in science 

877
00:46:07,861 --> 00:46:08,694
magazine,
very highly respected Journal saying 

878
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:11,424
that the fisheries management people 
basically didn't understand what they 

879
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:15,100
were doing.
A,

880
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,330
which I agreed with him by the way.
And we were talking about that the phone

881
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:19,164
rings just at that moment from a fishery
scientist who I won't give the name of 

882
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:23,214
an eastern Canada,
but who worked for government and who 

883
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:25,764
was threatening to sue him for 
defamation of character because they 

884
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:30,990
had,
they were at odds,

885
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,173
uh,
they were analyzing the same problem 

886
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,053
from entirely different points of view.
And particularly when I lived in Nova 

887
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:39,894
Scotia,
I could give you endless stories of 

888
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:41,940
this.

889
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,070
And,
and they,

890
00:46:43,071 --> 00:46:44,120
they were,
uh,

891
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,053
in one case,
there was a whole very large ecosystem 

892
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:47,994
group and they were shut down.
They were shut down by the higher ups 

893
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,243
because they were producing data that 
were at odds with what the population 

894
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:57,534
dynamics people were producing.
I'm giving a simplified version of 

895
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:00,770
things,
but,

896
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,490
so the point is,
um,

897
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:03,493
and I used to say this,
the students when I was teaching a 

898
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,170
fisheries things,
and,

899
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:08,040
uh,
in a Nova Scotia,

900
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,350
don't trust the experts,
you know,

901
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,184
form your own opinions.
The experts are often very wrong and 

902
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:17,040
they wear blinders just like everybody 
else in society.

903
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,640
And one of the biggest ones is about 
fisheries management.

904
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:22,043
Same could be said at times in the past 
for forest management with fisheries 

905
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,930
management is inherently even more 
complex.

906
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:31,270
At least trees stand in line and can be 
counted.

907
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,340
Rarely is that the case with fish.

908
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,210
Um,
because of water kearns money,

909
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,840
other things.
So here's,

910
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:40,480
here's just a little,
a collection of books,

911
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:44,800
a Nikah triple that collection about 
these different points of view.

912
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,790
And I won't go into details now,
and this is a side story here.

913
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,160
Um,
this is in Lunenberg Nova Scotia.

914
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,440
And how many have ever been to 
Lunanburg?

915
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,200
How many have ever been to Nova Scotia?
Great,

916
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:56,920
great.
Well,

917
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,350
if you go down to the Lunanburg,
you'll see that it's very moving,

918
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,850
very,
very moving.

919
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,080
Uh,
um,

920
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:03,610
uh,
set of,

921
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,443
uh,
what would you call these obelisks 

922
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:07,480
maybe,
I guess,

923
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:13,110
and they list as much as possible the 
names of people who were killed at sea.

924
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:17,560
In some cases there might be,
they don't have all the names because it

925
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:21,290
would be 50 or 100 people were killed in
1927.

926
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,870
Again,
while we were living there,

927
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:26,260
there was a terrible incident,
but these are just people from Lunenburg

928
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:30,560
area cause this was the grand banks 
fisheries and um,

929
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:31,840
and it's very moving to see it.

930
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,800
But the point is,
uh,

931
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:34,803
we remember a lot about our ocean passed
and we even tend to glorify it or feel 

932
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:41,920
sad about it or whatever.
But what have we actually learned,

933
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:42,843
you know,
and there's a just a little window 

934
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:45,394
dressing.
There is couple of postage stamps to 

935
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:50,320
remind us about the glorious past.
And that's the,

936
00:48:50,321 --> 00:48:52,430
I'm a fellow on the right.
Uh,

937
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,050
Angus Walters was a very famous captain 
of the fastest of the,

938
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:57,010
uh,
of the ships,

939
00:48:57,011 --> 00:49:01,210
the bluenose Newfoundland.
That's that abundant cod population.

940
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,840
But the interesting thing is the man 
that told us early on stuff let is still

941
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:10,100
being quoted,
is Harold in this,

942
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:11,680
uh,
from the University of Toronto,

943
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:13,383
who was an economist who dealt with this
idea of heartland and hinterland in 

944
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:20,500
Canada.
And the fact that we were hewers of wood

945
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:23,470
drawers of water for traders,
but also,

946
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,353
uh,
we dipped into the emotion and he wrote 

947
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,120
this,
what happens when you get a really,

948
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,190
truly abundant resource like the cod 
fishery?

949
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:35,023
So that's,
uh,

950
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,100
that's his book written in 1940,
very prescient.

951
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,780
And basically he's saying as a,
uh,

952
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,990
an abundant tradable resource can fuel 
and economy,

953
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,920
but it also traps you in many ways.
And,

954
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:52,900
and that is what has happened in Canada 
in a sense.

955
00:49:52,901 --> 00:49:53,734
We've,
we've relied on super abundant natural 

956
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:57,160
resources,
not just fish,

957
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,760
but,
but it,

958
00:49:58,761 --> 00:49:59,594
it allows us,
I thought a lot about this over the 

959
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,043
years,
trying to understand why we behave 

960
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,500
towards the resources we do.
Like for example,

961
00:50:05,501 --> 00:50:07,720
with a cod,
when we lived in Nova Scotia,

962
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,580
you know,
he'd go in and buy this fish.

963
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,790
There was awful,
uh,

964
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,740
in the stores.
You couldn't get good cod in the stores.

965
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,550
And the reason it wasn't good was 
because it was mishandled,

966
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,590
right from the time it was,
it wasn't nice,

967
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:25,120
it wasn't bled.
So you'd have a nice open flesh and uh,

968
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:25,973
it,
it was treated as if it was going off 

969
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,150
the care where else,
uh,

970
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,230
to be treated a salted cod,
you know,

971
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:31,610
low value commodity.

972
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,890
Uh,
some other people,

973
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:34,724
Icelanders,
Norwegians and some others didn't do 

974
00:50:36,201 --> 00:50:37,670
that.
They treated the fish property,

975
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,504
they got a very good value added and 
they started respecting the resource 

976
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:43,114
base even more.
So that's the important thing for those 

977
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:49,910
with an economic bent to recognize is 
that you can,

978
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,210
one of the,
one of the ways in which we can actually

979
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:56,600
get more out of our resource get is to 
add value to it,

980
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,350
handle it carefully,
respect each fish that we catch,

981
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:05,730
which gets again into why is it that we 
can go in and use trawlers and take that

982
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:08,600
small fraction of the fish.
But anyways,

983
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,460
a lot of this stuff goes back to harold 
in us.

984
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,060
And now the other thing is,
and I hear I differ a bit from what,

985
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,180
uh,
what was said about the,

986
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,510
the empty oceans.
Yes,

987
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,344
the oceans are empty because we've,
we've knocked out a lot of the food 

988
00:51:20,841 --> 00:51:23,480
chain,
but there still can be an abundance.

989
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,390
And as you correctly pointed out,
uh,

990
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,190
Jordan,
if you like eating a jellyfish,

991
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:29,024
which I actually,
I do there and I keep asking my Chinese 

992
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:35,060
colleagues,
uh,

993
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,073
well why is it that you eat a chicken 
feed or certain other things with some 

994
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:41,900
of the certain other things?
Well,

995
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:43,490
it doesn't for the taste,
particularly,

996
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,810
it's for the crunch and crunch feller 
and jellyfishes one of those things.

997
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,150
And the same with Indonesians and 
others.

998
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,310
They liked the crunch and they're 
delicious.

999
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,383
Now they're dried in Newfoundland.
Newfoundland couldn't believe it's good 

1000
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:56,294
luck when they discovered the,
were actually people in the world that 

1001
00:51:57,891 --> 00:52:00,530
want to do eat jellyfish,
but uh,

1002
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:01,633
they,
so they started drying them and 

1003
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:04,130
exporting them into at least a little 
flat patties,

1004
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:04,964
you know.
But there's certain other things that I 

1005
00:52:06,801 --> 00:52:08,450
could mention as well.
And Squid.

1006
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,100
Uh,
of course it's one of them.

1007
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,400
And so what you find is a notion that 
gets,

1008
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:14,663
um,
very abundant in those creatures that 

1009
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,790
can be low on the food chain often and 
what we call it,

1010
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,030
the tritus food chains.
You know,

1011
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:22,940
the stuff that rains down into the water
column.

1012
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:27,890
So lots of fishermen are now happy to 
see no cod and Nova and a,

1013
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,720
well now I don't know about Nova Scotia 
so much,

1014
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:31,490
but certainly,
whoops,

1015
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,720
everything shut off of a,
I guess if you've got it still,

1016
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,573
you know,
you have,

1017
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,773
can I ask some technical help up here?
Like I've got nothing on my screen and 

1018
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:43,520
then really like seeing the screen.

1019
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:46,723
Oh,
it's okay.

1020
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,600
Okay.
Talk to her.

1021
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:48,483
It's just okay.
And then how do I get it to go back 

1022
00:52:51,561 --> 00:52:53,790
here?
Okay.

1023
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,120
So,
so we now have very,

1024
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:56,954
very valuable snow crowd in northern 
shrimp and basically the ecosystem has 

1025
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:04,490
changed.
Don't expect the car to come back unless

1026
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:07,790
something catastrophic happens to these 
guys because these are replaced,

1027
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:11,840
basically replaced the card.
We'll see card for sure.

1028
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:12,883
We'll see some other groundfish,
but we probably won't see them in the 

1029
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:16,880
abundance because these guys are eating.
And the food train now.

1030
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,620
So,
but,

1031
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,780
uh,
that's not necessarily a bad thing,

1032
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,063
you know,
that there's fewer card if you're asked 

1033
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:24,734
the fishermen.
A lot of them have made it a lot of 

1034
00:53:25,861 --> 00:53:27,810
money off.
These new species will say,

1035
00:53:27,811 --> 00:53:29,130
hey,
we're making more money,

1036
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:30,360
we've got better votes,
et Cetera.

1037
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,900
The question is,
and I've tried to look at this question,

1038
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:35,880
but some people,
the auditor general's office,

1039
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,823
uh,
some years ago and we concluded that 

1040
00:53:39,361 --> 00:53:40,194
there was no knowledge base to support 
the hypothesis that these actually were 

1041
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:46,140
being sustainably harvest and the new 
ones.

1042
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,400
In other words,
we might end up with the same problem,

1043
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:52,620
but let's go back again to what a,
another thing that was mentioned earlier

1044
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,530
and that is electronic gear and so 
forth.

1045
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,450
Well,
it's not exactly new,

1046
00:53:57,451 --> 00:54:00,180
but it's in this period from about 1970 
on,

1047
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,200
um,
and this man got a,

1048
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,880
an honorary doctorate from I think the 
University of New Brunswick.

1049
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,283
Um,
and this oddly enough was one of his 

1050
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:12,930
boats,
which I have in the sea and the dry dock

1051
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:14,580
in Lunenburg.
Um,

1052
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,511
and,
and,

1053
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:16,344
uh,
Captain Medford Matthews was a real 

1054
00:54:18,181 --> 00:54:20,640
innovator with gear.
And he brought in and saw,

1055
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:24,690
this wasn't the first trawler that came 
by any means into the region.

1056
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,501
Uh,
but it's,

1057
00:54:25,501 --> 00:54:27,540
it's kind of like the early brand of 
the,

1058
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,770
of the,
uh,

1059
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,180
trawlers that are of a modern type and 
well equipped with all the gear that can

1060
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:36,090
take a lot of fish soner things and 
other equipment.

1061
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,590
Well,
here's what they look like.

1062
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,433
No,
here's another one with a couple of 

1063
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:41,424
kayakers for scale.
And these things are essentially the 

1064
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:47,200
bulldozers of the sea.
They,

1065
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:49,530
they,
they do so much damage to the bottom.

1066
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,113
They rip things up and I think 
eventually probably will see these 

1067
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,200
things phased out for other types of 
gear.

1068
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:02,130
That's my hypothesis.
But in the interim,

1069
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,323
these are deadly machines for from the 
point of view of what they can hold for 

1070
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:06,894
fish.
It doesn't mean that they can't be made 

1071
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:14,430
to be useful contributors towards 
sustainability if they're held in check.

1072
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:15,803
But,
um,

1073
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,633
particularly when you get in these big 
vessels and then you'd get a facilities 

1074
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:25,830
on them or factory boats that can 
accompany them,

1075
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,113
that can take an immense amount and stay
at sea for long periods of time because 

1076
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:35,640
they can devastate a whole region of the
ocean very quickly.

1077
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,553
Now,
then we move to what happens to fish 

1078
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,840
after it gets caught.
Um,

1079
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,630
if you look at this plant at the top,
national seafoods,

1080
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:52,530
uh,
is the worlds one of the world's major,

1081
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:54,360
a fishing companies.
Uh,

1082
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,283
and one of the largest ones in candidate
this plant located in Lunanburg was the 

1083
00:55:59,071 --> 00:56:02,130
world's largest fish plant in the 1980s.
Now,

1084
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:05,430
my daughter Laura,
will quite well remember when we used to

1085
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:08,880
go down to the cottage some days we were
down in window of this,

1086
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:09,960
uh,
this,

1087
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:10,711
uh,
this,

1088
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:11,544
uh,
a plant and it was just a bad smell and 

1089
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:15,350
they were taking all the remains of 
making,

1090
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,910
cooking it to make it into fish meal and
selling it.

1091
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,200
But what does national seafood do now?
Um,

1092
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,130
white fleshed fish such as cod,
haddock,

1093
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,223
pollack,
and a bunch of others are kind of what 

1094
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,000
some people in the banking business 
would call fungible.

1095
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,600
I either all you can exchange them 
interchangeably.

1096
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,100
Uh,
they're white flash,

1097
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:39,934
we can make them a deficient chips.
You can even take something like 

1098
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:42,920
Tilapia,
uh,

1099
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,520
which is a freshwater fish and call it 
cod.

1100
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,580
And that happens sometimes illegally,
but it happens.

1101
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:49,953
So in today's market supply chain,
because China has become the most 

1102
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,080
efficient processor,
they get all this fish go into China and

1103
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:58,960
it goes through big ports like Rotterdam
where it gets all muddled up.

1104
00:56:58,961 --> 00:57:01,720
It could come from west Africa,
it could come from southern America,

1105
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:06,721
whatever gets turned into chunks of fish
that are partially processed there.

1106
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:09,903
Then it comes back to companies like the
one in Lunanburg where people squirt 

1107
00:57:14,741 --> 00:57:15,574
some nice things on top of it and maybe 
make it a little fancier and make it 

1108
00:57:17,921 --> 00:57:19,720
into a frozen dinner or something like 
that.

1109
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,973
Then it gets step made in Canada and 
then sent to the United States are 

1110
00:57:23,951 --> 00:57:26,050
consumed in Canada or maybe in Europe 
even.

1111
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:27,490
Uh,
so that's,

1112
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:28,324
that's a reality.
So if you were listening to the radio 

1113
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:30,934
and the last few weeks,
there's been a release of a report that 

1114
00:57:33,461 --> 00:57:38,461
estimates that something like 30% of 
this fish is actually mislabeled because

1115
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,904
once it gets to Rotterdam or wherever,
you don't know whether it's a card or 

1116
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:43,054
whatever it happens to be.
So market supply chains go through this 

1117
00:57:45,971 --> 00:57:46,804
complex thing and um,
it makes it very difficult for us to 

1118
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:51,334
know a,
whether we're really eating what we 

1119
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,510
think is caught or whatever else it 
might be.

1120
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:58,360
B,
whether it was caught sustainably,

1121
00:57:58,610 --> 00:57:59,443
uh,
or even whether it went through some 

1122
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,870
mission happen.
It's a,

1123
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,730
and it's a process that lowered the 
quality of the fish.

1124
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:09,790
So this has become a major,
major problem,

1125
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,630
uh,
in,

1126
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,463
in,
uh,

1127
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,590
ocean management and in management of 
the seafood chains,

1128
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,030
the sort of thing that you're talking 
about.

1129
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:19,690
If you want to be a good citizen and 
only eats sustainably produced fish.

1130
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:22,000
Fortunately,
there are solutions.

1131
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:23,443
Um,
but just to give you another example of 

1132
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:26,770
this,
uh,

1133
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:31,090
and this is an area where Australia was 
furious with us.

1134
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,830
See these,
this large fish,

1135
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:36,340
the Patagonian toothfish,
which some of you may have eaten us.

1136
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,440
How many people,
and I shouldn't ask the question,

1137
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:42,130
but if you want to raise your hand,
have you ever eaten Chilean Sea Bass?

1138
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:43,930
Okay,
well,

1139
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:44,763
Chilean sea bass is one of those fancy 
names that's given for something that's 

1140
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:48,934
actually a fish coming from Antarctica.
And for the most part unsustainably 

1141
00:58:53,201 --> 00:58:55,420
produced.
And at one point in time,

1142
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:57,640
this has been cleaned up quite a bit 
now,

1143
00:58:57,641 --> 00:59:01,150
but it was going from Antarctica,
uh,

1144
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:03,780
an pretty much an unregulated fishery.
Uh,

1145
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,900
even though the Australians were really 
making a pitch for it and,

1146
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,540
and then he would go to China,
it would be handled there,

1147
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,493
then it would come to Canada and then 
it'd be try and shipped to the United 

1148
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,520
States as Canadian fish.

1149
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,650
Australians weren't very happy about 
that.

1150
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:19,000
I can tell you.
Uh,

1151
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,200
but,
but again,

1152
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:21,034
this just illustrates things.
So one of the ways to get around us is 

1153
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:28,760
through all these various choices that 
you can make and people that help you to

1154
00:59:28,761 --> 00:59:29,594
make good choices.
It started with the Monterey Bay 

1155
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,580
aquarium and now the Vancouver aquarium 
is in their seafood watch.

1156
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:35,943
Uh,
the most critical thing is something 

1157
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:40,100
started by wwf and some others in the 
private sector,

1158
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,380
uh,
on the,

1159
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,130
what's called the Marine Stewardship 
Council,

1160
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,083
which is now certifying some,
some species of fish and interestingly 

1161
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:49,483
many chefs now in the world will refuse 
even in countries and places like Hong 

1162
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,440
Kong and some of the big hotels,
they will refuse to handle fish that are

1163
00:59:57,441 --> 00:59:58,274
not certified.
And this is a real step forward and I 

1164
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:04,430
could tell you some interesting stories,
but I'd better move on.

1165
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,443
So just go to a fish choice.com
and take a look at some of the things 

1166
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:12,020
that are on there or any of these 
individual websites.

1167
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,393
This is the future.
This is a future that responsible 

1168
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:20,090
seafood companies like national see,
see us,

1169
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:20,924
what they would be faced with.
All of us and countries like China are 

1170
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:26,210
now starting to recognize that they will
have to become involved.

1171
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,170
Then there are some of the really nasty 
things like a shark's fin.

1172
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,600
I took this picture in a Chinese 
restaurant.

1173
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,250
But the interesting thing there is,
um,

1174
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:38,570
[inaudible] the guy who was so,
so tall,

1175
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:39,404
and he reaches to this guy,
a basketball player from China and 

1176
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,233
respected,
highly respected within China and a 

1177
01:00:45,651 --> 01:00:46,484
person who doesn't just play basketball,
but he's very interested in public 

1178
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,260
policy issues.
And,

1179
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,780
and he came out and said,
I will not have my wife to be and I will

1180
01:00:57,351 --> 01:00:58,860
not have,
um,

1181
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,200
shark fin soup served as it's 
traditionally done at Chinese weddings.

1182
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,460
And I'm going to encourage all my fellow
basketball players in sports figures and

1183
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,990
so forth to do the same.

1184
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,380
He's probably had more impact than any 
other single thing of the scientists and

1185
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:15,524
others who bring their hands because 
China is a primary place now for shark 

1186
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:23,831
fin soup and where all those 70 million 
or more shark fins are going now.

1187
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:28,580
Little known facts,
I think the facts,

1188
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:30,223
but it's always interested me in Nova 
Scotia that there's been a sort of 

1189
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:35,150
fishery.
And if you go back far enough,

1190
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:35,984
there was a,
there was all sorts of books written by 

1191
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:39,200
people,
I think Zane gray type of books.

1192
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,473
Um,
very rich people used to go to Nova 

1193
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,950
Scotia and,
and catch them off as a sport fishery.

1194
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,400
But in the 1940s,
still even,

1195
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,121
uh,
there was,

1196
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:50,954
uh,
um,

1197
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,820
a harpoon sort fishery in glace bay up 
in Cape Breton Island,

1198
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:59,210
hundreds and hundreds of boats.
This is just one picture from the,

1199
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:01,610
um,
from the era.

1200
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:02,833
And they had these canoes that they went
out in and men would go out there with 

1201
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:09,230
Harpoon waiting to catch up 400 or more 
phone swordfish.

1202
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,920
The interesting point about it is it 
still exists,

1203
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,353
and one of the points right now is that 
the marine stewardship council has been 

1204
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:22,380
asked to certify harpooned fisheries in 
the United States and in Canada.

1205
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:26,340
Um,
and then also the pelagic longline.

1206
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,790
Now you've got introduced to the long 
line and,

1207
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:32,700
and some people wrap their hands to put 
their hands to their heart and say,

1208
01:02:32,701 --> 01:02:36,210
the long line is the way to go because 
it's not involving those trawlers.

1209
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,030
But with the long line does is catches 
turtles,

1210
01:02:39,031 --> 01:02:42,240
sharks and all sorts of other things 
that are not the ones that species,

1211
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,473
um,
at the same time as they're catching 

1212
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:45,550
swordfish.
Uh,

1213
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:46,620
but,
uh,

1214
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,270
controversially,
uh,

1215
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,740
the Marine Stewardship Council has 
awarded the Northwest Atlantic Canadians

1216
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:56,910
sort of fishery,
which amongst about $10 million a year,

1217
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,510
um,
um,

1218
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:00,780
certification that they were doing it 
properly.

1219
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:02,130
Uh,
I'm not so sure.

1220
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,840
I don't know now this one.

1221
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,733
But the interesting thing is that 
already awarded the spirit fishery for 

1222
01:03:10,981 --> 01:03:12,090
the,
sorry,

1223
01:03:12,091 --> 01:03:12,924
the yes,
the spear of fishery for the swordfish 

1224
01:03:15,031 --> 01:03:16,030
re,
uh,

1225
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,420
they're still using spirits out there.
And if you go,

1226
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:21,030
if you're google something along those 
lines,

1227
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:24,450
you can actually see little things for 
sportsmen in the United States.

1228
01:03:24,451 --> 01:03:27,550
For example,
going out and votes and throwing this or

1229
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:32,570
harpoons at getting swordfish.
But you can see what happens that uh,

1230
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,023
the government in the late nineties 
really put a clamp on things cause you 

1231
01:03:36,541 --> 01:03:40,770
could see the decline on the,
on the sort of fish going down there and

1232
01:03:40,771 --> 01:03:44,850
what below what is considered a maximum 
sustainable yield of biomass.

1233
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,810
And you can see as the consequences of 
stopping that fishery,

1234
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,673
how it's built up to the point now where
they feel that they can re-institute 

1235
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,340
illimited sort of fishery.
So these are the sorts of things.

1236
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,110
This is,
this is an odd ball little example.

1237
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,990
It's not one of the great fisheries,
but there's dozens,

1238
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:01,853
even hundreds of these other kinds of 
fisheries out there that don't get the 

1239
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,510
same kind of presses.
They cod fishery.

1240
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,340
Uh,
the big ones.

1241
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,213
Uh,
the biggest single thing we have going 

1242
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:13,660
for us now is the lobster and then had 
a,

1243
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,190
uh,
is a ground fish that is still retaining

1244
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:20,460
some place in the and the scale of 
things.

1245
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,353
A very nice fish to eat.
But these are the things that sustain 

1246
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:25,530
the small communities in the social 
work,

1247
01:04:25,531 --> 01:04:27,810
Nova Scotia,
Bay of fundy and so forth.

1248
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,200
But the point here is that the haddock 
went down and it went down maybe because

1249
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:35,004
of what we're fishing,
but it wasn't on the scale of over 

1250
01:04:37,051 --> 01:04:38,090
fishing of the,
uh,

1251
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:42,450
of the card and almost certainly water 
temperature has played a role in it.

1252
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,493
So again,
what's cause and effect between fishing 

1253
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,450
pressure and uh,
fish abundance?

1254
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,820
Sometimes not very clear.
Here's another one.

1255
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:52,180
This just,
uh,

1256
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:55,860
a friend of mine took this picture last 
weekend or the weekend before,

1257
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,220
one day a fishery and you get all these 
collections of boats going out and,

1258
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,063
and they kill immensely.
They take huge schools of herring and 

1259
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:07,140
then the goals and other birds are 
there,

1260
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:07,974
eagles,
et cetera.

1261
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,263
And the point here though is that the 
abundance of herring is that the 

1262
01:05:13,171 --> 01:05:15,780
greatest level in the last 30 to 40 
years,

1263
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,583
responsible fishery scientist would say,
we have no idea of why they would make 

1264
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,530
claim credit to and sales because our 
careful management,

1265
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,750
but it's been up and down and up and 
down.

1266
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:26,561
There's,
I,

1267
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:27,394
you don't have time.
It was an awful lot of interesting 

1268
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:32,560
stories about this fishery and about the
way the native people,

1269
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:36,520
the first nations along the coast 
perceive how it should be managed,

1270
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,410
where they wouldn't have any of these 
bullets up there.

1271
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:39,244
They would be,
because it's mainly managed for herring 

1272
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:41,681
row,
you know,

1273
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,540
they eggs and,
and uh,

1274
01:05:43,541 --> 01:05:46,090
they go to Japan and places like that.
But,

1275
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,740
um,
um,

1276
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:52,890
they would manage by lifting the things 
out on of Kelp where they'd been spawned

1277
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,220
by the official themselves and get rid 
of the bullets period.

1278
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,330
So there's different points of view of 
what you can do and some of those things

1279
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,120
I think are going to be the things for 
the future.

1280
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:05,013
Salmon.

1281
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:10,360
I have spent a lot of my life looking at
reading about,

1282
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:11,613
trying to understand Simon.
I'll be the first to say it's really 

1283
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:16,960
difficult,
not the only person to say that.

1284
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,113
Um,
there's aboriginal interests which are 

1285
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:23,170
strongly constitutionally supportive 
commercial interests,

1286
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:26,770
which often are on the decline sports 
fisheries interests,

1287
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,663
which claim to produce about five to 16 
times the value per fish landed because 

1288
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:35,920
fishermen spent a lot of money.
Uh,

1289
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:39,880
and then there's agriculture and 
anybody,

1290
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:42,460
anybody here from BC?
Great.

1291
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,473
Well,
you know that this is not exactly an 

1292
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:46,150
easy subject in British Columbia.
I mean,

1293
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:49,080
everybody has an opinion on it and,
and uh,

1294
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,980
it's really difficult.
But look at this.

1295
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,600
This is a plot,
uh,

1296
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:53,463
several years ago of watersheds and 
counter because you have to involve the 

1297
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,680
freshwater watersheds in British 
Columbia.

1298
01:06:59,681 --> 01:07:02,050
I should say we're sockeye salmon is in 
decline.

1299
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,950
So the yellow and red watersheds,
huge watershed is under threat.

1300
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,040
That's likely to,
uh,

1301
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,280
increase,
uh,

1302
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:09,303
because of global warming and the 
streams are warming up and other things 

1303
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:13,114
happening in the watersheds.
The Pine Bark Beetle killing all the 

1304
01:07:14,921 --> 01:07:17,740
trees,
trees go and water runs off,

1305
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:18,603
isn't there for the spawning season.
So the salmon's truly in trouble no 

1306
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:24,400
matter what aquaculture.
Uh,

1307
01:07:24,401 --> 01:07:26,020
if you're looking at a,
a net like this,

1308
01:07:26,021 --> 01:07:28,510
this is a fairly well run,
uh,

1309
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,990
agriculture,
uh,

1310
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,143
setting in a,
on each of those netted areas holds 

1311
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:37,000
about 50,000
fish this size.

1312
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,550
And if you've ever seen anything like 
that close up,

1313
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:43,810
it's quite amazing.
So this is just fish pack in place.

1314
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:46,430
The fish aren't discontented.
Um,

1315
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,390
and,
um,

1316
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,810
you know,
there's varying points of view about it,

1317
01:07:50,140 --> 01:07:52,080
but some of you may know that,
uh,

1318
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:53,680
uh,
our prime minister appointed,

1319
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,590
uh,
uh,

1320
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,613
uh,
justice from British Columbia who was 

1321
01:07:56,981 --> 01:08:01,030
called the Koan commission to look at 
the future of the Fraser River Salmon,

1322
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:02,020
the biggest bear run.

1323
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:03,401
And,
and,

1324
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:04,900
uh,
don't read all of this,

1325
01:08:04,901 --> 01:08:08,530
but the basic point is that a Cohen 
said,

1326
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:10,270
if,
if people were expecting that,

1327
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:13,060
I'd find a smoking gun one causality to 
it.

1328
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,740
No,
no way.

1329
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,633
And I think I certainly felt that would 
be what he would come up with at the 

1330
01:08:18,231 --> 01:08:19,910
end.
But there's all sorts of factors,

1331
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,043
but read what he says.
Fraser River sockeye face and uncertain 

1332
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:26,340
future shrinking resources,
um,

1333
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,223
which may result in delays in 
implementing reforms and research as 

1334
01:08:31,031 --> 01:08:32,360
shrinking,
shrinking resources,

1335
01:08:32,361 --> 01:08:35,840
being less money around dfo has been cut
badly.

1336
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:37,803
Um,
meaning that the stressors to with 

1337
01:08:39,221 --> 01:08:40,054
Sockeye are exposed will continue and 
the deterioration of sockeye habitat 

1338
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:44,114
will get worse.
The water's constituting Fraser River 

1339
01:08:46,221 --> 01:08:47,054
sockeye habitat or warming.
And then pointing out that basically 

1340
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,100
because the government had taken a bunch
of amendments before receiving as a,

1341
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:56,203
to the fisheries act that uh,
in fact the future of management of the 

1342
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,140
Fraser River is unknown and that's 
putting it in the most positive terms.

1343
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:04,670
And,
and so,

1344
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:07,340
um,
these are guarded comments,

1345
01:09:07,341 --> 01:09:09,290
the whole report,
the summary of that,

1346
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,303
if you want to get a sense of that 
particular very important resource and 

1347
01:09:13,611 --> 01:09:15,770
why it's difficult to manage,
read that report.

1348
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:18,420
So my,
my,

1349
01:09:18,421 --> 01:09:19,370
uh,
concern.

1350
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:20,563
So we have these various things that we 
can do in Canada for the oceans and two 

1351
01:09:23,901 --> 01:09:26,030
big things.
What is the Fisheries Act,

1352
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:27,230
which was in,
uh,

1353
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:28,063
is in a very old,
one of the first pieces of legislation 

1354
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:30,944
we had encountered.
And I won't give you a ball boring and 

1355
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:34,244
dull description of all the parts of it,
but it sets the basis for conservation 

1356
01:09:37,941 --> 01:09:38,774
of fish for pollution control and a 
number of other things related to 

1357
01:09:41,331 --> 01:09:42,800
habitat,
etc.

1358
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:44,293
And also sovereignty over our resource 
and sovereignty between the federal 

1359
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:51,700
government and provincial governments 
and,

1360
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,360
and its management.
Uh,

1361
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:55,070
it's a very important piece of 
legislation.

1362
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,920
It's been changed quite dramatically in 
the last year.

1363
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,880
Placing less emphasis on the habitat 
aspect in particular.

1364
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,233
Uh,
but we also have the oceans act in 

1365
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:05,264
Canada and this was a new piece of 
legislation that came out in the 1990s 

1366
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,800
and essentially set a new basis of 
management around ecosystems,

1367
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,010
sustainable development in another 
words,

1368
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:21,011
balancing between the various kinds of 
uses of the ocean and specified the need

1369
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:25,520
for attention to marine protected areas.
And also,

1370
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:26,783
uh,
what was called la eventually became 

1371
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,193
called wool,
most large ocean management areas to 

1372
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:33,980
take big chunks of the ocean and try and
develop,

1373
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:35,570
uh,
plans for them.

1374
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:39,020
I'm just going to give you a very brief 
overview of a few of these and you can,

1375
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:39,983
uh,
th this talk will be available to 

1376
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:45,200
anybody that wants it and you can see in
more detail but,

1377
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,520
but the Lomas,
uh,

1378
01:10:46,521 --> 01:10:47,780
represent,
uh,

1379
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:48,993
uh,
move towards the ecosystem based 

1380
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:54,530
approach and one that's based on 
consultation among the various users,

1381
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:57,230
whether they're first nations,
whether they're oil and gas,

1382
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,190
fisheries and so forth.
It's building relationships and dialogue

1383
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:05,600
among the various users.
And the idea is to plan for surprises,

1384
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:06,853
plan for management strategies that you 
could actually implement and get that 

1385
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:13,130
information in advance of development.

1386
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,103
So a one that I'm very familiar with is 
eastern east coast Scotian shelf and 

1387
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:23,660
they produce good work,
um,

1388
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,380
and so forth.
I won't talk about it anymore.

1389
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,410
One that's citizen led,
uh,

1390
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:32,700
scientists led and led by both Canada 
and the United States is the area of the

1391
01:11:32,701 --> 01:11:35,010
Gulf of Maine,
particularly Georges Bank.

1392
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:35,844
As part of that.
And then happened to the Bay of Fundy 

1393
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,600
and a here,
the federal government has a limited,

1394
01:11:40,601 --> 01:11:43,110
it has taken a limited rural,
um,

1395
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:47,580
and it's been the states and the 
provinces working together.

1396
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,920
That's really done some very innovative 
work.

1397
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:52,890
Won't have time to go into it.
But I wanted to say just one thing,

1398
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,860
if you take this is the boundary line 
between the two countries.

1399
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:57,780
Uh,
painfully worked out.

1400
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:01,350
And I can tell you interesting stories 
about that cause I was at some level and

1401
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:02,910
some of that,
it was very interesting.

1402
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:04,133
But if you look up towards the Bay of 
fundy and into north towards New 

1403
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,213
Brunswick,
which is,

1404
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,363
uh,
just to the right at the top of the 

1405
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:13,350
line,
top line,

1406
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:14,763
um,
whales and ships collide up there 

1407
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:20,273
because that's where it's a natural,
one of these areas with lots of 

1408
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:25,020
occurrence flowing and dryers and so 
forth.

1409
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,213
And it's incredibly productive.
The whales come up there to feed in the 

1410
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,090
summer.
Some of the scarcest whales,

1411
01:12:30,091 --> 01:12:30,924
humpbacks are there,
but some of the other whales and they 

1412
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,910
collide with the ships.
So you get these ships going up into,

1413
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:39,600
um,
particularly for an oil refinery located

1414
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:42,390
up there and they find a whale draped 
over this.

1415
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,430
They have a kind of a bulbous front on 
them and there was a whale of dead whale

1416
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:46,320
there.
And,

1417
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,490
and so the right whales particularly,
um,

1418
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,910
there's only about 300 of them left,
I think,

1419
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,630
and they were being knocked off right,
left,

1420
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,820
no pun intended,
uh,

1421
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:55,863
in that area.

1422
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,030
So there was a simple solution.
It was a very simple solution.

1423
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,403
And one that's worked remarkably well.
They just changed the shipping lanes 

1424
01:13:04,861 --> 01:13:05,694
slightly and they put in place a kind of
a spotting mechanism cause you can see 

1425
01:13:08,491 --> 01:13:09,324
the whales and so people would know 
where the whales tended to be clustered 

1426
01:13:11,881 --> 01:13:12,714
on a given day.
So there's some leeway in where the 

1427
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:17,230
ships go and problem not completely 
solve,

1428
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,950
but let's say 80% salt.
So there's,

1429
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:20,813
there's,
there really are win win situations out 

1430
01:13:22,351 --> 01:13:26,550
there.
And the charge for that was led by,

1431
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:29,580
you can see how Nova Scotia goes down to
kind of a little point,

1432
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,170
not,
not the big part of Nova Scotia,

1433
01:13:31,171 --> 01:13:33,750
but there's a little kind of peninsula 
and beautiful place.

1434
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:39,140
Now the school teacher was living out 
there and she took it upon herself to be

1435
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,314
part of the solution and organize local 
groups to actually spot and be able to 

1436
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,374
say where the whales would be and 
demonstrated to the scientists who 

1437
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:50,340
didn't really believe in this.

1438
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:53,910
I don't think very strongly that,
that it could actually be a solution.

1439
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,223
So it started from a citizen and I have 
a lot of respect for what I see is 

1440
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,000
citizen science in the oceans,
uh,

1441
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,913
throughout this country.
I could give you many other examples in 

1442
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,280
the west coast,
in the Arctic and so forth.

1443
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,253
Another one that I think involves a 
heavy degree of citizen input is the 

1444
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:12,580
same,
the Gulf of Saint Lawrence,

1445
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:14,020
uh,
action plan,

1446
01:14:14,021 --> 01:14:16,410
which is being implemented primarily 
through a,

1447
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,040
um,
a environment Canada.

1448
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,323
And here there's something called Zip.
We don't need to go into the details of 

1449
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,223
it,
but zip committees exist throughout the 

1450
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,124
golf,
in and around particularly around go 

1451
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,420
back.
It's all just all of life.

1452
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,280
Um,
and the,

1453
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:32,123
the neat thing about it is that a,
it brings the stakeholders together and 

1454
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,334
they come to real solutions about local 
problems that affect their part of the 

1455
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:41,410
Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

1456
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,243
And the government and others provide a 
broader input into overall what the St 

1457
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:48,933
Lawrence Action Plan would look like.
So there's some degree of coherence 

1458
01:14:50,501 --> 01:14:51,334
throughout the whole region.
Now these are good things that are 

1459
01:14:53,261 --> 01:14:54,850
happening and they've,
they,

1460
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:58,330
they've been developed by people working
together,

1461
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,283
painstakingly working together.
I might add for more than a decade of 

1462
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:03,993
interaction,
overcoming all sorts of obstacles or 

1463
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:08,080
differing points of view,
narrow points of view,

1464
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:08,914
et cetera.
So these are some of the good things 

1465
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:12,490
that are happening in Canada.
Uh,

1466
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:16,090
one that I helped to get underway in 
terms of some of,

1467
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,330
I won't go into all sorts of stories 
about it for time reasons,

1468
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:23,560
but a terrible name,
Penn Sema Pacific North Coast integrated

1469
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,750
management area.
And this includes,

1470
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:26,960
um,
when I,

1471
01:15:26,961 --> 01:15:29,830
I hate the word also worldclass the 
phrase world class,

1472
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:34,831
but the oceans in this area are stunning
in terms of the diversity of life,

1473
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:36,643
uh,
and also the intactness of the 

1474
01:15:37,931 --> 01:15:42,931
ecosystems in this whole area in the 
northern part of Vancouver Island.

1475
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:45,700
Um,
up to Prince Rupert,

1476
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,790
there's only 15 or 20,000
people living in that whole area.

1477
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:52,780
And that's an area that's probably about
as long as the cost of much of the coast

1478
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:53,950
of Norway.
For example,

1479
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,490
I'm absolutely fine,
intact ecosystems.

1480
01:15:57,491 --> 01:15:58,324
You can fly at a reasonably low levels 
and see gigantic sunfish floating on 

1481
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:04,540
their side into the weigh a thousand 
pounds or more.

1482
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:05,853
You can see whales,
you can see if you're in a boat where 

1483
01:16:08,741 --> 01:16:11,350
the seabirds go.
And then there's important,

1484
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:12,370
uh,
uh,

1485
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:14,710
uh,
fisheries activities in that as well.

1486
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,710
There's a wonderful atlas of it.
Uh,

1487
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,480
if you want to look at it online and you
can download that,

1488
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,340
but,
um,

1489
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,233
there's all sorts of other activities.
This is drawn from that atlas just 

1490
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:26,900
showing who's got,
uh,

1491
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,083
uh,
oil and gas exploratory wells and 

1492
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,330
tenures in the area.
Um,

1493
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:31,781
uh,
you know,

1494
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:33,730
all sorts of people have staked that 
territory.

1495
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:35,590
There's another one that shows,
uh,

1496
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,480
all sorts of different fisheries 
interests.

1497
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:39,370
Well,
interspersed with those,

1498
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,780
I don't know if I've got the,
no,

1499
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:42,020
I don't.
Um,

1500
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:45,010
I took it out for time reasons.
Uh,

1501
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,430
if I,
if I could show you where the corals are

1502
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:51,310
and where there's the thing called a 
glass sponges,

1503
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,270
which we thought were creatures that had
gone extinct.

1504
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,163
They were studying as fossils in Germany
and that was where they found the 

1505
01:16:58,931 --> 01:16:59,764
veranda.
The areas I think that are fossilized 

1506
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:06,070
now in Germany and suddenly about 15 
years ago,

1507
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:11,120
somebody discovered that there was huge 
beds of these things around this area.

1508
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:13,460
They're primarily in the area that's 
kind of a pale orange.

1509
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:17,270
Um,
so what are you going to do about it?

1510
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:18,523
These were areas that were just 
beginning to be used heavily by 

1511
01:17:20,961 --> 01:17:23,660
trawlers.
The trawlers were starting to plow right

1512
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:25,520
through these ancient beds because these
are,

1513
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,140
some of these are thousands of years 
old.

1514
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:28,470
Um,
and,

1515
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:29,540
and uh,
uh,

1516
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:31,100
stock was put to it.
Um,

1517
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,830
and now they're all applauded.
We know where they are.

1518
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,130
There's an exclusion zones for the 
corals for the,

1519
01:17:37,131 --> 01:17:38,510
a,
a fisheries in the same,

1520
01:17:39,210 --> 01:17:41,490
uh,
Iran up till about 2000,

1521
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,930
there was an official almost denial that
there was a,

1522
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:45,803
the soft corals that were found on the 
east coast and the fishermen had been 

1523
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:49,244
complaining about a particularly long 
liners that the trawlers were going 

1524
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:52,664
through and bringing up these things.
And I went to a Fisher Fishery 

1525
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:57,013
Association for museum and Southwest 
Nova Scotia and the handle these big 

1526
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:04,481
corals and if you went on the west coast
to do some of the commercial,

1527
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:07,290
but um,
sports fishing shops and boats,

1528
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,100
uh,
places they'd have them on the wall.

1529
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:11,630
The same thing on the west coast.
Well,

1530
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:15,740
officially they didn't exist and finally
they did exist.

1531
01:18:15,741 --> 01:18:16,574
And now there's all sorts of 
exclusionary is for the red corals as 

1532
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:19,400
well.

1533
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,220
So progress but it's slow and it's 
painful.

1534
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,443
The northern gateway,
I'm not going to even touch tonight if 

1535
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:30,131
you want to ask me questions about it,
but this is the prime example now of why

1536
01:18:30,381 --> 01:18:31,214
we need something like Benzema to 
generate the kind of data that would be 

1537
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:37,100
helpful to know how much,
uh,

1538
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,770
what is their actual risk.
Unfortunately,

1539
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:41,143
for whatever reason,
the government has decided to more or 

1540
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,540
less,
not totally,

1541
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,290
but more or less,
um,

1542
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:50,500
got the cooperation that had been 
established hoop and Sema and,

1543
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,760
and that mechanism it seems to be lost.
Now,

1544
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:56,300
another one in the north is the Beaufort
Sea partnership,

1545
01:18:56,630 --> 01:18:57,463
uh,
in which is a complicated thing and you 

1546
01:18:59,241 --> 01:19:00,074
can see the vision of it is basically a 
ecosystem health and supporting 

1547
01:19:04,311 --> 01:19:05,144
sustainable communities and economies 
for future generations as well as the 

1548
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,494
present.
The problem with the Beaufort Sea 

1549
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,380
partnership is there's a lot of things 
that relate to land claims and,

1550
01:19:15,381 --> 01:19:16,730
and uh,
uh,

1551
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:19,350
northern,
um,

1552
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,300
local peoples up there that have made it
very difficult.

1553
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:26,600
And I'm not blaming them,
but it's just there's a lot of obstacles

1554
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:29,780
in the way still to make this move as 
fast as it should.

1555
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:31,313
Another one where another mechanism is 
in place now and we're starting to get 

1556
01:19:35,511 --> 01:19:38,150
in places lancaster sound,
lancaster sound,

1557
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,330
who is one of the first places where 
there were see use planning in Canada.

1558
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:42,513
And at that time that was in the 1980s.
People were kind of looking at it as a 

1559
01:19:45,651 --> 01:19:49,370
bit of a curiosity.
Now this is a very important part of the

1560
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,293
northwest passage that will become one 
of the areas used for shipping 

1561
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:54,104
eventually.
There's a large part of that has now 

1562
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,990
proposed as a national conservation area
and,

1563
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:00,980
and uh,
this,

1564
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:04,370
it'll be very interesting to see what 
this will actually mean in reality.

1565
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:05,623
Now I want to point out the,
the national marine conservation area 

1566
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,500
because we actually have legislation 
saying that all the representative areas

1567
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:16,020
in Canada,
there's 26 or 27 of them,

1568
01:20:16,021 --> 01:20:16,854
something like that.

1569
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,933
Each of those kinds of habitats should 
have representative areas where you 

1570
01:20:21,631 --> 01:20:26,130
could actually pinpoint and say,
Aha,

1571
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:28,560
this is,
this area is protected within that.

1572
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:29,394
And it will tell us about the area.
I could be abused for fisheries 

1573
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:33,920
management and so forth.
Uh,

1574
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,410
helping to replenish their stocks,
uh,

1575
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,313
were far from there.
Just to highlight again what Jordan was 

1576
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:42,480
saying.
Ah,

1577
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,433
look at the small percentage of 
protected areas in the oceans in Canada 

1578
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:48,623
compared to the line.
And most people would say on the land 

1579
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:51,450
areas,
it's not enough.

1580
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:52,853
So I don't look at the detail of this,
but these shows all these different 

1581
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,320
types of areas.
You know,

1582
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,383
you can look at Hudson Bay for example,
or the north and south part of west 

1583
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:06,480
coast,
Pacific coast.

1584
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,850
There's a lot of areas,
but particularly in the Arctic,

1585
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,880
um,
we,

1586
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:14,220
we need a lot more effort.
And one of the things that a c pause,

1587
01:21:14,221 --> 01:21:17,340
which has been a prime,
a contributor to this,

1588
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,593
they have a whole list of things that 
they feel are urgent priorities for 

1589
01:21:22,001 --> 01:21:23,100
marine protected areas.

1590
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:25,920
And they're not all being acted on at 
this point in time.

1591
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:30,060
So we do have a document and talk,
talk,

1592
01:21:30,061 --> 01:21:30,661
talk,
talk.

1593
01:21:30,661 --> 01:21:34,110
It's very cheap called the national 
network of Mbas.

1594
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,470
Do we have a national network of Mbas in
Canada?

1595
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:38,873
Uh,
well here's one point of view from a 

1596
01:21:40,111 --> 01:21:43,380
person who I respect a lot through the 
Pew Foundation.

1597
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:44,214
Daniel Pauly from UBC fishery center is 
one of the people that really 

1598
01:21:47,191 --> 01:21:48,024
understands the oceans and fisheries 
very well in Canada and around the 

1599
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:52,020
world.
And,

1600
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:53,670
uh,
he's been running something,

1601
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,193
a database called MPA global,
looking at marine protected areas all 

1602
01:21:58,381 --> 01:21:59,214
around the world.
And then if you go and look at the 

1603
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:04,620
Canadian entries,
there's 574 of them,

1604
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,070
including provincial coastal parks and 
ecological reserves and so forth.

1605
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,180
I can go out in my kayak and go right 
around the ecological reserves,

1606
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:14,400
two kilometers off shore from where I 
live,

1607
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:15,630
uh,
for birds,

1608
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:18,480
for example,
rain parks in British Columbia,

1609
01:22:18,481 --> 01:22:19,560
there's dozens of them.

1610
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:21,240
Uh,
but they're mainly for,

1611
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,690
they've been chosen not for their 
ecological value,

1612
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,500
although sometimes there is ecological 
value,

1613
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:29,490
but it's nice safe shelters for boats 
that go up and down the coast,

1614
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:30,300
you know,
small,

1615
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,740
pleasurable.
It's a big pleasure bullets.

1616
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:32,970
So,
um,

1617
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:36,930
this is kind of overstates the case,
but it's not Daniel polly's fault.

1618
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:39,990
This is following certain criteria.
Um,

1619
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:45,350
we're starting to see this now emerge as
networks within the regions.

1620
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,050
So for example,
um,

1621
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:51,090
there's whale sanctuaries,
coral sanctuaries,

1622
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:52,763
and a place called the gully where a lot
of the really interesting whales that 

1623
01:22:56,491 --> 01:22:57,324
are off shore from Nova Scotia collect 
now and then there's a lot of actually 

1624
01:23:01,231 --> 01:23:04,650
land based ones so that you're primarily
for birds and protection of wetlands.

1625
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:09,010
The problem with this is can you really 
call it a network?

1626
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:10,610
What are the criteria?
What,

1627
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:13,150
how will it relate?
How will all of this relate,

1628
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,280
uh,
that I've got on this diagram?

1629
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:18,460
How will it relate to sustainable 
fisheries management?

1630
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:21,640
Because that's the kind of question that
we should be asking.

1631
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:25,660
I don't think we're asking that question
very well and Canada now,

1632
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:26,793
but I would urge fin to be thinking 
about that when you're thinking about 

1633
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:31,833
sustainability of seafood and so forth,
how does it relate back to the other 

1634
01:23:35,021 --> 01:23:38,800
things in the ocean ecosystem and how 
can we use those tools better?

1635
01:23:39,460 --> 01:23:40,680
Uh,
Penn Sema,

1636
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:41,913
this diagram shows the,
all these different places that I 

1637
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:47,614
mentioned,
the corals and other areas that deserve 

1638
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,220
some sort of,
um,

1639
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:52,733
um,
protection of one sort or another from 

1640
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,350
here and now.
Um,

1641
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:58,773
management issues,
things like the trawlers and other 

1642
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:03,040
activities,
oil and gas in some cases.

1643
01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:08,490
Now here is the makings of at least a 
west coast northwest coast network.

1644
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:13,210
Here's what I'd like to see.
Uh,

1645
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,560
if you look at Penn seem,
and I've taken it up to the 200 miles on

1646
01:24:17,561 --> 01:24:20,380
it because I feel we should be going out
to the 200 miles on this,

1647
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,650
but if you had a,
I call it boy to brooks.

1648
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:26,920
Brooks peninsula is a really,
I should've put a picture of it.

1649
01:24:26,921 --> 01:24:28,810
And it's so interesting to see it from 
the air.

1650
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:29,991
It's,
it's,

1651
01:24:29,991 --> 01:24:30,824
uh,
a finger of land that goes out to the 

1652
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:34,600
sea.
Is that an interesting place?

1653
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:35,434
Because,
um,

1654
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:36,333
during the Second World War when we were
patrolling all along the coast for a 

1655
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:43,120
ship's coming across automation,
a lot of ship,

1656
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:48,150
a lot of airplanes were lost in the boy 
in the brooks peninsula because right at

1657
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:52,770
that point there's a change in the 
current and you get all,

1658
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:53,773
so there's a north and south current 
coming and they change seasonally and 

1659
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,210
right at that point you can get a,
I've talked to a pilot about this when I

1660
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:02,044
was flying over it with him and he was 
saying that he had actually seen what 

1661
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:08,740
looked like Niagara Falls coming up 
because of the currents are clashing.

1662
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,830
You get this water coming up rising out 
of the ocean.

1663
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,091
And,
and uh,

1664
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:13,924
he said it was just like this wall of 
water coming up and then crashing down 

1665
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:17,614
the other side in the atmosphere.
So these are the things that only pilot 

1666
01:25:21,291 --> 01:25:21,821
see,
I guess,

1667
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:23,650
but he said it exceedingly dangerous 
area,

1668
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,430
but it's,
it's uh,

1669
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,433
again,
a very important area separating the 

1670
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:30,400
north and the south and the kinds of 
animal migrations,

1671
01:25:30,401 --> 01:25:34,360
whales and so forth and see birds.
And then if you look at the top end,

1672
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,750
there's the boys see mode and there's 
sea mounts.

1673
01:25:37,751 --> 01:25:41,020
These mountains that rise up almost to 
the ocean,

1674
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:42,850
top of the ocean.
Um,

1675
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,863
but in the case of Boise,
mounted comes within 75 feet of the 

1676
01:25:47,201 --> 01:25:48,034
surface.
Now I have talked to people that have 

1677
01:25:50,351 --> 01:25:51,184
gone out there and their cell phones,
big sailboats and scuba dived on that 

1678
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:55,480
seem odd.

1679
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,360
It's filled with life.
It's absolutely filled with life.

1680
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,750
And,
and so we have a whole series of these.

1681
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:02,763
This is the only one that gets any 
protection whatsoever from fishing as 

1682
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:07,244
far as I can tell.
And there's other things in the scone 

1683
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,080
olins and,
um,

1684
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:16,070
rarity is very important.
We'll look in the estuaries.

1685
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,900
Another one of these strange little 
fish,

1686
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,233
uh,
things that I won't go into the sponge 

1687
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:24,890
reefs and so forth.
So this is not just a big blend,

1688
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:28,070
a body of light blue or anything like 
that.

1689
01:26:28,071 --> 01:26:29,780
When you start looking at what's on the 
bottom,

1690
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,590
it needs protection.
The Sea otters coming back,

1691
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:34,680
um,
and,

1692
01:26:34,680 --> 01:26:36,290
and they're part of the ecosystem.
Now.

1693
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:37,593
Uh,
some first nations hate them because 

1694
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:41,203
they're taking moistures,
they're taking all sorts of creatures 

1695
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:45,400
that they want to harvest.
Uh,

1696
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:49,570
the coral reefs.
I've mentioned way Hannah's,

1697
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:50,643
uh,
which is land co managed between Parks 

1698
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:58,751
Canada and now a marine conservation 
under area under the Marine Conservation

1699
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:03,330
Act and the Haida people,
one of the most innovative systems of co

1700
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:05,510
management anywhere in the world.

1701
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:11,110
I mean this is fabulous and this is 
going to mean a whole different approach

1702
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,820
towards fisheries management in the area
towards,

1703
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,733
uh,
how the Haida people perceive their 

1704
01:27:18,021 --> 01:27:18,854
responsibilities and how the government 
of Canada and the province of Canada 

1705
01:27:21,951 --> 01:27:22,860
actually,
uh,

1706
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,920
it's all done in a Cole management 
basis.

1707
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:28,400
This is one of the most exciting things 
that you can possibly imagine.

1708
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:33,110
And this is what the southern end can 
see down that yellow tip,

1709
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:34,183
the southern end,
which happens to be where the highest 

1710
01:27:37,401 --> 01:27:38,234
recorded winds were ever recorded.
And it was off a test oil rig there in 

1711
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:43,184
the 1970s,
I think it was 200 kilometers and hour 

1712
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:49,400
or something like that.
So this is the kind of habitat that's up

1713
01:27:49,401 --> 01:27:50,234
there.
And you can see the animals that are 

1714
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:54,050
living there at the sea lions,
the beautiful area.

1715
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:56,860
Um,
oops.

1716
01:27:58,150 --> 01:28:03,150
Cmon um,
above that rock fish,

1717
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:07,730
those fish,
many of them are 70 years old.

1718
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:10,550
And as some of my colleagues,
they want to protect them to say,

1719
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:13,850
would you eat your grandparents because 
they're delicious.

1720
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:19,000
They're served on many menus and a not 
very sustainably harvested.

1721
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,430
And in fact,
before boys see mount,

1722
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:27,710
while it was still under consideration,
that's just a,

1723
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,700
uh,
uh,

1724
01:28:28,820 --> 01:28:29,653
a plot of the,
the depth contours and these currents 

1725
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:35,390
that circulate around on the boys seem 
odd,

1726
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:40,640
but fishermen were being told to go out 
there and fish while they still could.

1727
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:44,150
So even in the,
this is safe,

1728
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:45,043
seven or eight years ago when it was 
actively knowing that boise is going to 

1729
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:51,200
be handled,
there was boats going out there.

1730
01:28:51,530 --> 01:28:52,363
So now that problem is solved,
but there's all these other problems 

1731
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:56,293
along the coast.
Should you allow bullets to go out to 

1732
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,880
other seamounts triangle island?
Uh,

1733
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:03,820
most amazing place.
Uh,

1734
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:07,200
the day I went out there and the pilot 
said,

1735
01:29:07,201 --> 01:29:08,034
you were lucky,
you get one to two days a year when it 

1736
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,810
looks like this is not covered in rain 
fog.

1737
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:14,910
You can see the little blip on the top 
of it.

1738
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:17,490
That was a,
a light house.

1739
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,220
They put the light house up in the,
uh,

1740
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:22,080
in the club level.
So no,

1741
01:29:22,081 --> 01:29:23,730
the light house keepers could never see 
it.

1742
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,013
The weather was so bad there that 
lighthouse keepers often would get no 

1743
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:32,040
food for two or three months at a time.
Um,

1744
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,143
sadly,
some of the lighthouse keepers went 

1745
01:29:34,291 --> 01:29:36,060
crazy out there as well.
And,

1746
01:29:36,061 --> 01:29:38,130
and there's only the base of the light 
house,

1747
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:39,023
uh,
left,

1748
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:41,220
uh,
hurricane blew the Adelaide house itself

1749
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:42,470
away.
Um,

1750
01:29:42,780 --> 01:29:43,613
and so they also,
one of the leading scientists that 

1751
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:46,920
studied,
it's a great place,

1752
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:49,350
one of the great nesting areas for 
certain,

1753
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:50,213
um,
uh,

1754
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,230
important seabirds.
And,

1755
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,720
uh,
sadly one of the scientists fell off the

1756
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:55,554
cliff and she died.
There's a wonderful book though that's 

1757
01:29:57,811 --> 01:29:59,700
been written about triangle island,
uh,

1758
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,450
with a lot of watercolors and so forth,
uh,

1759
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:05,970
by an artist that went out at a later 
time.

1760
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:06,511
Um,
it's,

1761
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,340
it's,
it's a very interesting spot.

1762
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:10,500
Now,
what do you think those things are?

1763
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:11,973
Uh,
innovation with ocean technology and 

1764
01:30:13,591 --> 01:30:16,950
sovereignty issues such as signing onto 
the law of the sea.

1765
01:30:16,951 --> 01:30:19,830
We never ratified the law of the seed,
for example.

1766
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,620
I think it's time to revisit and 
strengthen our commitment to the ocean.

1767
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:29,100
I think we've made a start with the 
oceans action plan,

1768
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,880
but I think it's,
um,

1769
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:31,953
we've got some good points and it's 
faltering in some key areas and not 

1770
01:30:34,861 --> 01:30:38,580
enough resources or even attention is 
being given to do it.

1771
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:41,670
Ask when the last time this was reviewed
in parliament,

1772
01:30:41,671 --> 01:30:44,130
for example,
the fisheries,

1773
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:45,593
as far as I can see,
the committee that deals with fisheries 

1774
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:54,150
and oceans matters and the current 
parliament is,

1775
01:30:54,230 --> 01:30:55,063
we pretty much dysfunctional,
certainly not dealing with the kinds of 

1776
01:30:57,421 --> 01:30:59,160
questions that we're talking about here 
tonight.

1777
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:04,670
It will probably receive the report of 
the Commissioner on the environment,

1778
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:05,850
sustainable development.

1779
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,680
An Mba's say,
thank you.

1780
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:08,543
We probably won't be needing any serious
discussion of this longterm discussion 

1781
01:31:11,671 --> 01:31:13,410
of this.
Thank you very much for your hard work.

1782
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:16,560
And that's what things are degraded to 
at various times.

1783
01:31:16,561 --> 01:31:19,200
Now we need much more than that.
Uh,

1784
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:20,163
so in the work of Finn and with,
I hope your other colleagues around the 

1785
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:28,050
country that you will join the voices of
those who do speak,

1786
01:31:28,051 --> 01:31:32,310
I think responsibly and sensibly about 
the,

1787
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:33,343
and for the a boat and for the oceans,
but that you will take these kinds of 

1788
01:31:37,531 --> 01:31:38,364
broader perspectives and keep those in 
mind even as you focus very strongly on 

1789
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:43,913
underneath for going after the 
individual species and looking at the 

1790
01:31:46,651 --> 01:31:50,460
problems related to all of the fish that
are out in the ocean.

1791
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:51,683
Because it's clear we're going to be 
eating more varieties of them and we're 

1792
01:31:55,981 --> 01:31:58,470
going to find some very scarce still in 
the future.

1793
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,030
So thank you very much for your 
attention this evening.

1794
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:06,150
[inaudible]

1795
01:32:14,930 --> 01:32:17,030
how'd your attention for a long time 
tonight?

1796
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:19,620
Uh,
so,

1797
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:23,240
but you're welcome to ask questions if 
you'd like to do that.

1798
01:32:23,241 --> 01:32:24,770
Right?
If you ask a question,

1799
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:27,260
then I'll repeat it because then we can 
capture it on video,

1800
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,230
but he'd be more than pleased to take 
questions.

1801
01:32:30,231 --> 01:32:35,231
So if anyone has one.
Oh yeah.

1802
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,730
Just the general problem of 
sustainability.

1803
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:43,120
I don't know if anyone's heard of Donald
Wright's idea of a progress draw.

1804
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:47,840
So like our ancestors killing two 
minutes,

1805
01:32:47,841 --> 01:32:50,330
let's say over one is a good idea.
That's progress.

1806
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:51,493
But once they could drive 200 off a 
cliff and kill an entire herd and then 

1807
01:32:55,431 --> 01:32:56,264
like he'll more herds until they,
all our ancestors in those areas would 

1808
01:32:59,631 --> 01:33:01,850
starve to death because they'd kill all 
minutes essentially.

1809
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:03,720
Um,
that would be progress drop.

1810
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:06,290
What a book from dawn [inaudible].
And I was wondering,

1811
01:33:06,291 --> 01:33:07,124
um,
if you guys have any thoughts about if 

1812
01:33:09,171 --> 01:33:10,004
that applies,
if that's like an oversimplistic 

1813
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,580
generalization or if it fits it.

1814
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:15,423
Is there anything that you do about it?
So the question is whether the idea of 

1815
01:33:18,691 --> 01:33:19,524
progress trap is relevant to this issue 
in a progress trapped is the expansion 

1816
01:33:23,551 --> 01:33:27,360
of technology to harvest beyond 
sustainable limits,

1817
01:33:27,510 --> 01:33:29,220
I guess.
Do you want to take that?

1818
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,260
Sure,
sure.

1819
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:31,230
Um,
well,

1820
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:32,064
it,
it's part of a larger problem of traps 

1821
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:38,550
and progress traps is certainly one.
And we get caught in those traps because

1822
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:41,490
something works well for us for at the 
time hearing.

1823
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:43,410
And Sonia was true in the fisheries 
case.

1824
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:48,890
And then when it doesn't work well,
we're still adhering to that approach.

1825
01:33:49,770 --> 01:33:50,603
So one of the things,
and this is one of the reasons why I 

1826
01:33:52,141 --> 01:33:54,270
bring up the ecosystem work and so 
forth,

1827
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:58,590
we have to open our mind to alternative 
possibilities.

1828
01:33:58,650 --> 01:33:59,483
And also there's another little phrase 
that you is called the option for 

1829
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:03,380
closure.
Um,

1830
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:03,961
Eh,
you know,

1831
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:06,210
for example,
if you lay out all the different uses in

1832
01:34:06,211 --> 01:34:07,720
the ocean,
um,

1833
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,710
and everybody's scrambling for space in 
the ocean,

1834
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:11,633
you know,
the fishermen don't want aquaculture 

1835
01:34:12,721 --> 01:34:15,420
because they can't park their boats or 
their nets are in the way,

1836
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,890
whatever it happens to be.

1837
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:17,843
The oil people want one thing.
The aquaculture is don't want to do old 

1838
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:20,804
people,
et cetera.

1839
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:23,910
So you've got to have some rational case
for making choices,

1840
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:26,640
but option for closure if you do it 
well.

1841
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:28,920
And zoning is one of the ways to do 
that.

1842
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:31,320
Um,
allows for more to go on,

1843
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,633
but at a lower risk.
And what we're doing now I think is 

1844
01:34:35,731 --> 01:34:36,564
moving back towards a sectoral approach 
where it happens right now that the 

1845
01:34:40,921 --> 01:34:44,080
sector happens to be oil and gas.
It could equally be some other sector,

1846
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:47,370
the could be deep ocean mining for 
example,

1847
01:34:47,371 --> 01:34:49,410
or shallow ocean mining.
Um,

1848
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:50,303
and,
and so we have to have a more rational 

1849
01:34:52,951 --> 01:34:57,620
basis and just following whatever we 
think at the moment is the best know.

1850
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:58,670
And,
uh,

1851
01:34:58,670 --> 01:34:59,503
so that's,
that's really dealing with the progress 

1852
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,690
trap.
Um,

1853
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:04,990
I think there's also a kind of,
and maybe the company said,

1854
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:08,060
but it kind of a conceptual trap 
sometimes as well.

1855
01:35:08,090 --> 01:35:08,923
And our,
we,

1856
01:35:08,930 --> 01:35:12,350
we adhere to ideas and therefore wonder,
open our minds up,

1857
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:16,700
but then something comes along.
It could be some terrible accident,

1858
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:18,580
uh,
the classic cases,

1859
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:21,320
the Exxon Valdez or something like that.
And suddenly,

1860
01:35:21,321 --> 01:35:22,154
Bang,
you're in a whole new environment of 

1861
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:27,380
thinking and you're not prepared for it.
You don't have solutions.

1862
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:28,214
You don't have,
haven't thought your way through the 

1863
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:30,374
kind of knowledge basis you need.
And so that's another kind of trap that 

1864
01:35:33,651 --> 01:35:37,190
we have to face because that's why I say
think about accidents.

1865
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:42,140
Many of the changes in our society are 
the result of accidents and something so

1866
01:35:42,141 --> 01:35:45,620
awful happens that we have to think of a
new way of doing things.

1867
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:46,783
And so a lot of what I think of the 
scientific community is dealing with in 

1868
01:35:52,311 --> 01:35:56,780
the oceans right now is to say we've got
to prepare ourselves for a future that's

1869
01:35:56,781 --> 01:35:57,614
very uncertain and therefore we need to 
have a lot of knowledge and we have to 

1870
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:05,330
ask a lot of what ifs so that we are 
prepared to make um,

1871
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:07,610
direction shifts as necessary in the 
future.

1872
01:36:07,611 --> 01:36:08,444
Whether they're from climate change or 
some horrible accident or just changing 

1873
01:36:11,631 --> 01:36:16,190
priorities and society.
One of those priorities for sure is that

1874
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,820
all those certification programs are 
going to become the way we do business.

1875
01:36:20,210 --> 01:36:23,390
And those people who are not engaged in 
that,

1876
01:36:23,391 --> 01:36:24,890
in the fisheries are going to learn the 
hard way.

1877
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:27,170
That's my prediction for five to 10 
years.

1878
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:34,480
What would be the negative consequences,
especially economic consequences,

1879
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:40,360
the loss of jobs or those mysteries.
We'll let some of those fee.

1880
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:44,400
The question is the negative potential 
negative consequences of zoning?

1881
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:46,351
Um,
yeah,

1882
01:36:46,351 --> 01:36:48,030
it's a good question.
Really good question.

1883
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:49,373
Um,
well to start with it is if you impose 

1884
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,193
zoning,
it's almost certainly going to have a 

1885
01:36:56,941 --> 01:36:57,774
lot of negative consequences.
One of which is people simply won't 

1886
01:37:00,091 --> 01:37:04,170
accept it and therefore the illegal 
activities will take a,

1887
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:05,063
so the first thing about zoning is it's 
gotta be done on a consultative and 

1888
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,400
collegial and some conclusions,
the wrong word,

1889
01:37:11,401 --> 01:37:14,670
collaborative way and bringing 
stakeholders together.

1890
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:16,830
That's essential.
Otherwise,

1891
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:19,350
there's all sorts of ways around zoning.
Uh,

1892
01:37:19,351 --> 01:37:21,380
the second thing about zoning is,
um,

1893
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:23,213
if there are economic trade offs,
one has to look at that carefully 

1894
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:29,123
because there may be ways to avoid them.
And if you don't look at the economics 

1895
01:37:31,951 --> 01:37:32,784
carefully,
then you can do really dumb things with 

1896
01:37:34,471 --> 01:37:35,304
economic zone.
The third thing is if you're going to 

1897
01:37:37,591 --> 01:37:42,480
make an assertion like we have both made
tonight that we think Mbas,

1898
01:37:42,780 --> 01:37:43,613
which is a type of zoning can be helpful
in the overall issue of fisheries 

1899
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:48,174
management.

1900
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:51,750
Eventually maybe we can get away with 
saying that for a number of years,

1901
01:37:51,751 --> 01:37:52,584
maybe even decades.
Eventually we've got to show the 

1902
01:37:54,061 --> 01:37:54,894
results.
So there to be a lot of monitoring and 

1903
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:58,590
so forth as well.
Otherwise,

1904
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:01,170
it's your word against my word,
so to speak.

1905
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:04,590
And so,
so those are some of the consequences on

1906
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:07,620
the positive side.
If you do things right with zoning,

1907
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:10,740
you can actually get added value.
You can have,

1908
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,800
uh,
well give you an example.

1909
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:17,280
There was a full page ad in the paper,
uh,

1910
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,350
in and uh,
uh,

1911
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:20,363
British Columbia,
I think it was probably a number of the 

1912
01:38:21,211 --> 01:38:26,211
papers by a group of people in engaged 
in marine tourism on the discovery,

1913
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,360
uh,
Somme area,

1914
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:35,540
which is up the coast a little ways.
And the point was in this case that they

1915
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:36,384
feared a bunch of clear cutting there 
was going to totally destroy or largely 

1916
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:41,520
destroyed the potential for tourism.

1917
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:43,620
So,
um,

1918
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:44,663
you zone that you don't let that happen 
or do you just let it happen while 

1919
01:38:49,141 --> 01:38:53,430
they've got the rights to clear cutting 
and the people are saying,

1920
01:38:53,431 --> 01:38:54,810
well,
we're going to lose their livelihoods.

1921
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:57,090
People aren't going to want to come up 
and see clear cuts.

1922
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,273
Uh,
so those are things that if you do get 

1923
01:39:00,781 --> 01:39:01,614
together,
there's probably a good solution and 

1924
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:08,130
everybody gives at the end of the day.
But there's probably a solution.

1925
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,073
It's the same as that example between 
that I gave of the whales going and 

1926
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:12,683
avoiding that ship.
Legends for years there was resistance 

1927
01:39:14,521 --> 01:39:17,070
again,
there's going to be shifts crashing into

1928
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:18,870
each other and all sorts of things or it
won't work,

1929
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:20,940
work perfectly.
So.

1930
01:39:20,941 --> 01:39:22,320
So,
and that was the zoning one.

1931
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:23,154
So,
so look for the positive side of it and 

1932
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:28,890
anticipate if there are negative things,
can they be addressed?

1933
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:32,963
Yeah,

1934
01:39:32,980 --> 01:39:35,190
just from the point of view of an 
organization like Finn,

1935
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:37,360
I think,
uh,

1936
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:40,180
I read that the eye you use,
um,

1937
01:39:40,510 --> 01:39:41,343
also engage in a lot of odious behaviors
that aren't necessarily related to what 

1938
01:39:44,231 --> 01:39:45,520
you talked about tonight.
I,

1939
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:47,890
you know,
human trafficking drugs now,

1940
01:39:47,891 --> 01:39:49,360
that sort of thing.
And I'm just wondering,

1941
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:50,500
in order to help,

1942
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:52,103
uh,

1943
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:56,090
give the issue more political 
prominence,

1944
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:59,960
is there,
do you see linkages possible or possibly

1945
01:39:59,961 --> 01:40:04,250
between this issue and others that 
people that other groups or other people

1946
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:04,941
make,
you know,

1947
01:40:04,941 --> 01:40:08,870
sort of considered to be sort of trigger
ideas if you understand the question?

1948
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:10,920
So,
so the question is,

1949
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:11,873
given that there are illegal fishing 
activities in that those illegal 

1950
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:19,230
activities spill into other domains of 
the illegality light,

1951
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:21,450
perhaps drug trafficking and human 
trafficking,

1952
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:25,170
are there ways of making political 
capital out of those connections?

1953
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,670
Um,
and it's interesting that the,

1954
01:40:28,671 --> 01:40:29,361
I,
you you,

1955
01:40:29,361 --> 01:40:30,194
and I think that's relatively new,
that people have been trying to make 

1956
01:40:32,361 --> 01:40:35,330
those linkages even though we've known 
that there are linkages.

1957
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,150
Um,
I th I think,

1958
01:40:38,151 --> 01:40:40,280
uh,
the answer in quick answer is yes,

1959
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:43,230
but it has to be done very carefully.
Um,

1960
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:44,533
and it has to be done on the,
it has to be evidence based and it has 

1961
01:40:47,991 --> 01:40:48,824
to be done not just at a kind of a 
global thinking level or won't lead and 

1962
01:40:51,581 --> 01:40:55,010
where it has to be God down a very 
serious things.

1963
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:56,810
To give you one example,
um,

1964
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:00,760
in the 1980s,
um,

1965
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:06,150
the fisheries industry and south of 
Thailand really went into decline and it

1966
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:08,044
was fish docks if been over fishing and 
all they could catch her jellyfish and 

1967
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:13,000
squid.
Um,

1968
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:14,133
so,
and there's thousands of boats and so 

1969
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:16,804
many of them turned into predatory 
action against the Vietnamese refugees 

1970
01:41:19,931 --> 01:41:21,100
coming out of Vietnam.

1971
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,320
And,
and it was a terrible situation,

1972
01:41:23,321 --> 01:41:24,920
really awful.
Um,

1973
01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:28,570
well one of the things that happened was
that,

1974
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:30,850
uh,
Thailand,

1975
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,880
which was very concerned and the rest of
the world was as well,

1976
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:38,570
but tyler and decided that they would 
take on the function of turning the,

1977
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:39,413
this past industry into a processing 
industry for the world's tuna and 

1978
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:44,194
successfully managed to build a whole 
new industrial basis around taking 

1979
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:49,780
frozen tuna from everywhere in the 
world.

1980
01:41:49,781 --> 01:41:50,614
So if you look at all your canned to 
interview happened to eat tuna that 

1981
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:54,603
you'll find most of,
it's been that Camden and Thailand ever 

1982
01:41:57,341 --> 01:41:58,174
since.
So it created a new industry as it at 

1983
01:42:00,851 --> 01:42:01,684
least picked up some of the jobs and got
out of a lot of the illegal other 

1984
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:06,244
activities.
And including a lot of the illegal 

1985
01:42:07,841 --> 01:42:08,674
fisheries activities because of the ties
were also going off into Indonesian 

1986
01:42:11,201 --> 01:42:13,600
waters and elsewhere and just savaging,
uh,

1987
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:16,270
this fish docks there in terms of stocks
and so forth.

1988
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,760
So there,
there can be solutions to that.

1989
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:24,160
I think the,
on this iau you thing it's a huge issue.

1990
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,560
FAO has been very useful on it.
Um,

1991
01:42:27,610 --> 01:42:30,190
and a lot of countries are now buying in
very,

1992
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:31,133
uh,
in a very good way including many 

1993
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:35,680
developing nations.
I think we're making progress on it,

1994
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:36,933
but as a long way to go still.
And so anything that can link it to the 

1995
01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:40,804
other illegal activities,
some of which are very audience to 

1996
01:42:42,551 --> 01:42:43,890
countries,
um,

1997
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:45,010
that would be helpful.

1998
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:51,533
Uh,
aggressive activism like a sea shepherd 

1999
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:58,140
can be positive or do you think that 
that's counter productive?

2000
01:42:59,130 --> 01:43:03,360
The question is whether aggressive 
action like that of the sea shepherd can

2001
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:06,400
be productive for with her overall.
That's counter row.

2002
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:09,180
Well,
I have a personal view on this.

2003
01:43:10,170 --> 01:43:11,003
My personal view,
which is I think a agreed upon by at 

2004
01:43:12,991 --> 01:43:13,824
least some of my colleagues,
not everybody is that we need a number 

2005
01:43:16,801 --> 01:43:20,680
of different,
it is a war that's being fought and,

2006
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:21,903
and sea shepherd is,
is fighting actively on some fronts 

2007
01:43:26,941 --> 01:43:31,560
where others fear to go,
but we need people who are on the front,

2008
01:43:31,561 --> 01:43:34,230
whether it's Greenpeace,
whether it's a sea shepherd,

2009
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:36,810
whether it's people who are milder and 
their actions,

2010
01:43:36,811 --> 01:43:37,860
but still,
uh,

2011
01:43:38,010 --> 01:43:40,800
for example,
in the case of Sierra Club,

2012
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:41,693
no taking a harder stance decided which 
might include some actions that are not 

2013
01:43:45,931 --> 01:43:46,764
very nice but not on the level of going 
out and ramping ships or whatever that 

2014
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,620
of sea shepherd has been accused of.

2015
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:52,983
Um,
I think that there's a wide spectrum of 

2016
01:43:56,571 --> 01:43:59,660
things are needed,
some of which are on that far end.

2017
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,820
And I'm not,
I don't want people to be injured in the

2018
01:44:04,821 --> 01:44:09,680
process,
but they're making a point in a dramatic

2019
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:13,070
way that,
that others cannot make.

2020
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:16,160
Um,
then there are the people that,

2021
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:17,740
um,
um,

2022
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:22,400
that go out and there's lots of them go 
out and make movies.

2023
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:23,263
They go out and do active research with 
money that's raised for their cause and 

2024
01:44:28,341 --> 01:44:30,400
then the many of the NGO's fallenness 
and,

2025
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,660
and so they're not going that far,
but there's still,

2026
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,793
there's still activist,
highly activists and they're going out 

2027
01:44:36,051 --> 01:44:36,884
and they're looking at the problems 
locally and internationally and so 

2028
01:44:39,381 --> 01:44:41,360
forth.
And they're valuable.

2029
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:47,150
There's people like myself that have 
chosen to work closer to government.

2030
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,280
But I mean,
I,

2031
01:44:49,281 --> 01:44:50,114
I'd like to believe that I understand 
some things about science and I want to 

2032
01:44:53,631 --> 01:44:55,580
see that translated into public policy.

2033
01:44:56,030 --> 01:45:00,490
If I ever went out and did something 
like Seasha,

2034
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:01,333
right,
I certainly wouldn't be welcome in some 

2035
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:05,420
of the circles that I traveled with,
with government people or whatever.

2036
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:06,583
So you make choices.
And then there are scientists that 

2037
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,130
often,
um,

2038
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,770
want to remain very close to their 
science,

2039
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:13,873
uh,
whatever it happens to be and would 

2040
01:45:15,411 --> 01:45:20,120
prefer to bring that information freely 
and well out to the public and so forth,

2041
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:22,640
but not be the front liners themselves.
And,

2042
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:24,650
and so,
and then there's others as well.

2043
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:27,380
Um,
I also believe in the power of one,

2044
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,630
you know,
individuals like the school teacher.

2045
01:45:29,631 --> 01:45:31,970
And the whales in Nova Scotia,
um,

2046
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:37,300
that was just an ordinary school teacher
in a small rural school district who did

2047
01:45:37,911 --> 01:45:41,060
something that was really very,
very valuable at the time.

2048
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,800
And we can find many other examples.
I could tell you dozens of stories.

2049
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,180
There's people,
um,

2050
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:52,130
an organization that deals with 
fisheries management.

2051
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:52,983
Um,
I'm a collective sort of basis and the 

2052
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:57,920
west coast of Vancouver Island.
And they stick their necks out.

2053
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,873
They,
they work collectively between first 

2054
01:45:59,961 --> 01:46:01,190
nations,
um,

2055
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,890
and with governments,
federal,

2056
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:04,724
provincial to support,
supported from a variety of different 

2057
01:46:05,811 --> 01:46:06,644
sources.
And they manage a lot of species that 

2058
01:46:08,361 --> 01:46:10,640
are not the big flashy salmon or so 
forth,

2059
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,503
but other things.
And they're making progress in setting 

2060
01:46:14,031 --> 01:46:16,370
the basis for a new form of fisheries 
management.

2061
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:17,750
And,
and it's tough.

2062
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:18,613
Let me tell you how tough it is because 
I've looked at this organization quite 

2063
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:22,580
closely.
Uh,

2064
01:46:22,610 --> 01:46:23,331
and,
and,

2065
01:46:23,331 --> 01:46:24,164
uh,
so we need people that are activists in 

2066
01:46:26,211 --> 01:46:27,820
different ways.
Uh,

2067
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:30,590
we need people that are educators.
We need researchers,

2068
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,630
whole range.
So I,

2069
01:46:32,631 --> 01:46:33,590
I do think,
uh,

2070
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:34,543
I must admit that I have a higher degree
of respect for Paul Watson than many 

2071
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:42,830
people might have.
I think he's,

2072
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:44,070
he's shown us,
he,

2073
01:46:44,071 --> 01:46:46,160
Sean,
a lot of light into some very,

2074
01:46:46,161 --> 01:46:47,180
very dark corners.

2075
01:46:51,940 --> 01:46:52,773
Okay.
So I kind of have this legal and the 

2076
01:46:54,321 --> 01:46:57,960
same question I'm interested in how we 
could introduce this.

2077
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,880
How can I extract something on a more 
daily interaction that we have,

2078
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:06,890
you know,
like choosing the better flavor or a,

2079
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:10,200
you know,
are there any maybe way of like,

2080
01:47:10,201 --> 01:47:12,570
because with food on land,
like you know,

2081
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:14,430
quality is an important aspect.
So you can,

2082
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:15,264
I guess you could take an individual to 
a farm showing the process of what I 

2083
01:47:18,830 --> 01:47:22,080
think of choice is,
but how do you show something has this,

2084
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:26,550
I mean we don't have the same connection
with the fish because we could.

2085
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:29,930
Sure.
So is there another way of educating and

2086
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:31,260
what genuinely the public

2087
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:33,660
wasn't?
He picked the first try,

2088
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:34,240
you know,
you're,

2089
01:47:34,240 --> 01:47:37,800
you're a person who deals with 
behavioral psychology sorts of things.

2090
01:47:37,801 --> 01:47:38,634
I think,
which of this is all about psychology 

2091
01:47:41,011 --> 01:47:44,080
and behavior has been,
well the question is consumerism.

2092
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:48,030
What can you know what can be done to 
link these issues to behavior on a,

2093
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:50,110
at a local level,
um,

2094
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:52,920
you don't have something.

2095
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:54,193
Maybe if there's like a project that you
have or there already is circulating 

2096
01:47:57,770 --> 01:47:59,780
that maybe we can take people.
Oh yeah,

2097
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:02,670
he can be like,
because this is an intellectual talk how

2098
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:03,504
let's say,
and I can't really voice this 

2099
01:48:05,811 --> 01:48:10,190
information process adequately.
So maybe if I can point individually.

2100
01:48:10,570 --> 01:48:11,270
Well,
I,

2101
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:12,103
the only,
the only real effective means of 

2102
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:15,543
changing individual behavior that I 
think would actually work is for people 

2103
01:48:18,941 --> 01:48:22,540
to write their nps and the members of 
the cabinet.

2104
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:23,913
Because believe it or not,
politicians actually pay attention to 

2105
01:48:25,931 --> 01:48:26,764
letters.
And so a lot of what we've talked about 

2106
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:30,963
tonight,
especially the marine protected areas 

2107
01:48:31,841 --> 01:48:36,340
issue isn't going to be moved forward 
unless the politician sense that there's

2108
01:48:36,341 --> 01:48:39,160
actual public demand,
like the frameworks already there,

2109
01:48:39,161 --> 01:48:40,720
right?
They've signed the treaties and so on.

2110
01:48:40,721 --> 01:48:43,300
But the way they're reading the 
population is,

2111
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,193
it's perfectly okay to ignore that.
And the only way to change that as far 

2112
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:49,354
as I can tell is to indicate that it's 
actually not okay to ignore it because 

2113
01:48:53,441 --> 01:48:54,910
right now it is okay.
And,

2114
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:58,930
and that's not good.
Our political system actually does work.

2115
01:48:59,110 --> 01:48:59,943
It's much more permeable than people 
really think because in some ways it's 

2116
01:49:04,031 --> 01:49:05,680
left to its own devices.

2117
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:06,543
You know,
most people don't really participate in 

2118
01:49:08,111 --> 01:49:11,050
the political system,
so it leaves it in the hands of the very

2119
01:49:11,051 --> 01:49:11,884
small minority who do,
but it's surprisingly permeable if 

2120
01:49:15,401 --> 01:49:18,760
you're interested in permeating it.
And so while that's,

2121
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:20,750
that's my take,
at least at the political level,

2122
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,170
that's one.
Uh,

2123
01:49:22,230 --> 01:49:24,130
let,
let me give you four or five things that

2124
01:49:24,131 --> 01:49:25,940
I think are really useful.
Uh,

2125
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,520
one is,
uh,

2126
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:29,120
if you have the trust in them,
uh,

2127
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:30,013
these seafood guides are very helpful 
and so you can use those in your own 

2128
01:49:34,481 --> 01:49:36,670
personal life.
And if you go into a restaurant,

2129
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:39,460
uh,
ask them has this,

2130
01:49:39,550 --> 01:49:42,910
and if you happen to enjoy fish,
ask them,

2131
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:45,520
tell me about this fish.
What is a species?

2132
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:48,340
Where was it captured from?
Um,

2133
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,850
what is it certified fish that you're 
serving?

2134
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:54,490
Ask the chef to come out and talk to 
you.

2135
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:55,503
I've done that.

2136
01:49:55,820 --> 01:49:56,331
And,
and,

2137
01:49:56,331 --> 01:50:01,331
and go in if you use an ipad or an 
iphone and challenge them on some things

2138
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:04,120
when they say they don't know,
they,

2139
01:50:04,121 --> 01:50:04,954
there's no information.
And then I did this once in a very 

2140
01:50:08,411 --> 01:50:10,600
respectable restaurant in Vancouver and 
I warned them,

2141
01:50:10,601 --> 01:50:11,081
I said,
look,

2142
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:14,340
I'm bringing a group of people who are 
leaders in this whole seafood process.

2143
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,730
They're going to have all sorts of 
questions.

2144
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:16,863
So I brought my ipad was brand new in 
those days and did this come out six 

2145
01:50:19,421 --> 01:50:20,254
months before and we sat down and half 
an hour by the time that the poor chefs 

2146
01:50:25,661 --> 01:50:26,494
were sweating and let me tie,
but they answered all the questions 

2147
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:28,953
correctly.
We got all information and we got past 

2148
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:31,624
all these fancy names and so forth.
So that's what another way in dealing 

2149
01:50:34,871 --> 01:50:37,510
with the food industry do it at a 
supermarket.

2150
01:50:37,810 --> 01:50:42,040
If you're not getting good answers right
to the president of the company and say,

2151
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:42,874
you know,
I was in whatever chain had happened to 

2152
01:50:44,561 --> 01:50:45,394
be local or national and,
and I could not get any answer above 

2153
01:50:48,521 --> 01:50:51,970
whether the crowd that you're serving 
with sustainably produced.

2154
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,500
Can you tell me?
And if they can't go after them and say,

2155
01:50:56,530 --> 01:50:57,570
please,
I really want to,

2156
01:50:57,571 --> 01:50:58,404
not an honest answer,
but I'll bet you the answer and you'll 

2157
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:04,000
make your decisions.
And a third way is,

2158
01:51:04,001 --> 01:51:04,834
as you say,
go to the politicians and keep going to 

2159
01:51:06,761 --> 01:51:07,594
the politicians.
Find out who the politicians locally 

2160
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:10,654
are,
the really have an interest in the 

2161
01:51:11,771 --> 01:51:12,604
subject because there are little 
clusters of people that don't get very 

2162
01:51:15,341 --> 01:51:17,830
much support in both the Senate and in 
the house.

2163
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,903
There really are interested in they 
cross party lines and some of these 

2164
01:51:20,891 --> 01:51:22,600
things as well.
Um,

2165
01:51:22,630 --> 01:51:25,350
and so that's another way of doing it.
But go to this.

2166
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:28,210
I think that unsustainable development 
in general,

2167
01:51:28,240 --> 01:51:29,073
we have to go to the cities and what's 
anything but Toronto and political 

2168
01:51:33,821 --> 01:51:36,490
system right now and how much this would
come up to the top.

2169
01:51:36,490 --> 01:51:39,740
But I know certainly in the West Coast 
and uh,

2170
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:41,290
I think a lot of places in the east 
coast,

2171
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:42,124
it's very central.
People will talk about it to you and 

2172
01:51:44,261 --> 01:51:46,210
they are the places where action is 
taking,

2173
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:49,690
taking on interesting approaches.
Uh,

2174
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,553
the next one is to figure out,
and you can only do this yourself by 

2175
01:51:55,450 --> 01:51:56,283
looking at different organizations,
decide which organizations you're going 

2176
01:51:59,321 --> 01:52:00,154
to support and support them in ways,
not just maybe giving them some money 

2177
01:52:03,191 --> 01:52:05,710
from time to time,
but ask how you can help because,

2178
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:06,660
uh,
it,

2179
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,950
just to give you a couple of examples,
world wildlife fund,

2180
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:12,520
a Canadian parks and wilderness society 
both have excellent,

2181
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:16,010
excellent people that need support,
you know,

2182
01:52:16,011 --> 01:52:16,844
and not just money,
but they need people behind them in 

2183
01:52:19,751 --> 01:52:21,510
various ways.
And there's various things.

2184
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,720
Uh,
and I guess finally if you have children

2185
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:28,630
will have children or whatever,
work with kids.

2186
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:34,170
Kids genuinely want to do things better.
They understand kids,

2187
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:36,370
you know,
you're cute animal.

2188
01:52:36,630 --> 01:52:39,870
Well I was a bit insulted about that 
fish that your child.

2189
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:46,180
But I thought it was kind cute myself 
but,

2190
01:52:46,210 --> 01:52:47,090
but uh,
uh,

2191
01:52:47,390 --> 01:52:48,223
the important point is that kids love 
whales are our little granddaughter 

2192
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:54,440
who's eight years old.
And she proudly announces,

2193
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:57,670
oh I'm doing a research project on a 
Pacific Dolphin.

2194
01:52:58,090 --> 01:52:59,870
And,
and by the time she finished that thing,

2195
01:52:59,871 --> 01:53:03,170
she knew a lot about Pacific dolphins 
help people that way,

2196
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,330
you know,
get at young people,

2197
01:53:05,480 --> 01:53:06,313
young people who really want to because 
they are upset by these things and they 

2198
01:53:09,471 --> 01:53:11,930
see it.
There's a lot of stuff on television and

2199
01:53:11,931 --> 01:53:12,764
so forth.
The Internet and they are getting done 

2200
01:53:14,811 --> 01:53:17,660
that there's a problem and they happened
to love these things.

2201
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:18,494
They love dolphins,
they love seals and they decided the 

2202
01:53:20,811 --> 01:53:21,644
other certainly whales and uh,
they can't understand why these things 

2203
01:53:25,161 --> 01:53:28,700
are in trouble or the fish that they 
might eat her in trouble.

2204
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,863
So those are some concrete ways that you
can actually address this and keep that 

2205
01:53:33,620 --> 01:53:36,320
list in mind as you move ahead with Finn
as well.

2206
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,610
Cause I think it's a really important 
question when I'm talking and we all are

2207
01:53:40,611 --> 01:53:42,410
talking that may maybe a bit abstract 
they hear,

2208
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:45,970
but in each case,
you can bring these things down to,

2209
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,180
uh,
to real life.

2210
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:51,650
Another one on the west coast,
just to give you a nonstop on this.

2211
01:53:51,651 --> 01:53:54,950
But if you go to any school around 
Victoria,

2212
01:53:54,951 --> 01:53:58,400
