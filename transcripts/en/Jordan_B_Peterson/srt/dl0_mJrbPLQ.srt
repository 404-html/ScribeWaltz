1
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,190
We've had written history for 5,000 
years.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,560
People have been generally literate for 
less than 500 years,

3
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:47,740
but we've had culture for 150,000 years 
identifiable culture for at least 25,000

4
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:56,071
so the vast period of our enculturation 
was preliterate in culturation before we

5
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:59,380
could write down the rules and transmit 
them.

6
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,410
How were they transmitted?
Assuming we had culture?

7
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:05,200
Well,
there's a variety of mechanisms.

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,633
We have a tendency to see elements of 
the world in personified form because 

9
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:11,464
most of the interrelationships we have 
with the world are actually social or 

10
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:15,544
interpersonal relationships.
So that's basically how our brain is 

11
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,760
structured.
And as we evolved,

12
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,983
we develop the capacity to extend our 
cognitive ability beyond the merely 

13
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,344
social to take in the world as such.
But the categories that we use to do 

14
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,020
that,
we're still fundamentally social.

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,123
Now.
The reason the unknown per se is 

16
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:36,340
symbolized his feminine is because the 
critical feature of the feminine,

17
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:40,300
and I don't mean the female individual,
I mean the feminine as a category is its

18
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,490
capacity to generate new forms.

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,593
And the unknown is such as as logically 
and appropriately symbolized by the 

20
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:52,420
feminine because it's the bringer.
Fourth of all things,

21
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,270
which is to say that the background of 
existence,

22
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:56,104
the unknowable background of existence 
is the thing that generates everything 

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
paired with that,
of course,

24
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,830
according to the Schema that we've been 
working with,

25
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,310
uh,
is the archetype of the great father.

26
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,880
And the archetype of the great father is
the archetype of tradition.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,970
Fundamentally the great weight of the 
past.

28
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,500
Because as you incorporate your past,
the past of your culture,

29
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:19,540
through the intermediation of your 
parents,

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,560
you learn routines and rituals for 
structuring the unknown.

31
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,423
Now those are routines and rituals are 
patterns of action that you use in the 

32
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:31,990
world as such.
And also complex patterns of action that

33
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:32,824
you use to structure your own 
interpretations and your own motor 

34
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:38,920
output and your own conceptualizations 
when you're dealing with other people.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,753
And so that would be the absorption fund
most fundamentally of your cultural 

36
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:43,834
rules and the fact of those cultural 
rules and their incarnation in you 

37
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:53,070
essentially keeps chaos at bay.
Which means if two of you share the same

38
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,320
cultural structure,
assuming you're playing the same game,

39
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:57,154
so to speak,
that means that you can each predict 

40
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,490
each responses,
which is very,

41
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,324
very useful because that way you,
you can be sure that you can trust the 

42
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:04,894
other person.
You can more or less in further goals 

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,193
because after all,
their value structure of similar to 

44
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,384
yours and if you can infer their goals,
that means you can embody their 

45
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,624
emotions.
So that's the benevolent aspect of 

46
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,451
tradition,
right?

47
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,670
The part that protects and shelters you 
instructors,

48
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,030
the nature of your being in the face of,
of existential terror and doubts,

49
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:23,864
so to speak,
but there's also an aspect of tradition 

50
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:29,590
that's terrible,
a tyrannical,

51
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:33,990
it's the part that marches young men off
towards say in defense of the structures

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,930
that it's protecting.

53
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,063
It's the part that says,
when you're a teenager where this and 

54
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,154
not this,
or you'll be the target of mockery for 

55
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,854
all your peers.
It's the part of the structure that 

56
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,554
crushes the creative life out of you 
because the tyrannical aspect of social 

57
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,250
order doesn't want your creative light 
life,

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,113
so to speak.
What it wants is your obedience because 

59
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,490
you're a bds is what makes the machine 
run smooth.

60
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
And so you're always in an ambivalent 
relationship with regards to security to

61
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
authority.
On the one hand it provides you shelter 

62
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,294
and what you need and allows you to gain
the benefits of literally thousands and 

63
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,670
thousands of years of cultural 
evolution.

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,743
On the other hand,
it's the thing that makes you obey or 

65
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,150
face the painful consequences thereof,
which can range from,

66
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,223
you know,
mere social exclusion and consequent 

67
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,730
re-exposure to the unknown,
to,

68
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,743
to truly oppressive practices designed 
to make you be exactly like everyone 

69
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,304
else or else.
And so you could say most particularly 

70
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,703
again,
that that's a standard existential 

71
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:40,870
problem.
It's a problem that's faced by people in

72
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:42,520
every place,
in every culture,

73
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,640
balancing the appropriate attitude 
towards culture.

74
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,623
So the most fundamental representation 
of culture can be portrayed essentially 

75
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,210
in this manner,
I think.

76
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,643
And uh,
what you see here is the dragon of 

77
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:01,590
chaos,
of course,

78
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,424
lurking in the background.
And what that means is that all forms 

79
00:05:04,591 --> 00:05:09,390
come from the formless and that the 
farther itself is a primary form,

80
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,840
a representation of God.
The father and God,

81
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:17,490
the father in the Christian Trinity is 
the representation of the positive end,

82
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,533
the security inducing,
and the tyrannical aspect of social 

83
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:21,931
order,
right?

84
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:22,764
God has a set of rules for you.
You bloody well better listen to those 

85
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,170
rules if you don't all hell's gonna 
break loose.

86
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,004
And you know,
that's a pretty reasonable summary of 

87
00:05:30,301 --> 00:05:34,320
how things work unfortunately.
So on the one hand God offers security.

88
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:35,154
On the other hand,
he offers tyranny and in total that 

89
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:38,244
basically represents orders.
So you can see this representation is 

90
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,760
quite useful.

91
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,020
Chose God's standing over this city,
which of course is a city,

92
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,430
uh,
uh,

93
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,323
committed to him fundamentally.
So it operates under the moral 

94
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:51,954
principles that he represents.
And behind him is a representation of 

95
00:05:54,391 --> 00:05:55,224
the sun,
which is partly a representation of the 

96
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,850
source of all life,
partly a representation of the source of

97
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,580
consciousness and illumination,
right?

98
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:06,200
Cause you're conscious during the day 
and partly,

99
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:06,830
uh,
uh,

100
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,430
Halo representing the sort of 
transcendent nature of the,

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,760
of the social order that structure,
structures existence.

102
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,120
So it's a primary phenomenon and it's 
only to say that in all human experience

103
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,624
there's a cultural aspect and a natural 
aspect and the funny thing is the 

104
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,164
cultural aspect.
In some ways this as natural as the 

105
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:27,890
natural aspect,
right?

106
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:31,550
Because we're social beings,
we can't exist without society.

107
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,670
Society structures are very nature.
Ben and were beneficiaries and victims

108
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,870
and so then just as the case just as is 
the case with the

109
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,203
feminine,
there's a two aspects that can be 

110
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:54,310
represented metaphorically with regards 
to the masculine.

111
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,390
You can say,
well,

112
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,600
the security aspect of social order is 
the wise king and you could see medieval

113
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,443
representation of a mirror sitting on 
his throne calmly in a relatively open 

114
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:05,614
posture.
That means he's ready to listen to sub 

115
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,340
to supplicants to people who are coming 
to talk to him.

116
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,460
He's holding an orb with a cross on top 
of it,

117
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:13,294
which means essentially that he's in 
control of the world and the world is 

118
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,790
subordinated to something else that's 
represented by the cross,

119
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,913
a wise and just ruler and then his 
mirror image here is the sun devouring 

120
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:27,550
king.
A very common mythological theme.

121
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,533
The father who wants to destroy his son.
And there's shades of the eatable 

122
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:34,090
conflict in that of course,
if you remember your Freud.

123
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,163
But basically what it means is this,
is that despite the fact that every 

124
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:41,380
human being is an offspring of culture 
by nature,

125
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:42,723
um,
every human being is also in the 

126
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:46,114
terrible position of facing the fact 
that they're very individuality is 

127
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:52,660
likely to be crushed out of them during,
during the socialization process.

128
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:54,480
And that in a sense,
that's really not an,

129
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,470
that's really not avoidable.
I mean,

130
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,500
if you're subject to really tear radical
socialization,

131
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:02,380
it's obviously a much more cardinal 
problem,

132
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,214
right?
But even if you're subject to 

133
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:06,340
socialization under normal 
circumstances,

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,353
you are still what you are rather than 
the manifold things that you could have 

135
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,100
otherwise been.
And,

136
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:12,934
and,
and just to give you some sense of how 

137
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,064
dramatic a process this really is,
one of the things you should know is 

138
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,164
that you actually die into your brain.
So one of the things you might wonder 

139
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,270
is,
why is,

140
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,010
why is it the death evolved?

141
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,843
It,
it doesn't really make that much sense 

142
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,950
from a Darwinian perspective,
right?

143
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,784
Because you'd make the presupposition 
that if you could just stick around and 

144
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:37,390
farther children safe for 250 years,
you'd be doing a lot better job than the

145
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,224
poor sap who only live to be 30 so why 
is it that you only live to be 70 and 

146
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,030
really your,
you know,

147
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:46,990
your period of fertility is say by the 
time you're 40 why would that be?

148
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,200
What's the utility of death?
And then you remember,

149
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,140
well the environment's always changing,
right?

150
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,040
In this chaotic manner that's 
represented the great mother,

151
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,200
can you change with it?
And the answer to that is yes,

152
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,130
but only to a certain point,
which is why as people age,

153
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:08,700
they stay tend to become more and more 
alienated from the current culture,

154
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,534
right?
They've,

155
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:12,870
they've adopted their position of being 
say,

156
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,870
which is a word more or less fixed by 
the time they're 25 or so.

157
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,363
Once their prefrontal cortex matures and
then after that the world gets away 

158
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,904
from,
they don't have enough biological 

159
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,721
resources left to constantly undergo new
revolutionary neurological processes.

160
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:31,740
And part of the reason is this,
you have more neural connections in your

161
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,810
brain.
When you're first born,

162
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,110
then you do for the rest of your life 
any other time in your life.

163
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,280
And as you learn when you're an infant 
and as you learn,

164
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,133
say over the first two years,
what happens is that there's a 

165
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:44,274
plentitude of circuits and they die off 
leaving only those circuits that have a 

166
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:49,710
function.
And you think about that,

167
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,544
it's kind of a quasi Darwinian process.
And so what that means is that as you 

168
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:56,370
mature and become fixed in your form,
you know,

169
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,400
to adopt your personality,
whatever it becomes,

170
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,803
what's happening is that the excess 
possibility in some sense is being 

171
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,080
demolished by experience.

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,153
So the [inaudible] aspect of 
enculturation is something that's real 

173
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,150
because it makes you in large part what 
you are.

174
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,223
And you have to understand as well that 
that's necessary because it's better to 

175
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,364
be something in the final analysis.
It's better to be something than to be 

176
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:27,060
nothing.
But you know,

177
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:31,240
we still have residual dreams like those
expressed by Peter Pan,

178
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:32,074
say who's the boy that never wants to 
grow up because he doesn't want to 

179
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,944
attain any final and fixed form.
And it's interesting because in one 

180
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,490
respect,
as you progress through your life,

181
00:10:41,491 --> 00:10:43,710
you're climbing,
assuming things are going well,

182
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,010
you're climbing to ever new heights.
But on the other hand,

183
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:47,844
the,
the direction that you're going in 

184
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:53,130
constantly narrows as you age.
So there's a real trade off there.

185
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:53,570
And,
and,

186
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,403
and I think the existential angst that's
caused as a consequence of that trade 

187
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:59,190
off is often real.

188
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,360
And I also think that adolescents in 
early adults feel this most intently,

189
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:04,194
which is part of the reason why they 
tend to rebel against social structures 

190
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,460
in general.
You know,

191
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,294
the,
whether it's the military industrial 

192
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:13,860
complex or the corporate world or 
globalization or what have you,

193
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:14,694
is that you have these large structures 
that represent the tier radical aspect 

194
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:19,110
of social being.
And,

195
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,350
and it's no wonder that the fact of 
those structures in genders rebellion,

196
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,400
it should.
On the other hand,

197
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,710
it's also no wonder that structures like
that exist.

198
00:11:28,711 --> 00:11:29,544
Because if they didn't exist,
then people would have no way of 

199
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,410
interrelating there,
their social being.

200
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,244
And we would revert back to the sort of 
hobbsy and state of war where 

201
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:41,160
everybody's arms are around.
Everybody else's throat.

202
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,560
That doesn't mean the payoff is always 
good.

203
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,130
So for the Floridians,
of course,

204
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:48,760
had a real field day with this,
and,

205
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:49,594
and we're,
we're most fundamentally concerned by 

206
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:52,134
it.

207
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,003
Now,
part of the reason that Friday and 

208
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,424
psychology,
he's had such an immense impact on 

209
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,310
western and world cultures because Freud
came along just when classical,

210
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,890
Judeo Christian mythological structures 
were on the,

211
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:07,000
on a serious decline in the west.
And Freud stepped in with a secularized,

212
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:11,110
mythological version version of reality,
which said,

213
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,630
well,
there's nature knocks the Ed,

214
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:14,464
right?
That's the wild and untamed impulses 

215
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:18,310
that spring up from,
from the animal mind.

216
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,060
And there's the ego,
which is the individual who's,

217
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,910
who's in many ways a pawn of these ed 
like forces.

218
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,540
And then on top of the ego,
crushing it down into the Ed,

219
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,020
so to speak,
is the Superego,

220
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,200
which is the,
uh,

221
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:35,110
internal and external embodiment of 
social order and morality.

222
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,980
So you can see the mythological 
substructure underlying Freud.

223
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,843
Freud said,
well,

224
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,100
the ego is always being shaped by the 
superego.

225
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,270
And it's always compulsion.

226
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,800
It's don't,
don't,

227
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,060
it's always,
no,

228
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,890
it's like Old Testament morality.
Right?

229
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,320
And the incarnation of the 10 
Commandments,

230
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,150
whatever you want to do.
If it feels good,

231
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:52,984
the probability is high,
that it's immoral from the perspective 

232
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:55,894
of the social world.
And you can really see this with 

233
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:58,360
children.
You know,

234
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,350
it's really remarkable to watch them 
because my sense is,

235
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:06,010
and I don't think this is just because 
I'm a particularly tyrannical farther,

236
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,143
is that children often get in more 
trouble for having fun and they do for 

237
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,164
any other reason because their capacity 
for unbridled enjoyment is so unbridled 

238
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,250
that it actually poses a threat to 
orderly structure.

239
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:19,084
So you know,
if a child really gets into inactive 

240
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,020
mood and is playing a very active game,
I mean,

241
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,600
especially if they're are somewhere 
between say three and five,

242
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,910
they can tear your house to shreds and 
no times,

243
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,870
no time flat.

244
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,240
And you're always following them around 
going,

245
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,173
no,
no,

246
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,200
no,
quiet down.

247
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,520
Don't do that.
And you know,

248
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,354
they're smiling away and they're happier
than any adult you're ever going to see 

249
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:37,444
in your entire life.
And you're doing everything you can to 

250
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:39,844
push them down so that they can sit 
quietly and read a book or whatever it 

251
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:45,700
is you think they should be doing.
And that's really nasty and horrible.

252
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:46,534
But by the same token,
it's absolutely necessary because if 

253
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,830
they don't learn to bring their 
impulses,

254
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,110
even their impulses,
they're ludic impulses,

255
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:55,510
right?
Their impulses to play under control,

256
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,344
then nobody else can stand them.
And if they don't get access to the 

257
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:00,910
resources that are in the social world,
man,

258
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,980
they have one dismal life laid out in 
front of them.

259
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,814
So anyway,
so that's an early description of the 

260
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:09,640
genesis of the conflict,
say between the ego and the superego.

261
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,910
And I just wanted to point that out 
because it's not just sex and aggression

262
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,290
that gets regulated,
right?

263
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,420
I mean,
we can understand why that might happen,

264
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,553
but it's also playfulness and creativity
and spontaneity and all the things that 

265
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:25,531
we associated with the joy of being that
the terrible tyrannical social structure

266
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,320
puts a clamp on.
So Jaak Panksepp for example,

267
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:32,350
has recently demonstrated that children,
boys,

268
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,220
because it's usually boys who have 
attention deficit disorder,

269
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:39,190
which is generally diagnosed in the 
schoolroom,

270
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,680
do much better if they're placed on 
methylphenidate,

271
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,470
which is a kind of a amphetamine 
fundamentally.

272
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:47,080
But normal kids do better on 
amphetamines too.

273
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,700
By the way.
They can focus better,

274
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,980
they can focus more and they can pay 
attention more.

275
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Mostly what methylphenidate does is 
suppress play.

276
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,990
So panksepp's notion is that,
well,

277
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:00,020
what's happening with these adhd kids,
hyperactive kids,

278
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:02,270
is they're more playful,
more,

279
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,104
more boisterously playful,
which is tends to be a masculine 

280
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:05,990
attribute.

281
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,450
And in the juvenile forms of many 
mammals,

282
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:09,284
they're boisterously playful,
give them a little meth methylphenidate 

283
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:15,080
that shuts down their play behavior and 
they can sit down and focus,

284
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,220
you know,
and well,

285
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:19,430
you can understand how,
even if you might think that's necessary

286
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:20,264
because apparently many people do.
You can also still understand that by 

287
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,494
the same token,
that probably represents some kind of 

288
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:27,110
loss,
right?

289
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:30,290
Because we like to see kids play and 
it's good for them besides,

290
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,190
so anyways,
Freud says the ego pops up.

291
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,780
It's all thrilled to death with the 
world.

292
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:36,614
The superego comes along and shuts it 
down and now it's a faith that befalls 

293
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,093
all of us.
And not only that because Freud's a 

294
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,400
pretty wise man,
all things considered,

295
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,410
he doesn't say that's a whole to the 
bad.

296
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,910
He says that's the price we pay for 
social being.

297
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,040
And Fair enough,

298
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,743
you see this happening in children all 
the time where part of what they do as 

299
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,784
they mature as to adopt rules so they'll
play being a father or being a mother 

300
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,863
say and what they're doing is pulling in
what they see as as the world view that 

301
00:16:06,651 --> 00:16:10,280
characterizes parenthood,
embodying the farther,

302
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,143
playing out the role and trying to 
organize their motivational structures 

303
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,074
within the observed framework say that 
the father provides and that's an 

304
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:18,944
introjection of social wisdom.
If you can imagine that the role of 

305
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:26,000
fathers say has a structure,
like one structure would be,

306
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,060
well if you're a father and you're 
around to model,

307
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,580
then you have to be taken care of the 
children.

308
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:32,414
Or at least you have to be there often 
enough so that you can be a target of 

309
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,223
modeling.
And so you can imagine that the spirit 

310
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:42,200
of the father that's modeled,
at least in the optimal circumstances is

311
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,034
one that deals out rules in order,
but that also provides nurturing care 

312
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:47,630
and support.

313
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,860
And that's a kind of story.
We know fathers who aren't like that and

314
00:16:51,861 --> 00:16:54,050
maybe we know fathers who are too much 
like that,

315
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,570
but all things considered on the 
average,

316
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,404
you have a father role and children 
attempt to interject that and that's 

317
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:02,264
part of the way that they learn to 
modulate their own motivation and 

318
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,540
resources.
So for example,

319
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,890
if the child observes the father and the
mother sharing,

320
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:13,250
which means taking each other's 
motivational states into account,

321
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,730
then they can act out the game of 
sharing with a doll,

322
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:17,564
say representing a child.
And what they're doing is trying to 

323
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:23,030
imagine what it's like inside that 
doll's head.

324
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:23,923
Treating it like a person by embodying 
the potential motivations and emotional 

325
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:30,410
states of that pretend to object in 
their own body.

326
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,560
And then by trying to organize a higher 
order structure,

327
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:34,394
which would be like the tea party where 
Tia shared a higher order structure 

328
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,624
where you have a turn because you want 
to turn because you're thirsty like me 

329
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,733
and then I have a turn and we both get 
what we want and we can exchange 

330
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:45,914
information.

331
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Well that's a little bit more optimistic
of the tyranny of social order than pure

332
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,590
compulsion.
Right?

333
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,424
Because what it suggests is there's a 
way that you can organize the way you 

334
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,594
are genuinely and the way I am genuinely
so that we both are genuine yet we get 

335
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:07,290
something more than we would get if we 
were just by ourselves.

336
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,124
And so you think that with kids they 
like to play by themselves but by the 

337
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:13,890
time they were about three and a half or
four boy,

338
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,783
like they have a hunger for other 
children and they will do anything in 

339
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,650
order to go out and play with other 
kids.

340
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:21,450
So you can say to them,
well if you,

341
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,990
if you take all the toys off your bed,
I'll go let you play with your friend.

342
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:25,824
And like the toys are off there in two 
tenths of a second and they're out the 

343
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:31,980
door because they have this primary need
to go out and experiment with the social

344
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:36,300
world and in large way in large part,
that's how they build the complex higher

345
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,134
order,
more abstract structures that enabled 

346
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,040
them to regulate their motivated.

347
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,880
They're motivational states and their 
emotional states without just,

348
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,360
no,
it's,

349
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,810
it's a more sophisticated way of doing 
it,

350
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:49,644
right?
It's better to play a game with someone 

351
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:55,260
then to engage in a battle of wills with
them because then there's no compulsion.

352
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,363
There's just mutual participation.
And that's critical because one of the 

353
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:04,701
things that the notion of the tyranny of
the social order brings up as a question

354
00:19:05,101 --> 00:19:05,611
is,
all right,

355
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,400
all right,
so you have to take part in society,

356
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,623
right?
You have take your part in the social 

357
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,590
world,
yet the social world wants it's pound of

358
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:18,591
flesh or it's 60 pounds of flesh 
depending on where you live on the one.

359
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:22,680
So you're damned if you do so to speak 
and you're damned if you don't.

360
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,520
What do you do as a consequence of 
facing that challenge?

361
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:30,690
And so you remember with the great 
mother with chaos and the unknown,

362
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,883
the way you meet,
the challenges to understand that the 

363
00:19:33,901 --> 00:19:36,810
things you don't understand are 
dangerous and frightening,

364
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,320
and that if you encounter them,
they can hurt you and that this is real,

365
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,990
but you don't run away all the same,
right?

366
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:46,190
If you're trying to get somewhere and 
things you don't understand happen,

367
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,033
you can't shut yourself down.
You have to explore cautiously and try 

368
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:51,390
to gain new knowledge.

369
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,140
How do you organize your social being?
Well,

370
00:19:59,141 --> 00:19:59,974
let's make the presupposition that 
you've got half a dozen or so 

371
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,410
fundamental motivational states,
right?

372
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:10,240
So what they are is your subjugation to 
a world of a priori.

373
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,900
Daddy's right?
You see in children rage,

374
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,850
fear,
hunger,

375
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,250
anger,
affiliation,

376
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,780
love the capacity to play all value 
sets,

377
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,640
which have their own goal,
like behavioral patterns,

378
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:30,340
their own worldview,
their own way of manifesting themselves.

379
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,780
All those are innate,
right?

380
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:36,610
They're all dependent on prewired neural
architectural systems.

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,690
They have to unfold inexperienced,
but they're there,

382
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,683
okay?
And so let's say that's what you come 

383
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:44,140
into the world with and that's what you 
come into the world with and that's what

384
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:44,974
you come into the world with.
But then the fact that you're in the 

385
00:20:46,661 --> 00:20:50,470
world poses a more complex problem,
which is,

386
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,543
well yeah,
you've got one motivational state 

387
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:54,640
happening,
you're angry,

388
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,010
but then you've got another one you have
to worry about,

389
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:00,400
which is you'd like to be affiliated 
with someone like your sibling.

390
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,440
So you've got a real conflict with your 
sibling.

391
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:03,274
It's like you really hate them,
but you really liked them too and you 

392
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,170
want to play with them.
So what do you do about that?

393
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,303
Well,
you'd say a behaviorally dysregulated 

394
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,080
child who isn't well socialized,
say they're impulsive,

395
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,453
they don't,
they don't act as if they take the 

396
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,110
future into account.
So they heavily future discount.

397
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,700
They're impulsive.
What does that mean?

398
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,100
Do you watch a child have a temper 
tantrum?

399
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:26,380
Which around too,
they're really prone to.

400
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,540
It's like it's a phenomenon.
You know,

401
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:33,430
it's like a tornado on a real small 
scale in the child's just flipped out.

402
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,100
If you saw an adult do that,
you'd run away screaming,

403
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:40,060
right?
And they're completely dominated by this

404
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:40,894
emotional state.
And my sense watching that has always 

405
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:44,644
been to kind of try to help the kid not 
have that happen to them because it 

406
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:49,750
looks like a terrible catastrophe for 
their emerging eagle,

407
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:49,990
right?

408
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,823
I mean,
they're trying to get their world 

409
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,564
together and something frustrates them 
and womp up come these like a Mig delek 

410
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:56,884
projections that are governing anger,
hypothalamic even more primitive and 

411
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:04,240
just like bull them over and then 
they're on the floor and they're holding

412
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,190
their breath and they're turning blue 
and they're having a fit.

413
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,590
And then it takes him like 15 minutes to
recover.

414
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,840
So they have to take themselves into 
account as total as complete beings.

415
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,090
And that's the emergence of a higher 
order morality.

416
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:16,924
But it's more complicated than that 
because not only do they have the 

417
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:21,550
problem of themselves,
which is a bad enough problem,

418
00:22:21,551 --> 00:22:23,860
but then they have the problem of the 
other person.

419
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,563
So what's the proper response of the 
individual given that he or she is 

420
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:30,544
threatened by the natural world and the 
unknown on the left hand and threatened 

421
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:37,480
by the social order and it's tyranny on 
the right hand,

422
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,853
but also dependent on the natural world 
and chaos for all good things and all 

423
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:46,780
new information and dependent on the 
social order for their very motive being

424
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,890
caught between four paradox is all at 
the same time.

425
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,270
How can that route b property 
negotiated?

426
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,433
Well,
and then you can look at hero mythology 

427
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,563
and the most tarman plot,
and I would say in some ways the only 

428
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,464
plot,
although there are variations of this 

429
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:11,851
that are endless romantic variations or 
adventure story variations or variations

430
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:13,174
of failed heroic endeavor.
Still the only plot goes something like 

431
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:17,614
this.
There's a current state of being now 

432
00:23:20,271 --> 00:23:23,230
that can be represented by a 
psychological state,

433
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,770
your current personality,
it can be represented by your family.

434
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,070
It can be re represented by your 
extended social group,

435
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,690
your city,
your town,

436
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,210
your country,
your ecosystem.

437
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,470
You're,
you're,

438
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,730
you're in science fiction frequently.
The entire global community,

439
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,300
right?
A structure is threatened by what?

440
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,320
Well,
you name it,

441
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,440
if it's dangerous,
it can threaten the structure.

442
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,920
Now it can be one of various forms of 
barbarian,

443
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:52,754
right?
Any person from another culture and 

444
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,060
alien in science fiction.

445
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,163
Uh,
a terrible monster that lives in the 

446
00:23:58,341 --> 00:23:59,174
deep that had been dominated and no 
press before but has come back for more 

447
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,213
an agent of horror.
That's a common theme in modern horror 

448
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:07,454
movies,
right?

449
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,230
And object that moves the ghosts in the 
basement because the dad were improperly

450
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:13,680
buried,
et Cetera,

451
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:14,930
et Cetera,
et cetera.

452
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,390
Anything uncanny,
anything fear,

453
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,610
inspiring,
anything Reptilian,

454
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,123
um,
anything that smothers or in trances or 

455
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,113
seduces or you name it.
If it's change or some metaphoric 

456
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,350
representation of anything that can 
change,

457
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,573
then it's this the dragon of chaos.
And that's the thing that always 

458
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,204
threatens the stable state.
And it's multiple potential manifest 

459
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,690
forums.
And what does that mean?

460
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,660
It means the apocalypse is always 
happening,

461
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,583
right?
The end of the world is always before 

462
00:24:50,571 --> 00:24:51,404
us,
which is why you see apocalyptic 

463
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:54,140
imagery,
for example,

464
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:54,974
throughout the New Testament,
Christ says the world is coming to an 

465
00:24:57,591 --> 00:24:59,810
end and people are waiting around for it
to happen.

466
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:04,160
But what they don't precisely understand
is that the world is always coming to an

467
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:08,390
end always.
And that's because what you think now is

468
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,790
not good enough for the next second,
right?

469
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,100
You have to change because change is 
coming.

470
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,250
And what change means is you have to let
go of what you know.

471
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,800
That's the apocalypse and it's always on
us.

472
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,710
The structure is threatened.
Well,

473
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,950
what do you do about that?
Well,

474
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,480
okay,

475
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,700
you can run,
but you can't hide,

476
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,590
right?
That's the theory.

477
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:31,424
And the reason for that is that even if 
you are unwilling to face the threat 

478
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,020
that's right in front of you,
no matter where you run to,

479
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:39,854
that threat is going to be there.
So you'll see in the case of an 

480
00:25:41,721 --> 00:25:42,554
agoraphobic woman who starts to run away
from the shopping mall when she has 

481
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,393
heart palpitations that then she runs 
away from the subway and then she runs 

482
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,830
away from taxis and buses,
and then other people.

483
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,990
Then finally she's at home and there's 
nowhere to run,

484
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:57,800
but her heart's palpitating.
And the fear of death is still honor and

485
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:02,000
there's no place to go.
So hiding isn't much of a help.

486
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,780
Or you can pretend that the chaotic 
thing isn't there and refuse to change,

487
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,590
but all that does is make the threat 
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

488
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,423
So just like simply put,
I'll say you only have $100 in the bank 

489
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:17,600
and you have $110 telephone bill and you
think,

490
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,583
well,
I'd like that $100 I'm not going to pay 

491
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,610
that telephone bill.
It's just a little threat,

492
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,260
right?
But then you don't pay it,

493
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,094
and the next month it's $125 telephone 
bill and then they slap a $50 charge on 

494
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:31,820
you and then they cut off your phone.
So then you don't have a phone.

495
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,670
Then you miss a job appointment and 
that's not so good.

496
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,504
And then it's $250 to pay your phone 
bill and another 200 to get it hooked 

497
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:39,914
back up.
And then your credit record goes all to 

498
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,230
hell because you haven't paid any of 
that.

499
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,040
Then you can't buy a house when you're 
25 and you think kind of weird.

500
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,490
A little bitty chaos turns into a great 
big monster.

501
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,500
And partly that's because everything 
that looks separate from everything else

502
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,780
isn't.
It just looks that way.

503
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,793
And when you ignore anything,
especially if it's impeding your 

504
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:04,500
progress,
you know it's impeding your progress.

505
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,210
You know,
you have to deal with it,

506
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,750
step away from it and see what its true 
nature really is.

507
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,793
So you can hide and you can not change.
Or You could pretend that the threat 

508
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:14,514
doesn't exist.
But in the final analysis that just 

509
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:19,740
stores up the catastrophe for later.
