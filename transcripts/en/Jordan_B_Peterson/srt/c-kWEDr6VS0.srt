1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,053
Okay.

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello everyone.
Apologies for the delay.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,180
I hope this is all working.
Um,

4
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,850
I'm taking questions from Patriot on 
people today.

5
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,120
So
there's 841 questions ready to go.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,560
So hopefully I'm up to this.
What should teaching and research in the

7
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:47,084
humanities look like?
I'm going to Grad School for literature 

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,660
and I don't want my work to serve 
ideological possession.

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,650
Well,
the thing is,

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,540
first of all is that you kind of have to
educate yourself when you go to graduate

11
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:12,780
school,
you know you have your courses,

12
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,823
but I don't think that you learn more 
than about 10% of what graduate school 

13
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,620
can teach you by taking the courses you 
have to read.

14
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,933
And the mistake that most people read is
make is that they only read what's been 

15
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:30,840
published in the last five or six years 
in their own narrow field.

16
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,970
And that's increasingly a bad idea.
Um,

17
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,030
the libraries are full of classic books 
and I would say take your field,

18
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,063
go back to the beginning of the field.
At least read the people who wrote the 

19
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,234
classic works.
Bring yourself up to date and then 

20
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,030
familiarize yourself with as much 
history,

21
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,703
as much history of art,
as much history of literature and 

22
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:59,970
literature as you can possibly manage.

23
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,570
You want to learn as much as you can 
about everything.

24
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,410
I would also say you have to ally that 
with a certain degree of specialization.

25
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:09,870
You have to pick one topic and really 
become expert at it,

26
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:13,260
but it'll serve as a doorway to,
because everything's connected.

27
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:15,330
It'll serve as a doorway to what's 
behind it,

28
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,490
so you focus on one thing and read as 
much as you can on that.

29
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:23,220
That's your specific discipline.
Then outside of that,

30
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,290
read as widely as you possibly could 
manage.

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,060
The other thing I would really 
recommend,

32
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,160
and this is also true if you're going to
university,

33
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,994
is it isn't enough to read.
You also have to write and if you're 

34
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,090
going to go to graduate school,
you should write every day.

35
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,230
It's a good idea for anyone who wants to
develop themselves intellectually,

36
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,330
but even half an hour a day,
you know,

37
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:45,960
that's 180 hours a year.
That's a lot of thinking because writing

38
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,700
is thinking and you should be writing 
out your understanding of what you wrote

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,593
or what you read and the questions you 
have about it and trying to formulate 

40
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:59,500
what you regard as clear questions and 
problems and also clear answers.

41
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,360
Uh,
both of those.

42
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,870
And that's how I would say you should 
approach graduate school.

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Okay.

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,180
Have you thought about slowing down 
there?

45
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:11,014
Are people worried about how hard you're
pushing yourself with the countless 

46
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:16,300
commitments?
Yes.

47
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,134
Well,
I would say that those people worried 

48
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,500
about that include,
ah,

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,560
I dunno if it's me,
but certainly my family,

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,873
they're worried about it.
But I'm putting competent people around 

51
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,650
me increasingly to handle the scheduling
of the public events for example.

52
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,440
And I have good agents in a good 
publisher and,

53
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,040
um,
I'm learning how to manage this.

54
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:43,250
I think I've,
I'm not really interested,

55
00:03:43,251 --> 00:03:44,084
I suppose in slowing down,
although it has been a bit much in the 

56
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,953
last year and a half.
I,

57
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,363
I'm,
I do better in some ways when I'm 

58
00:03:51,321 --> 00:03:55,090
working flat out.
Uh,

59
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:55,933
if my health was good,
it's better than it was by a large 

60
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:01,790
margin.
And maybe it's still getting better.

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,140
If my health was good,
this,

62
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,040
none of this would be an overwhelming 
challenge,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
but I'm trying to do everything I can to
put my health in order and many,

64
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:16,001
many things have been fixed.
So yeah,

65
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:17,204
I thought about slowing down,
but I've decided against it I guess is 

66
00:04:19,581 --> 00:04:23,270
really the final answer to that.
That's the other thing.

67
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:26,540
You know there are times in your life 
where it's not time to slow down,

68
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,374
it's time to

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,730
become more efficient.
That's the thing.

70
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,070
You can become so efficient,
you know,

71
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:33,904
you end up doing things in five minutes 
that would otherwise take you a week 

72
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,860
might.
That might seem like an exaggeration,

73
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,900
but,
and I suppose it is to some degree,

74
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,850
but it's not that much of an 
exaggeration.

75
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,403
So as you take on more responsibilities 
and you determine that you're going to 

76
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:49,084
become more efficient,
the responsibility pushes the 

77
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,930
efficiency.
So

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,580
what do they say too?
There's time enough to sleep when you're

79
00:04:58,581 --> 00:04:59,414
in the grave.
Many who respect your work feel your 

80
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,120
tweets are often impulsive or even 
expedient.

81
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,180
Very funny.
In certain interactions,

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,090
would you consider a change in the way 
you tweet?

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,673
Well,
I've been considering that for a very 

84
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,084
long time.
One of the things I did in the last 

85
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,570
month,
which that I think was productive.

86
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,890
Twitter's a hard,
hard medium to manage because it rewards

87
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:36,891
impulsivity and I have somewhat of a 
temper and I suspect that it's maybe I'm

88
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,070
more susceptible to being,
um,

89
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,070
to being tempted to respond in a

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,353
yeah,

91
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,093
too forceful manner.
Maybe I'm more tempted by that than I 

92
00:05:55,471 --> 00:05:57,120
should be.
Um,

93
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
but twitter is real useful.
I mean it does keep me updated with 

94
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,520
regards to the,
the ongoing,

95
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,354
let's say,
war that's raging at the bottom of our 

96
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:12,101
culture and it doesn't enable me to stay
in contact with people,

97
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,550
at least to some degree.
And it's a great way of communicating,

98
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,500
um,
small,

99
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,010
but at least in principle important 
ideas.

100
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,263
And also to let people know about what 
I'm doing on youtube and with the tours 

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,090
and,
and all of that.

102
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,033
People seem to
respond positively to those sorts of 

103
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,774
notifications.
So what I did do in the last month was 

104
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,960
to find people.
I tweeted out one day,

105
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:42,794
I asked people to send me the twitter 
handles of organizations or individuals 

106
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:51,230
who were reporting on positive 
developments in a credible and realistic

107
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,123
way.
Human progress.org seems to be doing 

108
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:54,734
that really well.

109
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,130
I thought it would be good to tilt my 
twitter feed toward or my twitter,

110
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,603
uh,
my actions towards things that are 

111
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,190
positive and also true as much as 
possible.

112
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,100
And so I've started doing that in the 
last month.

113
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,780
Um,
I feel somewhat of an obligation to,

114
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,670
if I'm being discussed publicly by 
journalists or,

115
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,083
or other professors and they 
misrepresent me or misrepresent the 

116
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:32,690
ideas that they're purporting to 
discuss,

117
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:35,240
then I feel like I have a moral 
obligation to,

118
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,813
I suppose one is to defend myself I 
suppose and certainly to object to the 

119
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:49,040
miss utilization of ideas by my fellow 
academics.

120
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,173
I don't know if that's a,
I don't know if that's reasonable or 

121
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:56,504
not.
It's not easy to figure out in a 

122
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:00,860
situation like this,
how much you shut up,

123
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,460
how much you stay patient,
how much you push back,

124
00:08:04,461 --> 00:08:07,010
how much you fight,
how,

125
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,540
how firmly you respond,
whether or not to use wet

126
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,900
mean the rule.
I tried to outline in a,

127
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,040
in my book
12 rules for life.

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:25,041
There's a chapter called
don't let your children do anything that

129
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,154
makes you dislike them.
And there's a philosophy of discipline 

130
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:31,950
in there and it really has two 
dimensions,

131
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:33,990
let's say,
or two.

132
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,180
It's,
it's at the juncture of two ideas.

133
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,283
One idea is that you don't want to make 
any more rules that necessary because 

134
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:44,150
you get tangled up in them.
So minimum necessary rule.

135
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:44,984
So that's a good guideline for setting 
up any structure even in dealing with 

136
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:51,684
yourself.
And then if you're going to have rules 

137
00:08:54,631 --> 00:08:57,210
you have to them because otherwise 
they're not rules.

138
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,800
And so how do you enforce them with 
minimal necessary force and some of that

139
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:06,780
has to be played with,
you know,

140
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,270
and experimented with.
So you know what minimal force is.

141
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,313
Those are really good principles and I 
try to govern myself by them in my 

142
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,920
twitter behavior.
But,

143
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,940
and I hope that that successful,
um,

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,993
you know,
sometimes when I've gone after people I 

145
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,620
went to after a couple of journalists in
Canada last year who

146
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,303
wrote I would,
what I would regard as scurrilous and 

147
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,860
incompetent articles.
That's a bad combination.

148
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,703
And

149
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,123
you know,
it was kind of a harsh exchange I would 

150
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:46,680
say,
but it isn't clear that it was the wrong

151
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,170
thing to do.
So

152
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,040
it's hard to know how much you have to 
skirt the ragged edge of disaster if you

153
00:09:56,041 --> 00:10:00,450
want to do things right.
So anyways,

154
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,284
I am changing the way I tweet because 
I'm trying to make it the bulk of it 

155
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,023
informative and positive.
I guess I should say something about 

156
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,121
that too.
You know,

157
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:12,120
there's a lot of really good things 
going on in the world.

158
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,433
So we have poverty,
absolute poverty between the year 2000 

159
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:23,370
and 2012 which was three years ahead of 
what the UN had hoped would happen.

160
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,350
You know,
and cynics say,

161
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:30,351
well you have absolute poverty,
but the cutoff was kind of arbitrary.

162
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,660
It was a dollar 90 a day,
if I remember correctly,

163
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:36,150
which obviously is quite low.
Um,

164
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,830
so it's not a real transformation.
It's like it's a real transformation.

165
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,540
Some number had to be picked to 
represent that absolute poverty.

166
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:51,541
And I don't suspect the UN erred on the 
side of capitalist over optimism.

167
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,073
Perhaps they did.
Hundreds of thousands of people are 

168
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,170
being connected to the power grid every 
day.

169
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,440
Fresh water's available,
not to fewer and fewer people,

170
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,930
but to more and more people.
And that's happening extremely rapid,

171
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,003
rapidly.
No starvation in India and China is a 

172
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:11,320
thing completely of the past.
You never hear about that.

173
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,070
And that's pretty much the case for the 
rest of the world except now.

174
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,950
And then for political reasons.
So,

175
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,143
you know,
everybody's got a cell phone or an oil 

176
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:21,704
on anybody who doesn't,
is going to have one in the next 10 

177
00:11:23,201 --> 00:11:26,650
years.
And that puts in people's hands,

178
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,703
uh,
a degree of communication and access 

179
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,450
that would have been absolutely 
incomprehensible even 15 years ago.

180
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,603
So
it seems to me that the reason too that 

181
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:41,374
I changed,
it seemed to me that it was worthwhile 

182
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,554
to change the way that I was using 
twitter because all these good things 

183
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,084
are happening
and just concentrating on this 

184
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,153
polarization process that seems to have 
gripped us in the West seems 

185
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,234
counterproductive given all those good 
things that are going on in the 

186
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:04,970
background.
Now that doesn't make what's going on in

187
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,460
the west with regards to political 
polarization,

188
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,893
trivial,
but it does set it inside a much more 

189
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:14,210
positive context.
So that's something to keep in mind.

190
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,130
What if a client's need for autonomy 
slash identity in therapy,

191
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,600
they would prefer that which is 
meaningful and therefore under the under

192
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,640
their control.
Is this not unhealthy?

193
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,830
I'm not exactly sure how to meet what to
make of that question.

194
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,780
Well first of all,
let's try.

195
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,540
What if a client's need for autonomy,
identity in therapy?

196
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,943
That's paramount mean again in my book 
and in Chapter Nine assume the person 

197
00:12:56,171 --> 00:12:57,004
that you're listening to know something 
you don't have so that you can learn 

198
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,054
something.
Maybe because you need to learn 

199
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,370
something.
Cause like,

200
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,204
what do you know in therapy,
I don't think that if you're a good 

201
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,044
therapist,
you try to take responsibility for the 

202
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:17,470
decisions that your clients make.
Like you don't take that decision making

203
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:22,471
onto yourself because you have to adopt 
a position of radical ignorance.

204
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,600
No,
a person is sitting across from you.

205
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,000
And this is the true,
true of every person.

206
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,834
You know a person is sitting across from
you and they don't understand 

207
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:36,640
themselves,
but you really don't understand them.

208
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,550
And if you're a therapist or maybe even 
if you're a friend or a partner for that

209
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,940
matter,
the person wants help and so something's

210
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:50,941
wrong as far as they're concerned and 
there might be some way to fix it.

211
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,043
And that's your initial starting place.
I would say both of you have to kind of 

212
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,930
agree on that in a psychotherapeutic 
situation.

213
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,130
Well,
but you don't know what's wrong.

214
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,713
You know,
you know something's wrong because the 

215
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,680
person is upset enough to come and seek 
counseling.

216
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,830
So they want to set their life right.
But you have no idea what's wrong.

217
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:15,350
You don't know anything about the way 
they think or what,

218
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,300
what they value or what their past is 
or,

219
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,970
or how,
or what they're,

220
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,470
what they're like physiologically or 
what their temperament is like are,

221
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,173
or what,
how things are going in their 

222
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:28,990
relationships are,
what their career is like.

223
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,853
You just,
the things you don't know about that 

224
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:31,451
person,
man,

225
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:34,120
it's,
it's intersectionality gone mad.

226
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:34,954
I can tell you that.
And so you got to listen and let the 

227
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:44,281
person tell you what it is that's wrong 
as if you don't know,

228
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:46,670
cause you don't know.
And,

229
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,913
and so,
and you have to ask questions of 

230
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,190
clarification and,
but you always have to remember,

231
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,213
not only do you not know what's wrong,
maybe the person doesn't know what's 

232
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:54,830
wrong.

233
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,050
It's highly probable.
They know that something's wrong,

234
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:57,884
but they don't know exactly what.
And they certainly don't know what 

235
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
caused it.
And so you gotta listen radically and 

236
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
clarify now ask questions and make sure 
you're not confused so that you do 

237
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,244
understand.
And maybe you can help the person start 

238
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:10,670
to understand what they're talking 
about.

239
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,620
Um,
or thinking about,

240
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:15,860
cause talking in thinking are very much 
the same thing.

241
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,293
And then then well maybe you get some 
sense of what's wrong and maybe some 

242
00:15:21,741 --> 00:15:24,710
sense of how it came about.
God only knows how long that'll take.

243
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,350
And then the next thing you have to 
figure out is,

244
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:30,350
well,
what would a solution look like?

245
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,410
Like even hypothetically,
what does the person want?

246
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,540
And do they know what they want?
And if they don't know what they want,

247
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,374
then how can you help them figure out 
what they want and how do you help them 

248
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:43,850
figure out what they need and how do you
help them admit to that and all of that.

249
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,310
And so that's a boat load of listening 
there.

250
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,280
Again,
you know,

251
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,720
and it's the same in every relationship 
that you have.

252
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:52,970
If you're trying to foster that person's
development,

253
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,900
he want to find out,
well what's wrong in their lives?

254
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,840
And,
but they have to figure that out because

255
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,674
they're the ones that,
they're the ones that will have to bear 

256
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:03,614
the responsibility for the decisions.
So you don't want to take that on to 

257
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:07,071
yourself.
It's like,

258
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:07,904
well,
I don't want to tell you what to do 

259
00:16:08,181 --> 00:16:09,014
because I don't know what you should do.
Like we can both agree that you should 

260
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:18,980
move toward what's better for you and 
hopefully for the people around you.

261
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,230
Cause we would include that in the 
definition of better,

262
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,090
right?
Because otherwise it's not sustainable.

263
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,270
But we have to talk forever to find out 
what that is.

264
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,104
And you have to be,
you have to be very incautious to think 

265
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,770
that you can
make decisions for someone.

266
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,183
It's an arrogant move and it's an ill 
advised move and you shouldn't do it if 

267
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,730
you're properly terrified of your errors
because,

268
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,290
well,
again,

269
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:49,124
I'll repeat.
You're not the one that's going to have 

270
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:53,630
to take responsibility for the decisions
they are.

271
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,860
So it has to be left in their hands.
And so,

272
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,170
so autonomy,
it's everything in a clinical practice.

273
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,033
No,
that doesn't mean that you can't help a 

274
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:10,880
person strategize.
You know,

275
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,163
you might say,
well as you're moving towards some 

276
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:18,710
formulation of the problem,
you might say,

277
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:20,840
well here's five things that it might 
be,

278
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,240
or here's the list of things that might 
be bothering you.

279
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,074
Or you know,
you can make suggestions but they can't 

280
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:27,854
be baited suggestions either.
You can't overweight the one you hope 

281
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,930
they'll choose.
You know,

282
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:33,501
again,
it's,

283
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,640
it's in cautious.
A lot of this I would say I learned well

284
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,310
from thinking about it,
but also from reading Carl Rogers,

285
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,170
I'd really recommend Carl Rogers.
You know,

286
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:43,004
he,
he was a smart guy when it came to 

287
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:45,920
listening.
You can really learn a lot from,

288
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,800
and he was also smart in how we are 
outlined,

289
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,003
the client's need for autonomous 
development and that's the development 

290
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:54,240
of the individual.
So

291
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,803
any update on your plans to start 
providing independent classes or an 

292
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:05,860
online university?
Well,

293
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,860
I'm working with some young people right
now who are very,

294
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,250
very smart.
And the first thing we're,

295
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,640
we're going to build modules by the 
looks of things.

296
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,073
Each module,
hopefully it will stand alone because 

297
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,970
then we can test them instead of 
launching like a whole university.

298
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:19,804
Which seems to be a crazy thing to do.
We're going to make independent modules 

299
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:25,690
for different purposes and then launch 
them probably as quiet,

300
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:26,590
shy,
independent.

301
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,160
Yeah.

302
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,340
Products let's say to see if there's a 
demand for them.

303
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:33,070
So the one we're working right now on 
right now,

304
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,390
and I'm not going to say too much about 
it,

305
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:39,391
is a competitive writing module where 
you'll be able to look at paragraphs and

306
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:40,650
okay.

307
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,210
Paragraphs that other people have 
written.

308
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,220
Okay.

309
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,200
Of a variety of sorts.
No,

310
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,350
I don't think I'll tell you about that.
I bet her weight.

311
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,693
So anyways,
we're going to write a competitive 

312
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,740
writing module and because one of the 
big problems,

313
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:55,574
the biggest problems that has to be 
solved for any online university is how 

314
00:18:57,861 --> 00:18:58,694
do you teach people to write,
because you don't want the university 

315
00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:02,780
just to be lectures and multiple choice 
tests.

316
00:19:02,781 --> 00:19:07,781
Even though that could be done with some
degree of reasonable competence.

317
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,260
Mostly what you want when you educate 
people as to educate them,

318
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,770
not so much into like factual knowledge 
but intellectual skill.

319
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,820
They have to be able to speak.
So we'll need a speaking module and they

320
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:22,654
have to be able to think and we'll have 
to develop exercises that are relevant 

321
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:29,530
to critical thinking.
Writing is a big part of that.

322
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,230
Um,
so

323
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:32,830
yeah,

324
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,663
and they have to be able to read.
And so those are the big problems to 

325
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,050
solve.
And then the other problem for an online

326
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:40,884
university is creditation.
Obviously we've got some ideas about 

327
00:19:43,171 --> 00:19:46,440
that.
And also what you do with regards to the

328
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:47,274
social element,
because that's a huge part of 

329
00:19:48,511 --> 00:19:49,344
university,
is to develop an intellectual peer 

330
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:52,530
group.
Right?

331
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,743
That's really an important part in yet.
It's not going to be easy to replace 

332
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,890
that online.
You know,

333
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,813
the relationships that people make in 
college often last while they can last 

334
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:07,060
for decades or maybe they can last a 
lifetime for that matter.

335
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:07,894
But

336
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,600
yeah,

337
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,433
it's a place where you catalyze your 
adult identity and the peers that you 

338
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:15,220
pick are a big part of that.
Um,

339
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,200
of course some of the peers that you 
pick when you go to university should be

340
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:20,800
the great people of the past.
Um,

341
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,120
yeah,

342
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,720
that's really what university is for,
is to make them in some sense your peers

343
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:26,261
know that,
you know,

344
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,094
that's pushing it because you'll have to
do a lot of work before they become 

345
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:32,210
peers.
Anyways,

346
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,760
we're definitely working on this.
Um,

347
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,590
the part of the problem is,
is that I'm,

348
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,390
yeah,

349
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:40,120
it's hard.
It's what's the problem?

350
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,263
MMM.

351
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,660
Okay.

352
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,493
I'm doing enough other things at the 
moment so that finding the time to do 

353
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:50,800
this credibly in addition is one of the 
major challenges.

354
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,973
So,

355
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,763
hmm.
I married young and have had only one 

356
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,254
sexual partner.
Now I desire a variety but value of my 

357
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:06,470
marriage and will not cheat any insight 
and overcoming this conflict.

358
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,840
As a matter of fact.
Yes.

359
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,370
I would say get the variety with your 
partner.

360
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,350
You know,
there's lots of

361
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,320
games you can play to spice up your 
sexual life,

362
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,730
you know,
um,

363
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,780
by some lingerie,
like buy a hundred pieces,

364
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,753
you know,
buy something sexy for your partner to 

365
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:32,460
where maybe multiple things,
um,

366
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,100
by some,
by whatever you need that you might want

367
00:21:37,101 --> 00:21:38,920
to experiment with.
You know,

368
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,773
I mean you have to introduce that spirit
of pretend play that you had when you 

369
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:44,984
were a little kid into your sexual life.
And then you have many partners in the 

370
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:49,910
same person

371
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,473
and

372
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,360
you put some thought into it.
You know,

373
00:21:55,361 --> 00:21:56,194
I mean sex is something that,
that sex is a domain in which expertise 

374
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,790
can be developed just like any other 
domain.

375
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,103
And some of that's play and fantasy play
and all of that and some of it's sexual 

376
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:11,890
technique and,

377
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,393
and I guess then the other thing I would
say is take stock of each other and see 

378
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,123
if there are things that you could do in
your life that would make you more 

379
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,500
attractive to one another.
You know,

380
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:28,690
those are hard questions because no one 
wants to say,

381
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:29,524
well,
you know,

382
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,450
I'd be more attracted to my wife 
sexually if she just acted x way.

383
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,860
And the same with regards to how a 
wife's contemplation of her husband.

384
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:41,590
But those are the real questions,
man.

385
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,453
It's like if your partner isn't acting 
in a manner that is sexually attractive 

386
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,503
than either there's something wrong with
you or there's something wrong with 

387
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:52,234
them.
And of course I know people have ill 

388
00:22:53,681 --> 00:22:55,690
health and all of that.
I'm not talking about that.

389
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,524
But those harsh judgements that your 
sexual attraction makes are also very 

390
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:04,090
useful ways of orienting yourself 
towards proper behavior in the world.

391
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,883
So I would say
any insight and overcoming this 

392
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,180
conflict.
Now I desire variety,

393
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:15,190
but I value my marriage and will not 
cheat.

394
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,473
Well,
admit to the variety that you want and 

395
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,700
see to what degree you can fulfill that 
within the confines of the marriage.

396
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,820
It's also part of coming into contact 
with the shadow.

397
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:30,370
I would say if you want to look at it 
from a union perspective,

398
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,120
you might have all sorts of sexual 
desires that are,

399
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,130
that part of you feels should remain 
taboo and maybe they should.

400
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,053
I'm not suggesting ag absolute,
sexually libertine behavior and then 

401
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,910
with sexuality has to be regulated very 
carefully,

402
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,373
but
you might be able to push yourself with 

403
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:56,411
some time and effort and contemplation 
and some admission of fantasy.

404
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,344
And all of that into domains of sexual 
satisfaction that you haven't achieved 

405
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:04,844
before.

406
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,063
Why do I know what to discuss?
Religious fundamentalism more often and 

407
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:32,454
more in depth.
Many people consider you a religious 

408
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:38,820
apologist as a consequence.
Well,

409
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,610
it's okay if people considered me a 
religious apologist.

410
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:42,444
I am a religious apologist.
So an apologist is someone who makes an 

411
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:46,464
argument for something.
And I'm constantly making arguments for 

412
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:53,970
a religious perspective on life or 
religious orientation towards life.

413
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,260
Uh,
an orientation that's centered in,

414
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,483
in meaning and orientation that's 
centered in desire for all things to 

415
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:08,811
thrive in so far as that's possible.
Desire for people to speak the truth and

416
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:13,200
act out the truth and act 
responsibility,

417
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,090
act responsibly and all of that.
And I think that there's something,

418
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,610
something transcendently necessary about
all of that.

419
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,760
And I think it is the antidote to hell.
So that,

420
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,670
that makes me a religious apologists.
The fundamentalists,

421
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,493
I dunno.
Which fundamentalists you mean if you 

422
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,650
mean the Christian fundamentalists?
Well,

423
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,590
I understand where they're coming from.
You know,

424
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,113
I think the Christian
Christianity is an ethical framework 

425
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:49,850
above all else.
And it's predicated in a story about the

426
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:50,684
way the world is constituted and,
and the story provides the foundation 

427
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,810
for that ethic and the ethic unites the 
community and gives people direction.

428
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,330
This is a big deal.
Now,

429
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:06,050
if the story is challenged,
if the foundational stories challenged,

430
00:26:06,051 --> 00:26:06,884
which is certainly what happened as a 
consequence of the rise of empirical 

431
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:13,190
science,
then the foundation for the ethic starts

432
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:14,024
to,

433
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,920
starts to shake and tremble.
And that threatens the ethic.

434
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,100
But the ethic is what holds people 
together and gives them direction.

435
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,390
So you can't just lose the ethic.
So the fundamentalist Christians are all

436
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:28,224
short circuited because they know that 
there's something to the ethic and they 

437
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:35,100
understand that the foundation has been 
shaken,

438
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,653
but they don't know what to do about it.
So they insist that the foundation has 

439
00:26:40,171 --> 00:26:43,770
not been shaken.
And I that,

440
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,870
so I think the way out of that is to 
understand that

441
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,200
the truth that govern ethics and the 
truth that govern the description of the

442
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,440
world as a material place are not the 
same.

443
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,060
They're not,
they're not,

444
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,890
they're not of the same kind.
Um,

445
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,180
how they're related.
I'm not exactly sure,

446
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:08,520
but there's no simple one to one 
relationships.

447
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,550
You can't describe the world and then 
immediately extract out in ethic.

448
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,610
It's partly because there are just too 
many ways of describing the world.

449
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,990
So this is the,
that the fundamental point of difference

450
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:22,824
as far as I can tell between Sam Harris 
and I and hopefully what we'll discuss 

451
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:28,770
in the summer.
So,

452
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,503
so that's the Christian fundamentalists 
and I don't really see that there are a 

453
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,430
particularly threatening group as far as
I can tell.

454
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,264
I mean there are certainly not in the 
ascendance by any stretch of the 

455
00:27:39,361 --> 00:27:41,640
imagination.
Um,

456
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,613
they're not involved in any particularly
reprehensible political behavior unless 

457
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:47,850
you count conservatism.

458
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,620
And it is by no means obvious that 
they're even holding their ground in the

459
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,960
culture war.
So I'm not very worried about them.

460
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,610
Um,
Islamic fundamentalism,

461
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,583
that's a whole different story.
But I don't know enough about it to 

462
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,450
discuss it intelligently.
I don't understand Islam.

463
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,903
It,
it,

464
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,250
it,
I'm concerned about.

465
00:28:16,251 --> 00:28:21,050
It's,
what would you call compatibility with,

466
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,930
with the Democratic West.

467
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,870
Okay.

468
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:26,703
It isn't obvious to me that there are 
medium to high functioning Muslim 

469
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:35,200
democracies.
I suppose turkeys the closest one,

470
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:38,500
but Turkey's pretty soon,
pretty shaky at the moment.

471
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,180
I think that the failure to separate 
church and state,

472
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,573
or even if we don't call it a failure,
the fact that church and state hasn't 

473
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,414
been technically separated in Islam 
makes it difficult to understand how 

474
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:55,024
it's possible for Islam and modern 
western democratic traditions to 

475
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:02,590
coexist.
I don't know how that can be,

476
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,670
that gap can be bridged.
Um,

477
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,590
you could say,
well with goodwill and let's,

478
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,380
let's hope that's the case.
Um,

479
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,333
that doesn't mean I don't think that 
Muslims can live in a modern western 

480
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,990
democracy.
I mean there are many,

481
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:20,560
many kinds of Muslims just like there 
are many kinds of Jews and Christians.

482
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:21,394
And so,
and then there's the problem of the 

483
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,523
current proclivity of the extreme end of
the Muslim fundamentalists world to 

484
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:35,940
become,
to be very violent in very many ways.

485
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:40,290
And so,
you know what,

486
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,180
I'm not a great admirer of the Saudis to
say the least.

487
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,840
I don't appreciate their brand of,
of Wahhabi Islam.

488
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,953
And I don't appreciate their exports of 
that view with their petro dollars to 

489
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,800
the rest of the world.
So

490
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,910
I guess that's what I have to say about 
fundamentalists.

491
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,940
Hello,
Dr. Peterson.

492
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:08,800
I've been trying to listen to my 
conscience,

493
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,260
but I can't tell the difference between 
fear,

494
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,260
willful blindness or genuine conscience.
Well,

495
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,393
the first thing I would say about that 
is it is quite clear that you are in 

496
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:18,604
fact trying to listen to your conscience
because that's probably the first thing 

497
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:23,950
that you discover.
So that's a really good question.

498
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,610
Okay,
fear.

499
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,540
Well,
here's the test and you don't want to do

500
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,374
this stupidly.
If you think that you should do 

501
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:39,584
something and you think that the reason 
you might not be doing it is because 

502
00:30:43,371 --> 00:30:45,560
you're afraid,
then you should do it.

503
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,730
So that way you can find out if it's 
fear.

504
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,760
You know?
I think your question is,

505
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,594
well,
how do I know my conscience isn't just 

506
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,240
masquerading as fear of saying,
well,

507
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:59,990
you shouldn't do that,
but it's rationalizing the real issue,

508
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,170
which is you're afraid of doing that.
Now see,

509
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,440
here's a reason that you want to tell 
the truth.

510
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,513
And I parked,
I kind of figured this out when I was 

511
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:11,090
looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.
You know,

512
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:14,780
in Pinocchio as Pinocchio strives to 
become real,

513
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:17,030
he,
he has a conscience to guide him,

514
00:31:17,031 --> 00:31:19,280
but it's jimminy cricket,
this insect.

515
00:31:19,281 --> 00:31:21,860
But Jimmy hasn't really a very good 
conscience.

516
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:25,090
He's a bit dogmatic to begin with.
Dogmatic and inexperienced.

517
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,583
And so it's,
it's not like the conscience is an 

518
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:33,230
unerring guide.
It's like a partner in discovery.

519
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,603
And as you move forward in your life and
you consult your conscience and you 

520
00:31:39,321 --> 00:31:43,970
listened to it,
then it gets smarter and so to you.

521
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,493
But there's a code of their,
and this is why I've suggested part of 

522
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:53,180
the reason why I've suggested so 
frequently in my lectures and in my book

523
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,910
that people try not to lie.
You see,

524
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,450
there are many systems,
you have many systems within,

525
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,220
let's say,
that guide you.

526
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,420
And one of those is your capacity for 
rational thought.

527
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:06,254
And then you have a variety of emotional
systems and motivational systems and 

528
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:09,853
internal dramas and intuitions and 
bodily sensations like lots and lots of 

529
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:18,080
and senses,
lots of systems that are guiding you.

530
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,310
And many of them operate,
you might say,

531
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,850
unconsciously,
autonomously,

532
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,970
instinctively,
implicitly,

533
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:29,804
all of that.

534
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,393
Now you pr nonetheless,
you program them like you feed them 

535
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:35,954
content,
let's say just like you feed your body 

536
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:38,744
nourishment,
you feed them and a lot of the content 

537
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,314
that you feed them pertains directly to 
your voluntary thoughts and speech and 

538
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:47,474
your actions.
And then if you pathologize those by 

539
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,534
lying.
So if you say things that you know not 

540
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:55,880
to be true or you don't say things that 
you know to be true when you need to,

541
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,320
which is more common.
And if you act in ways that you consider

542
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:03,590
that act in ways you considered 
reprehensible,

543
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,690
then you pathologize all of those 
autonomous systems that guide you.

544
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:09,524
It's like you're programming them badly.
You're building an AI system inside 

545
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,690
yourself really in,
in,

546
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,510
in some sense that is what you're doing 
that has very bad,

547
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,403
it's very bad training data.
And so the output it produces will be 

548
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,000
well,
won't guide you properly.

549
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,420
And so you don't want to pathologize 
your guidance systems.

550
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:33,080
It's a really bad idea.
So that's why you have to not lie.

551
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,010
And maybe that's also why you have to 
say what you have to say.

552
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,590
And you have to say it clearly as well.
And you have to learn how to do that.

553
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,910
So that's one of the ways of getting 
your conscience straightened out.

554
00:33:43,911 --> 00:33:46,550
And then you have to have a dialogue 
with your conscience.

555
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:47,570
And you might ask,
it's like,

556
00:33:47,571 --> 00:33:49,430
okay,
well what should I do?

557
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,473
Or what should,
should I do this or should I not do 

558
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:53,540
this?
So let's say you're thinking,

559
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:55,670
should I not do this?
In the case of a temptation,

560
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,140
maybe you have a chance to develop a new
relationship.

561
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:01,070
You know,
and you're,

562
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,353
you're excited about it and apprehensive
about it and afraid of it and you don't 

563
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,990
know how to sort out all those feelings.

564
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,470
And the first thing is you really have 
to want to sort them out.

565
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,730
That's why you have to orient yourself 
to something that's a genuine up.

566
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:18,590
You know that the star above the 
horizon,

567
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:19,424
you have to really want things to be 
straight and you have to have thought 

568
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:24,134
that through.
And you have to know what it means for 

569
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:27,464
things not to be straight.
And really what it means is that you're 

570
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:33,320
headed for hell in one way or another.
And if you understand that it's enough,

571
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:36,470
maybe it's enough to scare you straight.
You really got to think that through.

572
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,100
Then you've got to think about how much 
better it would be if you aimed up and,

573
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,680
and that really has to kind of permeate 
your whole being.

574
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,143
And so then you're oriented that way.
You're oriented to dop and you're 

575
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:50,270
deciding that it's okay to try to tell 
the truth and then you can start to rely

576
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:52,070
on this dialogue with your conscience.

577
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,840
But both of you have to learn and you're
going to make mistakes along the way.

578
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,550
You know,
that's okay.

579
00:34:58,551 --> 00:34:59,181
You can say,
well,

580
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,460
I'm going to try this without being 
certain that it's right.

581
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,743
You can even say,
I'm going to say this without being 

582
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,700
certain that it's correct.
Like if you're arguing with your wife or

583
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:09,620
your husband or your,
or your sister,

584
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:12,620
your father,
and you have an idea about what might be

585
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:13,970
going on,
you can say,

586
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,990
look,
here's my idea about what's going on.

587
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,303
Um,
who knows what that idea might be 

588
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:24,950
contaminated with like maybe I'm putting
it forward just because I'm too proud or

589
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:27,440
arrogant or angry or fearful or 
whatever.

590
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,920
That's possible.
Let's see if we can figure that out.

591
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,590
But you can offer tentatively and both 
have added.

592
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,430
That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,
right?

593
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,520
You both have at it and see if it's an 
idea that's worthy of,

594
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,743
of keeping you do that with your 
conscience and then you were move 

595
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,154
forward.

596
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,363
There's a,
there's a technique and behavioral 

597
00:35:50,271 --> 00:35:54,080
psychology called psychotherapy called 
collaborative empiricism.

598
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,943
So let's say that we,
you and I have been sitting down and we 

599
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,380
decided that you're going to try 
something new this week.

600
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:03,620
Like maybe your agoraphobic and you're 
having a hard time in a parking lot.

601
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,620
And so getting out of the car and going 
to the grocery store.

602
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:07,454
So maybe we say,
well you to drive to the grocery store 

603
00:36:09,381 --> 00:36:11,180
and you're just going to walk halfway to
the

604
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,723
halfway from your car to the door and 
that's good enough for like do that 

605
00:36:16,461 --> 00:36:19,820
every second day for a week and then 
come back and let's talk about it.

606
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:23,120
So that's collaborative empiricism,
you're running a little experiments,

607
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:23,963
you think,
well your conscience is guiding you 

608
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:26,204
towards something.
You take a tentative step in that 

609
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:30,860
direction and then you check and see,
well,

610
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:31,694
you know,
did what I wanted to have happen or 

611
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,250
occur as an outcome.
That's the crucial question.

612
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,680
And that's the crucial question for 
behavioral truth,

613
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,600
right?
That's the pragmatic perspective.

614
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,703
Did what I want to have happened happen 
as a consequence of my framework of 

615
00:36:46,911 --> 00:36:50,780
interpretation and my action.
If the answer is yes,

616
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:54,110
then I have not invalidated it.
Right?

617
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:54,973
That's,
that's the pragmatic philosophy in a 

618
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,091
nutshell.
And it's,

619
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:58,370
it's very,
very smart.

620
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,530
So you have a dialogue with your 
conscience that never ends and hopefully

621
00:37:06,531 --> 00:37:09,200
it gets wiser and you get wiser.

622
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,983
And

623
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,103
that's the dialogue that young talked 
about between the conscious and the 

624
00:37:16,241 --> 00:37:18,070
unconscious,
between your,

625
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,580
your fantasy life,
say the life that sort of underneath you

626
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:24,414
as a conscious being,
like the life that's part of your 

627
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:27,234
biological platform,
the biological platform that somehow 

628
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,970
miraculously gives rise to your 
consciousness.

629
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,270
If a dialogue with that.
We're always in dialogue,

630
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,910
we're always in dialogue,
right,

631
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,873
with everything.

632
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,330
So
pursue that.

633
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,643
I've watched many hours of your videos,
but I don't think I've ever heard you 

634
00:37:59,631 --> 00:38:00,464
describe yourself on the big five model.
Could care to tell us how you rank on 

635
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:04,790
each trade.
Yeah.

636
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,833
Okay.
Well there's a problem because I know 

637
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,540
the tests and so it's hard for me to 
take them without being

638
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,660
well because I know the tasks,
right?

639
00:38:14,661 --> 00:38:15,494
So it's hard for me to take them without
the ever present threat of conscious 

640
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,970
manipulation.
Um,

641
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,960
I've gone through them with my family,
you know,

642
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,970
to,
to see if we get a more accurate,

643
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,250
uh,
accurate judgment.

644
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:29,084
So I can tell you on the big 10 scale,
which is the understand myself 

645
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:35,090
personality scale,
I'm pretty,

646
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,910
I think it's 75th 80th percentile,
something like that.

647
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,970
Um,
99th percentile for assertiveness.

648
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,480
So I'm pretty extroverted cause those 
two together make extroversion.

649
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,153
And then with neuroticism,
that's a hard one because I've had this 

650
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:55,990
problem with chronic depression that 
looks like it's auto immune related.

651
00:38:55,991 --> 00:39:00,250
And so I felt a lot more negative 
emotion then the typical person does.

652
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:03,390
I would say by a substantial margin,
um,

653
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,351
withdrawal,
well,

654
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:08,560
I don't seem to shy away from things.
So,

655
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,663
you know,
apart from the fact that I do feel 

656
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,533
anticipatory anxiety,
which I think is secondary to this 

657
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,500
depression,
let's say,

658
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,630
I don't seem to shy away from things.

659
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,410
So I don't think that temperamentally,
I'm particularly high and withdrawal,

660
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,530
I am more,
um,

661
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,350
it's not irritable.
What's the,

662
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,510
what's the next one?
Volatile.

663
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,050
I'm higher in volatility than withdrawal
by a substantial margin.

664
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,330
I can be quite irritable,
but again,

665
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:39,520
it's hard to dissociate that from the 
depression.

666
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,970
So anyways,
my levels of negative emotion are higher

667
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:46,520
than I would prefer.
Um,

668
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,960
agreeableness,
I'm pretty compassionate,

669
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:50,794
pretty high,
and compassion's like 75 80th 

670
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,620
percentile.
So,

671
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,090
um,
you know,

672
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,973
and,
but I'm,

673
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,090
I'm relatively low in politeness,
so I think but not,

674
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,670
you know,
not fifth percentile,

675
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:07,330
something like 30th percentile,
40% off I remember correctly.

676
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,030
So,
um,

677
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,540
that means that,
huh?

678
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,350
It means that I'm blunt enough to hurt 
people's feelings now and then,

679
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:17,620
and that I really don't like that 
because the compassion thing gets me.

680
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,740
So,
um,

681
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,860
conscientiousness,
I'm moderately orderly,

682
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,783
70,
75th percentile and 99th percentile for 

683
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,174
industriousness and then openness,
both of them intellect and 99th 

684
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:37,030
percentile for intellect.
And then it's like 95th,

685
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,850
something like that for openness or 
higher.

686
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,830
Um,
so that's where I,

687
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,750
that's where I rank.
So

688
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,653
my wife and I found out earlier in the 
year and we may not be able to have 

689
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:52,564
children.
Then last month I was diagnosed with 

690
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:57,550
cancer.
Man,

691
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,833
how do I combat depression?
While the first thing that we should 

692
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:03,820
point out here,
I'm very sorry to hear about all that.

693
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,654
That's,
that's a lot of tragedy in a very short 

694
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:07,840
period of time.
And,

695
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,660
um,
and I'm not going to give you any casual

696
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:12,650
advice because,
but I,

697
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,690
maybe I can make some things clearer.
The first is you're not depressed.

698
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,120
You've had terrible things happen to 
you.

699
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,460
That's not the same thing,
right?

700
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,283
I distinguished between them.
If a client comes to me and they say 

701
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,550
they're feeling very sad and down and 
anxious and worried about everything and

702
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:31,384
so forth,
then I kind of walked through their 

703
00:41:32,381 --> 00:41:34,520
life.
Do they have friends?

704
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:37,040
Do they have a family?
Do they have a meaningful job?

705
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,343
Is their educational background 
appropriate for their level of 

706
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:43,910
intelligence and ability?
Are they taking care of themselves?

707
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,410
Do they have something to look forward 
to?

708
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,680
Do they use their time outside of work 
productively and wisely,

709
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,623
et cetera.
So you think about those as the 

710
00:41:50,721 --> 00:41:53,870
dimensions of a good life.
There's more,

711
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,883
or maybe there's fewer,
but that's not too bad for a quick and 

712
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,120
dirty first pass through,
let's say.

713
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,430
Um,
those are the dimensions by the way,

714
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:02,264
that you work on.
If you do the future authoring program 

715
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,563
in the self authoring suite,
you're asked to think about all those 

716
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:12,260
dimensions and consider what your life 
might be like if you optimized along all

717
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:14,090
of them.
And so,

718
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:19,370
um,
if you,

719
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,204
if all of those things are going well 
for you and you feel terrible all the 

720
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,530
time,
then you're depressed.

721
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,913
Cause there's,
there's something wrong with your 

722
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:29,470
emotional regulation.
You know,

723
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:30,304
I mean,
maybe you're having an existential 

724
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:33,190
crisis that's a possibility,
but I mean,

725
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,340
let's assume we can't see anything 
structurally wrong with your life,

726
00:42:36,341 --> 00:42:38,320
but you're feeling terrible.
Then I would say,

727
00:42:38,321 --> 00:42:39,910
well,
you have depression.

728
00:42:39,911 --> 00:42:43,210
There's something wrong.
Maybe it's physiological and people like

729
00:42:43,211 --> 00:42:44,380
that.
In my experience,

730
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:47,020
those are the people who often really 
benefit from antidepressants.

731
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,600
But then there's other sort of person 
who,

732
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,180
who is in trouble.
You know,

733
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,590
they,
they,

734
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,340
their educational attainment is not what
it should be.

735
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:04,240
They don't have a job.
They have an alcohol or drug problem.

736
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:05,403
They have a family that's really not 
functioning well or they don't have a 

737
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:11,230
family.
Their immediate relationship,

738
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,930
intimate relationship is nonexistent or 
terrible.

739
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,720
Um,
their friends are nonexistent.

740
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,990
Or,
or,

741
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,610
or worthless and,
and destructive.

742
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,863
Um,
they don't get along with their 

743
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:26,980
relatives there in poor mental and 
physical health.

744
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,880
You get the picture that's,
and they're not feeling good.

745
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,720
There are moods low and they're anxious.
That's not depression.

746
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,220
Like it might be,
you know,

747
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:37,660
but it's a terror.
But what that is,

748
00:43:37,661 --> 00:43:41,440
is a terrible life and those are 
different things they needed to be.

749
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,540
They need to be conceptualized 
differently.

750
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,780
Now even if you have a terrible life and
antidepressant might be able to lift you

751
00:43:49,121 --> 00:43:51,400
up enough so that you can keep fighting,
let's say,

752
00:43:51,401 --> 00:43:52,234
assuming that that's what you're doing,
but an antidepressant obviously isn't 

753
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,134
going to help,
isn't going to remove the fact of your 

754
00:44:01,241 --> 00:44:04,050
terrible life.
Now you,

755
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:07,750
you've got terrible things happening to 
you at the moment and,

756
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,610
and there's no simple answer to that.
I would say you could,

757
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,200
you could take a look at chapter 12 in 
my book,

758
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:20,240
12 rules for life.
It's,

759
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,210
it's called a pet.
A cat.

760
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:24,940
When you encounter one on the street.
And in part it's a,

761
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:26,523
it's an autobiography I autobiographical
chapter about how my wife and I and my 

762
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:30,640
family,
my,

763
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,800
my son and daughter and my,
my extended family as well dealt with my

764
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,710
daughter's extremely serious illness 
while she,

765
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,770
it's still,
it's still plagues are to some degree,

766
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:41,604
although not nearly as much as it did.
She was very seriously ill when she was 

767
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,720
a teenager and a,
it was an ongoing crisis,

768
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,763
a continual for years of crisis.
And so the question is how do you cope 

769
00:44:55,951 --> 00:44:58,470
with that?
And the answer is,

770
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,730
the first answer is you shrink your 
timeframe.

771
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,210
You know,
you've had these,

772
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,820
especially with regards to your 
diagnosis.

773
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:09,683
So like
all of a sudden your future has been 

774
00:45:13,621 --> 00:45:18,621
thrown completely into chaos and
you don't know how to deal with that.

775
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,233
And who would you do what you can to 
stabilize your medical treatment and do 

776
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,020
optimize your quality of life while 
that's happening.

777
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,153
Very complicated thing to do.
And then I would say you live for the 

778
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,750
day,
you know,

779
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:37,020
for the week maybe,
maybe a week's too much even,

780
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:40,320
but for the day it's like you get up in 
the morning,

781
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,453
you think I need to do everything I can 
to make this day as meaningful and and 

782
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:53,511
rich as I possibly can.
And hopefully I will have had a full day

783
00:45:55,141 --> 00:45:59,190
by this evening and then I'll be able to
sleep and then I'll be able to get up in

784
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,024
the morning and say,
I'm going to try to make this day as 

785
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,470
useful and meaningful and engaging as it
can be.

786
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,800
And then maybe when you're really sick,
you don't have a day,

787
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,410
you have hours and then you do the same 
thing for the hours.

788
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:15,540
And then maybe you do the same thing 
with the minutes.

789
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,000
I would also say,
you know,

790
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:21,834
you've been through a lot of shock and 
it's conceivable that you might need to 

791
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:26,454
talk to someone.
It's also conceivable that an 

792
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:31,140
antidepressant could help you,
you know,

793
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:31,974
you've got a lot to deal with and you 
might need your nervous system might 

794
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:37,980
need some stabilization with all that 
stress.

795
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,810
And so that's something to consider.
Antidepressants are also quite effective

796
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,110
as pain medications,
especially a drug called Cymbalta.

797
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:47,453
So that's also worth knowing because you
need to know about effective pain 

798
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:52,830
medication.
It's very important,

799
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,640
um,
in extreme situations of pain.

800
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,520
Opiates of course are the drug of 
choice,

801
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:00,354
but you can use drugs like 
methylphenidate that riddle in the Adhd 

802
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,140
drug,
you can use them as adjuncts to,

803
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:08,203
to pain medication.
And people need to know that because 

804
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,340
the,
the,

805
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:13,890
um,
there basically amphetamines,

806
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:17,640
amphetamines have analgesic properties,
but they also keep,

807
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,773
they also maintain alertness.
And so the problem with opiates is they 

808
00:47:22,561 --> 00:47:25,740
can be sedating but an opiate 
amphetamine combination.

809
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:28,950
And this is for people who are in 
absolutely intractable pain by the,

810
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,423
um,
that can increase alertness and help 

811
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:34,264
cope with pain.
And it's really useful to know what you 

812
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:37,324
might need to cope with pain.
So I would say shrink your time horizon 

813
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,063
and then,

814
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,313
oh,
thank you.

815
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,550
Okay,
thanks Tim.

816
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,010
Shrink your time horizon and then 
concentrate on the

817
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,560
concentrate on the moment.
Whatever that moment happens to be.

818
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,300
Might be the next minute.
You know,

819
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,480
I don't know what else to do when you're
in an extreme situation.

820
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,340
The other thing,
I guess the final thing I would say with

821
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:22,180
regards to the,
we may not be able to have children.

822
00:48:22,181 --> 00:48:23,014
Well you need a plan to address that to 
the best that that you can to the best 

823
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,183
way that you can.
And then you have to give yourself some 

824
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:31,960
time to reconceptualize your life and 
your future.

825
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:35,860
And I would say news,
like we may not be able to have children

826
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,250
that probably takes about a year or year
and a half to digest.

827
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:42,580
So don't be too hard on yourself if you 
haven't figured it out yet.

828
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:47,470
It's any major life transformation,
like a really major life transformation.

829
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:50,100
I would say it takes a minimum of a year
to really adapt to

830
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:09,983
please give your perspective on why 
polyamory is bad for the individual and 

831
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:13,674
society.

832
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,023
Well,
I think the fundamental reason is 

833
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:25,783
there's a bunch of reasons.
I mean the first is society seem to 

834
00:49:29,181 --> 00:49:31,880
function better.
That is less violently,

835
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,260
let's say when there's one woman per 
man.

836
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:42,340
If there's many women per man,
there aren't many women for every man.

837
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:49,040
There are a handful of men,
let's say a minority of men,

838
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:49,903
a predo distribution of men
who have a disproportionate number of 

839
00:49:57,081 --> 00:50:02,081
women and a lot of men who have none and
those aren't happy man,

840
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,620
let's put it that way.
Uh,

841
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,010
there are men who are very likely to get
up to no good,

842
00:50:10,011 --> 00:50:11,990
very rapidly.
So there's that.

843
00:50:12,830 --> 00:50:17,830
Then I would say the women who,
let's say a man has many women,

844
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:22,070
and let's say he's a desirable man for 
that matter,

845
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,140
just for the sake of argument,
if he has a variety of women,

846
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,153
those women don't have much of him,
so they don't get to establish a real 

847
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,490
individual relationship with him because
it's going to be fragmentary.

848
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:41,400
And I don't believe that that's 
satisfying for people.

849
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:42,234
I think that what you want as much as 
you possibly can is to have people 

850
00:50:47,041 --> 00:50:52,041
around you with whom you can weave your 
life together over the short term,

851
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:56,910
medium term and long term.
It adds depth to your life in a way that

852
00:50:56,911 --> 00:50:59,820
almost nothing else can.
And so

853
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,393
what you do,
and so I'd been speaking more about 

854
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:07,840
permanent polyamorous relationships you 
might ask,

855
00:51:07,841 --> 00:51:10,380
but what about sequential ones where you
know,

856
00:51:10,381 --> 00:51:13,080
you're,
which is in some ways indiscriminate,

857
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:15,860
indiscriminate,
indiscriminate from,

858
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,760
uh,
um,

859
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,290
well from just casual sleeping around?
Um,

860
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:22,823
I think the problem with that is that to
sleep around casually is to imply that 

861
00:51:27,211 --> 00:51:31,890
sex is casual.
To imply that sexist casual is to assume

862
00:51:31,891 --> 00:51:35,490
implicitly that it can be divorced from 
the rest of life,

863
00:51:35,491 --> 00:51:38,070
emotional life,
motivational life values,

864
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:41,730
all of that.
And you can divorce it,

865
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:42,564
but you pay a big price for that.
I think the price you pay is like the 

866
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:47,790
virtual,
it's,

867
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:48,624
it,
it,

868
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,710
well the word psychopathic keeps 
leaking,

869
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,690
leaping to mind,
leaking to mind.

870
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,720
Yeah,
good old Freud.

871
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:58,873
Um,
you have to reduce a person to the 

872
00:52:04,961 --> 00:52:07,270
casual pleasure of a

873
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,070
transients sexual interaction in order 
to

874
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:19,030
sleep around casually.
And I think that once you establish that

875
00:52:19,031 --> 00:52:23,350
as a habit with sex,
which is a deep,

876
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,850
deep experience,
if you'll,

877
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,000
if you'll do that with sex,
which is a deep experience then,

878
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,193
and you learn how,
then what makes you think that won't 

879
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:37,960
transfer to everything else that you do.
I don't see how it can fail too.

880
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,380
So,
you know,

881
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:42,041
you could say,
well,

882
00:52:42,041 --> 00:52:44,440
monogamy isn't a very good solution.
It's like,

883
00:52:44,441 --> 00:52:47,710
well,
life is a fatal section.

884
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,573
Fatal.
What is this sexually transmitted 

885
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:53,530
disease with 100% fatality rate too?
You know,

886
00:52:53,531 --> 00:52:57,130
there's lots of really complex problems 
for which we only have

887
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,190
the best answer we can come up with,
which is not,

888
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:05,970
not a utopian answer,
but I would say,

889
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:10,350
and I think the evidence supports this 
as well,

890
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:13,980
that stable monogamy is the best 
solution that we know of.

891
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:14,843
And it's also the minimum necessary 
requirement for the stability of 

892
00:53:18,841 --> 00:53:21,390
children.
So

893
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,690
polyamory,
it's wrong,

894
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,960
it's wrong.
It makes men violent.

895
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:31,790
It increases inequality in,
in,

896
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,020
in the manner that makes things 
dangerous.

897
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:38,940
It makes it impossible for women to have
a deep relationship with men.

898
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:43,170
It makes it,
it facilitates the,

899
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,270
uh,
what would you call it,

900
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,493
the transformation of sex into something
casual and then that spills out into 

901
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:51,870
the,
into the rest of the world.

902
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,423
Um,
it deprives the people who engage in it 

903
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,830
have the opportunity of establishing a 
stable,

904
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:02,820
longterm,
longterm,

905
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,040
mutually,
uh,

906
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,313
mutually satisfying.
It's more than that mutually beneficial 

907
00:54:09,781 --> 00:54:10,800
relationship.
You know,

908
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:12,360
cause a good,
a good marriage.

909
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:13,643
The people in it,
gay gain more than there are more than 

910
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:18,120
twice as good.
Right?

911
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,960
It,
it,

912
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,860
the,
the,

913
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,993
the benefits aren't precisely linear,
so you lose that destabilizes the 

914
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:27,810
situation for children.
There you go,

915
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:30,240
man.
That's a lot of things that aren't about

916
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:31,074
it,
that aren't good,

917
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,243
that's for sure.

918
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,363
Yeah.

919
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,513
How do you think altered state of 
consciousness or shamonic experiences 

920
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,820
can you should be integrated into modern
life and scientific thought?

921
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,743
Man,
you guys are really asking some tough 

922
00:54:49,711 --> 00:54:54,711
questions today.
Well,

923
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:55,704
the first thing that we should realize 
is that states of altered consciousness 

924
00:54:59,311 --> 00:55:02,550
are,
people have been experimenting with them

925
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:03,384
forever
and God only knows what the consequence 

926
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:08,654
of this.
I certainly believe that the old Greek 

927
00:55:11,121 --> 00:55:11,954
mysteries were
institution induced hallucinogenic 

928
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:18,924
experiences.
I think that most of the religious 

929
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:25,350
stories that we have are a consequence 
of psychedelic experience.

930
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,143
Most a substantial number of them.
It certainly seems to be the case with 

931
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:31,920
so much,
for example,

932
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:34,080
which looks like it was the flyer 
garrick mushroom,

933
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,360
the Amanita,
um,

934
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,250
people have been using hallucinogenics 
substances for a very long time and they

935
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:46,480
produce very incomprehensible sets of 
experiences,

936
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:51,510
most recently documented by the research
teams at Johns Hopkins

937
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:54,243
where they've shown that if you give 
people enough magic mushrooms silicide 

938
00:55:57,341 --> 00:56:01,060
been to induce a mystical experience 
that you decrease their death,

939
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,040
anxiety and fear when they have cancer 
diagnosis,

940
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,580
which is really something.
And that a single dose of mushrooms that

941
00:56:09,581 --> 00:56:14,230
produces a mystical experience has about
an 85% cure rate for smoking,

942
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:16,690
which is absolutely beyond 
comprehension.

943
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:22,350
So the psychedelic substances seem to 
open up another plane of so to speak.

944
00:56:24,161 --> 00:56:24,994
You know,
and it's,

945
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:30,160
it's that part of experience that's,
that has an infinite scope.

946
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,010
Why they do that,
how they do that,

947
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,320
what that means.
God only knows,

948
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,560
God only knows.
I don't think we understand psychedelics

949
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,280
even a bit.
I don't think that they what?

950
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,160
I don't think they fit into our current 
worldview.

951
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,080
So how should they be integrated?
Well,

952
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,630
you're a fool if you play with 
psychedelics,

953
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:56,480
don't,
what did Carl Young say?

954
00:56:56,481 --> 00:57:01,481
Beware of unearned wisdom.
That's pretty damn smart.

955
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:07,550
So you don't play with them.
If you're inclined to experiment,

956
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:09,223
then you should treat them with respect.
You should go into the experience with 

957
00:57:12,921 --> 00:57:16,610
the expectation and the desire that your
life will,

958
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,473
that you will learn something painful as
that's going to be and that your life 

959
00:57:21,141 --> 00:57:21,974
will be transformed in a positive 
direction and you should pray to 

960
00:57:24,621 --> 00:57:27,290
whatever God's you worship that they 
don't rip you apart.

961
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,700
You know?
And then maybe you'll be sensible enough

962
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:32,534
to learn something and you build to 
bring it back from the underworld and 

963
00:57:35,211 --> 00:57:36,044
you build integrated into your life 
carefully and you'll be a better person 

964
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:41,630
as a consequence.
But be careful what you hope for.

965
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,200
Okay?

966
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,740
I don't even have the conscientiousness 
to sit down and do self authoring.

967
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:50,110
I bought it over a year ago and haven't 
opened it.

968
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,450
What the Hell is wrong with me?
Well,

969
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,750
lots of things probably because there's 
lots of things wrong with everybody,

970
00:57:55,751 --> 00:57:58,570
but let's,
let's not go right for the jugular.

971
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:00,670
You know,
let's assume,

972
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:02,103
let's assume that the problem is 
relatively simple before we assume that 

973
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,613
your character is beyond salvage,
which is also something I would 

974
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:11,920
recommend if you're arguing with your 
wife or your husband or your partner,

975
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:12,754
you know,
assume that their character can be 

976
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,650
salvaged.
It's a good way to start the argument.

977
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,233
So I would say,
why don't you have a smaller goal in 

978
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:25,204
also,
if you notice that you're not doing 

979
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:27,814
something,
I'm not doing the self authoring 

980
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,711
program.
Well,

981
00:58:29,711 --> 00:58:31,750
maybe it's daunting to you,
you know,

982
00:58:31,751 --> 00:58:33,820
or,
or maybe you're not very disciplined her

983
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,520
or maybe both or maybe six other things.

984
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,480
Who knows,
right?

985
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,400
Maybe you're angry that you spent money 
on it.

986
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:40,790
Um,
it's,

987
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,650
it could be any number of reasons.
Maybe you don't want a better life.

988
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,810
Maybe there are things in your past you 
don't want to look into.

989
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:50,950
Maybe you're afraid of your personality.
Maybe you're terrified of the future and

990
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:52,840
you don't want to think about it.
God,

991
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,703
any of those things can be true.
But what you want to do is first notice 

992
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:58,210
that you're not doing it.
It's like,

993
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,710
oh,
I'm not doing this.

994
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,720
Well,
I must be going about it wrong.

995
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,880
Well,
it started the definition of wrong,

996
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:04,714
right?
If you're trying to do something and 

997
00:59:05,351 --> 00:59:07,390
you're not doing it,
then you're doing it wrong.

998
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,480
That's for sure by your own definition.
So let's say,

999
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:11,314
well,
if you're trying to do something 

1000
00:59:12,311 --> 00:59:13,144
difficult and you're not doing it well,
you can be yourself with a stick until 

1001
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:16,330
you do it.

1002
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,250
Or You could hire someone else to do it,
you know,

1003
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:21,410
metaphorically speaking or even maybe 
really if you want do it.

1004
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,290
Um,
but the best,

1005
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,213
but barring that,
the next best thing is to aim at 

1006
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:27,974
something lower.
Obviously your two useless to do the 

1007
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:31,370
self authoring program.
Okay.

1008
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,580
Um,
ask yourself,

1009
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:36,020
sit on the edge of your bed and say,
okay,

1010
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:38,660
I think I'd like to try this self 
authoring program.

1011
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,480
Is there some step I could take towards 
that,

1012
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:43,400
that I would do?
I would say,

1013
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:45,020
well,
maybe you can think what I have to do to

1014
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:45,681
do it.
Oh,

1015
00:59:45,681 --> 00:59:49,520
I have to find my username and password.
Then I have to open the web.

1016
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,050
No,
I've turned on my computer.

1017
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:54,050
I have to look in my email.
I have to find my username and password.

1018
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:57,200
I have to find the site.
I have to open the site.

1019
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,033
Then I have to enter the username and 
password and then I have to start 

1020
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:02,271
reading it.
Okay,

1021
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:05,450
so then you think got to walk through it
like it's a simulation.

1022
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,450
Which of those things are you unwilling 
to do?

1023
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:11,660
You can ask yourself,
am I willing to go turn my computer on?

1024
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:15,830
Yes.
Am I willing to open my email?

1025
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,843
Yes.
Am I willing to search through my email 

1026
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:20,720
for the username and password?
Well,

1027
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,970
I'm a bit worried about that because I 
bought it a year ago.

1028
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,120
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to 
find the username and password.

1029
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,403
Okay.
Do you think you can handle that 

1030
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,650
potential disappointment and 
frustration?

1031
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,110
Yes.
I could do that for 10 minutes.

1032
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,520
Okay.
You could always buy it again,

1033
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:35,690
if you look lost.
Right.

1034
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:37,460
If you really want to do,
it's not that big a deal.

1035
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:38,713
Okay,
so it looks like I'll turn on the 

1036
01:00:40,191 --> 01:00:41,210
computer,
I'll sit down,

1037
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:43,100
I'll turn on the computer,
open my email,

1038
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,180
I'll look for the username and password 
and I'll buy it if I can't find it.

1039
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,820
That's possibility.
Will you actually do those things?

1040
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:51,530
Like would you do them right now?
Yeah,

1041
01:00:51,531 --> 01:00:52,364
I think I do that.
Would you also put the username and 

1042
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:59,981
password into the program itself?
Well then you feel a little resistance.

1043
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:02,360
You think,
well maybe,

1044
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,740
maybe I do that.
Maybe I wouldn't.

1045
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:04,574
Okay.
Would you put the username and password 

1046
01:01:06,741 --> 01:01:08,750
into the program and start reading?
It's like,

1047
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:09,920
nope,
that's too much.

1048
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:10,783
It's like,
okay.

1049
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:11,990
Then you might think,
well,

1050
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:13,910
if I wasn't such a useless son of a 
bitch,

1051
01:01:13,911 --> 01:01:15,950
I just sit down and do the whole thing.
It's like,

1052
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:16,581
yeah,
maybe,

1053
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:17,414
but you are exactly that useless kind of
son of a bitch and so you can ask 

1054
01:01:21,381 --> 01:01:23,750
yourself politely what you're willing to
do.

1055
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:24,913
You might find that you're willing to 
open the damn program and put the 

1056
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,584
username and password in and like look 
at the first sentence and that's a big 

1057
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:30,890
accomplishment.

1058
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:31,723
It's like you could take yourself out 
for dinner to dinner for managing that 

1059
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,290
and I'm not being cynical.
It's like way to be you opened it.

1060
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:41,900
That means you have to get over your 
anticipatory anxiety.

1061
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:44,750
That's a big deal.
Maybe that's enough for the day.

1062
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,723
If you're find that you're not doing 
something that you know you should be 

1063
01:01:49,521 --> 01:01:52,970
doing,
ask yourself like seriously.

1064
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,790
Like you would ask someone else.
Like you'd ask someone you care about,

1065
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,540
like you'd ask someone you'd listened to
what it is that you're willing to do.

1066
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,970
You won't clean up your room.
Okay,

1067
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:05,240
will you clean up your closet?
No.

1068
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,523
Will you?
Will you look in your closet and like 

1069
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,560
think about some things that you might 
clean up if you did it the next day.

1070
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,910
It's like,
yes.

1071
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:17,000
Well there you go.
Successful negotiation.

1072
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,253
You know,
you gotta you're not your own slave and 

1073
01:02:19,771 --> 01:02:21,060
you're not your own tyrant.

1074
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,720
You have to deal with yourself.
You have to negotiate with yourself just

1075
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:26,460
like you'd negotiate with another 
person.

1076
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:30,240
So that means you've got to take your 
stubborn idiocy the way you find it.

1077
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,463
You got to accept it.
And then you have to ask yourself like 

1078
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:34,224
you'd ask a really bratty nine year old 
kid what you might be willing to do to 

1079
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:39,684
put another foot forward.
And then you have to do it small as it 

1080
01:02:43,891 --> 01:02:46,770
is in humility because you're so damn 
useless.

1081
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:48,540
That was the best you could manage.
It's like,

1082
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,980
well,
it's better than nothing,

1083
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:54,360
so it's good enough.
And if you do that every day,

1084
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,583
if you try that every day or every 
second day or once a week for that 

1085
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:58,621
matter,
you know,

1086
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:03,621
if you allow yourself to genuinely step 
forward on a reasonably regular basis,

1087
01:03:04,321 --> 01:03:06,420
you'll actually move forward.
You know,

1088
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:09,600
even that will do the trick because the 
benefits will start to compound.

1089
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,050
So if you're not hitting what you're 
aiming at,

1090
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,053
aim lower,
move closer to the target until you can 

1091
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:19,883
hit it,
until you can hit it with a little bit 

1092
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:25,050
of effort and accept that as your 
starting point.

1093
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,280
At least.
That's good.

1094
01:03:26,281 --> 01:03:28,080
You found your starting point.
Hurray.

1095
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,850
Hurray.
You're on the path.

1096
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:31,920
Good for you.
You know it really.

1097
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,090
I'm serious about that.

1098
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,610
Yeah.

1099
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,350
My wife says,
I am like you.

1100
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,513
I he obsessed by ideas and sell them.
Want to talk about much else she wants 

1101
01:03:42,001 --> 01:03:44,460
me to ask if your wife has ever annoyed 
by it.

1102
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,220
Ha Ha.
No,

1103
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:51,390
I don't know if she's annoyed by that.
I think she's worn out by it,

1104
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,070
you know?
I mean,

1105
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,780
I'm amazed that she can,
she seems to be able to live with me,

1106
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:03,270
which is asking quite a lot of someone 
because there's always a lot going on,

1107
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:04,830
you know?
I mean,

1108
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:12,020
so I don't think she's annoyed by it.
I think she's overwhelmed by it

1109
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:13,643
and fair enough.
And maybe sometimes she's annoyed by it 

1110
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,900
too,
to be obsessed by ideas like that.

1111
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,720
Well that's part of being high in trade 
openness at,

1112
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:25,230
especially if you're also extroverted.
That's what you like.

1113
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:27,300
You know,
you're high in openness.

1114
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,730
You should have your wife take the 
understand myself,

1115
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:32,640
test and,
and you two and then you can look,

1116
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:34,800
we're going to build this couple's 
report pretty soon.

1117
01:04:34,801 --> 01:04:36,810
That will,
I'm working on the paragraphs now.

1118
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:37,644
The infrastructure's already in place.
That will enable people to compare one 

1119
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:40,830
another.
But you know,

1120
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:44,100
it sounds like your extremely high in 
trade.

1121
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:46,110
Openness,
especially on the intellect dimension.

1122
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:49,710
And perhaps your wife is lower on on 
that dimension.

1123
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:50,873
And so take the test and find out and 
then you'll both understand that it's 

1124
01:04:53,581 --> 01:04:55,560
characterological.
So,

1125
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:58,950
okay,

1126
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:03,470
you might need to find people that share
your intellectual predilection.

1127
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:04,803
Um,
if you're interests are more than your 

1128
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:14,391
wife can easily
and happily,

1129
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:16,820
let's say,
tolerate

1130
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:38,840
well.
Hi Dr. Peterson.

1131
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:42,470
I'm a member of the translators who 
translate your video into Chinese.

1132
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:46,520
How can I speak the truth and survive in
China and protect my family?

1133
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,040
Oh Man.
While the first thing I would say is,

1134
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,190
God,
that's a hard question.

1135
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,333
Carefully and carefully and attentively.
How can I speak the truth and survive 

1136
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:07,900
carefully and attentively?
I mean,

1137
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:12,850
I would say rule number one,
rule number one,

1138
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,990
don't suck.
Don't sully your soul.

1139
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,960
That's like rule number one in life.
You know,

1140
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:21,873
you got to decide what's horrible.
And obviously being persecuted for your 

1141
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,780
opinion is horrible.
There's no doubt about that.

1142
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:34,380
But being unable to,
being forced to live in a web of silence

1143
01:06:38,041 --> 01:06:42,840
and deception is also horrible.
I'm not going to say worse.

1144
01:06:42,870 --> 01:06:46,950
I'm going to say also horrible.
So you've got Hobson's choice there.

1145
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:52,470
If you're going to do what you can to 
tell the truth,

1146
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,353
then do it with humility and care.
Start within the confines of your own 

1147
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:01,950
immediate circle.
And don't get arrogant.

1148
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,350
Don't get arrogant,
don't think you'll get away with it.

1149
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,770
You have to be doing it humbly and 
carefully.

1150
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,093
Okay?

1151
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:16,010
Push on what you can push on that you 
think might change.

1152
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:23,570
And don't be contemptuous of small 
victories

1153
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:30,840
and take care of yourself.
Be careful.

1154
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,683
You want to maintain yourself while 
you're making your attempts so that you 

1155
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:42,120
can be along to around to do it for a 
long time.

1156
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:43,643
So see,
and I guess we could rephrase the last 

1157
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,720
part of your question because we could 
also say,

1158
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:49,554
how can I speak anything but the truth 
and survive in China and protect my 

1159
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:54,384
family?
I do believe that in the medium to 

1160
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:01,330
longterm and all things considered,
you never have a better bet than telling

1161
01:08:02,851 --> 01:08:03,684
the truth.
But I do say that realizing that there 

1162
01:08:06,511 --> 01:08:07,344
are places and times where it's 
relatively safe to do so and places and 

1163
01:08:12,241 --> 01:08:15,030
times where it's relatively unsafe to do
so.

1164
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:19,400
And if you're in China now and for a 
very long time,

1165
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:22,220
you're in a place where it's relatively 
unsafe to do so.

1166
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,610
Don't take unnecessary risks,

1167
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:30,073
dope

1168
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:36,550
but don't.
But you have every reason to try to keep

1169
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:38,540
your soul and your word intact.

1170
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:40,683
Yeah,

1171
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,513
my brother committed suicide and I'm 
taking care of my sister's kids age 

1172
01:08:56,161 --> 01:08:58,950
seven and three until she stables 
stable.

1173
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:01,500
How can I help them cope with the loss 
of their uncle?

1174
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,250
Well,
how do you help kids cope?

1175
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:18,703
You
put a stable routine together around 

1176
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,160
them so that they don't have any 
additional uncertainty in their life.

1177
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:31,650
You decide that you're oriented towards 
their future.

1178
01:09:31,651 --> 01:09:33,120
Good.
You know,

1179
01:09:33,180 --> 01:09:36,300
you got to decide that as deeply as you 
can.

1180
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,840
Are you resentful about having to take 
care of them?

1181
01:09:39,841 --> 01:09:42,720
Cause you might be,
and maybe you have your reasons too,

1182
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:43,554
but I would scour your soul for that 
possibility and see if you can rectify 

1183
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:53,841
it by whatever means necessary,
act responsibly and reliably.

1184
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,903
And that will give them faith in adults,
which is good because they need some 

1185
01:09:59,761 --> 01:10:00,594
faith and they're going to be adults.
So they need to have some faith in 

1186
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:03,744
adults,

1187
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:09,363
play with them,

1188
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,080
pay attention to them,
play with them.

1189
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,140
It's not a bad idea to teach kids how to
come and get a hug.

1190
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:22,423
You can,
uh,

1191
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:25,400
you can do that in a pretend play mode.
You know,

1192
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:26,031
you say,
look,

1193
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:28,610
let's practice something.
Why don't you Prac,

1194
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:29,453
let's pretend that you need a hug.
And then let's pretend that you need 

1195
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:34,760
some practice in figuring out how to ask
for what,

1196
01:10:34,761 --> 01:10:35,594
because everybody needs a hug sometimes.
Even the three and the seven year old 

1197
01:10:37,991 --> 01:10:38,824
and both should both be able to play 
that game and then have them practice 

1198
01:10:41,781 --> 01:10:42,614
until they get good at it.
And then you can play that like every 

1199
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:47,750
day for three weeks until they're 
really,

1200
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:48,584
really good at it.
And so that when they're feeling 

1201
01:10:49,551 --> 01:10:50,384
lonesome,
they can,

1202
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:51,380
and then you tell them,
look,

1203
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:54,920
pretend you're feeling lonesome.
How do you come and get a hug?

1204
01:10:55,190 --> 01:10:56,860
And you got to figure that out.
You know,

1205
01:10:56,930 --> 01:10:59,330
maybe they just come on and they look at
your feet and they say,

1206
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,340
I feeling lonesome.
I really need a hug.

1207
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:03,590
And then you know,
you know,

1208
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:06,230
you can teach them to come and get 
attention from you when they need it.

1209
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:09,800
And that's really what a kid needs is to
have someone there to pay attention when

1210
01:11:09,801 --> 01:11:11,390
the kid needs it.
That's really,

1211
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,010
that's really a good thing.

1212
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:25,423
The seven year old in particular is 
probably going to wonder if he or she 

1213
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:35,240
was the cause of the suicide.
That conversation might come up.

1214
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:36,993
You want it,
want to watch the kid to see if there's 

1215
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:40,480
any evidence that he or she believes 
that

1216
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:43,603
it's an easy thing for kids to believe 
because it actually helps them make a 

1217
01:11:45,651 --> 01:11:47,690
little bit of sense out of what happens.
You know,

1218
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:49,760
something terrible happened.
I lost my dad.

1219
01:11:49,761 --> 01:11:51,580
He went away.
I wasn't good enough for them.

1220
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:53,090
You know,
that's really easy,

1221
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:56,240
easy thing to think.
So you might want to keep your eyes open

1222
01:11:56,241 --> 01:12:01,241
for the necessity of that conversation.
I'm a minority.

1223
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,293
I kids are mixed or resent the 
disempowering narrative of victim hood 

1224
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:18,630
being handed to them.
It's lazy and offensive.

1225
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:23,870
How to arm them against it.
That's a good one.

1226
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:26,400
Well,
the first question is,

1227
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,660
you didn't tell me how old they were,
so that complicates things,

1228
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:36,410
but I would say you better pay attention
to what they're being taught in school.

1229
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,413
My suggestion to parents is that if your
kids are in a class where they talk 

1230
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:47,100
about diversity,
equity,

1231
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,040
inclusivity,
gender,

1232
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,320
white privilege,

1233
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:55,810
that's not a bad,
there's other words too,

1234
01:12:55,811 --> 01:12:56,644
but we'll stick with those that your 
kids should be encouraged to leave the 

1235
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:02,140
class because they're not being 
educated.

1236
01:13:02,141 --> 01:13:04,000
They're being indoctrinated.
Now,

1237
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:04,834
that doesn't mean that there can't be an
intelligent discussion about any one of 

1238
01:13:08,711 --> 01:13:11,080
those topics,
but when they come together in a group,

1239
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:11,914
then that's a pretty good marker that 
you're in the vicinity of a radical 

1240
01:13:15,611 --> 01:13:18,400
leftist,
neo Marxist ideology,

1241
01:13:18,401 --> 01:13:21,220
and there's no excuse for that being 
foisted on your children.

1242
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,980
You may have to have a serious chat with
your school,

1243
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:28,840
with your kids,
teachers with the principal.

1244
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:30,760
You may have to learn how to form your 
argument,

1245
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:33,790
formulate your arguments against the 
practice,

1246
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:36,880
like if you resent it,
what are you going to do?

1247
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,453
You're going to put up with it.
You're going to get angry and take it 

1248
01:13:40,421 --> 01:13:43,720
out on someone else you to do something 
stupid because you're resentful.

1249
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:44,733
It's like those are,
that's likely right or you're going to 

1250
01:13:46,281 --> 01:13:48,370
swallow it and get weak.
I mean,

1251
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,140
Jesus,
those are dismal options.

1252
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,191
I mean,
first of all,

1253
01:13:51,191 --> 01:13:54,160
you might want to find out if all your 
resentment is justified.

1254
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,233
You can talk to someone that you admire 
and see if you're just flying off the 

1255
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:59,950
handle because maybe you are.
But if you're not,

1256
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:01,323
well,
if something is happening that you 

1257
01:14:03,491 --> 01:14:04,324
really don't like,
that's a sign that you have to do 

1258
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:10,780
something about it because you're being 
is

1259
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,600
rebelling against that constraint.

1260
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:17,723
So

1261
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,230
you have to get more educated.
You have to get more articulate.

1262
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:24,570
You have to get more politically 
oriented,

1263
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,820
politically savvy,
politically involved.

1264
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,210
You have to talk to people and make a 
coalition.

1265
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:33,840
Um,
you have to face down,

1266
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,930
you're chill,
your children's teacher.

1267
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:41,520
You have to come up with a plan for what
happens if when you faced them down,

1268
01:14:41,521 --> 01:14:45,000
nothing changes.
You have to lay out a strategy of,

1269
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:50,330
of idiation war or you have to live with
your resentment and risk.

1270
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:54,900
Having your children disempowered by the
narrative of victim hood,

1271
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,600
that seems like a really bad outcome.
You know,

1272
01:14:57,990 --> 01:15:02,990
if they see you resisting it actively,
then you are right then in there

1273
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:12,650
acting out than the contrary narrative.
So if you don't believe that they should

1274
01:15:14,671 --> 01:15:15,504
be described as disempowered,
then you should act in a manner that 

1275
01:15:18,811 --> 01:15:23,811
indicates that your convictions have far
more potency then you might believe,

1276
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,193
okay,

1277
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:33,050
Sam Harris has accused me of sophistry 
and my Bible lectures.

1278
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:35,990
How do you draw the line between 
sophistry and a valid reading?

1279
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:37,183
Well,
welcome to the universe of literary 

1280
01:15:38,991 --> 01:15:41,570
criticism.
Seriously.

1281
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:43,160
Right?
Cause that's the real question.

1282
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:48,890
I look for patterns.

1283
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:53,100
You know,
when I wrote maps of meaning,

1284
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:58,130
which is my first book,
I laid out a description of the way that

1285
01:15:58,561 --> 01:16:03,561
we perceive the world and I wanted to 
know if it was an accurate perception.

1286
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,883
And so I tested it against multiple 
levels of analysis and so I wanted to 

1287
01:16:08,701 --> 01:16:12,120
see while it did it stand up,
did the story stand up logically?

1288
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:18,020
Was it in keeping with the,
what was known at that point in terms of

1289
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,243
functional neuropsychology?
Was it in keeping with the literary 

1290
01:16:25,621 --> 01:16:26,454
tradition?
Did it make sense from the perspective 

1291
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:29,454
of mythology,
all of these things in my supposition 

1292
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:34,830
was that if

1293
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:40,220
the interpretation remain coherent 
across all those levels of analysis,

1294
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:42,920
the probability that that was spurious 
was very low.

1295
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:44,473
Just like you can think about it as akin
to the way that you detect whether or 

1296
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:49,604
not something's real using your senses,
you have five qualitatively different 

1297
01:16:53,031 --> 01:16:53,864
senses and if one of them reports the 
existence of something that might be 

1298
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:58,814
faulty and if if to report the existence
of something maybe even that would be 

1299
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:04,400
faulty.
But if five of them report it,

1300
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,863
then the probability that there's 
something there is starting to become 

1301
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,100
high enough so that you don't die by 
relying on it,

1302
01:17:13,610 --> 01:17:17,750
which is really our fundamental,
what would you say it?

1303
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:19,730
Manifestation.
Indication of,

1304
01:17:19,850 --> 01:17:22,730
of sufficiency.
Um,

1305
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:25,743
you know Sam's,
I don't think Sam ready accused me of 

1306
01:17:28,431 --> 01:17:29,630
software street.
Precisely.

1307
01:17:29,631 --> 01:17:34,631
What he did was say like the postmodern 
is say any text is susceptible,

1308
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:39,860
susceptible to a very large number of 
interpretations.

1309
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:44,960
How do you know yours is?
While you could say true,

1310
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:46,423
this is where things get complicated 
because it depends on what you mean by 

1311
01:17:48,951 --> 01:17:49,784
true,
which is another thing that Sam and I 

1312
01:17:50,991 --> 01:17:55,190
had a head to head about.
You know,

1313
01:17:55,191 --> 01:17:56,024
I act out my interpretations of the 
stories that I read and I detect there 

1314
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:02,533
the consequence of that action in the 
world and use that as another means of 

1315
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:10,841
deep determining their validity.
So acting in this manner,

1316
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:12,853
the manner that I believe is appropriate
as a consequence of the way that I've 

1317
01:18:16,461 --> 01:18:17,294
interpreted come to interpret these 
great mythological stories has been of 

1318
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:26,140
inestimable [inaudible] bell inestimable
benefit in my life.

1319
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:27,973
And I think it's helped my family a lot,
my immediate family and my broader 

1320
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:34,070
family.
It's helped my friends,

1321
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:34,963
it's helped my students,
it seems to be helping the broader 

1322
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:43,370
community and it's commensurate with 
what I know scientifically.

1323
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,890
And so
if that's sophistry that isn't sophistry

1324
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,950
because it's just too many points of 
contact.

1325
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:56,810
So,
so no,

1326
01:18:59,000 --> 01:18:59,840
besides,
you know,

1327
01:18:59,841 --> 01:19:00,674
there's other ways of,
there's other ways of protecting 

1328
01:19:02,061 --> 01:19:06,080
yourself against Sofa street to one of 
the ways you can tell if you're a social

1329
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,680
scientist and you've actually found 
something is that you're not happy about

1330
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:13,190
it.
So if you do a data analysis and you get

1331
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:15,500
a result and you think,
Oh God,

1332
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,220
that's the last thing I hope for,
then that's pretty good evidence.

1333
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,113
Not Conclusive,
obviously that's pretty good evidence 

1334
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:22,454
that you've actually found something 
real that's sorta like the data for the 

1335
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,474
data that's being generated by the 
personality theorists lately showing 

1336
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:31,610
that as societies become more 
egalitarian,

1337
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:32,653
the proclivity of men and women to 
choose different occupational roots 

1338
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,823
increases rather than decreases.
You can be sure that whoever made that 

1339
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:43,100
finding that isn't what they were hoping
for because that's,

1340
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:43,851
well,
first of all,

1341
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:44,840
who would hope for that?

1342
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:45,771
You know,
it's,

1343
01:19:45,771 --> 01:19:49,520
it's just there isn't an ideology 
supporting that as a desirable outcome.

1344
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,523
I mean,
it might be a great outcome because it 

1345
01:19:51,261 --> 01:19:52,094
means that as you make society's more 
sociologically flat say in terms of 

1346
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:56,834
opportunity,
men and women get to choose what they 

1347
01:19:59,001 --> 01:19:59,834
want.
And they actually choose different 

1348
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:02,690
things and that's okay,
you could say that,

1349
01:20:02,691 --> 01:20:03,524
but hardly anyone is.
So there's almost no one who's happy 

1350
01:20:05,511 --> 01:20:09,960
when they find that.
So often when you interpret a story,

1351
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,660
let's say you come up with a self 
serving interpretation,

1352
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:13,494
then you might think,
well I know I'm going to trust that 

1353
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:17,790
because it's self serving.
But often if you,

1354
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,270
I believe is if you take the union tack,
for example,

1355
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:26,040
through the mythological material,
you don't find what you want.

1356
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:28,320
You find the opposite of that young 
said,

1357
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:32,790
what's his prime d dictum derive from 
alchemy in sterk wiliness infinite tour,

1358
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:36,000
which I'm probably butchering in terms 
of pronunciation.

1359
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,700
Of course no one knows,
uh,

1360
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,810
cause it's Latin.
Um,

1361
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:44,580
what you most want will be found where 
you least want to look.

1362
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,180
Well that's hardly a self serving 
interpretation.

1363
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:51,660
Who's going to generate that man?
But that's what the,

1364
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,030
that's the dragon and the gold right 
there.

1365
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:56,843
So

1366
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,860
you know,
if your interpretation makes things more

1367
01:20:59,861 --> 01:21:03,550
difficult for you,
it makes things more challenging,

1368
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:06,790
requires you to be more mature,
requires you to be more responsible.

1369
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:07,624
All of those things.
Then I would also say that that's a 

1370
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:10,324
testament to its validity because it's 
not self evidently contaminated by 

1371
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:16,840
impulsive self interest.
So

1372
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,283
how is it that society has not learned 
from history about the dangers of 

1373
01:21:30,391 --> 01:21:31,680
socialism,
Marxism,

1374
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:33,450
radiology,
et Cetera,

1375
01:21:33,451 --> 01:21:35,850
after years,
how to Marxists get away with it?

1376
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,313
Well,
let's,

1377
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:43,270
let's not go with the dangers of 
etiology.

1378
01:21:43,271 --> 01:21:47,380
Let's go with the dangers of like to 
call it radical left wing ideology.

1379
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,170
Well,
I think the reason for this,

1380
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:51,004
and this also might buy the reason,
be the reason that there's a strange 

1381
01:21:54,161 --> 01:21:54,994
thing that the iconography of,
of social of communism is still 

1382
01:21:58,961 --> 01:21:59,794
acceptable socially,
whereas the iconography of Nazi-ism 

1383
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,640
isn't.
Now,

1384
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:04,743
I'm not saying that we should make the 
icons of Nazi-ism socially acceptable 

1385
01:22:09,221 --> 01:22:10,054
either.
I think that the communist icon 

1386
01:22:12,251 --> 01:22:14,500
shouldn't be socially acceptable,
but they are.

1387
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,870
And there's probably a reason for that.
You know,

1388
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:21,760
now part of it is that the left has 
never taken on.

1389
01:22:21,761 --> 01:22:22,594
The radical left has ne never taken 
responsibility for being on the same 

1390
01:22:26,471 --> 01:22:27,304
side as the Stalinists and the Maoists 
and the Cambodian murderers and all of 

1391
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:33,430
that.
So that's part of it.

1392
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:35,860
But then the next part is,
I think there's something deeper.

1393
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:38,883
I think that

1394
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:40,533
no inequality is a reality and it's a 
reality that cannot be put at the feet 

1395
01:22:45,351 --> 01:22:49,160
of capitalism or at the feet of human 
political structure.

1396
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,720
There's a good book you guys might want 
to read this called the great leveler by

1397
01:22:53,721 --> 01:22:54,554
Walter Shy Dale,
and it's a new book and it's the study 

1398
01:22:56,721 --> 01:22:57,554
of inequality.
And one of the things he does is do an 

1399
01:22:58,851 --> 01:23:02,240
empirical analysis of the relationship 
between inequality,

1400
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,250
the Gini Coefficient,
which is a measure of inequality and the

1401
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:10,030
ideological position of governments.
So here's the theory.

1402
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:11,890
The hypothesis would be,
well,

1403
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:14,320
because the left wingers are concerned 
with inequality,

1404
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:15,453
if you measured inequality in left wing 
under left wing governments and you 

1405
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:20,740
measured inequality under right wing 
governments,

1406
01:23:20,741 --> 01:23:23,950
you'd expect a reduction in inequality 
under left wing governments.

1407
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,900
And the results are
no difference.

1408
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,453
And so what does that mean?
It doesn't mean that left wings are 

1409
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:32,944
hypocrites,
although it might mean that because 

1410
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:35,530
people can be hypocrites.

1411
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:36,363
But what it means is the problem of 
inequality is so intractable that we 

1412
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:43,114
don't know of any appropriate
political sociological or economic 

1413
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:54,610
solutions that actually work.
It's a real catastrophe.

1414
01:23:55,150 --> 01:23:55,983
Now,
inequality in itself might not be a bad 

1415
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:02,050
thing unless it's too extreme.
It's extreme.

1416
01:24:02,051 --> 01:24:05,890
When people say start to starve and then
clearly somethings you know it's,

1417
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:10,920
it's very difficult to,
I think everyone would agree that that's

1418
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:12,550
a suboptimal outcome.
You know,

1419
01:24:12,551 --> 01:24:14,620
we don't need to get all the ideological
about that,

1420
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:16,383
but some degree of inequality is useful 
because well it gives people something 

1421
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:21,400
to strive for.
It gives them an op,

1422
01:24:21,490 --> 01:24:23,590
right?
It means,

1423
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:24,543
I was thinking about this sometimes you 
actually want people to be rich because 

1424
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,550
if a new product is introduced into the 
market,

1425
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:32,013
the people there have to be people 
around who have substantial pools of 

1426
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:35,284
capital to be able to afford it when 
it's still novel and then that market 

1427
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:41,260
brings the price down for everyone else.

1428
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,900
And so if everyone had exactly the same 
income,

1429
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:44,734
it would be very difficult to introduce 
expensive products into the market with 

1430
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:50,350
the hope that their price would plummet.
Not actually is a big deal.

1431
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:51,333
You want large pools of capital sitting 
around too so that people can invest in 

1432
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:56,590
very,
very complex things.

1433
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,753
And you also want large pools of capital
would be the hands have to be in the 

1434
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:03,940
hands of private individuals so that 
there's competitive,

1435
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:07,180
there's forces that are powerful,
that are competitive with the government

1436
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,600
and with other large organizations.
So anyways though back to the Marxists,

1437
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:19,890
despite the fact that there are reasons 
for inequality and despite the fact that

1438
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:21,034
you can't lay the fact of inequality at 
the feet of capitalism and despite the 

1439
01:25:24,731 --> 01:25:25,564
fact that capitalism also appears to be 
making everyone not absolutely poor at 

1440
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:34,840
the same time as it makes some people 
very rich,

1441
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:36,993
there's still inequality is still 
painful reality and no one really likes 

1442
01:25:40,751 --> 01:25:41,560
it.

1443
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:42,393
You know?
I mean you can lord it over someone I 

1444
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:44,644
suppose and and extract out some sense 
of your moral superiority because you 

1445
01:25:48,581 --> 01:25:53,380
happen to occupy a hierarchical position
that's higher and sometimes there's some

1446
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,330
validity in that,
especially if you've earned it.

1447
01:25:55,780 --> 01:26:00,780
Although I would say like glorying in it
is probably a suboptimal outcome.

1448
01:26:01,630 --> 01:26:06,110
It's still the case that that violates a
moral intuition that everyone has.

1449
01:26:06,111 --> 01:26:08,240
I think,
and that's probably the moral intuitions

1450
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:10,760
that lie along the agreeable access.
It's like,

1451
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,943
well,
wouldn't it be better if everyone had 

1452
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:14,450
enough?
It's like,

1453
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:15,770
well,
who argues with that?

1454
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,570
You know,
I mean everyone feels that way.

1455
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:19,700
And so I think,
um,

1456
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:24,940
a thoughtless,
a thoughtless compassion makes Marxism

1457
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,693
naively attractive.
And I'm not being cynical about that 

1458
01:26:33,481 --> 01:26:36,810
because there is some utility in naive 
agreeableness,

1459
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:38,573
but unfortunately the world is a very 
complicated place and merely wanting to 

1460
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:45,054
be nice about things and wishing that 
everything was fair doesn't justify 

1461
01:26:49,951 --> 01:26:53,610
imposing an equity outcome and 
Gerrymandering,

1462
01:26:53,611 --> 01:26:54,444
complex economic systems that will bite 
you if you mess with them because your 

1463
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:58,890
idiot logically possessed.

1464
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:13,780
I am 46 retired executive,
wealthy,

1465
01:27:13,781 --> 01:27:14,614
competent and full of juice.
Who could I talk to if I want to invest 

1466
01:27:17,381 --> 01:27:21,130
time slash money slash energy in your 
university

1467
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,180
people,
lots of people are,

1468
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:29,500
are asking me such things and it's very 
much appreciated.

1469
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:30,520
It's a weird,
you know,

1470
01:27:30,521 --> 01:27:31,354
because you'd think that if people are 
offering you time and money that it 

1471
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:36,580
would be a straight forward thing to 
say,

1472
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:38,920
yes,
please climb aboard and help.

1473
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:41,740
But it's not that simple because first 
of all,

1474
01:27:41,741 --> 01:27:42,574
I don't want to involve people in 
something that I can't be sufficiently 

1475
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,730
committed to.
It's not fair to them.

1476
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:50,523
Um,
and it isn't obvious to me how I can be 

1477
01:27:52,481 --> 01:27:54,460
committed to this yet fully committed to
it.

1478
01:27:54,461 --> 01:27:58,270
And so I'm sort of playing with it at 
the level that I can manage.

1479
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,113
It's not like it's a game.
We have a good product in involved or a 

1480
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:06,940
good product in,
in motion at the moment.

1481
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:11,530
But I'm not,
I don't have the wherewithal to scale at

1482
01:28:11,531 --> 01:28:15,610
the moment.
And you know,

1483
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:16,773
you can say,
and people who are developing new 

1484
01:28:18,521 --> 01:28:19,354
businesses like to do this.
Like let's say I could come up with a 

1485
01:28:21,731 --> 01:28:25,690
draft business plan for an online 
university and then I can contact people

1486
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:28,960
like you Paul and say,
look,

1487
01:28:28,961 --> 01:28:29,794
I'm ready to gather investments and 
let's say I could raise $20 million or 

1488
01:28:32,861 --> 01:28:36,220
let's say I could raise $200 million,
but then I have a new problem.

1489
01:28:36,970 --> 01:28:38,410
The problem is,
well all my God,

1490
01:28:38,411 --> 01:28:40,420
I've got all this money,
now I have to figure out something to do

1491
01:28:40,421 --> 01:28:41,254
with it.
And that's actually a really big 

1492
01:28:42,311 --> 01:28:44,740
responsibility.
Not Start like,

1493
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:46,660
you know,
it's a success catastrophe.

1494
01:28:46,661 --> 01:28:49,000
Let's say it's a first world problem.
I get all that,

1495
01:28:49,001 --> 01:28:51,550
but that doesn't mean that it isn't 
real.

1496
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,930
So I have to do a lot more thinking and 
planning

1497
01:28:57,820 --> 01:28:58,653
and figure out how to disperse my time 
most effectively before I dare to take 

1498
01:29:04,081 --> 01:29:06,750
on any additional people who would like 
to help.

1499
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:11,780
Now,
once my organization as it is in a place

1500
01:29:11,941 --> 01:29:16,260
where that sort of help would be useful,
then I'll make a public announcement and

1501
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:19,920
I would be more than happy for people to
jump on board.

1502
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,170
Let's say climb on board,
start pushing,

1503
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:24,360
devote resources,
all of those things.

1504
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:25,194
I'd be happy for that to happen then,
but I don't want to do it prematurely 

1505
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:31,440
because I don't want people to,

1506
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:38,300
to risk their valuable resources in an 
endeavor that isn't yet solid.

1507
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:41,580
So,
all right,

1508
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:44,730
so I'm only going to do,
I think one more question.

1509
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:46,933
Um,

1510
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:00,873
okay.

1511
01:30:01,120 --> 01:30:03,730
I am a sober alcoholic slash drug 
addict.

1512
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:04,564
How can I find my way back to belief in 
a higher power after 10 years in the 

1513
01:30:07,871 --> 01:30:10,510
empty void of atheism?
I'm falling apart.

1514
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,550
Well,
I would say your best bet is to actually

1515
01:30:21,551 --> 01:30:26,320
start devoting some,
some time to it.

1516
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:27,460
You know,
for me,

1517
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:31,660
I became convinced of the validity of a 
religious viewpoint.

1518
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:36,690
I think as a consequence of study
read,

1519
01:30:38,901 --> 01:30:42,950
Joseph Campbell read Carl Young Young's 
hard.

1520
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:46,970
Campbell's a good introduction though.
Richa Ellie Outta as well.

1521
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:52,060
I don't know if you can find your way 
back to belief,

1522
01:30:52,061 --> 01:30:52,894
but you might be able to find your way 
back to meaningful engagement and that 

1523
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:56,794
might,
that's a better way of thinking about 

1524
01:30:59,441 --> 01:31:00,460
it.
You know,

1525
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,890
the belief thing is a really tricky one.
People ask me,

1526
01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:05,290
do you believe in God?
And I think,

1527
01:31:05,890 --> 01:31:08,470
I really think,
how dare you ask that question.

1528
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:14,010
I think that's really what I think,
but on a more prosaic level,

1529
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:16,450
I usually think,
well,

1530
01:31:16,451 --> 01:31:20,560
I don't know what you mean by belief.
I don't know what you mean by belief and

1531
01:31:20,561 --> 01:31:24,610
I don't know what you mean by God.
These are very,

1532
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:28,000
these are very difficult questions and 
none of that self evident.

1533
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:29,560
Now I would say,

1534
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:33,680
do I believe in the crucifixion?
Well,

1535
01:31:33,681 --> 01:31:34,880
certainly,
I mean people,

1536
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:36,283
the crucifixion,
how can you not believe in it if you 

1537
01:31:38,571 --> 01:31:42,680
think symbolically,
it's like human beings are,

1538
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,470
we're eternally crucified,
right?

1539
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:49,010
Our lives are tragic and they end in 
death and were,

1540
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:51,860
were all betrayed.
We're all betrayed.

1541
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:54,830
We all experienced betrayal.

1542
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,070
So you can't not believe the 
crucifixion.

1543
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:02,740
Do you believe in the resurrection?
Well,

1544
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:07,030
people die and are reborn all the time.
You know,

1545
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:07,960
they,
they go through,

1546
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:08,823
this is what you're after here.
I'm a sober drug and alcohol drug 

1547
01:32:11,351 --> 01:32:11,861
addict.
Well,

1548
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:12,694
you know,
you,

1549
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,713
you had to let a lot of you die when you
stop being an addict and something new 

1550
01:32:16,331 --> 01:32:17,164
be reborn.
It's like what's the ultimate 

1551
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:22,780
significance of that and how is it tied 
to the notion of bodily resurrection?

1552
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:23,643
Well,
I don't know what the ultimate 

1553
01:32:24,701 --> 01:32:25,534
significance is,
but it does seem to be the pathway 

1554
01:32:27,311 --> 01:32:32,311
through life
to believe.

1555
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:40,720
I would say you start believing not by 
attempting to

1556
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:47,340
convince yourself that the statement 
there is a god is true,

1557
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,353
like a fact is true,
but to act out the proposition that you 

1558
01:32:53,951 --> 01:32:58,480
should shoulder your cross and stumble 
uphill towards the city of God.

1559
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,280
That's belief,
man.

1560
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,373
Yeah,

1561
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:03,430
and you can do that.

1562
01:33:04,460 --> 01:33:05,250
Yeah,

1563
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:06,083
right away.

1564
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,300
Okay.

1565
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:09,710
Now you might ask,
well,

1566
01:33:09,711 --> 01:33:14,711
do I have any guarantee that that has 
transcendent and universal significance?

1567
01:33:14,931 --> 01:33:16,520
It's like,
well,

1568
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:21,200
it's not a bad model for emulation,
so it has universal significance in that

1569
01:33:21,201 --> 01:33:22,034
regard.
We each have to shoulder the tragedy of 

1570
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:27,414
our existence and stumble upwards.
Despite that that has universal 

1571
01:33:32,061 --> 01:33:32,894
significance.
Does it have significance outside of 

1572
01:33:34,611 --> 01:33:37,760
life and like get the internal eternal 
realm?

1573
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:46,670
I wouldn't surprise me if it did.
I suppose it depends on what you mean by

1574
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:48,210
the eternal realm.
The

1575
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:52,870
seems to have significance in the 
eternal realm of consciousness.

1576
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:58,150
It seems to have significance in the 
eternal realm of unconscious fantasy,

1577
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,043
implicit fantasy and mythology.
How is it connected with the factual 

1578
01:34:05,841 --> 01:34:06,674
world?

1579
01:34:09,460 --> 01:34:10,293
Yeah,

1580
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,173
that's a hard question because the 
factual world in some sense divorced 

1581
01:34:14,391 --> 01:34:19,160
itself from that transcendental world 
during the development of the scientific

1582
01:34:19,161 --> 01:34:23,900
methodology,
so never the twain shall meet.

1583
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:29,080
It's a methodological issue in part
I think you probably have to draw on the

1584
01:34:34,851 --> 01:34:38,780
same forces that enabled you to sober up
and abandoned your drug addiction.

1585
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:42,410
No,
something was guiding you forward.

1586
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:43,393
Go forward again,
go forward again as if there there is a 

1587
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:49,250
higher power.
That's your manifestation of faith.

1588
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:54,920
Go forward again as if being is 
benevolent and God is good.

1589
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:01,260
That's the hallmark of courage
and that's good place to stop.

1590
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:05,770
Thank you all for showing up today and,
uh,

1591
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:12,510
and for all the support and,
and that's enough for March,

1592
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:20,040
March 4th,
2018 bye bye.

1593
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:27,163
Okay.
