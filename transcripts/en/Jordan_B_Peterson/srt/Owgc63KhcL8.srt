1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,980
Today,
we're going to talk a little bit about,

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,060
I guess you could call them the
underlying structures of perception.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,840
I picked this image.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,460
It's a very old image.
It's,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,500
it's an,
it's an image that that portrays.

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,520
Man,
I'm being cast up on the beach by whale.

7
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:34,521
It's Jonah Biblical figure and in this
is the story of Jonah.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
Jonah was owed on a rough ocean storm
and he had been commanded by God to do

9
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:46,011
something which he was ignoring and uh,
the storm was sufficiently rough so that

10
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,890
he got cast overboard.
It was eaten by this giant.

11
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,520
This is a whale as far as the medieval
medieval people were concerned.

12
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:56,280
It's obviously not what we would think
of as a whale,

13
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:59,130
but they didn't know much about whales
anyways.

14
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:04,131
He was swallowed up by a whale and then
cast back up on shore a number of days

15
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,870
later.
It's a death and rebirth story.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,810
And the reason I use it as an image is
because

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,870
it represents something of psychological
import that you're all familiar with,

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,020
but that you might not know that you're
familiar with.

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,880
Symbols are often like that.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,550
Assemble often stands for something that
you know,

21
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,300
but that you don't know that you know,
there's lots of things that you know

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,200
that you don't know that you know,
almost everything is like that.

23
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:36,330
In fact.
And it's rather obvious if you think

24
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,950
about it because if you are transparent
to yourself and you knew everything,

25
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,930
you knew,
you wouldn't have to study anything

26
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,570
about psychology because you'd
understand that yourself completely.

27
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:51,190
And we understand ourselves poorly.
And so we have to study ourselves as

28
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:53,310
individuals and then,
you know,

29
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:53,971
as,
as,

30
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,690
as phenomena in the world as,
as other people and that edit and

31
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,680
there's mammals in this animals and as
living things and as political actors

32
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,770
and so on,
just to get some minor notion of what's

33
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,920
actually going on.
And what that means in part is that

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,920
you're more complicated than you can
understand.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,120
And when you hear,
say psychoanalytic thinkers talking

36
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:19,200
about ideas like the unconscious,
the unconscious is actually a

37
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,770
representation in some ways of the fact
that there's far more to you than you

38
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,604
know about.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,970
And that what that means also is that
there are different kinds of

40
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:29,370
unconscious.
And we certainly know that to be the

41
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,900
case.
There are different kinds of memory,

42
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,560
for example.
So a lot of your procedural knowledge is

43
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,170
unconscious.
And so your procedural knowledge is what

44
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,740
allows you to do things like ride a bike
or walk for that matter,

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,510
because you don't really know how you
walk.

46
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:44,310
You haven't,
it's actually a controlled fall.

47
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:48,450
So you lean forward and then you use
your legs to stop you from falling on

48
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,670
the ground.
It's,

49
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,660
it's,
it's,

50
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,580
it's encoded in your architecture rather
than something and it's apprehensible to

51
00:02:56,581 --> 00:03:00,310
your conscious understanding.
Now there are lots of,

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,540
there are lots of phenomena that are
procedural in the unconscious.

53
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,110
And then there was sort of borderline
phenomena that you have some idea about

54
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,330
that you can represent,
but you still don't completely

55
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:11,164
understand.

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,240
So what sorts of representations tend to
be more into just stick?

57
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,240
And those are the sorts of things maybe
that pop up in your fantasies and your

58
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,010
dreams.
And those are also this sorts of

59
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:24,820
unconscious sources of knowledge that
allow you to understand,

60
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,030
say,
complex work works of literature or art

61
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,730
that draw their meaning from multiple
sources,

62
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:35,380
simultaneous seely and attempt to inform
you on a deep level about how things are

63
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:40,360
connected and how they're different.
Now this particular image is a journey

64
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:42,070
to the underworld image,
and that's a very,

65
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,140
very old idea.
Journey to the underworld.

66
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,310
It's maybe the oldest myth.
It's one of the oldest mythological

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,530
ideas or one of the oldest archetipal
ideas.

68
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,720
And the underworld is,
it's a difficult,

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,960
it's a difficult phenomenon to grasp,
although you can certainly encountered

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,380
the concept,
particularly in movies.

71
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:04,210
So for most of you know,
how many of you have seen all the Harry

72
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,040
Potter movies,
right?

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,821
So,
right,

74
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,620
of course.
And so in the second movie,

75
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,160
I believe it's the second movie where
pottery counters of basilisk underneath

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,440
hogwarts,
is that right?

77
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,910
The second one?
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:17,890
Well,
that story is a journey to the

79
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:22,891
underworld story and the architectural
setup of the kind of the of the movie.

80
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,000
By architectural setup.
I mean the relationship of Hogwarts,

81
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:32,830
the castle to the underground structures
is a symbolic representation of the

82
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:36,130
representation of consciousness embedded
in culture.

83
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:39,880
And so that would be partnered as
friends and bedded in the realm of

84
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:41,410
magical knowledge,
so to speak.

85
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,570
It's outside of them.
And that's,

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,470
that's represented by the castle,
you know,

87
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:47,304
uh,
uh,

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,040
uh,
it's a representation of knowledge cast

89
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,380
in stone.
So that's a form of memory to cast

90
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:56,350
something in stone.
And so potter and his friends are being

91
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:00,330
enculturated in this enclosed
environment in the safe enclosed

92
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,950
environments like a university,
like the university,

93
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:05,710
more on the other side of the campus
then on this side for,

94
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,910
for various reasons.

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,020
Now underneath the,
the well in the background,

96
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:12,160
of course,
in the Potter series,

97
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,960
there's a battle between good and evil
going on.

98
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,960
And that's also an extremely old
architectural idea.

99
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,720
And that's an idea that's probably as
old as human beings.

100
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,130
And that's partly because human beings
are very strange creatures and they're

101
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:25,840
capable of very,
uh,

102
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,240
what would you call profound acts of
deception.

103
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,230
And one of the things that separates
human beings from most other animals is

104
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,800
our capacity to use deception and it's
associated with our imaginativeness,

105
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,830
right?
Because we can imagine a variety of

106
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:41,860
alternative potential realities and move
towards them.

107
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,310
That opens the door for us to deceive
ourselves and others because we can

108
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:50,311
replace our accurate vision of the world
in so far as it's accurate with whatever

109
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,840
vision and representation we wish to
choose.

110
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,240
One of the things you find in childhood
development,

111
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,500
for example,
is that the smarter child,

112
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,310
the earlier they learn to lie and it's
an offshoot of the ability to use

113
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:06,010
fantasy,
and so the idea of good versus evil part

114
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,320
comes out of that to some degree because
if you're dealing with people,

115
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,440
you're always dealing with phenomena
that can trick you in some way.

116
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,170
They can represent reality as other than
it is,

117
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,190
and that that's a tremendous problem for
human beings because it makes other

118
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,410
people extremely difficult to figure
out.

119
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,100
Now,
if you're honest and straight forward,

120
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,530
then you're easy to figure out because
you don't have to be figured out.

121
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,330
I can just take you at your word,
which means you'll tell me something and

122
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,120
it'll be relatively straight forward.
I'll be able to understand it and then

123
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,770
you'll go do it.
No problem.

124
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,770
I don't have to know anything about you.
On the other hand,

125
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:43,070
if you don't do things according to what
you say you'll do,

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,070
then Europe,
bottomless pit of incomprehensibility

127
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,050
and God only knows what you're going to
be up to.

128
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,680
And so that,
that's an architectural problem for

129
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,380
human beings.
And that's the problem of having to deal

130
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,410
with the late deceptive capacity of
other people.

131
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,620
And of course the for ourselves.
So that's all going on in the background

132
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,450
and the Potter series.
But underneath the castle,

133
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,860
for example,
there is,

134
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,840
remember what's under the castle in the
second,

135
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,760
in the second film,
what is it?

136
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,250
It's a,
it's a vassilis,

137
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,061
right?
Yeah.

138
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,960
And what happens when you look at a
LISC,

139
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,440
right?
And so what,

140
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:20,030
what might that mean if you're thinking
about it intelligently,

141
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,730
say w what?
What phenomena might that,

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,210
that represent?
What happens to prey animals when they

143
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,390
encounter of creditor,
they freeze.

144
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,201
Exactly.
Yeah.

145
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,530
So it's a representation of the fact
that there are certain classes of

146
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:37,910
phenomena that will freeze you on site
and you freeze because there are parts

147
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,440
of your brain that respond to phenomena
in the external world as if you are

148
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,270
praying.
And the reason for that is,

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,550
well per first you are,
and second from an evolutionary

150
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,840
perspective,
you're your ancestry going back say tens

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,610
of millions of years is an ancestry that
was composed of predessessors that we're

152
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,990
continually preyed upon.

153
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,380
And we have entire systems in our brain
that react to the class of potentially

154
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,610
predatory events.
Now for human beings,

155
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:15,260
that system has differentiated
cognitively so that many of the things

156
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,640
that we would experience as predatory
threats in the modern world don't come

157
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:23,800
in the shape of say crocodiles and and
bears and you know,

158
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,460
giant cats and so forth.
The sorts of things that would

159
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,110
necessarily pray on you in the night.
But there are analogous in that

160
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,150
the outcome is the same.
You can be preyed upon by many things

161
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,940
you can be preyed upon by,
you know,

162
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,610
a corrupt corporation.
And so it's perfectly reasonable to

163
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:45,611
symbolize the actions of a corrupt
corporation as a form of predation.

164
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,260
And also to categorize that even more
deeply as a reflection of the underlying

165
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:53,990
consequences of the fact that people can
deceive each other.

166
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,660
Those sorts of get deep very,
very rapidly.

167
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,460
But there they're active and living
representations in the,

168
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,530
they still represent something that's
profoundly true,

169
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,460
which is not so much what things are in
enough of themselves,

170
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,910
which is what science does,
but what things are in relationship to

171
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:14,970
you,
which is more like what things mean and

172
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,030
things generally have a motivational or
emotional meaning.

173
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,800
And that meaning is generally quite
tightly tied to the necessity that you

174
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,380
have to survive and to thrive and to,
you know,

175
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:28,650
to find someone to be with and to
reproduce in all the Darwinian things

176
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,860
that you're supposed to be up to.
So a lot of these more archaic

177
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,310
categories,
are there meaningful categories,

178
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,440
their categories of meeting that's,
that's an,

179
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,420
that's a perfectly reasonable way of
looking at it,

180
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,960
knowing the partner situation,
which is related to this image.

181
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,450
The one that's up here.
The idea is that everything that's

182
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:51,720
stable
rests on something that's unstable and

183
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,554
dangerous.

184
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,320
And that's underneath in the potter
series.

185
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,470
And then the other thing that happens
continually in the series,

186
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:03,330
but particularly in the second episode,
particularly in the second episode,

187
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:08,331
is that partner has to go down the neat
things to encounter something that's

188
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,310
terrifying and deadly.
That's,

189
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,680
that's actually preying on his friends
and on the community.

190
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,780
So it's a,
it's very much like,

191
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,770
for example,
the hobbit having to go off and,

192
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,950
and,
and,

193
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,520
uh,
steel treasure from,

194
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,950
from smog.
I think the dragon's name is,

195
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,490
and except that in the,
in the potter sequence,

196
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,680
the Dragon,
which is the basilisk,

197
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,960
they're equivalent.
It's the same thing as this,

198
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,900
um,
in the,

199
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,210
in the hall,
but the Dragon Court's goal.

200
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,390
Whereas in the potter representation,
what does the basilisk guard,

201
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,380
what's it,
what has it captured?

202
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,740
It's the little redheaded girl,
right,

203
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,041
Jimmy?
Right.

204
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:52,260
And that's a very,
that's a very old story.

205
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,120
Now,
no partners kind of in love with her

206
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,710
right now.
I mean,

207
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,110
they're young and sort of platonic,
but you know,

208
00:10:58,111 --> 00:11:00,270
you can see the relationship sort of
burgeoning.

209
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:03,330
And now he has to confront this thing
that's terrifying,

210
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:08,070
that exists underneath everything in
order to free this original finger from

211
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,530
the clutches of something terrible in
Reptilian.

212
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,410
Now that's a very,
very interesting story.

213
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:17,040
That and what it means,
a whole variety of things.

214
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,140
And what it means to some degree is
that,

215
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,620
uh,
a male human being can't really become

216
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:27,220
mature until he confronts the terrible
things that lie underneath the civilized

217
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,730
veneer of society.
That's one thing that means,

218
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,830
uh,
another thing it means is that

219
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:37,440
it's the capacity.
It's the capacity of the male in that

220
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:41,190
situation to do that,
that makes him attractive enough to wake

221
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:43,770
up to females that he might be
associated with.

222
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,410
So that's like a sleeping beauty motif.
Um,

223
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,160
it has evolutionary echoes because much
of what we've battled with for the last

224
00:11:53,891 --> 00:11:56,710
60 million years say,
because I think you can trace the

225
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,040
development of our cognitive structures
quite straightforwardly,

226
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,590
back 60 billion years,
there's been an endless battle between

227
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:05,170
human beings and predators,
and many of those predators were

228
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,090
reptilian.
And so,

229
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,980
you know,
we're the result of a very,

230
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:12,130
very long battle between mammals and
reptiles.

231
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:17,131
And in our case particularly,
it appears that part of the reason we

232
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,680
evolved our tool using the past to get
aren't great capacity for vision was

233
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:24,970
because our ancestors were continually
preyed upon by predatory snakes when

234
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,890
they lived in trees.
And that's a long time ago.

235
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,160
And so he's,
he's symbolic representations are

236
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:34,660
unbelievably archaic and they're kind of
as archaic as the underlying biological

237
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:38,740
systems in your brain that,
that provide you with motivation and

238
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:39,220
emotion.

239
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,460
And those are extremely old.
You share those with while you share

240
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,870
those with any animal that you have any
hope whatsoever of understanding at all.

241
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,600
And that even means lizards.
You know,

242
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,730
my daughter had these lizards that were
called,

243
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,030
I can't remember,
unfortunately,

244
00:12:55,031 --> 00:12:57,910
there in the desert kind of lizard and
they make a good initial pet,

245
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,950
but they're,
they're very funny little creatures

246
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,210
cause they,
you know,

247
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,630
they're very lizard light being that
they're lizards and they have points a

248
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:07,990
little bit.
And if you put them in water,

249
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:09,850
they puff themselves up,
which is quite fun.

250
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:12,340
And then they zoom around in the water.
But more importantly,

251
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,530
they like to stack on top of each other.
They're very,

252
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:17,680
very social and they're friendly,
which is not exactly something that

253
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:19,090
you'd expect from a lizard.
But,

254
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,940
but my,
my point is that even something that's

255
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,830
distant as that from you and the
evolutionary hierarchy shares enough

256
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,180
commonality of biological structure with
you so that you can understand a fair

257
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,350
bit of it's motivation.

258
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,700
So for sample it's pretty easy to tell
when one of those lizards,

259
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,930
even though they're basically friendly,
it's angry cause it'll puff up his and

260
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:43,990
you know right away you don't have to
have a discussion with the rest of your

261
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,970
family to figure out that that's an
angry lizard.

262
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,220
Right.
And see it maps onto your body

263
00:13:48,221 --> 00:13:49,930
immediately.
And you know,

264
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,870
the same thing applies to snakes even
applies to insects.

265
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,440
Lots of insects have developed the kind
of warning behavior that will

266
00:13:56,441 --> 00:14:01,441
immediately signal to you that you're
about to be bitten or it's usually been

267
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:02,494
with insects.

268
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,160
So,
so this is all to say that there are

269
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:12,310
levels of understanding that are
underneath say your,

270
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,170
your,
your normative,

271
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,730
mundane,
day to day comprehension that informed

272
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,150
everything that you do with deep levels
of meaning.

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,170
And a lot of the activities that you
pursue that you might regard as

274
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:29,380
entertaining,
actually draw on those representations

275
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:32,620
and you find them entertaining because
they're actually deeply meaningful.

276
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,020
Now the idea that a man can be swallowed
or human being because there are myths

277
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:41,290
like [inaudible] where the protagonist
is clearly female,

278
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,640
where they the,
there's an underground journey and then

279
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,290
a reemergence.
And,

280
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,030
and that's the journey to the
underworld.

281
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,740
That's the journey that Terry partner
undertakes continually,

282
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,390
by the way,
throughout the far series,

283
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:56,360
the underworld,
taking different forms,

284
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,800
um,
as the,

285
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,680
as the series progressed,
um,

286
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,500
now that's also with death and rebirth
idea.

287
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,720
And,
and that's,

288
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,150
that's a very old and profound idea and
I think it's actually one of the most

289
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,950
profound ideas that human beings have.

290
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,950
And it's the idea that
you will spend time in your life

291
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,930
underground.
Now you might think,

292
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:18,860
well,
what does that mean?

293
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Well,
it means what the potter movie,

294
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,110
the second part of movie,
it was trying to represent it,

295
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:27,110
which is that there will be times in
your mind where you are faced with

296
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:29,420
things that will terrify you into
paralysis.

297
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,320
And that will take you underneath your
normal set of assumptions.

298
00:15:33,321 --> 00:15:36,320
Because when your normal set of
assumptions are functioning,

299
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,370
you don't end up facing something that's
terrifying enough to,

300
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,050
to freeze you.
When your normal set of assumptions that

301
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:45,260
are working,
the world stays happily predictable

302
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,230
around you.
And most of the time that's where you

303
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:50,690
are.
And that's the normal world that's blown

304
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:52,640
apart.
Whenever something that you're

305
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:56,840
attempting to do fails in a dramatic or
less dramatic way,

306
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,310
the more dramatic the way,
the deeper you go into the underworld

307
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:05,540
and the underworld is in some sense the
substructures of your preset positions.

308
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,290
Now you,
you know this already because I don't

309
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:12,260
suppose there's a single person in
realize and spent some time in the

310
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:13,280
underworld,
so to speak,

311
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:16,970
because this is what happens when
something terrible happens to you.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,170
Unpredictable,
a terrible.

313
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:21,260
And you know,
there's sort of classic categories of

314
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:23,460
events that send you to the underworld,
you know,

315
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,520
um,
the death of someone you love,

316
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,360
a serious illness of some sort,
either for you or for someone you love.

317
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,450
Um,
the death of a dream of some sort,

318
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,280
you know,
so you've got some goals that you think

319
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,610
is really important and all of a sudden
you find out for one reason or another

320
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:39,860
that there's just no way you're going to
be able to pursue it.

321
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,190
A betrayal that's a really good one.
People,

322
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,070
that's a really rough one.
And that'll send you for,

323
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,880
that'll throw you for a loop for sure.

324
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,380
So they're all,
they're all elements of the part of the

325
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:55,460
world that you can't control.
That in some sense always remains beyond

326
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,460
your control.
That has in some sense a predatory

327
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:01,220
relationship too,
because it could devour you at least

328
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:04,460
metaphysically.
And when that happens,

329
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:07,250
you go somewhere and the place that you
go is very dangerous.

330
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,740
It's underneath everything.
And maybe you come back out and if you

331
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:11,990
come back out,
what that means is that you've

332
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:16,310
reconstructed your erroneous
presupposition so that you can function

333
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:17,960
once again in the world.
And,

334
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,910
but maybe you don't.
Maybe you don't.

335
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,830
So people who have post traumatic stress
disorder,

336
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,930
for example,
they go into the underworld and just

337
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,490
stay there.
And you know,

338
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,490
and if you're,
if you're chronically depressed or if he

339
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:30,050
can't get over your grief,
or if you're in a state of continual

340
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:33,470
anxiety and upset or if you're
nihilistic for that matter,

341
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:38,740
you exist essentially in an underworld
domain because you can't master the

342
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:43,850
perceptual apparatus that culturally
informed perceptual apparatus that would

343
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:48,320
help you orient yourself in the world so
that the things that you want to have

344
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:51,150
happen and that you need to have happen
actually happened.

345
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
So that's what that picture means.

346
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,310
It also means,
at least in principle,

347
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:03,311
that you know people have the capacity
to die and be reborn at different levels

348
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,670
of analysis.
So you know,

349
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,060
there are minor disappointments that you
encounter when you have to drop some

350
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,610
precept position that you have and let
it die and then put a new one in its

351
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:16,430
place and that's painful,
but it's nowhere near as painful.

352
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:19,760
It's holding onto the things when they
don't work because then you just end up

353
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:24,470
wandering around just sort of clouded
collection of dad presuppositions and

354
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,000
nothing that you ever want will happen
under that circumstance because you're,

355
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,460
you're,
you're armed with tools that don't fit

356
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:34,010
the world and you know,
when you tried to apply them,

357
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,910
the world won't do what you want them to
do and then that's endlessly anxiety

358
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:41,030
provoking and frustrating.
So part of

359
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,790
pain is as part of the price that you
paid in some ways for being updatable

360
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,850
no,
because the world transforms around you

361
00:18:49,851 --> 00:18:52,580
and as a consequence you have to be able
to transform with it.

362
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,360
Otherwise it runs ahead of you and you
get left behind that,

363
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,380
you know,
that happens to people to some degree.

364
00:18:57,381 --> 00:18:58,550
Anyway,
it says the age,

365
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,150
that's actually one of the evolutionary
explanations for why people got,

366
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,210
cause it's a mystery right there.
There were elements of you,

367
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,100
they're rewarding.
You don't want to just sounds that

368
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,551
give,
give,

369
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:12,740
rise to you.
What are immortal there?

370
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,620
You know,
the DNA that produced,

371
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:17,090
he was at least three and a half billion
years old.

372
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,820
It might be older than that.
So structures getting entertained

373
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,390
themselves over unbelievably vast
expanses of time.

374
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,930
So it's not self evident why human
beings have to die like we do and we die

375
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:32,420
at about after you're done being a
grandparent is kind of when you're,

376
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,350
when you're done.
And the hypothesis is is that at that

377
00:19:36,351 --> 00:19:38,990
point,
in some sense it's too costly to keep

378
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:42,170
you updated and you have to be replaced
by a younger version of twitter.

379
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:44,570
Of course,
eat your grandchildren or whatever.

380
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,220
You know,
when you've sort of exhausted your

381
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:50,300
plasticity and flexibility,
the job that it's cheaper just to

382
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:53,120
replace you then to update.
So

383
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,900
that's kind of a drag.
But yeah.

384
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,213
Nope.

385
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,090
All right.
So here's the funny question for you.

386
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,680
This is the question that scientists are
always devoted towards answering.

387
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:28,050
What's the world made up?
Well,

388
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,380
that's a complicated question.
I mean,

389
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,660
the simple answer is that it's made out
of matter

390
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,520
and that matter is made out of this.
And that theory was the room originally

391
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:45,120
formulated by Democritus Kabaka.
This didn't exactly say that the world

392
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,800
was made up us.
You said the world was of atoms.

393
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,780
And space and that actually happens to
matter because the way that atoms are

394
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:56,710
arranged in space gives rise to another
property which has information.

395
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,630
And so if you haven't Adams in space,
you also have information and you can

396
00:21:01,631 --> 00:21:04,420
think of the world is being made of
information just as easily as you can

397
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,030
think of it as being made of matter.
In fact,

398
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:09,630
I think that,
and you know I'm not alone in this cycle

399
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:14,050
emphasis that it's actually more useful
to conceive of the ground of reality as

400
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:17,260
being something like information rather
than being something like matter.

401
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,130
But we don't have to discuss that at
lake at the moment.

402
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,590
What we'll say instead is that one,
one way of looking at the world is the

403
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,950
materialistic perspective and the
materialistic perspective is a very

404
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:34,300
powerful perspective and it's basically
the dominant for about since the time of

405
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:35,660
gale Galileo,
that's,

406
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,250
that's about when that prospective got
thoroughly going.

407
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,470
And for many reasons,
bacon,

408
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,830
descartes as well were major players in
the establishment of the materialistic

409
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:48,520
framework.
And it came about because in many ways,

410
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:52,150
because people were suffering from their
inability to understand objective

411
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:53,020
reality.
So,

412
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,680
you know,
we still suffer from that because there

413
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:59,260
are all sorts of diseases we don't know
what to do with and we age and you know,

414
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,570
things don't work out exactly like
they're supposed to.

415
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,430
And so we pay a big price for our
ignorance.

416
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,430
And so we're motivated to overcome it.

417
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:10,370
And one way we have overcome it was by
developing materialistic philosophy and

418
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:15,100
not materialistic philosophy enabled us
to specify the structure of certain

419
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:18,130
elements of the world and then to learn
to predict and control it at least to

420
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:19,600
some degree.
Now you know,

421
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,040
you learn to predict and control
something and sometimes you generate

422
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,500
more monsters doing that.
So that's problematic.

423
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:29,530
But all things considered,
I think it's a lot better to live now

424
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,540
that until live three or 400 years ago.
So or maybe even 30 years ago for that

425
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:37,750
matter.
So it looks like the whole materialistic

426
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:42,040
thing is be doing a lot of good for us.
But there it also has some serious

427
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:46,840
problems and the problems have to do
with another fundamental problem that

428
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:51,430
human beings have to solve,
which is what you should do about what

429
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
is.
And because human beings are dynamic and

430
00:22:55,361 --> 00:22:56,350
active creatures.

431
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,200
And so we do not only,
we're not mere machines of

432
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:02,200
representation,
we don't just care what the world is.

433
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,600
We care what you should do with the
world.

434
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,060
And the reason we care for that,
well,

435
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,640
the fundamental reason if you're
thinking about it from a scientific

436
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,410
perspective,
is essentially Darwinian.

437
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,450
And I think that you can,
you can imagine the conflict between the

438
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:21,451
moral worldview and the materialistic
worldview as a battle in some sense

439
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:25,960
between Newton and Darwin.
So Newton was the,

440
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,020
was the author,
the fundamental author of the idea that

441
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:32,800
the world was made out of material and
men and operated like a machine,

442
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,470
you know,
which was a pretty powerful perspective.

443
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,130
That perspective came about during the
time of clocks.

444
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,990
And when Europeans in particular,
we're starting to build things that

445
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,510
would function in a very predictable
manner once they were set in motion.

446
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,540
So Newton in some sense was influenced
by that at an assumed that the entire

447
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,630
cosmos could be understood as a
deterministic machine.

448
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,170
Um,
and the,

449
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,800
that it would be ultimately predictable
and controllable.

450
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,920
And in a famous statement,
and I don't think this was new,

451
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,710
and although I can't remember,
it might've been descartes

452
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,490
anyways.
The idea is that if you knew the

453
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:15,491
position of every subatomic or Vr,
every odd atomic particle in existence,

454
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,200
if you knew the position and the
momentum of those particles,

455
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,750
that you could then predict the entire
outcome of the future.

456
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,200
It was strictly deterministic.
And the only thing that stopped you from

457
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,400
being able to describe everything in
terms of machinery was your ignorance.

458
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,650
It was,
there was nothing at the bottom of the

459
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:31,700
cosmos,
so to speak,

460
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:33,920
that was fundamentally unknowable.
Well,

461
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:37,280
that turned out to be wrong.
It wasn't really discovered to be wrong

462
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:38,120
until,
you know,

463
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,250
the first couple of decades of the 20th
century.

464
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,810
But it definitely turned out to be
wrong.

465
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:46,490
We now know that in under no conceivable
conditions could we gather enough

466
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:51,050
information to predict the outcome of
what appears to be a relatively

467
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:54,350
unpredictable costco's.
There are levels of resolution that

468
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:56,870
remained relatively constant and that
you can manipulate.

469
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,140
But our hope for total knowledgist is
gone.

470
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,890
And that was mostly your consequence of
the development of quantum mechanics.

471
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:07,620
And the quantum theories have never
failed an experimental tests.

472
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:10,250
They're the most powerful theories that
human beings have ever designed.

473
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:13,520
So in some ways they seem,
well they're probably not final,

474
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,140
but they're,
they're pretty final,

475
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,513
so,

476
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,590
okay.

477
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,580
Nope.
Okay,

478
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:21,400
so,
so that's sort of the materialist stand

479
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,810
if things now,
now there's a Darwinian and the face.

480
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,310
And the reason I'm telling you about
both of these things is because part of

481
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:31,490
what we need to solve in order to
progress properly with this course,

482
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,870
we need to solve the problem of exactly
what constitutes truth.

483
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,270
Now,
the first thing that I might say is that

484
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,750
truth in some ways,
whether or not something is true is a

485
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:46,310
question that's sort of like whether or
not a tool that you have does the job

486
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,880
that it has.
It's not so much a question about the

487
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,930
ultimate nature of reality because you
can't get a truth that completely

488
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,330
informs you about the ultimate teacher
in reality.

489
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,490
So you're sort of stuck with partial
truths.

490
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,930
And so then you might ask,
well,

491
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:04,931
how do you tell a useful partial truth
from a non useful partial truth or maybe

492
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,460
a partial truth from a lie or from
fiction?

493
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:11,330
It's a very complicated to do that,
but one way you can progress towards

494
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:15,080
that is to start thinking about things
in terms of their tool like

495
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,250
capability.
And that's a pragmatic approach.

496
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:21,170
By the way,
from Intel esophageal perspective,

497
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:24,160
the pragmatists who were very influenced
by Charles dark,

498
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,900
by the way,
came to the conclusion at the beginning

499
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:31,901
of the 20th century.
That truth was bounded by claims of

500
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:35,420
practicality.
So if you're trying to determine whether

501
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:39,440
a statement is true,
the implicit question that goes along

502
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:43,320
with that is true in relationship to
what end.

503
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,290
So,
and the question then is sort of like,

504
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,100
is your tool that you're using to
represent the world or to act on it good

505
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,410
enough to do what you're trying to do
with it?

506
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,830
And then if it's good enough,
then you're playing just true enough.

507
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:01,010
Now this is tightly tied to Darwinian
philosophy and the pragmatists recognize

508
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:03,700
this right away.
The private just for American group,

509
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:06,090
as philosophers who worked on the east
coast,

510
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,010
particularly in Boston,
and they were,

511
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,000
they immediately took Darwinian
Darwinian hypothesis to their,

512
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,650
to their,
to their heart,

513
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:14,250
so to speak.

514
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:17,310
Because the Darwinian hypothesis is also
pragmatic.

515
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,080
That Darwinian hypothesis says whatever
reality is,

516
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,130
is and also becomes.
So it's something,

517
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:29,490
but it's something that's changing too.
And it changes in a way that's actually

518
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,890
not predictable.
It's technically,

519
00:27:31,891 --> 00:27:34,740
it's not predictable.
It's like the stock market in that way.

520
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,040
There are periods of time over which you
can make predictions,

521
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,160
but if you wait long enough,
no matter what you think you're going to

522
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:43,500
end up wrong.
Especially given what knowledge is for a

523
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:46,170
human being because your knowledge is
bounded that you know.

524
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,680
And so the way the Darwinian process
souls,

525
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:54,681
that is by death essentially things that
aren't good enough to solve the problem

526
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:59,130
that currently presents the presents
itself to them either die or failed to

527
00:27:59,131 --> 00:28:04,131
reproduce and to the degree that
organisms can come up with truth claims

528
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,120
that are sufficient than they live long
enough to reproduce and then the next

529
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:13,350
generation faces the same problem and
that's always the way it is is that

530
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,490
truth chases a reality that's
fundamentally unpredictable and it's

531
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,660
transforming constantly.

532
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,190
Now,
the reason,

533
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:23,730
the reason I want to tell you that he
said the important thing to understand

534
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:28,620
because I'm going to make a claim here,
is that the ways of looking at the world

535
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:32,850
that are more mythological than material
are also real ways of looking at the

536
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:35,820
world.
And it's not what people generally think

537
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,930
because you think about fiction,
it's not real.

538
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,520
Underneath fiction isn't mythology and
religious claims and that sort of thing.

539
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:45,090
That's the domain of fiction in
pathology and we don't think about that

540
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:48,000
as real,
but that's because we think about what's

541
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:51,510
real from a Newtonian perspective and
not from a Darwinian perspective,

542
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,920
from a Darwinian perspective,
this is also a claim that nature may,

543
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:01,030
you said truth serves the life.
Like what Darwin would say is you can't

544
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,430
define truth in any other way than that
which serves life.

545
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,070
That's it.
You're not going to get past that.

546
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:13,020
There isn't a truth past that.
The truth as far as a bounded living

547
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:15,510
organism is concerned and that certainly
needs us,

548
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,780
is the body of knowledge,
conceptual and embodied that best

549
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:25,260
enables survival in the face of
continual transformation.

550
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,900
And that's that.
There's nothing under it.

551
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,300
Now,
as soon as you know that,

552
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:34,650
then what happens is that it turns out
that the things that mean things to you

553
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,050
are also real.
Now,

554
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,060
science is a funny business,
right?

555
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:42,050
Because what science attempted to do and
for good and for

556
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,160
very useful reasons was to strip
everything subjective and subjectively

557
00:29:47,681 --> 00:29:50,160
meaningful off the picture of the world,
right?

558
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,420
So if you're a scientist,
you want to be objective.

559
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,630
And part of the way you do that is by
turning to suppress your own

560
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:58,540
subjectivity in the search for the
objective truth.

561
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,920
But also you do that by relying on other
people's observations.

562
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:05,530
So we kind of make a deal.
And the deal is if I see it and can

563
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:08,290
describe it and you see it and can
describe it,

564
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,350
and then a bunch of other people do the
same thing and we come to the same

565
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,780
conclusion,
we're going to treat that as real.

566
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,480
And that's useful.
It's useful because it,

567
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,690
it's useful to specify things precisely
and to put them in the appropriate

568
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,250
categories.
And in a sense,

569
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:28,090
that's what science does,
is that it continually strives to

570
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:31,350
differentiate,
differentiate things and put them in

571
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,650
identifiable categories.

572
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,880
And that means that increasingly we're
able to use what we categorize as

573
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:38,740
knowledge to help us confront the world.
So,

574
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,210
you know,
it's a,

575
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,700
it's a great,
it's a great process,

576
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,790
brilliant process.
And it's even more remarkable because

577
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:48,550
relatively stupid people could do it
because it's a,

578
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,380
it's algorithmic based,
you know,

579
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,920
the science is a method.
And so once you know the method,

580
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,320
you don't even have to be that smart to
make progress.

581
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:59,950
You could just grind away at something
with the method and sooner or later

582
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,700
you'll produce new information.
And,

583
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,500
and that's,
that's,

584
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,640
that's a great thing.
You know,

585
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:08,641
it's like a science is like a factory
that produces knowledge so well,

586
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,990
so that's wonderful.
But

587
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,500
what's not so wonderful about it
arguably is that it's,

588
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:21,700
in some sense,
war are our concept of what constitutes

589
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:24,550
reality.
And it's never really solved as far as I

590
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,680
can tell,
this conflict between the Newtonian

591
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:29,320
perspective on what's real at a
Darwinian perspective,

592
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:30,154
on what's real.

593
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,630
And as far as I can tell Darren and
trump's new,

594
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,060
and that's true if you're a biologist
for sure,

595
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,930
because there isn't anything that's more
true that sits underneath biology,

596
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:45,070
didn't a theory of natural selection.
And that's partly a philosophical claim.

597
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,490
And the claim is because you can't
represent all of the external reality

598
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,790
with ultimate accuracy.
You're going to fail in everything

599
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:58,630
that's bounded or even everything that's
not as complex as the thing that's

600
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:01,180
trying to be represented is going to
fail.

601
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,340
So how do you deal with,
how do you deal with that?

602
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,050
You generate variations and it somewhat
has to be somewhat random because you

603
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:12,370
don't know what's coming.
You generate random variations and then

604
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,610
hopefully one of those variations will
work in relationship to whatever is

605
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:21,100
coming.
And so it's also a kind of truth,

606
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:23,020
20 minutes and embodied truth claim,
right?

607
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:27,130
You carry the fundamental truth of your
existence in the shape of your

608
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,250
physiology.
So in on earlier claims a philosophical

609
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,020
truth where most of the disembodied,
you know,

610
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:39,620
there was some implicit idea that the
consciousness or the soul was more real

611
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,330
than the block.
Well,

612
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:44,840
it's nice to think about that in some
ways because it opens the door to the

613
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:49,160
idea of things like in mortality,
but it doesn't seem to be very

614
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,333
okay.

615
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,830
It's hard not to associate that with a
drink.

616
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,910
All right.
So category systems

617
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,330
w

618
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,640
when you encounter something that
frightens you,

619
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,080
your body categorizes it and it
categorizes it as something that

620
00:33:10,081 --> 00:33:15,081
presents a danger or threat to you.
And danger is the probability that

621
00:33:16,441 --> 00:33:19,950
something will damage you.
Like it'll be too loud or too hot or too

622
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:22,250
cold,
it'll damage your sensory systems or

623
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,670
directly pose a threat to your
physiological or psychological

624
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,280
integrity.
And so your design,

625
00:33:29,281 --> 00:33:31,770
so to speak,
to protect yourself against that,

626
00:33:31,771 --> 00:33:34,410
you feel pain for that reason.
And instead of paying,

627
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:36,840
you also feel anxiety,
which alerts you to the fact that you

628
00:33:36,841 --> 00:33:40,440
might feel pain and should do something
about that you should freeze or you

629
00:33:40,441 --> 00:33:42,690
should run away.
And so for example,

630
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,770
what,
what that,

631
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,210
what emerges from that is the beginnings
of a natural category system.

632
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,590
So you could say,
well,

633
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:53,310
here's one useful category.
That is the category of all things that

634
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,620
you should freeze at or run away from.

635
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,090
And that's a deep category.
It's a biologically predicated category.

636
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,040
And it's also a category that has
meaning,

637
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,780
right?
Because the meaning is what you should

638
00:34:03,781 --> 00:34:06,420
do when something like that shows up.
It's not,

639
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,760
the meaning isn't stripped out of the
category at all.

640
00:34:08,761 --> 00:34:12,060
It's actually fundamental.
Now it turns out that a lot of our

641
00:34:12,061 --> 00:34:14,890
perceptions,
when people think about the way they

642
00:34:14,891 --> 00:34:17,670
perceived the world,
they think well out there a bunch of

643
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:21,270
objects and you look at them and once
you look at them,

644
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:24,990
you see them and once you see them,
you figure out what they are and then

645
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:28,710
you evaluate what you should do and you
progress on that basis.

646
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:31,410
Right?
It's so object perception,

647
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,880
cognition,
emotion,

648
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,370
action.
While the problem with that is it's

649
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:38,520
wrong.
And the first reason it's wrong is

650
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,930
because things don't exist out in the
world as self.

651
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:46,680
Evidently separable entities hardly
because everything can be segregated

652
00:34:46,681 --> 00:34:51,000
into smaller entities and every entity
can be aggregated together with larger

653
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:51,510
entities.

654
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,760
And so the boundary that defines
something as a self evident,

655
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:59,761
the entity is not by no means clear.
So part of the way that your body deals

656
00:35:00,091 --> 00:35:05,091
with that is by categorizing things with
regards to their immediate impact for

657
00:35:06,241 --> 00:35:09,060
you.
And so when you look at something,

658
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,410
so let's say you're looking at this and
you say,

659
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,290
well that's a bottle.
And so you might ask,

660
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:19,170
well what is your brain doing when
you're looking at that?

661
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,790
And the answer is it's molding your body
to prepare to pick that thing up.

662
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,640
And that's how it understands it.
So your eyes,

663
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:32,840
I received a pattern that's constant
across some duration.

664
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:35,270
It's not made of smoke,
it's made of something that lasts.

665
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:38,760
So there's a pattern here,
a bottle pattern that lasts across time.

666
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,870
You have some sense of what it is having
interacted with these sorts of things

667
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:46,470
before,
but also its shape obviously indicates

668
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:49,920
that it's a grippable thing.
And so what that means is that when you

669
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:52,440
look at it,
your eyes activate your motor cortex

670
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,570
directly,
even before you see the object,

671
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,270
like before you form an image of it and
your imagination,

672
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,060
your retina,
the pattern when you rent.

673
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:04,320
And that activates your grit,
right handed or left handed,

674
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,760
whichever hand you happened to be.
And part of what you're seeing when you

675
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:13,761
see that bottle is what you would do
with it if you were interacting with it.

676
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,390
So you see the manner in which you would
interact with us.

677
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,010
And that's the case for virtually
everything that you see.

678
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,840
So for example,
when you look at a chair,

679
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:25,080
your body prepares to sit in the chair
and maybe to stand on the chair if

680
00:36:25,081 --> 00:36:29,070
you're going to change a light pole or
we know when you look at your computer,

681
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,140
you see the keyboard because that's the
thing.

682
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:35,700
You move your fingers up and down on.
And so your perception is tightly tied

683
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,690
to the implication of objects for action
immediately.

684
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,000
Now you might say,
well that's not real.

685
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:45,000
That's not the reality of it.
The reality of it is the objective

686
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:46,770
thing.
But as I said already,

687
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,930
it depends on how you define reality.
You take a Newtonian Newtonian tap on it

688
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:55,500
or our Darwinian attack and from the
Darwinian perspective,

689
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:59,820
the implication of something for
auctions actually its primary meaning,

690
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,900
which is don't stand around and
contemplate a tiger.

691
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,360
Well,
it's trying to eat you because the fact

692
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:09,210
that it's trying to eat you is more
important than the fact that it's a

693
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:11,370
tiger.
And if you don't figure that out quick,

694
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:14,970
then you're not around anymore.
And so much for your claims to truth,

695
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,950
that's just,
you're just gone.

696
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,480
That's an error,
right?

697
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,870
And whatever was in you that enabled you
to make that error is not going to be

698
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:25,170
transmitted to the next generation,
or at least hopefully not.

699
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,540
So there's a domain of categorization
that has to do with the meaning of

700
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:36,624
things.
Now,

701
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,130
most of what the psychologists have
dealt with who are clinical

702
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:44,010
psychologists,
does actually the domain of

703
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:47,220
categorization that has to do with the
meaning of things.

704
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,600
And it's actually because as far as
you're concerned in your life as a,

705
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:56,160
as a human being,
you live inside a network of meanings of

706
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:56,994
things,
right?

707
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,030
So for example,
when you look at your mother,

708
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:04,710
you're not looking at her at her as an
object and then attributing all sorts of

709
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:08,250
meanings to her.
You see the meaning of your mother right

710
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:10,320
away.
And that meaning is multidimensional.

711
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,160
It has a very long history and it
affects you directly on a physiological

712
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:18,210
and maybe you hate her and so the sight
of your mother makes your heart race and

713
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:21,900
your and your brain produce cortisol
because she's categorized as

714
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,110
unpredictable and chronic threat.
That's a standard story in situation.

715
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,390
No one would laugh if there wasn't
sometimes that was true.

716
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,740
Those are Friday and slips.
By the way,

717
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:41,080
when you discuss something like that and
people laugh,

718
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:46,060
then that's an admission on their part,
like an deeply unconscious admission on

719
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:50,170
their part that there is truth to this
statement and it's also a truth that is

720
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:53,020
somewhat painful to admit.
So you can tell that.

721
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,960
You can tell that when you're listening
to Comedians,

722
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,460
they do that all the time,
right?

723
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:01,090
They tell you something that's
absolutely brutally evident that no one

724
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,610
will admit.
And everyone laughs and that is a

725
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,880
Freudian slip technically,
because Freud often listened to the

726
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:10,540
sorts of things that would make his
patients laugh or make an audience that

727
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:14,680
he was speaking too loud because that
would give him some insights into what

728
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,210
they were repressing,
so to speak,

729
00:39:16,211 --> 00:39:18,010
and what they would allow to come to
light.

730
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,990
So when jokes are often about things
that are taboo,

731
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,560
right?
It's hard to make a joke about something

732
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,340
that isn't taboo.
So,

733
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,410
all right,
so I've kind of made it a classification

734
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,660
structure of these two different ways of
looking at things.

735
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,690
There's the meaning centered way of
looking at things and the meaning is

736
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,780
then the implication of the thing for
action on your part.

737
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,450
And it's a more materialistic centered
thing,

738
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:44,200
which is sort of like the world as it
exists if you weren't here,

739
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,180
right?
That's a,

740
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,640
that's this fundamental hypothesis of
sciences that we're,

741
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,450
there's something around that would be
here and look the way it does.

742
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:54,250
Look now,
if none of you were around,

743
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,290
you know,
it's possible that that's true.

744
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,670
And it's also possible that it's,
it's possible.

745
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,720
It's possible that it's not true,
but most possible is the fact that it's

746
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:11,590
true in a way that we really don't
understand because the existence of

747
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,420
things,
the way we perceive them as clearly

748
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:15,700
dependent on our existence as a
perceiver.

749
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:20,080
And so what the nature of the world
would be if there was no one around at

750
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,880
all perceive it.
If there was no such thing as

751
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,120
consciousnesses effect,
that is a completely unsolved problem.

752
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,050
So maybe it would be like a field of
quantum potential or something like

753
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:29,920
that.
But,

754
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,460
but it isn't even possible to really
understand what that means.

755
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,340
So
now having established that,

756
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,060
having established,
I'll give you another example before we

757
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:44,410
move on.
So I said,

758
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:47,890
for example,
that when you interact with objects

759
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:49,900
around you,
you're not really interacting with

760
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:51,640
objects.
It's more like you're interacting with

761
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,860
tools because you're a primary concern
is,

762
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,690
well,
what the,

763
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:59,080
what's the world in relationship to me?
What do I have to avoid?

764
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,000
You know,
if I'm going to get to where I'm going

765
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,760
and what can I use to further my
pursuits?

766
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,770
And so you're like that deeply.

767
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,170
That's why human beings are tool using
creatures,

768
00:41:08,171 --> 00:41:10,480
right?
We have hands and they manipulate the

769
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:14,350
world and those hands are there.
They're built into our cognitive

770
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:17,230
architecture.
Like it's not like our brain is separate

771
00:41:17,231 --> 00:41:18,670
from our hands,
far,

772
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,690
far,
it's,

773
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,270
it's,
it's very opposite to that.

774
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,420
We wouldn't have the brains we have if
we didn't have the hands we have.

775
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:29,230
That's why things like is by the way,
or Octopi are very intelligent.

776
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,260
They are,
even though they're invertebrates,

777
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,350
they only live a couple of years,
so they can't learn that much.

778
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:37,560
But they're extraordinarily intelligent
and it's partly because they're tactical

779
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,890
within the,
because they are technical,

780
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,550
they can grab things and manipulate them
and so you know,

781
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,530
they've developed an intelligence that's
identifiable to us because we have

782
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:47,990
little tentacles on the ends of our
hands and you know,

783
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,280
we're using them to fiddling around with
the world at the time.

784
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,520
So
now

785
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,030
there's the perceptual

786
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,900
reality,
which is that we know about already,

787
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:06,170
that when you look at something and we
track the way that you're interacting

788
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:08,210
with,
we know that one of the first things

789
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:13,211
that happen happens is the relationship
between the perceived object and your

790
00:42:13,461 --> 00:42:15,980
body is established very rapidly.
Okay.

791
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,340
Because you want to map the object onto
your body so you know what the hell to

792
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:22,370
do.
Orient yourself so that you're safe and

793
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:23,750
productive.
At the same time,

794
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:29,530
there's a guy named
Jj Gibson Gibson who was uh,

795
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,070
uh,
psychology psychologist.

796
00:42:34,071 --> 00:42:37,220
The perception you operated in the late
seventies people thought his theories

797
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,160
were
they weren't behavioral,

798
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:41,750
that's for sure.
They were going to have a different

799
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:46,970
classification or category.
And Gibson also made the first sort of

800
00:42:46,971 --> 00:42:49,610
claim that what you saw in the world
where things like tools,

801
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:52,370
he called them affordances.
And so for example,

802
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,880
when you approach what you would call
from an objective perspective,

803
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:58,280
a cliff,
Gibson would say,

804
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,300
you don't see a cliff.

805
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,560
You see a falling off place and you
might need from cliff.

806
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,970
But you see falling off place.
And if you think about it,

807
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,930
again from a Darwinian perspective,
of course you see falling off place.

808
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,890
That's why you know you,
you might shrink from a precipice is

809
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:19,820
your whole being perceives that as a
place that would instantly make you

810
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:23,030
extinct.
It's not a secondary derivation from

811
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:25,940
your analysis of a set of objective
facts.

812
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,360
It's that primary perception.
And it has to be because you better move

813
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,860
quick.
If you're to New York cliff,

814
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,610
you don't have any time to think.
The same thing occurs when maybe you're

815
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:35,900
being,
you know,

816
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:39,620
potentially struck by a snake.
You have circuits in your brain that

817
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:43,490
will see that snake and make you jump
way before you know it's a snake.

818
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:47,660
Because sick around standing around
waiting for the image of snake to

819
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,720
forming your consciousness means that
you'd be bitten five to six times

820
00:43:50,721 --> 00:43:55,640
already because you're just going fast
enough to see and then move you see move

821
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,820
and then proceed.
And that's what keeps you safe.

822
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,120
And so a lot of,
a lot of what you've perceived in the

823
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:04,490
world or the meetings that you've mapped
onto your body.

824
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,673
So,

825
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,670
so then you can think what human beings
have done in response to this bifurcated

826
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:20,161
way of perceiving reality is we've
developed two different systems of

827
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:23,740
classification to deal with it.
Now for most of human history,

828
00:44:23,741 --> 00:44:27,850
we only had one,
and the one we had was basically that

829
00:44:27,851 --> 00:44:30,460
meaningful system.
It wasn't the scientific system,

830
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,250
right?
We didn't get around to figuring that

831
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:34,430
out.
Even the ancient Greeks and the Romans,

832
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,050
the Greeks in particular who were
unbelievably intelligent,

833
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,090
really never gotten around to pause.
Something like that.

834
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,170
Objective reality.
And if certainly the Romans didn't,

835
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:46,450
there was no science.
Science only evolved in Europe and only

836
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,290
you know,
the late 1500 it's very strange and it's

837
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:53,220
very difficult to understand.
So we'd been elaborating out this

838
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:55,980
materialistic viewpoint for only about
500 years.

839
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,440
It's not very long.
The other viewpoint,

840
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,620
that's the natural habitat of humanity
and that's the viewpoint that's made up

841
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:07,650
of all the stories that people have told
about themselves in the world since the

842
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:09,120
dawn of human consciousness.

843
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,720
And that's really,
those are the knowledge forms,

844
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:15,870
the stories that actually constitute the
base of culture.

845
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,980
Because culture is not so much about
what the world is and how to perceive it

846
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,030
as it is about how you should act in
relationship to the world.

847
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,770
And so when you read fiction and when
you talk to each other endlessly about

848
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:32,130
what your friends are up to and what
their friends are up to and what they're

849
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:35,730
doing on facebook.
And when you go to movies and you watch

850
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:40,731
actors act out roles and you know when
you do everything you do to examine

851
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:43,950
other people around you,
that you're betting yourself in this

852
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,220
ancient culture that's there to tell you
how you should operate yourself in the

853
00:45:50,431 --> 00:45:52,020
world,
what you should do,

854
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,320
because that's a primary question.
You need to know what to do.

855
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,710
Human beings need to know what to do
because if you don't know what to do,

856
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:02,730
well that's a very unpleasant emotional
state.

857
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,090
And that's partly because it indicates
that you're not willing adapt it to your

858
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:07,680
current circumstances.
You know,

859
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,800
if you just stand around long enough not
knowing what to do,

860
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,170
you'll age and you'll die.
It's not an effective way of dealing

861
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:18,090
with the world.
You have to be oriented towards

862
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:21,690
something and the,
the job with culture in part is to tell

863
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:26,691
you to what you should be oriented and
that's where the rubber hits the road

864
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:30,960
with regards to psychology because
especially in its clinical variants and

865
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:35,720
personality theory has to be an element
of clinical clip.

866
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,150
Personality theory has to be a sub
element of clinical theory.

867
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,280
What psychology has to contend with,
as I mentioned in the first lecture,

868
00:46:44,281 --> 00:46:48,240
is not only what you are but what you
should be and the reason for that is

869
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,430
you,
when you're talking about a human being,

870
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,640
you can't separate out the bare facts
that present you about the person from

871
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,604
the ideal.

872
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,310
We do this all the time.
What's mental health?

873
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:01,021
Well,
you could say,

874
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,820
well,
it's the absence of mental illness.

875
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,990
You know,
really if someone tells you that you

876
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:09,900
should just stop the conversation
because all they'd done is

877
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,140
solve one problem with an equally large
problem.

878
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,470
There's no progress there.
It's,

879
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,850
it's a kind of a smart Alec he thing to
do.

880
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,090
You know,
it sort of means going into a lot of

881
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,260
the,
with your stupid question,

882
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,750
mental health,
if you want to understand what mental

883
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:30,130
health is,
it's because it's very difficult to get,

884
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:34,120
people did find it.
You have to watch how they act when

885
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,510
they're talking about such things as
mental health because then you can

886
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:41,440
derive some sense of what they actually
understand about it,

887
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,590
our presume about it instead of what
they just say about,

888
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,410
right.
So if you look at how society's use the

889
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:51,150
idea of mental health,
they partly do use it normatively and if

890
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,150
it's used normatively,
then describing it as the absence of

891
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:56,670
mental illness actually works.

892
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,680
Say well you're healthy to the degree
that you're normal.

893
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,680
And so extremes outside of normality
start to border on pathology.

894
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,430
But there's obvious limitations and
problems with that approach,

895
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,220
right?
Because we don't think the average

896
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:15,640
person is the best looking person.
And we'd assume that attractiveness is,

897
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:19,990
it's an ideal towards which we might all
at least aspire.

898
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,770
And it turns out there's deep biological
reasons for that because most of the

899
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:28,060
things that men and women find
attractive about each other are they

900
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:30,220
find you attractive for deep biological
reasons,

901
00:48:30,221 --> 00:48:32,950
like symmetry for example,
which is an indication of sort of

902
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,710
optimal biological development,
um,

903
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,890
for men,
for women looking at men that's shoulder

904
00:48:38,891 --> 00:48:41,530
to waist ratio and for what men looking
at women,

905
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:45,400
it's w waist to hip ratio,
which should be about 0.68,

906
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:47,560
which is pretty damned precise.
And you know,

907
00:48:47,561 --> 00:48:49,150
men are always computing that when
they're,

908
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,170
when they're looking around.

909
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,990
So,
so,

910
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,700
so,
um,

911
00:48:55,870 --> 00:49:00,640
you can't talk about what constitutes
health by merely making a normative

912
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:02,770
claim.
You also have to take into account

913
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:06,910
something like deviation from an ideal.
And that's a weird thing because of

914
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:10,480
course the ideal doesn't really exist
that that's what makes it ideal.

915
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:14,200
But you can't get away from that problem
if you're going to do anything serious

916
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,260
about psychology.
Because implicit in the idea,

917
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,430
not only of mental health but of health
itself is the,

918
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,240
is the question what constitutes an
ideal human being?

919
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,470
And he might think,
well,

920
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:28,270
that's not so relevant.
You know,

921
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:33,271
why would that be relevant to pursue?
And I would say as well as people were

922
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:37,530
not only ever engaged to this scientific
pursuit,

923
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:39,460
right?
We're engaged in the business of living

924
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,610
and we might be scientists sort of as a
subset of that,

925
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:46,060
but,
and then I would also say that if we're

926
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:48,820
dealing in the realm of health and
mental health were not being scientists

927
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:50,350
anyways,
we're being,

928
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:54,220
it's like philosophical engineers
because what we're doing is we're

929
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,920
attempting to take our knowledge,
however it's being gathered,

930
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:59,890
including scientifically and to make
things better,

931
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:00,820
not worse.

932
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,530
And when you're trying to make things
better,

933
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,070
you're not being a scientist.
What a scientist is trying to do is to

934
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:10,030
describe what things are as soon as
that's transformed into like

935
00:50:10,031 --> 00:50:11,890
engineering,
say it's more,

936
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:12,360
it's,
it's,

937
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:16,120
it is still,
it becomes a variation of applied.

938
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,750
It's like applied philosophy.
It's a different domain.

939
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,820
And I think it's not right to just skip
over that and pretend that what we're

940
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:27,810
studying,
say an a personality class is something

941
00:50:27,811 --> 00:50:30,260
we can only be studied scientifically
because it's not,

942
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,280
maybe you can study people's conceptions
of what constitutes ideal

943
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,700
scientifically,
but you're still faced with the problem

944
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,950
with that.
The question of what is the ideal

945
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:44,090
lingers underneath all the phenomena
that you're trying to understand and

946
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,560
explain.
So beauty,

947
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:47,270
that's a good example.
Intelligence,

948
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,000
we tend to assume that more is better,
right?

949
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:52,730
We don't think the average is the right
place to stop.

950
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,840
And in fact,
that's,

951
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,070
you know,
all of you people,

952
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:57,500
there's not a single person in here,
I suspect,

953
00:50:57,501 --> 00:51:02,501
who has an average Iq.
You're probably minimally at the 85th

954
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:05,990
percentile and most of you are at the
95th percentile.

955
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,750
So that's also,
remember I told you last summit,

956
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:11,270
last class that scientists are like,
you know,

957
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,910
albino elephants.
They're very rare.

958
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:17,540
And you guys are like that too.
You're not normal human beings.

959
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,420
So it's true.
You know,

960
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:23,180
and as you progress up the ladder of
success,

961
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:27,890
you'll be in increasing contact with
stranger and stranger variance of

962
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:32,880
humanity because the successful people
who are smart and highly conscientious

963
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,290
say are smart and highly creative,
are a tiny minority of the human

964
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:38,420
population.
And that's unfortunate.

965
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,940
Seriously unfortunate.
But,

966
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:44,120
um,
you're the beneficiaries of the lottery

967
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:47,780
that determined in part here genetic,
the genetic structure of your

968
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:52,460
intelligence.
So I suspect I've done some testing of u

969
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:57,461
of t students and the average comes out
at around 126 to 130 that's two standard

970
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,440
deviations above the mean.
So,

971
00:52:00,441 --> 00:52:02,370
and you know,
it's probably actually higher than that

972
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:05,390
because a lot of you have English as a
second language and so that tends to

973
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:06,710
suppress your,
your,

974
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:09,590
you know,
your performance on Iq tests if they're

975
00:52:09,591 --> 00:52:11,090
assessing verbal knowledge.
Anyway,

976
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:14,750
so,
all right,

977
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:22,500
let's
see.

978
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:33,330
So part of what I'm going to talk to you
today about is the sorts of things that

979
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:38,331
Carl Young would called archetypes.
And archetype is a ill defined term.

980
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:42,540
And that's,
that's partly why it's very difficult to

981
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:46,530
understand you.
It's also very difficult to transform

982
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:50,940
the sorts of things that he had to say
into very precise scientific

983
00:52:50,941 --> 00:52:53,640
formulations,
but

984
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:56,853
okay.

985
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,850
But that doesn't change the fact that
it's extraordinarily useful from the

986
00:53:01,851 --> 00:53:05,990
perspective of general understanding.
It's just useful thing to pursue.

987
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,220
And also from the perspective of
practical utility to understand

988
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:12,260
something about these archetypical
categories.

989
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,900
And the reason for that is you're in
their grit.

990
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,570
Now,
one of the things that you can set,

991
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,480
this is a brilliant thing.
It's terrifying and psychoanalysts are

992
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,180
terrifying people.
Freud's Beth not,

993
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,430
you know,
because Freud dug around in this

994
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,910
pathology of the family and families can
be great,

995
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,400
but if you want real pathology of
families,

996
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:35,730
a good place to look.
So because of pathological family is so

997
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:39,060
pathological that it's unbelievable.
And that's actually what Freud was

998
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:40,630
interested in.
And it's,

999
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,221
it's,
it's,

1000
00:53:41,221 --> 00:53:44,220
again,
it's hard for normal sort of healthy

1001
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,370
people to appreciate that because if
you're normal and healthy and your

1002
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:48,330
family's kind of,
you know,

1003
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:51,000
not half bad,
you don't have all those Freud,

1004
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:51,834
he had problems.

1005
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,360
But if you do have them,
that's all you have.

1006
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,940
You never get out.
You're trapped in there like that,

1007
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:02,090
like a fly in a spider's Web that the
flying spiders with common symbol

1008
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,090
representation of the classic Freudian
situation.

1009
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,770
So,
um,

1010
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,430
okay.
So I'm going to show you this picture

1011
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:15,510
because I want to talk to you about a
category system that will be useful in

1012
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:19,110
understanding what we're going to go
through during this course.

1013
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:22,950
So what I would like to do with all of
you is to start from the bottom of

1014
00:54:22,951 --> 00:54:24,590
things.
And that's what we were doing today when

1015
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:26,490
we were talking about definitions of
truth.

1016
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:30,660
So I asked you to consider for a moment
that there's two ways of looking at

1017
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:33,390
truth.
One is your objective sort of Newtonian

1018
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:34,920
way,
which by the way is outdated.

1019
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,980
We still hold it because it's
practically useful.

1020
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,050
And the other is the Darwinian
perspective,

1021
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:44,130
which is the world is meaningful in
relationship to you and those meetings

1022
00:54:44,131 --> 00:54:46,860
are real and so forth.
And so far as they have a bearing on

1023
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:49,110
whether or not you actually survive.
So,

1024
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,310
and then you make the claim that there
isn't anything more real fan,

1025
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,220
whether or not you survive,
you can't get under that.

1026
00:54:56,221 --> 00:54:58,470
That's where you start.
So,

1027
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,380
so you could say,
I could say for example,

1028
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,790
if the pursuit of the Newtonian theory
of reality culminated in the extinction

1029
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:12,060
of human beings saying because our
technological power got so great,

1030
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,800
that would be perfect evidence for its
lack of truth because there are things

1031
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:19,350
that just wasn't taking into account.
Right?

1032
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,080
Because something that's true should
take things into account.

1033
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:25,950
And one of the things that you take into
account is that we're living things that

1034
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,330
we can only exist under a certain,
you know,

1035
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,100
within certain parameters and that were
also oriented towards an ideal.

1036
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,500
And if your theory doesn't take that
into account,

1037
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:38,400
well maybe not only is it into plate,
it might be pathologically and,

1038
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,120
and,
and genocidally.

1039
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,190
All right,
this is a representation from ancient

1040
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,790
Egypt.
Um,

1041
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,960
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
what the representations mean.

1042
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,230
So this first one here is horace and
this person here is a service.

1043
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,260
And that person there is isis and Osiris
is the god of tradition.

1044
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:06,870
And that's why he sorta standing there
on that pillar.

1045
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:11,760
And so the Egyptians thought of these
three,

1046
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,210
there's one other,
there's seth and seth is a bad guy.

1047
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:19,290
So Seth is the evil villain that's
always whispering in the king's ear.

1048
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:23,410
You see that story repeated in all sorts
of different forms.

1049
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,530
So seth is,
it's a negative figure and he's not

1050
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:29,140
included in these particular image,
but we'll,

1051
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:31,270
we'll get to him.
Seth is also,

1052
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,180
by the way,
oh cirruses brethren.

1053
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:35,860
So,
and that's because the Egyptians had

1054
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:38,890
figured out,
and this is like 3000 years be seen,

1055
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:42,400
the Egyptians had already figured out
and if you put a state together,

1056
00:56:42,401 --> 00:56:46,990
so the state would be represented by
ocirus and ocirus is sort of like the

1057
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,060
abstraction of the patriarchal force
that stands behind the tradition.

1058
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,870
So if you imagine that a tradition has a
way of behaving,

1059
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,890
if that's what it tradition is to the
degree that you share a tradition,

1060
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,720
you're all manifesting the same pattern.
And the Egyptians would say that pattern

1061
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,700
that you're imitating,
that's a day.

1062
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,210
That's,
I mean they,

1063
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,440
they didn't think of it that way because
they didn't think the way we think.

1064
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:15,610
But for all intensive purposes,
the phenomena that they described as a

1065
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:20,611
god was the pattern that everyone was
unconsciously re imitating.

1066
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,660
Now you have to unconsciously imitate
the same pattern or you can't get along,

1067
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,830
right?

1068
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,270
So in,
in,

1069
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:32,740
in our society for example,
we have a body of laws and most of it's

1070
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:37,741
derived from English common law and
English common law emerge as a

1071
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:42,751
consequence of the
necessity to solve disputes between

1072
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:47,530
people.
So that all hell didn't break loose.

1073
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:52,531
So English common law was produced when
one person took another person to court

1074
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:55,060
to say,
we've got a serious problem.

1075
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,240
We don't know how to organize our
behavior in the same space.

1076
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,140
You have to make a ruling.
So then the judge would assess the

1077
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:06,280
situation and state who had the right to
do what.

1078
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:10,270
And then that became part of the law.
Now in so far as you are law abiding

1079
00:58:10,271 --> 00:58:14,290
citizens,
and so you abide by the body of law,

1080
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,450
you actually manifest the body of law
and your behavior.

1081
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:24,520
And to the degree that you do that,
other people like you to agree that you

1082
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:25,480
don't do that.

1083
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,900
You're either poorly trained,
poorly socialized,

1084
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:30,760
antisocial,
or,

1085
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,210
or downright dangerous,
in which case other people,

1086
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:37,000
we'll put you somewhere where you're
have less harm than you might be.

1087
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,200
So like it or not,
you're a mimicker.

1088
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,830
And what you mimic is the central
pattern of cultural behavior that has

1089
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:52,270
evolved over who knows how long,
forever,

1090
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,230
forever.
And so far as some of its associated say

1091
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:57,220
with dominance,
hierarchy,

1092
00:58:57,221 --> 00:58:58,840
behavior,
which is unbelievably old.

1093
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,810
That's so serious,
not so serious.

1094
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:03,670
That's God the father,
so to speak.

1095
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,910
And it's part of,
it's part of the category of culture.

1096
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,300
Now the Egyptians also knew that culture
was not only necessarily a good thing as

1097
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:14,590
a,
of course all of you know because no

1098
00:59:14,591 --> 00:59:18,220
doubt sometimes you note that you're the
beneficiary of your culture,

1099
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:22,640
but sometimes no doubt.
You also feel you're like crushed and

1100
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,050
mistreated and mold.
And pantone was shaped by the culture

1101
00:59:27,051 --> 00:59:31,730
because the culture says you better act
like everybody else expects you to.

1102
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:35,420
And of course that's necessary,
but you're not exactly like everybody

1103
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:37,550
else.
So you couldn't get mangled and crunched

1104
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:40,400
and you know,
male formed as you're socialized,

1105
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:44,750
even though you also learn to speak and
you learn to read and you learn all

1106
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,310
those things that culture can provide
with,

1107
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:50,300
you know,
the Egyptians knew even 3000 years ago

1108
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:54,350
that although culture was necessary,
it was an element of existence that

1109
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:57,740
human beings were always in bed.
Now that's why it's a permanent

1110
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,380
category.
There's no non cultural people.

1111
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,440
You can't be a human being without a
culture.

1112
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,910
It's,
it's not possible.

1113
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:06,540
We're,
we're evolving.

1114
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:11,030
Our,
our physiological form presumes that

1115
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:15,260
we're going to emerge into the world in
a culture and that will inform us as we

1116
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:17,150
develop.
That's why we have such a long

1117
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,040
developmental period,
right?

1118
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,050
We are,
we're born unformed.

1119
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:23,780
And the only reason that works is
because

1120
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:31,010
the lack of formed has been consistently
manifested in an environment that would

1121
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:31,844
form it.

1122
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:35,330
So culture isn't just culture.
It's the environment that we had habit,

1123
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,370
because culture has been around for so
long.

1124
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:42,080
And I'll give you one example of that.
So a big part of every culture is Darwin

1125
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,270
attire,
right?

1126
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:49,400
And a dominance hierarchy says who has
what access to what at what given time.

1127
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,060
It pretty much every creature is in the
dominant charge.

1128
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:55,310
Chickens earning dominance hierarchies.
That's the pecking order,

1129
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,830
right?
Members of wolves packs are in

1130
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:58,970
dominance.
Archi span.

1131
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,480
Member of members of chimpanzee troops
are in governance.

1132
01:01:01,481 --> 01:01:04,810
Hardy's songbirds are in dominance tire.
You know,

1133
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,580
here's what Satan in this frame,
it's all pretty,

1134
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:11,930
it's not little little birds sitting out
there saying,

1135
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,740
I'm healthy and loud and if you come
over here,

1136
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,260
I'll check into debt because this is my
tree.

1137
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:22,880
And so
and so the songbirds distribute

1138
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:25,490
themselves around the neighborhood by
dominance.

1139
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,870
And the more dominant birds get vendor
nastic spaces and better means they

1140
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:32,000
don't get rained on,
or at least not as much.

1141
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,310
They did their nest don't get blown out
of trees.

1142
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,780
There's not so many cats around and
they're close to a good food source.

1143
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,860
And so that makes them attractive to
potential meaning partners.

1144
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:46,070
But it also increases the probability
that their chicks will survive.

1145
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,230
And so,
and here's,

1146
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:50,630
here's the nasty bit of truth that goes
along with that.

1147
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:54,110
So let's say there's a bunch of birds in
the neighborhood and some kind of bird

1148
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:57,500
flu.
It's specific to birds kind of wafting

1149
01:01:57,501 --> 01:01:59,570
through and it's killing murders.
Well,

1150
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,860
the birds died from the bottom of the
dormant attire.

1151
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,810
Chiappe and the reason for that is the
bottom birds are all stressed out

1152
01:02:05,811 --> 01:02:08,120
because their life is hard.
And when they're stressed,

1153
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:10,460
they're immune system gets suppressed
and you know,

1154
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:11,820
they're all frazzled from,
you know,

1155
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:14,990
being chased by cats and so on.
And then they die.

1156
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,230
And so the talkers,
and the same thing happens in human

1157
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,064
populations.

1158
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,500
When I'm playing sweeps through,
people die from the bottom of the

1159
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:25,680
dominance hierarchy up.
And so dominance hierarchies mattered.

1160
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,750
And so birds have them in lizards have
them.

1161
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,010
And fish have the,
so in a school of fish,

1162
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,080
the dominant fish,
when the fish bowl up,

1163
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,870
they do that to make it hard for
predators to eat them.

1164
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,570
The big dominant Fisher in the middle of
that ball,

1165
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,030
the little sucker,
useless Fisher on the outside.

1166
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:44,610
And that's what gets eaten up when the
predators come along.

1167
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,150
So,
and we know the dominance hierarchy

1168
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:50,610
stretch back a very long time.
So we know for example,

1169
01:02:50,611 --> 01:02:52,220
that lobsters live in Darwin and sorry
he's,

1170
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:55,800
I told you a little bit about that and
there are about 300 million years old.

1171
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,330
So what that means is that we've been
existing in siding cultural structure

1172
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,150
because the culture is predicated on a
dominance hierarchy,

1173
01:03:03,151 --> 01:03:03,330
right?

1174
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,280
That's the patriarchy.
If you want to use,

1175
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,350
you know,
a politically correct term that's been

1176
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:11,580
around for 300 million years.
So to think about it as a permanent

1177
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:16,581
constituent element of reality is
extremely useful because again,

1178
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,320
here,
here's another question for you.

1179
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,580
Even if you don't buy the sort of
meaning argument with regards to

1180
01:03:23,581 --> 01:03:26,190
categorization,
there's another way you can look at it.

1181
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,460
You might say to yourself,
what's most real?

1182
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:32,400
That's,
that's a tough one because you know,

1183
01:03:32,401 --> 01:03:35,160
we,
we kind of accept gradations of real

1184
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:38,730
like rock seemed pretty real.
Trees seem pretty real.

1185
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:42,150
Um,
the environment is that real?

1186
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:43,940
That's a harder one,
right?

1187
01:03:43,941 --> 01:03:47,940
Cause it's an abstraction about numbers.
Are they real?

1188
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:50,430
You can certainly do real things with
them.

1189
01:03:50,431 --> 01:03:51,540
Once you,
once you get numbers,

1190
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,930
especially zero,
which seems not to exist at all,

1191
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,690
as soon as you get zero,
there's all sorts of magical things you

1192
01:03:57,691 --> 01:03:58,524
can do.

1193
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,940
So anyways,
my point is,

1194
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:02,520
it's not all that obvious to figure out
what constitutes real.

1195
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,200
But here's,
here's a hitch.

1196
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,180
The longer something has been around,
the more real it is.

1197
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,840
Okay,
dominance hierarchies have been around

1198
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:16,440
longer than trees.
They're really,

1199
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,930
they're really,
really real.

1200
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,110
And you live in one.
And not only do you live in one,

1201
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,430
you're really motivated to get to the
top of that well in order to create one

1202
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:29,250
that you can be at the top of it.
Because human beings are sneaky thing.

1203
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,940
Because if we're not doing so well in
the dominance hierarchy,

1204
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:32,710
we might think,
well,

1205
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,990
hell,
with this dominance hierarchy,

1206
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,020
we'll just make a new one.
And that's what creativity is.

1207
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,720
So if you're really creative,
you can make your own dog and it's

1208
01:04:39,721 --> 01:04:41,470
hurricane,
you can sit right at the top of it.

1209
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:44,700
And so that's how it's worked out very
well for human beings.

1210
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,600
You know?
And in fact,

1211
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:49,650
one of the fundamental traits of human
beings is openness and openness is

1212
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:54,651
actually a trade that basically assesses
the degree to which you're capable of

1213
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,420
playing around with the rules.
So you could come up with your own

1214
01:04:57,421 --> 01:04:59,430
dominance heart,
and that's what you do if you're

1215
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:01,410
creative because you make a new set of
rules.

1216
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,990
That's what a creative person does.
It's very sneaky.

1217
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,610
So it's very important to be near the
top of the dominance hierarchy because

1218
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:10,440
it means you live.
That's good.

1219
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:13,770
You live without so much stress.
That's also good.

1220
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,760
And your probability of successfully
reproducing or say of having many mating

1221
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:21,700
opportunities goes off,
especially in the case of men,

1222
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,020
it's,
it's like an ed.

1223
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:27,820
It's like an exponential improvement.
So if you ever wonder why men are so

1224
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:31,000
competitive,
that's the reason it's because the loser

1225
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:31,870
men get nothing.

1226
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,540
Really.
That's exactly how it works.

1227
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,630
And the winter man,
they get everything and there's actually

1228
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:39,760
a law that goes behind that and economic
law,

1229
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:42,010
you can look it up.
It's called the pareto distribution.

1230
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:45,730
You look up the prieto distribution.
It's the law that describes the income

1231
01:05:45,731 --> 01:05:48,310
inequality.
They don't tell you something important

1232
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:50,440
about how the world works and Prieto
distribution,

1233
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:54,760
which is almost everyone gets nothing
and almost no one gets everything.

1234
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,140
That's a frito distribution.
It covers the production of everything

1235
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:03,100
that's created money.
Inventions are like music,

1236
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:04,480
paintings,
you name it.

1237
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,720
If people creatively produce it,
hardly anyone does all of it and almost

1238
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:13,030
everyone does none of it.
So it's a really winner take all

1239
01:06:13,031 --> 01:06:14,560
situation,
his heart,

1240
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:17,470
he you set up.
And really as a reflection of that fact,

1241
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:21,640
we also know for example,
just to hammer the point home is that if

1242
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:25,150
you make dominance hierarchy steep like
a steep one is hard to climb.

1243
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:27,340
And there's a lot of difference between
top and bottom,

1244
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:31,900
the steeper the dominance hierarchy in
any given geographical locale,

1245
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,130
the higher the murder rate among men
cause they start to kill each other.

1246
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:39,160
And the reason they started to kill each
other's because that's a good way of

1247
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:41,680
attaining dominance if you haven't gone
any other routes.

1248
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:45,820
And so that's the relationship between
income inequality and the

1249
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:49,660
destabilization of society.
That's an extraordinarily powerful

1250
01:06:49,661 --> 01:06:50,980
relationship.
So,

1251
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:54,220
for example,
you can describe the steepness of a

1252
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:57,970
dominance hierarchy using a statistic
called the Gini Coefficient and the

1253
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:01,000
correlation between the Gini Coefficient
and the male homicide rates in North

1254
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:04,450
America is about 0.8 0.8 is like,
okay,

1255
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:06,100
you're done.
You don't have to figure anything else

1256
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,110
out.
You know why it happens.

1257
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:10,840
It just covers.
You never see it.

1258
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,980
You never see an explanation that
complete in psychology.

1259
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,410
It's like the most powerful effect ever
discovered.

1260
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:21,970
So dominance artists,
this person,

1261
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:23,440
he's painted the Darwin,
it's Harvey.

1262
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:26,410
So you could think about him as the
person who created it.

1263
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,920
That's one way of looking at it and you
can sort of think of him as the

1264
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:32,140
embodiment of it.
So,

1265
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,080
and he's a symbol.
That's another way of looking at it

1266
01:07:35,081 --> 01:07:36,570
because this,
this,

1267
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,620
this king,
because he's a k annual serious,

1268
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,590
he's also a god.
It was also the Egyptian Pharaoh because

1269
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:46,360
the Egyptians presumed that they're
feral was ocirus and he had to take on

1270
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:48,460
the being of those serious when he
became cake,

1271
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,740
when it was coronated.
It's like when you're not a person

1272
01:07:50,741 --> 01:07:52,810
anymore,
you're the embodiment of the state.

1273
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,500
And that happens to people when they're,
when they turned into the president of

1274
01:07:56,501 --> 01:07:57,820
the United States,
for example,

1275
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,640
they're not whoever they were,
they're hardly them at all.

1276
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,550
They're now is this.
And that's the thing that's at the top

1277
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:04,384
of the dominant term.

1278
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:07,030
And it's the thing that represents
culture.

1279
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,070
Now the Egyptians knew that it could go
stray to become tyrannical in religion.

1280
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:15,010
And that's why Oh,
serious had an evil brothers sad.

1281
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,490
But we won't talk about him for a
moment.

1282
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,230
Now he's the upper world.
This is isis.

1283
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:24,500
Isis is his wife,
and Isis is queen of the underworld.

1284
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:27,830
And she's,
the reason she's feminine as far as,

1285
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:32,000
as far as we can tell,
is because from a symbolic perspective,

1286
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:37,160
femininity represents more of like
possibility rather than actuality.

1287
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,730
And the reason for that is that the
defining characteristic of the feminine

1288
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,340
is the capacity to bring forth new
forms.

1289
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,700
And so if you're gonna use the feminine
as a symbolic representation,

1290
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:51,860
you're going to use it to represent the
domain from which new forms come emerge,

1291
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,100
the domain from which new forms emerge
and that sort of the domain of the

1292
01:08:55,101 --> 01:08:59,720
unknown or the domain of nature,
which is why it's mother nature and Isis

1293
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,300
is mother nature,
but she's also queen of the underworld

1294
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:05,150
and she had,
isis had an immense following in the

1295
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,520
ancient world and variance of Isis.

1296
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,700
They like her as a,
as a goddess of worship.

1297
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:15,680
Her,
her span of existence was thousands and

1298
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:16,401
thousands of years.
I mean,

1299
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:21,350
even a lot of the attention that's paid
towards married Catholicism is a

1300
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:24,110
variation of the generation that was
shown the isis,

1301
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:27,800
that stuff often on top of her head
there.

1302
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:30,230
That's usually a very intense with
president,

1303
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:32,810
Moon warhol.
I think in this particular situation,

1304
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:34,540
that's actually,
those are actually accountable.

1305
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:40,450
Okay,
so cirrus and Isis and they are teams,

1306
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,830
so their wedding together order and
chaos,

1307
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,400
they're wedded together and ordered.
That's culture and chaos.

1308
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:52,160
That's nature.
Those are the two most fundamental

1309
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:55,550
constituent elements of the world from
the mythological or symbolic

1310
01:09:55,551 --> 01:09:58,580
perspective.
And what that means is there's always

1311
01:09:58,581 --> 01:10:01,340
been cultured,
at least always discoursed.

1312
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:04,760
Any of us need to bother with it.
There's always been an interpretive

1313
01:10:04,761 --> 01:10:07,730
framework through which conscious
creatures viewed the world.

1314
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,390
You can,
you can't be without having a structure.

1315
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:15,800
And that structure is inculcated inside
you in a lot of it's culturally

1316
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:17,600
transmitted,
don't all of a lot of it.

1317
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:21,050
So it's,
it's a precondition for existence that

1318
01:10:21,051 --> 01:10:24,350
you're a structured thing and that
structure is ordered.

1319
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,400
And then the other element of existence
is that there are things that are

1320
01:10:28,401 --> 01:10:31,430
outside of that order.
All ways that you can't cope with

1321
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,020
because you're a finite thing and your
culture is a finite and founded thing.

1322
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:41,170
And outside of that,
there's mystery and there's mystery.

1323
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,850
Like an outside is a funny place because
it's not outside in the,

1324
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,290
in the way that you think about being
outside of building.

1325
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:52,490
Although it is that in so far as it's
cold and dangerous out there.

1326
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,380
But there's outsides everywhere.
So,

1327
01:10:54,381 --> 01:10:55,370
for example,
if you're,

1328
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:57,830
if you know someone,
maybe you're in a relationship with them

1329
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,760
and you know you're kinda comfortable
with them and then one day you're having

1330
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:04,430
a conversation with them and they tell
you something shocking.

1331
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,220
Like maybe you're,
you're in an intimate relationship with

1332
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:10,460
them and they tell you that maybe it's
the day they tell you that they are

1333
01:11:10,461 --> 01:11:14,520
having an affair or maybe that they had
five that they're still going on.

1334
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:18,780
Who knows?
And then all of a sudden one second you

1335
01:11:18,781 --> 01:11:22,770
were inside a close and isolated and
comfortable cultural space.

1336
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:26,610
And the next second you're outside.
And that's because no matter where you

1337
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:28,970
are,
the boundaries of your known Joanie

1338
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:34,000
extends so far and the fact that you're
very limited in what you apprehend can

1339
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:38,430
be made manifest to you at any moment.
Any of your presuppositions can fail,

1340
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:41,850
especially in relationship to other
people or yourself.

1341
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:44,310
You know,
because if you're all of a sudden

1342
01:11:44,311 --> 01:11:47,460
informed by a longterm partner that they
have been having an affair,

1343
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:50,010
like that certainly says something about
them.

1344
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,710
But it's certainly also says something
about you.

1345
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,620
It's like how dumb can you get,
right?

1346
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,970
How did you not notice?
How are you so naive and you might think

1347
01:11:59,971 --> 01:12:03,000
it's cruel to blame the victim and no
doubt it is,

1348
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,210
but it's irrelevant in this case because
that's what you're going to think in any

1349
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,470
case,
right?

1350
01:12:07,471 --> 01:12:09,000
You know,
cause you're wandering around thinking

1351
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:12,720
you're a reasonably perceptive and well
adapted creature and all of a sudden

1352
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:14,250
poof,
someone pulls the rug out from

1353
01:12:14,251 --> 01:12:17,130
underneath you.
It's like you might doubt them and

1354
01:12:17,131 --> 01:12:19,830
certainly you will and maybe
relationships for a long time,

1355
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,030
but you could also be sure you're going
to doubt yourself and your past,

1356
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:27,870
which is weird because you think it was
already done with and your presence and

1357
01:12:27,871 --> 01:12:29,850
your future's like all of a sudden,
Bang,

1358
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:32,580
you're not in culture anymore.
Poof,

1359
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:37,850
you're in the underworld
order.

1360
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:41,280
Chaos now ordered chaos,
masculine,

1361
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:41,800
feminine.

1362
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:45,840
That's Yin and Yang as well.
They can unite to produce some third

1363
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:49,770
thing and that's often the sun.
It can be the sun as in the thing that

1364
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,770
shines,
but also in terms of the biological son,

1365
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:56,430
there are complicated reasons that those
two things are interrelated.

1366
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,360
This is horace and he's the offspring,
the child of Isis and Osiris.

1367
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:06,080
And I won't tell you the entire story,
but I'll,

1368
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,490
I'll tell you a couple of things about
chorus that are worth knowing.

1369
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:13,880
You've all seen the Egyptian I right
the,

1370
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,040
with the way the eyebrow,
everyone's seen that.

1371
01:13:17,041 --> 01:13:19,380
It's kind of weird cause it's really old
but you all know it.

1372
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,500
Hey that's for us.
And if you look at the Egyptian Idi was

1373
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,480
really open.
So that's an element of what horse is.

1374
01:13:27,481 --> 01:13:32,310
Horace is in fact open eye.
So horace you could think of as the god

1375
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:33,144
of attention.

1376
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,940
It's not to go out of intellect is a
very,

1377
01:13:35,941 --> 01:13:39,690
is a very important difference.
It's horace is the god of attention.

1378
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,000
And that's also why is this
representation.

1379
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:45,140
You see he's got the head of a bird.
It's not any old brewery.

1380
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:47,850
It's a fault.
And the reason the Egyptians put the

1381
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:51,600
head of a Falcon on choruses because
falcons can really see,

1382
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:55,440
they're like super observant.
So they fly above everything so they can

1383
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:57,870
see everywhere there,
above everything there,

1384
01:13:57,871 --> 01:14:00,720
even above the dominance hierarchies
there way up there in the sky.

1385
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,880
And from that position in the sky,
they can see everything and that makes

1386
01:14:05,881 --> 01:14:10,881
them powerful.
And so the Egyptian on the was that the

1387
01:14:11,231 --> 01:14:16,231
proper downloads between order and chaos
made you alert with your eyes open.

1388
01:14:17,230 --> 01:14:19,590
And that was what made you,
that's that.

1389
01:14:19,591 --> 01:14:21,970
That was an element of human divinity,
so to speak.

1390
01:14:21,971 --> 01:14:23,890
That was,
that was the deepest expression of your

1391
01:14:23,891 --> 01:14:25,960
soul.
Here's the way of thinking about that.

1392
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,940
So what happens to you if you're
somewhere where everything is entirely

1393
01:14:30,941 --> 01:14:31,990
predictable and comfortable?

1394
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:34,613
What do you do?

1395
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:37,020
You get lazy.
You get bored.

1396
01:14:37,021 --> 01:14:39,210
What else happens?
Well,

1397
01:14:39,211 --> 01:14:40,800
you certainly,
you don't have to pay attention,

1398
01:14:40,801 --> 01:14:42,720
right?
So what happens when you released,

1399
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,990
stopped paying attention?
You Fall Asleep,

1400
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:48,030
right?
Because you know you're fighting the

1401
01:14:48,031 --> 01:14:49,920
fire.
We just have a nice meal.

1402
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,950
You know that like nothing's going to
come rampaging through your front door.

1403
01:14:53,130 --> 01:14:55,380
And so what the hell do you have to be
awake for?

1404
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:58,940
Oof Asleep?
So now that's good.

1405
01:14:58,941 --> 01:15:00,120
You know,
sometimes you don't have to sleep,

1406
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,910
but as a lifestyle,
it's somewhat limiting.

1407
01:15:02,911 --> 01:15:05,880
So if you're just sitting around hyper
comfortable all the time,

1408
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:09,420
it's like you get all Doley and useless
and it's not helpful.

1409
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,400
That's the sort of couch potato thing,
right?

1410
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:13,830
It's not helpful because if anything
does come along,

1411
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,560
you're in trouble.
And plus you're nothing like you could

1412
01:15:16,561 --> 01:15:18,690
be.
And so you might think,

1413
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:22,500
well the more ordered the better,
but which is exactly what fascists think

1414
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:25,290
by the way.
But the problem with too much order is

1415
01:15:25,291 --> 01:15:28,140
that there's no utility and you even
being there cause everything's perfect

1416
01:15:28,141 --> 01:15:30,300
and it's already done.
You might as well just be asleep.

1417
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:34,140
There's no need for consciousness.
So you want to have a little chaos

1418
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:36,060
around.
And then you might ask,

1419
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:38,400
well how much chaos?
And that answer would be,

1420
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:42,450
well how about not enough to paralyze
you because that's too much.

1421
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,920
Then you're just praying and you might
be awake.

1422
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:46,763
But it's like

1423
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:48,843
it's

1424
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:53,520
terror is a form of consciousness I
suppose.

1425
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:56,760
But we might as well not presume that
it's the optimal form.

1426
01:15:56,761 --> 01:16:00,270
It's also rather self limiting because
if you're terrified long enough,

1427
01:16:00,450 --> 01:16:04,350
you'll just die.
So it's not an optimal state.

1428
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,840
It's also one you'll strive generally to
avoid.

1429
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:07,741
So let's say,
well,

1430
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:11,400
how much chaos should you have around
how much of what's unpredictable should

1431
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:14,430
you have around?
And we could say just enough to make you

1432
01:16:14,431 --> 01:16:16,830
optimally awake,
right?

1433
01:16:16,831 --> 01:16:20,160
So you should be pushing yourself hard
enough at each point.

1434
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:22,890
You want to be,
have one foot in order.

1435
01:16:23,130 --> 01:16:25,380
Yes.
So you're secure and stable and you have

1436
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:28,440
one foot in chaos so that you're not
exactly sure what's going to happen

1437
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:31,830
next.
So that you're pushed to transform and

1438
01:16:31,831 --> 01:16:35,520
change and grow and develop.
And you can tell when you're there

1439
01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:38,130
because then you're alert and you're
paying attention.

1440
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,710
And so at that point,
the Egyptians would say,

1441
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:43,860
well then you're optimally embodied
horace,

1442
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,750
who's the third element of experience?
One ordered to pay off,

1443
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,950
three,
the thing that mediates between order of

1444
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:54,150
males.
And if you're doing that optimally,

1445
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,950
then you know the end of the Yang
symbol.

1446
01:16:56,030 --> 01:16:57,290
I think I've got it here,
actually.

1447
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:03,720
Maybe.
Yes.

1448
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,270
Those are two circuits,
by the way,

1449
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:13,910
for black surface that's paid on us.
And it's an interesting symbol because

1450
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:15,380
there's a white circle in the middle of
it,

1451
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,870
right?
And that means that things might be

1452
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:19,910
pretty gloomy and dark because it's all
chaotic.

1453
01:17:19,911 --> 01:17:22,370
But at any point order can arise out of
that.

1454
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,980
And you know how that is.
You know when you go through a terrible

1455
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:28,190
period of transformation and
everything's instead get shaky and like

1456
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,770
it passes him.
Maybe you're even better off than you

1457
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,790
were before and maybe not.
But at least sometimes it happens.

1458
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,070
And then the white circle and had the
black guy.

1459
01:17:37,071 --> 01:17:38,450
And that's because,
well,

1460
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:40,370
you know,
just when you think you're safe,

1461
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:42,800
the rug gets pulled out from underneath
you.

1462
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,890
So there's a dynamic,
this is what the Dallas believe and what

1463
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:50,240
they state explicitly.
The world is a dynamic between chaos and

1464
01:17:50,241 --> 01:17:50,780
order.

1465
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:54,250
The world of experience,
the world that human beings existed.

1466
01:17:54,251 --> 01:17:59,120
It's a dynamic between chaos and order
and the function of a human being is to

1467
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:02,690
juggle those and keep the ballots.
And you can tell when you're doing now

1468
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,630
because you're awake and you were paying
attention.

1469
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,280
And not only are you healthy in who and
what you are,

1470
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,260
but you're moving towards something
better.

1471
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,890
And when that happens to you,
then you're possessed by a deep

1472
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:20,120
intimation of meaning because meaning
signifies something.

1473
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:25,010
And what it signifies is that you're in
the right place at the right time.

1474
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,420
And so you can learn to stay there by
paying attention to the balance of chaos

1475
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:33,020
and order in your life.
And the better you get at staying there,

1476
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:36,560
this is the kickoff for from the
Egyptian perspective.

1477
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:41,770
The better you get at staying there,
the more in permian impermeable you are

1478
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:46,010
to chaos and order because you can learn
to handle it.

1479
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:47,660
So you might say,
well,

1480
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,900
life presents you with a challenge with
regards to its ultimate significance,

1481
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:54,800
right?
You might say,

1482
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:57,260
well,
what's the use of human striving in the

1483
01:18:57,261 --> 01:18:59,630
face of everything that's terrible in
the world,

1484
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,840
including our own vulnerability as well?
You're not going to eliminate that,

1485
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:10,190
but it's possible that if you balance
things properly that you can learn to

1486
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:13,070
live with it.
And maybe you can even learn to

1487
01:19:13,071 --> 01:19:16,520
understand that those two,
the dynamism between those two things,

1488
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:19,520
it's actually a precondition for va and
that without it,

1489
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:24,510
there wouldn't be any big because part
of you is limited to part of you isn't.

1490
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,020
If that wasn't the case,
there wouldn't be you.

1491
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,590
So the question arises,
it's an existential question.

1492
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:35,210
What do you do with that set of facts?
And it looks like your nervous system,

1493
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:36,950
in a sense,
has already set up to answer that.

1494
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:40,490
Pay Attention.
Put yourself in a situation where you're

1495
01:19:40,491 --> 01:19:42,890
paying attention.
If you pay enough attention,

1496
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:45,950
you're right in the place that you
should be,

1497
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:49,370
that will be at least sufficient.
And maybe it be more than that.

1498
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:53,810
Maybe you'll say it's okay.
Terrible preconditions of existence are

1499
01:19:53,811 --> 01:19:56,750
justified by the manner in which it
manifests itself.

1500
01:19:57,670 --> 01:19:59,450
And that's a definition of mental
health.

1501
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:04,780
And that's implicit in all the clinical
theories that we're going to investigate

1502
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:07,310
trump the duration of the course.

1503
01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:11,230
Okay.
