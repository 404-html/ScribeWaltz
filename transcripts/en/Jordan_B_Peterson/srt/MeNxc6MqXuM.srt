1
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,660
Hey everyone,
here we go.

2
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,643
So I,
I saw somebody ask right off the bat if 

3
00:06:50,741 --> 00:06:53,800
there were any women,
I think they said girls actually,

4
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:56,480
if there are any women in the audience,
um,

5
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,200
and if there are,
well that's good.

6
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,710
So welcome.
Um,

7
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,320
thanks to all you Patriot people for 
your continued support.

8
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,560
It's a really big deal.
It's made a huge difference in,

9
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,763
you're a big part of the reason that 
Biblical lecture was so ridiculously 

10
00:07:14,891 --> 00:07:15,724
successful.
I think more than 2 million people have 

11
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:17,884
watched it so far.
So that's success by any stretch of the 

12
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,450
imagination.
So let's start with some questions here.

13
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:30,370
I've got to live chat going and um,
we also set it up so that,

14
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,050
uh,
we had,

15
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,830
we had questions taken to begin with 
without people could up vote,

16
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:40,831
which seems to be a good idea.
Let's start with one from practice cube.

17
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,780
What would be a practical approach for 
developing your shadow?

18
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,340
Well,
that's a good one.

19
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,174
Let's,
let's do a little review of union 

20
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:48,064
psychology.
The first thing is if you want to know 

21
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,670
about this,
the proper sources,

22
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:56,170
Carl Jung's collected works volume nine,
volume nine,

23
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,330
and there's two parts to volume nine a 
and be published as separate texts.

24
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:06,750
And volume nine is called archetypes of 
the collective unconscious and the other

25
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,404
one is called a ion.
But in archetypes of the collective 

26
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:15,160
unconscious,
there's a good discussion of the persona

27
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:20,161
and the shadow and the persona you could
say is a good way of thinking about it.

28
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,114
You know,
you watch all those Rom coms where 

29
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:24,934
there's always kind of a Beta male guy 
who's being real friendly and always 

30
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,104
failing miserably with women because 
basically he's lying to himself and to 

31
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,190
them.
Um,

32
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,293
he's a persona and a persona is the face
that you show to the world when you're 

33
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:44,701
trying to pretend and to convince 
yourself and others that you're,

34
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,190
I would say harmless,
but we could say a good person,

35
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,590
but a good person isn't harmless.

36
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,740
A good person is capable of,
well,

37
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,410
maybe a good person is capable of 
anything,

38
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,770
but is willing to hold that in a 
beyonce.

39
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,570
I read this interesting commentary a 
little while.

40
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:07,860
I'll go on a statement by Christ in the 
New Testament.

41
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,694
And the statement generally interpreted 
is that the meek shall inherit the 

42
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:12,804
earth.
But I was looking up the multiple 

43
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:14,904
translations of the word meek.
And Meek is actually derived from a 

44
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,970
Greek word of course.
Um,

45
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,053
because the Bible,
at least some of the original forms of 

46
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,440
the Bible were in Greek.
Um,

47
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,300
and that word didn't exactly mean meek.
It meant something like,

48
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,653
uh,

49
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,020
those who have weapons and the ability 
to use them,

50
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:38,854
but sir,
but determined to keep them sheets will 

51
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:42,184
inherit the world.
And that means that people who are 

52
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,730
capable of force,
let's say,

53
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,190
but decide not to use it,
are in the proper moral position.

54
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:55,480
And Neat.
You commented on that a fair bit too.

55
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,314
You know,
he,

56
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,400
he,
um,

57
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,233
thought of most moral morality has 
cowardice not because morality itself 

58
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,104
was cowardice,
but because most people who are cowards 

59
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,603
disguise their coward,
cowardice as morality and they claim 

60
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:14,350
that they're harmlessness,
which is actually a consequence of their

61
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:17,080
fear and inability to be harmful,
say,

62
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:21,190
or to be dangerous is actually a sign of
their moral integrity.

63
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,940
And that's a really bad idea.
So,

64
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:25,923
you know,
if you're an ax murderer but you don't 

65
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:29,890
have an ax,
that doesn't mean that your moral.

66
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,410
So now with regards to it,
so that's the persona and the persona is

67
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:36,520
the mask that you wear.

68
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,353
And that's what persona means is the 
mask that you wear to convince yourself 

69
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,250
and the world that you're not a terrible
monster.

70
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:43,870
So that when you look at yourself in the
mirror,

71
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:46,210
you don't have to run away screaming.
You know,

72
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,340
when you might think,
well that's a bit of an overstatement,

73
00:10:48,341 --> 00:10:53,341
but [inaudible] was very interested in 
phenomena such as say,

74
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:55,954
psychological,
the psychological phenomena that would 

75
00:10:58,331 --> 00:10:59,164
characterize the actions of someone who 
might be an Auschwitz camp guard for 

76
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,090
example.
And uh,

77
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,853
you know,
that's pretty monstrous form of 

78
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:07,504
behavior.
And the thing about Auschwitz camp 

79
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:10,654
guards is that there's no reason to 
assume really that they were much 

80
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:15,880
different than normal people.
Now,

81
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,710
there would have been exceptions 
obviously,

82
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,873
but,
and what that means is that perhaps you 

83
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:22,324
two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and
perhaps he would even derive some 

84
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,470
enjoyment out of it.
And you might think not,

85
00:11:26,471 --> 00:11:28,630
but you shouldn't think not so quickly.

86
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:29,883
And what that also implies is that if 
you could see what that meant when you 

87
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:34,780
looked in the mirror and looked at 
yourself,

88
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:35,614
you might run away screaming because 
you'd have a revelation of just exactly 

89
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,430
what the human being is capable of.
And that's a very unpleasant revelation.

90
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:43,264
And also one of the things that stops 
people from being enlightened because 

91
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,373
that revelation of the evil of the self 
is part of the journey to enlightenment 

92
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:51,634
and an early part.
Now the shadow be all the parts of the 

93
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,144
personality that the persona rejects.
And that might be the aggressive 

94
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,464
elements.
Certainly the case that's the case with 

95
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,920
for people who are hyper agreeable.
And now you can tell,

96
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,963
I think one of the best,
there's two pathways to the development 

97
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,530
of the shadow and they're tightly 
aligned with one another.

98
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,963
Um,
the fundamental pathway is truth and 

99
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:17,440
that's to face the bitter truth about 
yourself.

100
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
But to break that down more 
particularly,

101
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:24,010
you might think about that as the 
capacity to observe your own resentment.

102
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,000
You're going to be resentful and bitter 
in many situations because you don't get

103
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,460
what you want.
And if you watch that resentment,

104
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,400
bitterness,
clc,

105
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,253
that it produces fantasies that can be 
unbelievably dark and that can be very 

106
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:36,934
frightening.
And you might not want to admit to 

107
00:12:38,081 --> 00:12:38,914
yourself that you're actually capable of
having fantasies like that or impulses 

108
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,400
like that,
or aggressive feelings like that.

109
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,713
But the thing is is that if those 
aggressive feelings and impulses and 

110
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,270
fantasies are integrated into your 
character,

111
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,660
it's like you're opening up a dialogue 
with a part of yourself that can be very

112
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:56,494
forceful and strong and dangerous.
And it's really useful to be dangerous 

113
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:04,150
because if you can,
if you can be dangerous,

114
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,740
you often don't have to be,
and it's,

115
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,660
it's often weak people,
for example,

116
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,790
it's weak men generally speaking,
who rape,

117
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,313
you know that that's a very,
very common occurrence and that's a 

118
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,250
violent act,
but it's born out of weakness,

119
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,990
not out of strength,
that's for sure.

120
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,040
And so anyways,
you attend to your resentment honestly,

121
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:23,530
and you observe yourself and what you're
actually like.

122
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,543
You got to pay attention as if you don't
know yourself as if you might harbor 

123
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,440
hidden devils and then maybe they'll 
emerge.

124
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,274
Now you'll also felt that sort of 
embedded inside the shout at where the 

125
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:35,680
contras sexual tendencies.
And so for example,

126
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,490
sometimes you see people who are well 
developed men let's say.

127
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,413
And we can,
we can also talk about women in this 

128
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,890
regard.
Men who've integrated their shadow often

129
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,724
also develop a kind of peculiar grace 
that would be a consequence of not only 

130
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:53,420
allowing their aggressive side to step 
forward but also their,

131
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,410
their feminine and Compassionate side 
that might,

132
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,333
that they may have kept squelched 
because of embarrassment about it or 

133
00:13:59,261 --> 00:14:02,200
because they'd been harassed for being 
weak or any number of things.

134
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,363
So,
but the practical approach for 

135
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:09,241
developing your shadow I would say is to
contemplate and consider your resentment

136
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,683
and notice what it says and cause your 
resentment will also tell you what you 

137
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,410
have to say.

138
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,550
You know,
look at,

139
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,070
look at what happened to Google this 
weekend.

140
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,470
You know,
James Damore wrote that memo and you can

141
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:21,304
imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps 
even somewhat resentful at having to 

142
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:25,684
attend that diversity seminar.
And I'm really just using this as an 

143
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,414
example,
but what he did was decide that that 

144
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,080
meant that he had something that he had 
to say and then look at the consequences

145
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,480
of that man.
It's an absolutely unbelievable.

146
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,613
And so you know,
if your feet and pressed at work or 

147
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:42,430
you're oppressed in your life for or you
know,

148
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,264
or you're oppressing yourself,
then you got a notice that you're 

149
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,414
feeling oppressed,
then you have to notice that you're 

150
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:50,890
feeling resentful,
resentful and angry and bitter.

151
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:51,724
And maybe even like Cain in the story of
Cain Abel Cause Cain is sort of the 

152
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:55,604
architectural bitter man.
And then you have to decide what it is 

153
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:01,310
that you need to do in order to remove 
from yourself that bitterness.

154
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,860
And that's usually means that there's 
something that you have to say.

155
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,860
And then you have to say it because 
you're sold depends on it.

156
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,810
And not only does your soul depending on
it,

157
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:12,350
I would say the fate of the world 
depends on it because you know you might

158
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,860
be wrong and then you should be 
straightened out.

159
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,570
Maybe you're just being whiny and you 
have to talk to somebody about that.

160
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,630
But it may be that you're actually 
detecting something wrong,

161
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:21,464
some tyranny that's directed towards you
and other people and it's like your 

162
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,064
moral obligation to speak up about it.
And so many workplaces become toxic to 

163
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:29,684
use a terrible clash cliche because of 
the people in them won't speak up for 

164
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:37,010
what they actually want or they speak up
too late and then they're all twisted up

165
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:37,844
about it and,
and you know they're torturing other 

166
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,990
people because they're so unhappy and so
forth and so on.

167
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,153
So practical approach for developing new
shout of fundamentally is radical 

168
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,744
honesty.
And Young said that I know a genuine 

169
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,610
moral effort was a good substitute for 
psychotherapy.

170
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:53,830
Yeah.

171
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,870
What is my opinion on open 
relationships,

172
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,720
polyamory,
other forms of non monogamy?

173
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,883
Well,
I think that as a medium to longterm 

174
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,063
strategy,
they're completely untenable because 

175
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:07,390
human beings,
as far as I'm concerned,

176
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:09,640
are fundamentally pair bonding.
And you know,

177
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:12,730
if you're just talking about casual sex,
first of all,

178
00:16:12,731 --> 00:16:15,070
I think casual sex is a contradiction in
terms.

179
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:17,140
I don't think there's anything about sex
that's casual.

180
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:19,900
And I think that people are deceiving 
themselves badly whenever they think.

181
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:22,020
So they might like to live in a,
you know,

182
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,720
1970s playboy adolescent fantasy.
But I don't,

183
00:16:25,721 --> 00:16:28,900
I've never seen that work under any 
circumstances whatsoever.

184
00:16:28,901 --> 00:16:29,734
And I think people get hurt badly.
It's also a bad medium to longterm 

185
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,210
strategy because,
you know,

186
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,380
pair bonding is,
uh,

187
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,010
is the most stable arrangement we know 
of at least so far.

188
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,750
Well,
I won't even put it that way.

189
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,440
It's the only stable,
uh,

190
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,610
mode of being that we know for the long 
run.

191
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,400
And that's especially the case when you 
bring children into the equation.

192
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,770
So,
um,

193
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,980
I think it's delusional fundamentally.
And I think that people who are,

194
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
who believe that such things work,
I mean,

195
00:16:56,201 --> 00:16:57,034
sometimes they're open people in their 
creative and their exploratory and all 

196
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:00,094
of that and fair enough,
but often they're just unconscientious 

197
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:02,794
and they don't want to take any 
responsibility and they want to live in 

198
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:08,560
this wish fulfillment fantasy where 
everybody can have all the sex they want

199
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:09,394
all the time.
And it's always wonderful and no one 

200
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:11,800
gets hurt.
And it's like,

201
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,663
sorry,
that just doesn't work in the real 

202
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:14,950
world.
So

203
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,410
my girlfriend is quite overweight,
but I really love her.

204
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,360
Should I try to encourage her to lose 
weight?

205
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,523
Aside from personal preference,
is this likely to explode into a major 

206
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,920
issue down the road?

207
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,073
Huh.

208
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,480
I don't think that you can fool yourself
about what you're attracted to and yes,

209
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,510
it's certainly likely to develop into a 
major issue down the road.

210
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,100
Um,
it's tough,

211
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,390
you know,
uh,

212
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,700
because,
so

213
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,040
the devil's in

214
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,910
the details,
you know,

215
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:52,980
should you try to encourage her to lose 
weight?

216
00:17:52,981 --> 00:17:53,814
I guess the question is how would you do
that without disrupting the 

217
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,020
relationship?
Um,

218
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,230
okay.

219
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,570
And without knowing more about the 
details of that,

220
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:05,980
I would say that I don't know how to 
tell what to tell you to do about that.

221
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,080
I think that it's necessary to be 
truthful in a relationship period.

222
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:13,990
But I also think that you can't use the 
truth to hurt,

223
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,063
you know,
the truth is a very complicated thing 

224
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:17,014
and it's,
it's a sword and it cuts and you can't 

225
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:22,000
use it to hurt.
Now,

226
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,863
you know,
maybe you would be subtle enough to 

227
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:24,724
figure out some way that you could both 
embark on a health promoting endeavor 

228
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,970
together and that would work out.
Um,

229
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,550
but I would say,
you know,

230
00:18:33,551 --> 00:18:34,384
if you,
if you're in under stable longterm 

231
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,023
relationship with someone,
it's pretty much necessary for both of 

232
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,710
you to address all the issues that are 
making you unhappy with each other.

233
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,270
Um,
you know,

234
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:47,104
assuming there's some give and take on 
that because otherwise the relationship 

235
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,630
can easily come apart at the seams.

236
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,870
Like I would say,
my wife and I are both very hard on each

237
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,840
other about our physical appearance,
let's say.

238
00:18:58,841 --> 00:18:59,674
And I had gained a fair bit of weight 
from the time I was say 40 until the 

239
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:03,634
time I was 50 about probably because I 
was eating things that weren't good for 

240
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:06,994
me.
And I would say that was primarily 

241
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:08,524
carbohydrates.
I can tell you if you want to lose 

242
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,740
weight,
you stop eating carbohydrates,

243
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:12,640
man,
you'll lose weight.

244
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,260
Like you wouldn't believe.
Um,

245
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,020
I wouldn't necessarily recommend it 
because it has some dangerous,

246
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:19,360
but it certainly works.
But you know,

247
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,194
the,
the alternative to protect to the 

248
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:25,540
alternative is to pretend that 
everything's all right.

249
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,900
And all that means is that you're likely
to get drunk sometimes some day and have

250
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,440
an affair out of bitterness and spite in
the fact that you're no longer attracted

251
00:19:32,441 --> 00:19:33,070
to your partner.

252
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,940
So it's pretty rough.
So that's a pretty rough way of thinking

253
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,500
about things,
but life's pretty rough.

254
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:43,150
So what is the story behind the logo 
that you use in your intros?

255
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:45,740
Where did it come from?
That's,

256
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,580
that logo is called the meaning of 
music.

257
00:19:48,581 --> 00:19:49,414
And it's actually a sculpture that I 
made in 1985 that's about s five and a 

258
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,533
half feet by half,
five and a half feet and about eight 

259
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,470
inches thick.
And it's made out of foam core,

260
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,600
which is this bay.
It's a subset.

261
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,493
It's a material that's often used as a 
backing for paintings or for when you 

262
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:06,994
get them framed,
it's it's styrofoam sheet about a 

263
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,473
quarter of an inch thick with paper on 
both sides and you can cut it very 

264
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:13,174
accurately with an exacto knife.
And so what I did was make a stack of 

265
00:20:16,961 --> 00:20:17,850
those,
um,

266
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,993
uh,
those foam core sheets about 80 inches 

267
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:25,630
high and it made the thing in quarters 
and so that it would fit together on the

268
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:27,850
wall because it would have been too big 
to maneuver easily.

269
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,710
And,
um,

270
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,913
it's a very complicated image.
It's actually a three dimensional 

271
00:20:35,141 --> 00:20:36,880
representation of a,

272
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,970
it's a three dimensional representation 
of a two dimensional representation of a

273
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:49,000
four dimensional object and that four 
dimensional object you could think of as

274
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,520
it's a representation of time and space.
And I can tell you,

275
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,670
I kind of have to hint at what the 
painting means.

276
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,250
It or the sculpture,
it means the same thing.

277
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:01,300
That music means,
you know,

278
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,050
how music unfolds and then something 
else unfolds within it.

279
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:08,140
And then it unfolds again within it,
like a rose opening into the,

280
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,333
into the day,
or like a lotus flower that sort of 

281
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:12,784
comes up from the darkest steps up 
through the dark water and then blooms 

282
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,030
on the,
on the surface of the water and the sun.

283
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:20,860
And that's where the Buddha,
you know,

284
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,060
um,
what would you say?

285
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:25,150
Symbol symbolically rest.
So it can imagine that thing opening and

286
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,880
then imagine that that's what that 
painting is an image of.

287
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,180
And that's the same thing as music.
So it's a Mandela image.

288
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,450
And for young,
the Mandela was a symbol of the self and

289
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,090
the self was something that unfolds like
music,

290
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:40,060
which is actually why we like music.
And it's like the,

291
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,150
the rose,
the rose that you see,

292
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:43,791
the,
the,

293
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,210
the geometric rose that you see in stain
glass.

294
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,640
It's the same thing.
Um,

295
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,670
that's the Stain Glass Window that 
Pinocchio's reprehensible,

296
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,710
compatriot.
Um,

297
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,820
what's his name?
Lamp.

298
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:54,654
Wick breaks when he's in pleasure island
and he throws it rock to destroy the 

299
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:01,740
model home and to demolish the 
substructure of Western civilization.

300
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,574
And so I had a very intense religious 
experience at one point when I was 

301
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,390
contemplating that.
So when I drew the image to begin with,

302
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,400
I drew it in about 10 minutes,
kind of rough.

303
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,234
And then I used a straight edge to 
straighten it all open and a protractor 

304
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,550
to,
or a compass to make the curves.

305
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,800
But I drew it very quickly and I'd been 
thinking about,

306
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,930
I've been reading young a lot at that 
point,

307
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:24,160
like for,
for months,

308
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:24,994
months of intense reading.
And that image sort of popped out of me 

309
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:29,160
very,
um,

310
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,033
very suddenly.
But it took about three months to make 

311
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,464
the actual image.
And then I had only a quarter of it 

312
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,090
hanging on my wall because it was so 
big.

313
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,870
And I had finished it after about three 
months of work.

314
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:40,704
So this was back in 1985 when I was a 
graduate student and I was listening to 

315
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,510
the Jupiter symphony,
which is the piece of music that I use,

316
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,180
um,
that was used for the intro to my,

317
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,700
to my videos.
And it's a Mozart symphony.

318
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,250
And this happened,
man.

319
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,710
So this happened.
So I was really watching that,

320
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:59,140
um,
Mandela that quarter,

321
00:22:59,141 --> 00:22:59,974
Mandela,
that I had made intensely and caught 

322
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,753
listening to the music,
trying to understand what the music 

323
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,250
music was signifying,
you know,

324
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:09,850
because music has intrinsic meaning,
which is a very strange thing.

325
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,683
Now,
the part of the reason for that is that 

326
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,720
language has meaning and our language 
has a musical quality,

327
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:17,554
right?
And that's process mostly by the right 

328
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,380
hemisphere,
so that when people speak,

329
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:21,214
there's a,
there's a melody in their language and 

330
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:25,600
that carries a lot of the emotional 
import.

331
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,720
And then what musicians have done is 
figured out how to use that,

332
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,723
that,
that,

333
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,830
that musical faculty,
let's call it that,

334
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:37,831
no one semantic musical faculty to sort 
of purely denote meaning.

335
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:40,240
That's part of what music means.
And so,

336
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,060
but I was still trying to understand 
what the meaning was.

337
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:43,894
You know what,
because it's the meaning of music and I 

338
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:48,680
was trying to figure out how to 
articulate that.

339
00:23:48,681 --> 00:23:49,514
And that's partly why I made the,
the sculpture was to get a grip on it 

340
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:56,690
and to understand it in anyways,
I was really,

341
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:58,070
really concentrating hard on that.

342
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,903
Mandela and that sculpture and I had 
been working on it intensely for about 

343
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:03,381
three months,
you know,

344
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:06,020
so that's a lot of meditation on a 
single idea.

345
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,490
And I was standing in my living room and
then I had this very strange experience.

346
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,324
I,
I,

347
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,303
and I,
I can't explain this properly because 

348
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:16,400
there's no way of really describing it,
but I'll do my best.

349
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,234
So you know,
when those renaissance painting 

350
00:24:18,511 --> 00:24:20,570
sometimes you see,
well first of all,

351
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:23,240
you see great cloud,
great,

352
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,430
great sunny skies with,
with massive what?

353
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,023
Stupendous impressive bills of clouds 
and then light shining through the 

354
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,164
sunlight shining through in streams.
Sometimes that's captured very 

355
00:24:35,421 --> 00:24:40,340
beautifully by especially English later,
later artists usually that or later than

356
00:24:40,341 --> 00:24:41,174
the renaissance.
But you see it renaissance paintings 

357
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,730
too.
And you all,

358
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,770
you also see it in,
in,

359
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,783
in renaissance paintings,
especially in the earlier phase of the 

360
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:49,574
renaissance,
the sky opening up in God sort of 

361
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:52,610
peering for through the clouds.

362
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:56,030
And that's exactly what seemed to happen
to me is that I had this sense,

363
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:56,864
it was like a vision,
although I was still in my living room 

364
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,720
in Nuuk,
but inside the theater of,

365
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:03,200
of my imagination,
I could feel the,

366
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,170
the sky opening up now,
it wasn't the sky,

367
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,004
it was,
I would say the only way I can really 

368
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,274
think about it is that with was 
something like another dimension and 

369
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,070
then I can feel this force descend upon 
me,

370
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,530
which I think was something that,
you know,

371
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,510
would have been considered classically 
something like the holy ghost I suppose.

372
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,720
And it filled me with this intense sense
of,

373
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,590
of,
of,

374
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,570
of,
of Paradise.

375
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,360
A Paradise Ul.
Wow.

376
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:36,990
I don't know how to say it though.

377
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,343
Okay.

378
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,080
While it was like being in heaven for 
some,

379
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,943
some,
some brief period of time and I could 

380
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:45,824
feel myself transformed,
transmuted as a consequence of this 

381
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:49,184
experience.
And,

382
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,150
and it was as if I was in the presence 
of something that was living,

383
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:54,470
you know,
and I,

384
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,800
I suppose that was an experience of God,
if you want to put it that way.

385
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,590
Um,
that's certainly what it seemed like an,

386
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,443
and I felt that I could live that way.
I could live transfigured like that 

387
00:26:04,311 --> 00:26:06,740
permanently if I desired it.
And I thought,

388
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,783
my God,
I wouldn't be able to walk down the 

389
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:11,480
street in this sort of elevated state,
let's say.

390
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,813
I don't know how I would act.
I don't know how he would interact with 

391
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,554
people.
I don't know how people would interact 

392
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:18,410
with me.
I just don't think that I could do it.

393
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:21,560
And then I felt that whatever had 
descended,

394
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,410
it seemed that as if it was soro full in
it and it,

395
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,310
and it departed from me slowly and um,
with no,

396
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,830
like with no punitive intent.

397
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,663
And,
and I wouldn't say with any 

398
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,314
dissatisfaction,
it was as if the gift had been offered 

399
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:38,300
that I wasn't in no position to receive.
And,

400
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:39,740
uh,
I went,

401
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,603
I talked to my wife soon afterwards.
I shook for about physically for about 

402
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,290
half an hour after that,
uh,

403
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,610
experience like,
like I was shaking,

404
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,150
you know,
like,

405
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:48,983
like,
like you shake after a car accident if 

406
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:51,264
you've ever been in a car accident.
And my pupils were completely dilated 

407
00:26:53,941 --> 00:26:56,370
and I had a couple of experiences like 
that,

408
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,770
like echoes of it a couple of times 
after that.

409
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:00,330
And so anyways,
that was a very,

410
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:02,940
very powerful experience.
I've certainly never forgotten that.

411
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:04,830
And um,
well,

412
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,390
you know,
I dunno why,

413
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,040
I dunno what to think about that.
I mean,

414
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,190
God only knows what the world is really 
like,

415
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,053
that's for sure.
And I've had a variety of very strange 

416
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:16,500
experiences that have convinced me that 
we know very little about anything.

417
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,000
So,
um,

418
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,600
for those who are very creative but high
in neuroticism,

419
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:22,434
how should one work to gain emotional 
stability in order to go out into chaos 

420
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,720
to do more creative things?
That's a really good question.

421
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,853
You know what?
I learned about that by reading Ewing's 

422
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,850
works on El Camino,
weirdly enough.

423
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,820
And so back again in graduate school 
when I was writing,

424
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,654
starting to write maps and meaning and 
really tearing myself apart 

425
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:42,180
psychologically,
I'm trying to understand evil,

426
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,014
I suppose the evil of the Cold War and 
the evil of the individuals who compose 

427
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,880
Nazi Germany and Stella,
this Russia.

428
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,280
Um,
uh,

429
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,410
I,
I was reading Carl Jung because he,

430
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,273
he,
he wrote his tracks on alchemy where a 

431
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,690
lot about self transformation and he 
talked about,

432
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:58,983
uh,
it's hard to explain his works on 

433
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,254
Alchemy,
but suffice it to say that his advice 

434
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:06,450
was something like,
the advice he derived from the alchemist

435
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,523
was that if you are going to make mess 
around with very complicated and 

436
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,810
dangerous matters,
that's a good way of putting it.

437
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,240
That you should really put your life 
together.

438
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:16,074
And so I would say the right way to deal
with your neuroticism is to increase 

439
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:19,914
your conscientiousness because we also 
know that the higher your 

440
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,214
conscientiousness,
the lower year neuroticism 

441
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,150
conscientiousness does seem to keep 
neuroticism and check.

442
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:29,730
And so I would say,
and have said this to many people,

443
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,890
um,
clean your room,

444
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,150
organize your life,
like get a routine,

445
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,060
get up every day at the same time.
Go to bed at the same time.

446
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Established disciplined habits and that 
will help a lot schedule like,

447
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:46,080
and here's how to use a schedule.
Use it.

448
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,970
Use a calendar.
I use Google calendar,

449
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:50,160
but don't use it as a tyrant.
You know,

450
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,070
you want to use your,
use a calendar as if it's your,

451
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:56,550
um,
your confidant and advisor.

452
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,860
And what you want to do is use the 
calendar,

453
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,020
sit down and open the calendar and 
think,

454
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,430
okay,
well here's what I'm going to do.

455
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:07,430
I'm going to design a week of days that 
I would really like to have.

456
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,143
So what that would mean is that you 
would schedule things that you would 

457
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,540
consider meaningful and productive,
you know,

458
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:15,863
on a daily basis so that you feel that 
your life is justified by having a day 

459
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:21,294
like that.
And also to schedule enough of your 

460
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,414
responsibilities so that you make 
progress day by day instead of falling 

461
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:27,894
farther behind.
And what that'll do is it doesn't 

462
00:29:30,421 --> 00:29:33,600
directly affect your neurophysiology,
but you know,

463
00:29:33,601 --> 00:29:34,434
you're reacting as a neurotic person,
a person high in neuroticism say you 

464
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:42,220
react to uncertainty and the unexpected 
with more physiological preparedness and

465
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,130
more expenditure of energy than the 
typical person.

466
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,233
And so what you want to do is organize 
your surroundings because it's a lot 

467
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:50,044
easier to organize your surroundings at 
least to begin with than it is to do 

468
00:29:52,871 --> 00:29:55,450
radical reconstruction on your 
fundamental temperament,

469
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:57,070
which you might not be able to do at 
all.

470
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,820
So I would say discipline,
discipline.

471
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,820
And the other thing I would say for 
creative people,

472
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,713
and this is true for people in general,
but it's really important for creative 

473
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:09,520
people,
is that if you want to be creative,

474
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:11,410
which is very,
very dangerous and very,

475
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,303
very unlikely to succeed,
although absolutely necessary if you 

476
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:16,864
happened to be high in openness,
is that you should organize the rest of 

477
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:20,224
your life except for your creative 
endeavors in a pretty traditional and 

478
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,840
conservative manner.
If you can do that,

479
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:30,280
because what that does is buttress you 
against the unexpected and give you some

480
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,020
stability on many,
you know,

481
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,510
along many of the potential dimensions 
of your life.

482
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,200
And that frees you up to take larger 
risks in the creative domain.

483
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,453
Now it's hard for creative people to do 
that because they're sort of blasting 

484
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:42,341
out,
you know,

485
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,500
laterally in all directions 
simultaneously.

486
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,000
But you exhaust yourself that way and 
you also risk scattering yourself.

487
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,400
Um,
Louie waterson here at,

488
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,234
at a question,
how would you suggest someone who's a 

489
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:57,370
jack of all trades and master of none 
conduct themselves while you're probably

490
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,170
high in openness,
high in creativity.

491
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:01,600
And one of the dangers of being high and
creativity,

492
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,460
especially if you're also high in 
neuroticism,

493
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:04,294
is that it's hard for creative people to
catalyze an identity because they're 

494
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:09,610
basically pan like,
you know,

495
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:12,010
like Peter Pan or like,
or like Pan,

496
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:12,844
which means everything that God of the 
forest is the god of everything to some 

497
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:17,710
degree.
And the problem with being everything is

498
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:20,890
that you're also nothing at the same 
time because you never specialized.

499
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:25,720
And so I would say that if you're,
I think that being a jack of all trades,

500
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,554
it's pretty damn useful.
But I would also say that it's really 

501
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:29,704
necessary to buckle down and find one 
primary motive discipline and Jack or 

502
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,080
Louie.

503
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,960
If you can't figure out what you should 
do,

504
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,913
then guess,
just pick something that you think that 

505
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,800
you could hit hard and concentrate on.
You don't have to be perfect at it.

506
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:45,634
You don't even have to get it right,
but pick something rather than nothing 

507
00:31:48,521 --> 00:31:50,950
or pick something rather than all 
things.

508
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,030
And then set yourself to master that 
because you know,

509
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,300
you need to have a,
uh,

510
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,180
um,
uh,

511
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,190
discipline,
a primary discipline.

512
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:02,290
It's absolutely necessary to succeed in 
life.

513
00:32:02,291 --> 00:32:04,180
Now,
once you have a primary discipline,

514
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:05,014
then you can branch out and become a 
multiplicity in your disciplined 

515
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:09,184
approach.
And then you're absolutely bloody 

516
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:11,164
unstoppable.
But you really need that initial 

517
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:14,680
disciplinary routine.
You know,

518
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,580
this is something neat you knew,
knew very well.

519
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,240
He said,
for example,

520
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,250
I just wrote about this today,
that um,

521
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,313
it was the long unfreedom of,
of Europe subjugation to the dogmatic 

522
00:32:27,551 --> 00:32:28,384
structures of the Catholic Church that 
in noble the European mind and gave it 

523
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:36,340
the capacity to widely range that it 
eventually developed.

524
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,173
But it was that initial subjugation,
that initial voluntary slavery that 

525
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,384
produced the discipline that produced 
the spirit that can then go out and do 

526
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,240
other things.
And it's really,

527
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,900
really useful to subjugate yourself 
something to something voluntarily.

528
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,180
You know,
I think that's partly why it's useful to

529
00:32:53,181 --> 00:32:54,014
practice a religious faith because you 
subject yourself to a disciplinary 

530
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:00,020
structure that way.
And you might think,

531
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:01,700
well that's all oppressive and all of 
that.

532
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:05,210
And of course that's true,
but it also makes you disciplined.

533
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:06,740
And once you're disciplined,
like you're,

534
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,574
you're like a sharpened sword man,
like well tempered blade and then you 

535
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,500
can go out there and operate in the 
world.

536
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,510
So,
and if you haven't found your passion,

537
00:33:14,511 --> 00:33:16,790
then I would say,
well don't wait around till you find the

538
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,990
damn thing because you may never find it
is pick something and focus on it,

539
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:21,260
you know?

540
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,093
And if you move strongly and 
forthrightly towards it for a number of 

541
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,710
months at least,
or even a number of years,

542
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:30,350
and then you find,
well that wasn't the thing for you,

543
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,393
it isn't going to be a waste anyways 
because most of the time the pursuit of 

544
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:35,264
any discipline,
knowledge pays off even if it doesn't 

545
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,890
pay off in the way that you initially 
expect.

546
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,053
So Alex Burnstein said,
what is the female equivalent of the 

547
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:46,070
hero archetype?
Hmm,

548
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,510
that's a great question man.
Um,

549
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:52,580
I spent a lot of time thinking about 
this and of course the women in my class

550
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:55,970
and perhaps some of the women online to 
are irritated or,

551
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:56,923
or put off or maybe just alienated and 
perhaps properly sold by the fact that 

552
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:04,970
the archetypal hero is masculine.
Now there's complex reasons for that and

553
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:05,804
I would recommend for those who are 
actually interested in such things to 

554
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:09,704
read Eric Noi Amens the origins and 
history of consciousness and also the 

555
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,324
great mother,
which are two great works of union 

556
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:16,574
psychology.

557
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:17,750
Uh,
Camille Paglia,

558
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,240
by the way,
is a big fan of both of those books.

559
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,223
For those of you who might be interested
because Norman does the best job that I 

560
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,244
know of,
of describing why the symbolism of the 

561
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,130
hero is laid out the way it is.
Why Mother Nature,

562
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:34,220
his mother feminine and why the hero is 
masculine now,

563
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,143
now.
But here's how I've come to understand 

564
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:39,700
it and I'm going to use Christian 
symbolic language because I uh,

565
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,990
because it's,
it's the quickest,

566
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,180
it's the shortest route to this sort of 
explanation.

567
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:47,840
So I would say that in the male psyche,
the Dragon,

568
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,540
the dragon slaying hero is at the 
forefront.

569
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,760
And so that would be Christ in the 
architectural mode.

570
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,594
Because this dragon,
he defeats is the evil that that is 

571
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,240
encompassed in,
in within the figure of Satan.

572
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:03,320
So that'd be like the ultimate dragon.
And then behind that is the feminine,

573
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,970
that compassionate,
the caring.

574
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,880
And that would be embodied say in the 
Christian figure of Mary.

575
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:11,420
So you have an in both male,
in the male and female soul,

576
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:13,700
let's say you have Christ and Mary,
but in the mail,

577
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,680
Christ is foremost,
foremost,

578
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,420
that's the dragon slayer,
we'll say.

579
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,673
And Mary is the secondary character.
And although both should be very well 

580
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:23,270
developed and,
and,

581
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,104
and,
and that means that makes for a much 

582
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:26,900
better character.
And in the female,

583
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:30,920
it's the other way around is that the 
maternal slash feminine.

584
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:35,921
So let's say Mary is,
is at the forefront and Christ is in the

585
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:37,100
background,
the dragon slayers,

586
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,940
the background,
but should be well developed.

587
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,280
Um,
young felt that,

588
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,233
you know,
it was possible for men to develop the 

589
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,950
more feminine side of themselves,
especially in the last half of life,

590
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:47,784
which is also when he felt that women 
should develop the more masculine side 

591
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:50,550
of themselves.

592
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,570
And you know,
we can,

593
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,853
could debate that,
but it's a perfectly reasonable 

594
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:54,744
proposition.
Now we should note that the figure of 

595
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,890
Mary is actually,
uh,

596
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,370
is,
is actually,

597
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,970
what would you say,
a heroic figure in and of itself,

598
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:05,250
because like you can really understand 
this.

599
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:08,220
If you look at Michelangelo's Pieta.
So in that great sculpture,

600
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:12,300
you see Mary Who's holding the crucified
Christ and that's basically her son,

601
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:12,970
right?
Her,

602
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,370
her,
her son,

603
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:15,204
who's just being offered up to the world
and betrayed by his friends and broken 

604
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,590
on the cross.
In other words,

605
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:22,260
he's being subject to the worst that 
life can throw at him.

606
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,094
And the thing about Mary is that she 
knew initially when she agreed to give 

607
00:36:27,661 --> 00:36:30,450
birth to the savior of mankind,
that he would be broken.

608
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:34,680
And that's an archetypal story because 
women know in their heart of hearts that

609
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:37,860
their children are going to be broken 
and killed by the world.

610
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,770
That that's the human condition.
And so there's a car.

611
00:36:40,771 --> 00:36:44,070
And of course a woman who's a,
who's a woman who's well developed,

612
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:47,160
loves her child more than herself,
loves her job more than anyone else,

613
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,860
which is something you can't really 
understand until you've had a child.

614
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,173
But he's still willing to bring that 
child into the world knowing full well 

615
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:57,870
what his or her fate will be.
And so there's a real heroism and APP.

616
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,333
And so,
and then there's the standard here 

617
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:04,140
wisdom that a woman can undertake where 
she develops her masculine side,

618
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:06,000
which is basically what happens for 
example,

619
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:06,990
in sleeping beauty,
when,

620
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,243
when,
when sleeping beauty is awakened by the 

621
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,220
princess kiss.
You can think of that.

622
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,800
You can think of her being rescued by an
actual man.

623
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:17,400
But you can also think of that as the 
masculine part of her psyche,

624
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,563
waking up her unconscious femininity so 
that the two of them can unite and rule 

625
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:22,590
the kingdom.

626
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,380
It's perfectly reasonable interpretation
of that story.

627
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,753
And so,
and so that would be the development of 

628
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:30,490
the masculine side in,
in,

629
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:31,324
in a female that decide that stout 
stalwart and forthright and willing to 

630
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:37,180
go forth into the world and con and 
conquer uncertainty.

631
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,014
And,
and then there's the beauty and the 

632
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:41,090
beast archetype,
which I think is,

633
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,953
is in some sense the primary female 
sexual archetype and beauty and the 

634
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:47,470
beast is another kind of dragon slaying 
story.

635
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:49,770
It's more like a dragon taming story,
I suppose,

636
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,750
where the,
the woman,

637
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,300
um,
the virginal woman who's,

638
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,300
who's out for an adventure finds a 
beastly male.

639
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,450
And that's the dangerous man that I was 
talking about earlier,

640
00:38:00,451 --> 00:38:02,670
right?
The man who has the capacity say to kill

641
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:07,020
the capacity to harm the capacity for 
violence at hand,

642
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:10,320
right at hand,
and then proceeds to tame him,

643
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,490
which is a real adventure.

644
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,323
And you know,
we know that this is the case because 

645
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,210
again,
we can refer to those,

646
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:16,044
you know,
bro or those raw rom coms that are so 

647
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:18,984
popular now with the failed Beta males 
always trying to make friends with the 

648
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:22,884
girl and failing.
The girls are interested in the rough 

649
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:25,614
guys who have,
who have the capacity to also be 

650
00:38:28,231 --> 00:38:31,050
sophisticated and to be,
let's not say tamed,

651
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:35,920
but civilized into channeling their 
harsh roughness,

652
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,950
their capacity for evil,
even into productive competition.

653
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:42,004
And,
and because competition can be very 

654
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,244
productive.
And then the sharing fourth of the 

655
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,360
fruits of that competition with,
with family.

656
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:52,920
And so those are all heroic aspects of 
feminine being and,

657
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,210
and they're not to be taken lightly 
there.

658
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,750
Major life tasks and major life 
contributions,

659
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,033
you know.
And I guess another part of the heroic 

660
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,194
element of the female is the subjugation
of her own privacy with regards to her 

661
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:07,780
child.

662
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,610
Because my daughter just had a child by 
the way.

663
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:11,530
So I'm a grandfather,
so hooray for that.

664
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:14,590
And it went really nicely.
And I'm so happy about that because a,

665
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:16,600
I love my daughter and be,
I really,

666
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,420
really liked kids.
I think they're so great.

667
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,790
And so now I've got to have kid around 
again.

668
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,560
So that's great.
But I mean,

669
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,663
you know,
one of the things you notice very 

670
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,194
rapidly if you're a parent is that you 
bring someone into the world who is now 

671
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,260
more important under all circumstances 
than you are.

672
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:33,094
And there's a,
there's a heroic subjugation of 

673
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,510
selfishness that's,
that goes along with that.

674
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,510
That's characteristic.
Deeply characteristic of the property,

675
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,344
develop feminine spirit.
So what is that that you are doing to 

676
00:39:45,371 --> 00:39:46,204
avoid becoming arrogant?
You're current situation is very 

677
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:50,350
inviting for that.
Yeah,

678
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,150
well I would say a good dose of 
existential terror curia that you know,

679
00:39:55,151 --> 00:39:55,984
there's a,
there's a saying in the old testament 

680
00:39:57,491 --> 00:39:59,800
that the fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom and like,

681
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,590
first of all,
and there's some real truth in that,

682
00:40:02,591 --> 00:40:04,480
you know,
like I don't want to make a mistake.

683
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,613
And so I live in constant terror that 
I'm going to utter some damning phrase 

684
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:12,460
that's going to sync everything I've 
done.

685
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:13,294
And so I'll tell you,
if you feel that way about the 

686
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:15,694
situation,
then either probability that you're 

687
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:18,844
going to be arrogant.
It's pretty damn low and like I don't 

688
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,420
feel I have any reason to be arrogant.
You know,

689
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,523
like here's,
here's something you could do if you're 

690
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:26,860
really interested in this,
but it's really hard.

691
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:27,694
There's a paper by Carl Jung called the 
relations between the ego and 

692
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,970
nonconscious and it's an unbelievably 
brilliant paper.

693
00:40:33,971 --> 00:40:34,804
It's very difficult to understand,
but it has to do with what young called 

694
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:37,834
ego inflation.
And so imagine that as you move up a 

695
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:41,974
hierarchy of authority or competence,
we're not going to call them dominance 

696
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,380
or power hierarchies because I don't 
think that's reasonable.

697
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,090
But as you move up,
you know you're,

698
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,953
you have the,
you have the temptation of having your 

699
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:56,230
ego inflate to match your hypothetical 
position of status.

700
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,063
But what that is is in some sense the 
taking on of the archetype as if it's a 

701
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:06,550
personal triumph or a personal construct
or a per personal invention,

702
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:09,130
and you'll one very,
very strongly against that.

703
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,103
And he knew what he was talking about 
because of course you had his followers 

704
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:13,264
and was an extraordinarily powerful man 
from a spiritual and a physical 

705
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:16,594
perspective.
He was certainly no pushover and a very 

706
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:21,640
brave person and he had the temptation 
of becoming,

707
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,260
well,
a cult leader for example,

708
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:25,060
which people have accused him of being 
in,

709
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:27,640
which he certainly wasn't and he knew 
that,

710
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,170
you know,
if you,

711
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,200
if you have the privilege of in a,
in a hierarchy,

712
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,420
what that means,
if that rising is real,

713
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:39,254
is that the archetype is operating 
through you and that you can't take 

714
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,670
credit for that.
You have to,

715
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,150
you have to separate your personality in
some sense from the architect.

716
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,820
I can give you a funny example of that.
It's like,

717
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,540
and I hope that nobody takes this wrong,
but it's very comical.

718
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,210
You know how all the superheroes have an
alter ego.

719
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,290
So you can't be superman unless you're 
also Clark Kent and you can't be,

720
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,390
well,
Batman isn't such a good example because

721
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:04,820
he gets to be playboy billionaire like 
iron man,

722
00:42:04,821 --> 00:42:06,530
but Superman's better example.
You know,

723
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:10,960
he's this mild mannered in meek reporter
and without that he can't be superman.

724
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,923
It's like,
well that's the reason that's such a 

725
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,710
well established comic trope is because 
comics are deeply mythological.

726
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:22,760
And there's the idea there that the 
person has these two elements.

727
00:42:22,761 --> 00:42:26,600
One is the archetipal and it's 
associated with the infinite.

728
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:29,030
It's like the God in man.
You could say that.

729
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,323
Um,
there's a great icon by the way of 

730
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:35,690
Christ as pantokrator.
One of the very earliest icons that show

731
00:42:35,691 --> 00:42:38,960
him with two different facial halves.

732
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,853
The eyes are different and the face is 
asymmetrical and one one face is the 

733
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:44,234
face of God have faces to have face of 
God and the other is the half face of 

734
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,170
man.
And he's holding a book.

735
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:49,004
It's,
I'm having Jonathan Pashto who's a 

736
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:51,674
brilliant carver.
I'm having him carved me that image so 

737
00:42:54,711 --> 00:42:58,520
that I can put it in my front porch 
because I love it in a Christ is holding

738
00:42:58,521 --> 00:42:59,390
a book.
And so,

739
00:42:59,391 --> 00:42:59,871
you know,
it's,

740
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:00,704
it's such a beautiful image,
this idea of man as a duality between 

741
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,230
the finite and the infinite and,
and simultaneously holding forth this,

742
00:43:09,231 --> 00:43:11,240
you know,
wealth of knowledge that's been gathered

743
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:16,100
by the human race.
It's mine mind expanding visual imagery.

744
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:17,840
Anyways,
I mean,

745
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,840
back to the arrogance issue is that,
you know,

746
00:43:20,841 --> 00:43:24,920
I'm,
I'm so Kara co I'm so what would you say

747
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,173
attuned to the fact that I'm barely 
staying on that line between chaos and 

748
00:43:29,751 --> 00:43:30,584
order and that any foolishness on my 
part or any attempt to manipulate the 

749
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:37,250
situation for my own,
let's say selfish,

750
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,630
personal gain,
you know,

751
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:40,920
that sort of impulsive,
um,

752
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:44,290
and,
and shallow and immature and,

753
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,540
and,
and shortsighted personal gain that,

754
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,433
that,
that willingness or wished to Lord it 

755
00:43:50,001 --> 00:43:52,910
over other people or to feel in some 
sense superior man.

756
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,760
If I go there with the exposure that 
I've got right now,

757
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:57,800
I'd be so fast that it wouldn't even be 
funny.

758
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,080
And that would not be pretty and I would
not want that.

759
00:44:00,081 --> 00:44:00,914
So I'm,
I'm doing my best man to keep myself on 

760
00:44:04,101 --> 00:44:04,934
the ground and whereas where I want to 
be and I've got my family to help me 

761
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:10,400
without and I've got my friends who are 
offering me,

762
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,160
you know,
corrective criticism on an ongoing basis

763
00:44:13,161 --> 00:44:13,994
and I listened to the negative comments 
on eat on youtube and I try to pay 

764
00:44:16,461 --> 00:44:19,550
attention to them and evaluate them and 
not just dismiss them out of hand.

765
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,953
You know,
if their crude or crass or any of those 

766
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:24,590
things,
then I'm less likely to pay attention to

767
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:25,490
them.
But you know,

768
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,280
even when I'm called far right,
I pay attention to that.

769
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:29,114
You know,
because well you got to listen to your 

770
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:31,860
enemy.

771
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,840
That's the thing.
That's another new testament.

772
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:34,674
In junction you should listen to your 
enemy because your enemy will tell you 

773
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:39,150
things about yourself that no one else 
will tell you.

774
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,160
Now,
some of those things might not be true,

775
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,053
but some of the might be.
And if your enemy tells you something 

776
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:45,750
terrible about yourself,
that's true,

777
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,820
then he's immediately become your best 
friend.

778
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:48,654
Because you bloody well want to know if 
there's something terrible about you so 

779
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,044
that you can get it rectified before it 
ruins your life and ruins your family's 

780
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,124
life and you know,
detrimentally affects the course of the 

781
00:44:58,831 --> 00:45:00,270
world and all of that.
So,

782
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:01,643
um,
in one of your lectures you said the 

783
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:05,610
film frozen was garbage.
I don't think I said garbage.

784
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,480
I think I said reprehensible propaganda,
which I believe it was.

785
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,760
Can you elaborate on your thoughts on 
the film?

786
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,850
I can't because I haven't seen it 
recently enough to,

787
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,033
um,
the only thing I can say is that I left 

788
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:18,144
the film with a strong sense that it was
produced for ideological reasons and it 

789
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:23,970
was produced as a sort of anti sleeping 
beauty.

790
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:24,803
And I felt that was entirely 
inappropriate because it wasn't a 

791
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:30,360
genuine artistic attempt.
It was an ideological statement.

792
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,750
I actually really liked [inaudible] I 
hope I'm pronouncing that properly.

793
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:35,640
I thought it was that.
I liked that,

794
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,503
you know,
that little girl in the movie allied 

795
00:45:37,711 --> 00:45:38,544
herself with is very,
very powerful but rather uncivilized 

796
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:42,024
masculine force.
And I thought they got the archetypal 

797
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,200
balance in that film really quite,
really quite nicely.

798
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:48,200
So I thought it was quite beautifully 
done.

799
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,710
So I liked Marianna quite a bit.
What were you like when I was 25?

800
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,740
Hmm,
well,

801
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,950
I was obsessed.
I'm 25,

802
00:45:58,951 --> 00:45:59,784
so that would have been 87.
I'd been in graduate school for two 

803
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,240
years.
Well,

804
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:04,973
you know,
um,

805
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:10,050
when I was 25 or so,
I probably weighed about 138 pounds.

806
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,080
I smoked like a pack of cigarettes day.
I drank tremendous amount of alcohol.

807
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:16,554
I was from northern Alberta,
this rough little town up in northern 

808
00:46:18,571 --> 00:46:19,610
Alberta called fairview.

809
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,453
And you know,
there were long winters there and my 

810
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:22,554
friends were heavy drinkers and most of 
them dropped out of school by the time 

811
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:27,690
they were 15 or 16.
Went off to work on the oil rigs.

812
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:31,260
And you know,
it was a rough town and we drank a lot.

813
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,810
And I started when I was 14.
And you know,

814
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,080
um,
and so I was,

815
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,000
I had a lot of bad habits,
let's say,

816
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:39,834
and,
uh,

817
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,600
things that were,
and I wasn't in great shape physically,

818
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,100
and I was also still intellectually 
obsessed by as I am now.

819
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,413
And,
uh,

820
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,660
so that would've been,
that would've been an 85,

821
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,870
but when I,
but I decided around that about 85,

822
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,570
84 or something like that,
maybe a little earlier that I was really

823
00:46:57,571 --> 00:46:59,910
going to try to get my act together.
And,

824
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,160
uh,
so I started doing that.

825
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:02,880
I,
you know,

826
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,713
I,
first of all,

827
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,520
I quit smoking.

828
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:06,653
Oh,
that took a long time because I 

829
00:47:07,141 --> 00:47:09,750
eventually had to quit drinking too in 
order to quit smoking.

830
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:13,110
And I started working out,
started playing sports,

831
00:47:13,111 --> 00:47:14,850
which I'd never done.
I was a small kid.

832
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:17,190
I been skipped a grade and I was a 
small,

833
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,380
small for my age.
So sports were never,

834
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:23,130
especially team sports were never really
a domain of expertise for me.

835
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,373
Um,
although I skied and went trapping with 

836
00:47:25,831 --> 00:47:26,664
my dad,
went,

837
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,200
you know,
cross country skiing and camping and all

838
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:30,034
that.
So,

839
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,030
but,
uh,

840
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,080
when I went to graduate school,
I started swimming the first,

841
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,790
the first,
uh,

842
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:42,760
physical exercise routine I did,
I enrolled in a swim suicides course,

843
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:43,594
I think it was called.
So it was me and this like really 

844
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:47,920
overweight kid and like these 60 year 
old women and men,

845
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:48,754
they could out exercise me like mad.
It was really embarrassing me in the 

846
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,630
overweight kid,
you know,

847
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,464
we'd be just panting ourselves three 
quarters to death at the end of the 

848
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:56,733
bloody workout in these 60 year old 
women who weren't in great shape or 

849
00:47:59,351 --> 00:47:59,861
like,
you know,

850
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:03,580
chatting away as if nothing was going on
at all in the pool.

851
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,140
So that was quite embarrassing.
And as was going to the weight room,

852
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,273
you know,
because when I started I could barely 

853
00:48:10,151 --> 00:48:14,170
best bench press 75 pounds and people 
used to keep coming over and helping me,

854
00:48:14,171 --> 00:48:17,070
which was last thing I bloody well 
wanted but certainly needed.

855
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:20,380
And I got to the point where I could 
bench press 225 pounds.

856
00:48:20,381 --> 00:48:21,214
I think that was the best I did.
And I gained about 30 pounds of muscle 

857
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,140
in a year and a half.
So that was good thing.

858
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,960
So like I was kind of a wild man and you
know,

859
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:31,090
I'm a little bit manic in my,
in my,

860
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:32,620
uh,
temperament and so,

861
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,473
you know,
I was,

862
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,550
I was kind of going every direction at 
the same time,

863
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:38,620
so,
and uh,

864
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:39,903
you know,
I don't regret that I had a fine time 

865
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:45,700
when I was a kid and uh,
I needed really to get disciplined and I

866
00:48:45,701 --> 00:48:49,420
had to do it because I was working on 
these hard problems that,

867
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,523
you know,
that I've been discussing with all of 

868
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:53,230
you and I've been working on them 
really,

869
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,363
you know,
obsessively since I was probably about 

870
00:48:57,071 --> 00:48:58,680
18,
maybe even earlier than that.

871
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,973
Got to the point around 25 when I was in
graduate school trying to get my Phd's 

872
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,430
doing all my research.
Like I published 15 papers by the time I

873
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,413
graduated with my phd,
which was by I think by a fairly large 

874
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:11,134
measure,
the most papers that any graduate 

875
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:14,410
student at that time it ever published 
at mcgill.

876
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:15,363
I think that's right.
Might have been twice as many or maybe 

877
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,120
twice as many,
maybe even three times as many.

878
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,280
And at the same time I wrote maps of 
meaning,

879
00:49:21,281 --> 00:49:23,110
which was a terrible,
terrible,

880
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,333
terribly difficult thing to do cause I 
was writing about three hours a day 

881
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:31,480
doing that and I couldn't do all that 
and continue with my misbehavior.

882
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:33,490
You know,
my sort of my,

883
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,960
what would you say?
My,

884
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,420
my,
my hedonistic,

885
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:41,710
my hedonistic
ma,

886
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,340
my massive hedonistic consumption of 
alcohol and all of that.

887
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:46,174
I just couldn't keep it up and also work
seriously on the issues that were at 

888
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:49,180
hand.

889
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,220
So you know,
I had to stop.

890
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,140
That's a sacrifice I had to stop messing
about and straight myself out.

891
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:59,470
And I,
I got married when my,

892
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,920
the woman who is my wife Tammy,
who I've known since she was eight years

893
00:50:02,921 --> 00:50:03,754
old,
she lived across the street from me and 

894
00:50:04,381 --> 00:50:07,540
this little town called fairview and I 
was in love with her like the first time

895
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,490
I saw her,
which is quite bloody thing.

896
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:10,623
So that's worked out pretty well for me.
But she came to live with me about the 

897
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:15,010
same time.
And,

898
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:15,844
you know,
we decided jointly to get our act 

899
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,270
together and we swore that we tell each 
other the truth,

900
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:21,370
which I think she's actually done better
than me.

901
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:22,204
Like I don't think,
I don't think she's lied to me ever in 

902
00:50:24,551 --> 00:50:26,800
our entire marriage,
which is unbelievable.

903
00:50:26,801 --> 00:50:29,420
You know,
it's been so useful because I can really

904
00:50:29,421 --> 00:50:31,970
tell her things that we can really talk.
So I tell you,

905
00:50:31,971 --> 00:50:33,590
if you want to have a good relationship,
man,

906
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:34,723
you embedded in the truth.
Because if you don't embed it in the 

907
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,880
truth,
you don't have a relationship.

908
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,110
It's,
it's just lies.

909
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:41,090
It's,
it's a tissue of lies and it will,

910
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,050
it will dissolve in the chaos as soon as
a crisis comes along.

911
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,450
So the truth is a terrible thing,
but not,

912
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,730
not compared to false hood.
So,

913
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,640
all right.
So let's look at the live chat here.

914
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,623
MMM.

915
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:09,823
Please get a better quality microphone.
While I'm really hoping that the 

916
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:15,260
microphone that I'm using right now is 
working well,

917
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,850
um,
it should be,

918
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:18,680
it's a really good microphone.
It's a,

919
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:19,514
it's,
um,

920
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,620
um,
what do you call on a road?

921
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,160
And I thought I was using it for quite a
while there,

922
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:29,840
but I'd reorganized my office and I 
actually had unplugged the road.

923
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:30,674
And so my voice was unwittingly,
unbeknownst to me coming through this 

924
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:34,850
little,
um,

925
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:35,953
large tech,
high def micro or a video camera that I 

926
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:42,320
have on top of my speakers.
And it might even be doing that for now.

927
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,390
Right now as you know,
for all I know,

928
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:46,400
I hope not.
No,

929
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:49,910
it says the microphone is road in team n
t u s B.

930
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,313
So,
um,

931
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,700
maybe God,
I hope so.

932
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,200
Anyways.
You know,

933
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,063
I've been mastering a lot of technical 
equipment in the last year and so I've 

934
00:52:02,091 --> 00:52:02,924
got most of it under control,
but I don't know if I have all of it 

935
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:07,760
under control.
So some fan,

936
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:10,040
and I wish I remembered his name because
he deserves it.

937
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:13,150
Sent me this microphone.
So Hooray for him and hopefully I'm,

938
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,920
I'm going to get access to it.
So,

939
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:17,960
um,
let's see here.

940
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,123
I'm 20.
My parents had made it clear they don't 

941
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,910
want me to leave home.
They are both drug addicted,

942
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,800
depressed and antisocial.
How do I leave without killing?

943
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:38,630
The only positive relationship they 
have.

944
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,450
Well I think you'll have to ask yourself
a different question.

945
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:46,760
I think you might have to ask yourself 
the question of how do you maintain that

946
00:52:46,761 --> 00:52:50,600
positive relationship into the future if
you don't leave and have your own life.

947
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:51,913
You know,
cause you have to be thinking over five 

948
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,370
year periods here or even decades.
And first of all,

949
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:56,204
you deserve to have your own life.
Like your parents should be fostering 

950
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:00,614
your independence.
It's their moral duty to foster your 

951
00:53:02,391 --> 00:53:03,224
independence.
Now hopefully they can do that in a way 

952
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:05,623
that makes you strong and that makes you
better able to have a relationship with 

953
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,210
them.
But they have no right to use their,

954
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,980
their,
their dependence,

955
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,814
let's say as an,
as an impediment to you becoming 

956
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:19,100
independent drug,
addicted,

957
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,810
antidepressant and anti antisocial.

958
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:22,550
Despite all of that,
they should be saying,

959
00:53:22,551 --> 00:53:25,230
you get the hell away from us as fast as
you can and you get out there and have a

960
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:27,150
life.
And if you can put yourself together and

961
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:30,150
we get to see you from time to time,
wouldn't that be a wonderful thing?

962
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,700
So you know,
you,

963
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,820
you,
you don't get in your children's way,

964
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,580
you don't get in your children's way.
So,

965
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,050
um,
I would say,

966
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,800
and I can't give you advice because I 
don't know you and the devil's always in

967
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:44,634
the details,
but I can say generally that you won't 

968
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,144
be able to maintain a positive 
relationship with your parents if you 

969
00:53:49,861 --> 00:53:52,440
do.
So at the cost of your own destiny.

970
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,420
Let's say that that isn't going to work 
out.

971
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,330
So when no one has the right to deprive 
you of that destiny,

972
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,460
family or not,
man,

973
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:00,363
you're to operate out there in the world
like an independent soul and to make 

974
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:05,064
your way through the world and to offer 
what you have to offer and those who 

975
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:08,124
love you should be behind you and 
encouraging you to do that in every 

976
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:13,020
possible way.
And if they aren't,

977
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:16,050
then you have to seriously think about 
whether or not a,

978
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:18,690
whether or not they have your best 
interest in mind and B,

979
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,673
whether or not it might be better for 
you and for them if you went and did 

980
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,980
what you needed to do anyways.
So I would say that.

981
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,413
So.

982
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,240
Okay.

983
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,450
Do you have in mind a more specific 
breakdown of the social sciences?

984
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,210
I presume you mean in relationship to 
the postmodern,

985
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,223
neo,
Marxist and have taken over so much of 

986
00:54:37,491 --> 00:54:38,324
the university?
I would say philosophy seems to be in 

987
00:54:40,371 --> 00:54:41,930
pretty good shape,
strangely enough.

988
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,470
It isn't exactly clear why.
Um,

989
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,523
that's mostly my impression.
I would say that in the rest of the 

990
00:54:48,021 --> 00:54:48,854
university,
if the discipline has at least one foot 

991
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:53,540
in science,
then it's relatively safe.

992
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:54,374
And so I would say psychology is 
relatively safe discipline because it's 

993
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:57,824
quite nicely constrained by the 
necessity of taking biology into 

994
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:03,110
account.
That's less true with social psychology.

995
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,183
But it's certainly true with clinical 
psychology and it's even more true with 

996
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:09,420
neuroscience and the animal behavioral 
side of things and stay,

997
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,510
well statistics,
statistics isn't science,

998
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:13,790
but at least it's a rigorous methodology
methodologically.

999
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:18,500
If the discipline is very heavy,
heavily theoretically theory dependent,

1000
00:55:18,501 --> 00:55:20,960
like say sociology or let's say women's 
studies,

1001
00:55:20,961 --> 00:55:22,760
which I have virtually no respect for.

1002
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:24,063
Um,
not that that's really relevant because 

1003
00:55:26,241 --> 00:55:28,100
whether or not I respect it isn't the 
issue.

1004
00:55:28,101 --> 00:55:30,950
The issue is whether or not it actually 
is a high quality discipline.

1005
00:55:30,951 --> 00:55:33,110
And I don't believe it's a high quality 
discipline at all.

1006
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,040
I would also say though,
if you're,

1007
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:35,893
and I'm going to make a video about this
in the next couple of weeks and advice 

1008
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,850
to university students when I launched 
that website,

1009
00:55:40,851 --> 00:55:45,440
had been talking about that helps.
It'll help people identify their courses

1010
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:46,274
as postmodern slash neo Marxist so that 
they can either take them if they want 

1011
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:52,850
to be indoctrinated or avoid them if 
they want to actually have an education.

1012
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,930
I would say it's your responsibility,
you know,

1013
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:01,970
um,
it's your responsibility to get educated

1014
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:05,840
at university and sort of,
despite the university we could,

1015
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:07,610
we could say that,
um,

1016
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:11,710
you,
there are great books.

1017
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,573
You can find out what they are and you 
can read them and you know what the 

1018
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:17,280
university does.
And Society is our,

1019
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:19,900
for you and identity for four years,
you're a student,

1020
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:23,050
you're a university student.
And so that's a credible identity.

1021
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,300
It offers you a lot of freedom.
And so you might say,

1022
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:29,380
you might have to get educated despite 
your courses and you know,

1023
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:30,243
you think,
well that's a bad deal because the 

1024
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:32,950
courses should be educating you.
It's like,

1025
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:33,784
well,
you got to look at it from a more 

1026
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:36,004
realistic perspective.
You can't expect the university to be a 

1027
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:38,824
perfect institution any more than you're
a perfect person and at least it offers 

1028
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:43,594
you an identity to shield yourself with 
while you're undergoing the difficult 

1029
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,740
process of educating yourself.
And so I would say,

1030
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,630
um,
you know,

1031
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,093
uh,

1032
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,033
take responsibility for education.
Find professors that you respect and 

1033
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:03,080
who's who and who,
who,

1034
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,530
who,
who challenge you.

1035
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,673
And,
and don't,

1036
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,710
don't fall prey to the,
to the,

1037
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:10,580
to the cynical attitude that,
you know,

1038
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,420
you take the course for the grade or 
that you should write what the professor

1039
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:14,171
wants to hear.
I mean,

1040
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:17,590
you have to be a real corrupt professor 
before you'll mark a student for,

1041
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:20,110
for producing an opinion contrary to 
yours.

1042
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,160
That's high quality.
I mean,

1043
00:57:21,161 --> 00:57:25,600
even the more corrupt professors even in
the more corrupt disciplines I think are

1044
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,240
fairly rarely guilty of that sort of 
thing.

1045
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,433
So,
um,

1046
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:34,270
anyways,
if it's grounded in science,

1047
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:35,110
it's more likely to be

1048
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,190
b,
a

1049
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:39,820
reliable,
that's the first thing to do.

1050
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:40,683
But the second thing is,
and the second thing is to know what's 

1051
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:43,504
your responsibility to get educated.
And the libraries are full of great 

1052
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:46,684
books.
You can figure out what the great books 

1053
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:47,981
are.
You know,

1054
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:50,350
in half an hour you could make list of 
50 great books.

1055
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,320
I have one on my website.
You can read all those,

1056
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,154
you know,
that takes about two years probably to 

1057
00:57:55,241 --> 00:57:58,390
really do a proper job of it.
We read the great classics,

1058
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,850
Scientific and Literary,
historical,

1059
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:01,684
all of that.
You'll get educated and then you'll be 

1060
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:08,110
sharp and coherent and articulate and 
powerful and able to formulate arguments

1061
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:12,340
and able to negotiate and able to 
formulate problems and solve them.

1062
00:58:12,341 --> 00:58:13,174
And you know,
that's exactly what you should be doing 

1063
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,510
when you get educated and it has 
tremendous,

1064
00:58:16,511 --> 00:58:17,344
tremendous economic value.
And that includes education in the 

1065
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,190
humanities.
So,

1066
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,720
all right.
Did I fail any classes in university?

1067
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:28,780
I had to retake stats.
I wasn't good at stats.

1068
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:30,850
I got it eventually.
Um,

1069
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:32,320
I needed to know,

1070
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,710
well,
I'm no mathematical genius,

1071
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:38,620
we can start with that.
But I also needed to know,

1072
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:40,480
I couldn't take the assumptions on 
faith,

1073
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:45,280
which was really quite problematic.
And so I couldn't just memorize,

1074
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:47,560
you know,
I had to understand and that didn't work

1075
00:58:47,561 --> 00:58:50,650
out so well for stats analysis.
It didn't understand at that time that I

1076
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:52,540
had to keep up with it sort of 
rigorously.

1077
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,670
But I got to be a pretty decent 
statistician.

1078
00:58:54,671 --> 00:58:56,440
At least I understand the statistics 
now.

1079
00:58:56,441 --> 00:58:58,450
So yeah,
I didn't do very well in statistics,

1080
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,284
but most of my grades otherwise were 
they in my grades in high school except 

1081
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:04,114
for grade 10,
when I bet my dad that I could get a 

1082
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:06,941
straight eighties.
And I think God,

1083
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:08,550
exactly that,
um,

1084
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,393
my grades in junior high and high school
are pretty dismal because I absolutely 

1085
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:14,980
detested school.
Partly for my own reasons,

1086
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:16,270
you know,
because of my own problems,

1087
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:17,104
but an immaturity.
But also because I found it painfully 

1088
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:22,730
unchallenging

1089
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,170
let's say.
Um,

1090
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,000
but in university,
college and university,

1091
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:26,834
I got very good grades and which was a 
good thing because I would have never 

1092
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,920
got into clinical graduate school 
without that.

1093
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:34,280
So yeah,
to 25 pounds isn't bad.

1094
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,750
Yeah.
Well I only weighed one 60,

1095
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:37,040
so you know,
it was pretty good.

1096
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:40,310
I thought it was funny because it was 
only one day I was able to manage that.

1097
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:43,070
I could do 200 with fair bit of 
regularity and a bench press.

1098
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:43,904
But one day man,
I did two oh five and that worked and I 

1099
00:59:46,671 --> 00:59:47,504
did two 10 in that worked and I got all 
the way to two 25 and I was never able 

1100
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,610
to duplicate it again.
So that was pretty interesting.

1101
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,953
So jared,
chance as you claim hierarchies are 

1102
00:59:57,171 --> 01:00:01,250
efficient enough yet you claim 99% of 
creative people get stuck at the bottom.

1103
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:02,810
Oh yeah.

1104
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,870
Well that's not a contradiction.
Um,

1105
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,990
what kind of propels you up?
Hierarchies of authority is intelligence

1106
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:10,310
and conscientiousness.
Right?

1107
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,960
And so then you might say,
well,

1108
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:14,720
what about creativity?
And it looks like creativity.

1109
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:16,670
Creativity is,
as you sort of know,

1110
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:19,930
is an out of the box phenomena.
And the problem is,

1111
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:20,764
is that if you're within a hierarchy,
there's a ladder upward that you can 

1112
01:00:24,111 --> 01:00:24,944
climb rung by rung.
And basically to do that you have to do 

1113
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:28,700
your damn job.
Now.

1114
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,140
Now you might say,
yeah,

1115
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:31,430
well isn't creativity,
you know,

1116
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,470
necessary.
And the answer to that is absolutely,

1117
01:00:33,471 --> 01:00:36,830
but it's not that useful when you're at 
the bottom because who the hell wants to

1118
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,350
hear your damn creative ideas when 
you're just starting out?

1119
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,080
You know you're just a pain in the neck 
even if you're right,

1120
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,200
even if you're brilliant,
you're just a pain in the neck if you're

1121
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:48,410
creative at the bottom because you come 
up with all these radical ideas that are

1122
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,350
going to shape out,
shake up the structure of the hierarchy,

1123
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:52,423
and plus you haven't what indicated your
credibility of demonstrated your 

1124
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:57,200
credibility to any great degree.

1125
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,230
So people are going to just write you 
off as a,

1126
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,573
they'll just going to write you off 
because it's easier than taking you 

1127
01:01:02,901 --> 01:01:03,950
seriously.
Now,

1128
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:07,040
the funny thing is,
is that as you climb up the hierarchy,

1129
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:08,203
creativity becomes increasingly 
necessary until when you're at the very 

1130
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:12,470
top,
it's absolutely vital.

1131
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:15,380
And many,
many companies suffer from the fact that

1132
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:16,670
they,
um,

1133
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,313
would you say promote conscientious 
people continually up the ladder and 

1134
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,200
then they end up at the top with no 
creative people.

1135
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,093
But it's hard for the creative people to
climb to the top because creativity 

1136
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:31,850
isn't one of those things that ratchets 
you up a hierarchy of competence.

1137
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:32,893
So,
so there are efficient on the 

1138
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:34,904
conscientious end and efficient on the 
intelligent and but creativity is a 

1139
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:39,134
whole different thing.
I mean partly because how the hell do 

1140
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:44,990
you evaluate a creative person?
You can't by definition,

1141
01:01:44,991 --> 01:01:45,824
because to have a structure of 
devaluation means that something has to 

1142
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,440
be done in a tried and true and 
measurable manner.

1143
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,290
And that is what a creative person does.
He like,

1144
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,950
they make a left turn,
you know,

1145
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,690
90 degree turn and they say,
well,

1146
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,520
I'm going to do it completely 
differently.

1147
01:01:58,521 --> 01:01:59,910
It's like,
well how are you?

1148
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,793
How is someone going to evaluate you if 
you do that now you might be right and 

1149
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:04,783
you know,
creative people are often wrong but 

1150
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:09,680
sometimes and vitally dead right when no
one else's.

1151
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:12,290
But it's a really,
it's really problematic.

1152
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,000
I mean,
if you're a creative person,

1153
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:14,834
you're your best bet I would say is to 
discipline yourself and ground yourself 

1154
01:02:18,231 --> 01:02:19,064
in something relatively practical that 
will enable you to eek out some sort of 

1155
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:23,244
living.
And then to practice your creative 

1156
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:27,000
endeavor on the side,
you can head,

1157
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:27,853
ha ha,
you can head to head long into it and 

1158
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:31,050
try to make money and be creative at the
same time.

1159
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,100
But I'll tell you,
man,

1160
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:32,943
my experience has taught me,
and this is a lot of experience and a 

1161
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,320
lot of watching and it's not something 
I'm happy to say,

1162
01:02:37,321 --> 01:02:39,060
is that it's very,
very,

1163
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:39,894
very,
very difficult for creative people to 

1164
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:42,420
monetize their creativity.

1165
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,180
And most of the time it's an exercise in
futility.

1166
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,313
So what you have to do is stabilize 
yourself in some sort of productive and 

1167
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:51,720
traditional domain.
And then,

1168
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,793
you know,
use your extra time to work creatively 

1169
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:56,670
and see if you can branch out that way.
You know,

1170
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,560
you can always try to start a small 
business to,

1171
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:00,450
or even a big business.
But again,

1172
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:02,640
not some,
that's a high risk,

1173
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:04,320
high return proposition.
And Yeah,

1174
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,990
actually there's a technology that goes 
along with that too.

1175
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,760
You can't do that like a fool,
you know,

1176
01:03:08,761 --> 01:03:10,800
you have to know what you're doing in 
order to do that.

1177
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:12,060
So,
um,

1178
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:18,210
what evil daddy will enslave the human 
race come the eclipse.

1179
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,313
I think that's probably the god Keck.
That would be my guess as far as I'd 

1180
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:23,280
been able to tell us.
So forth.

1181
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,413
Could you please tell the difference 
between equity and equality and why is 

1182
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:27,750
equity dangerous?

1183
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,880
Well,
it's not actually equity and equality.

1184
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:32,730
It's equity and equality of opportunity.
Well,

1185
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,460
you know,
it's a truism,

1186
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:38,790
I think that's agreed upon by liberals 
and conservatives alike,

1187
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:39,923
that the interests of individuals and 
society are best served by opening the 

1188
01:03:44,071 --> 01:03:49,071
door to the participation of all who are
qualified regardless of their,

1189
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,273
uh,
of attributes in domains that have 

1190
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:54,060
nothing to do with the qualifications 
for the position.

1191
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:57,030
So imagine that as a worker,
um,

1192
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,370
and that would include managers,
executives,

1193
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:00,780
et Cetera.
As a worker,

1194
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:04,200
you have a function like a tool.
You're a tool.

1195
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:05,243
And,
and I wouldn't,

1196
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,610
you know,
I wouldn't be too down on that.

1197
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:11,920
It's good to be good for something.
And um,

1198
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:14,123
we W W it's in society's best interest 
that those who are able to be the most 

1199
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:20,280
efficient tools are the ones that are 
placed in the position.

1200
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:24,510
And so you want to open up the 
competitive landscape to all players,

1201
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,553
not least so that society can most 
effectively exploit the people who are 

1202
01:04:28,831 --> 01:04:29,610
most productive.

1203
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:30,443
Now it also has the side benefit of 
allowing individuals to utilize their 

1204
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:35,460
talents and to take their place in the 
social world.

1205
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,180
But people are very diverse in their 
abilities,

1206
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:42,570
like incredibly diverse in their 
abilities and that's mostly evidence for

1207
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:44,310
example,
in the domain of intelligence,

1208
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:46,020
you know,
because while the,

1209
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:46,963
the,
the range that includes the majority of 

1210
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,260
people runs from an Iq of about 85 or 
let's say 72,

1211
01:04:52,261 --> 01:04:53,094
an Iq of 130,
although there's plenty of people who 

1212
01:04:55,051 --> 01:05:00,000
are outside those domains is like at 70,
you're pretty intellectually impaired,

1213
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:00,834
right?
You're not going to graduate from high 

1214
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,430
school with an Iq of 70,
except under very,

1215
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,160
very extreme circumstances with an Iq of
83,

1216
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:12,150
which is about 10% of the population,
85 is 15%.

1217
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,770
You're going to have a hard time reading
well enough to follow instructions it on

1218
01:05:16,771 --> 01:05:18,250
with an Iq of 115.

1219
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,790
You're going to do pretty well at uh,
uh,

1220
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,693
sort of mid level community college.
And so an Iq of 145 is going to prepare 

1221
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:27,430
you for like high success and complex 
domain,

1222
01:05:27,431 --> 01:05:28,264
say like law or,
or managerial positions where the 

1223
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:32,980
environment is transforming very 
radically.

1224
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:38,190
There is immense differences between 
people in their cognitive ability and so

1225
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:39,483
and in their conscientiousness and in 
their negative emotionality and all and 

1226
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:43,954
in their energy levels and oh and in 
their creativity and all sorts of 

1227
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:48,450
traits.
And because of that,

1228
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:49,433
that individual diversity,
there's no reason to assume that there 

1229
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:56,200
is going to be equality of outcome.
And that's what equity is.

1230
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:58,660
I've got to change the battery in my 
camera

1231
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:37,730
and we're back.

1232
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:51,230
Apologies for that.
With this Dlsr Dslr,

1233
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,240
whichever it is.
Um,

1234
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,060
there's some,
I won't go into it.

1235
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,870
I have to change the battery boat about 
after about an hour or so.

1236
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,120
Anyways,
back to intelligence.

1237
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:04,250
Um,
what was I saying?

1238
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,800
Talking about individual differences and
the differences.

1239
01:07:16,801 --> 01:07:18,840
Differences in intelligence.
Oh yeah.

1240
01:07:18,841 --> 01:07:20,700
Equality of outcome.
Well,

1241
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:26,430
the only way,
given the wide range of human capacity,

1242
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:27,783
mmm.

1243
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,790
First step for you don't want to,
uh,

1244
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:33,830
organize your society

1245
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:37,213
such that every single category of 
outcome has exactly proportional 

1246
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:44,780
representation from every single 
possible category of person.

1247
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,093
Because that isn't you.
You have to use so much social force in 

1248
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:53,540
order to make that occur.
That the consequences,

1249
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,090
the negative consequences will far 
outweigh the benefits.

1250
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,073
It's better to open up the marketplace 
to allow a very large range of 

1251
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:05,951
hierarchies to emerge.
And then to let people compete for their

1252
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,890
position to compete and cooperate for 
their own positions.

1253
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:13,400
And the other problem with equity is 
like who the hell is going to make the,

1254
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,010
who's going to decide which groups are 
to be categorized?

1255
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:18,110
You want to,
here's an example for you.

1256
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,990
Let's imagine you stratify the 
population by Iq,

1257
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,460
which,
which we do by the way.

1258
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:25,280
Although,
although we don't do it as evidently and

1259
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:29,090
obviously as we do say,
buy sex or perhaps even by race,

1260
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:30,563
are you,
would you actually recommend that an 

1261
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:36,290
equal number of people be drawn from 
every category of Iq to be surgeons?

1262
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,150
I mean,
that's palpably absurd.

1263
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,313
So there's too much social engineering 
required to produce equity of outcome 

1264
01:08:43,581 --> 01:08:44,211
now,
well,

1265
01:08:44,211 --> 01:08:46,520
having said that as well,
um,

1266
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:47,791
the,
the,

1267
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:50,630
the historical data on equity are 
absolute declare.

1268
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,464
The societies that have tried to aim at 
equity are the terrible communistic 

1269
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:55,334
societies of the 20th century and they 
were so goddamn ma so unbelievably 

1270
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,293
murderous.
And counterproductive that it beggars 

1271
01:09:04,911 --> 01:09:05,744
the imagination.
And so I can't even believe we have a 

1272
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:10,310
conversation about equity because it's 
such a pathological idea.

1273
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:11,144
It's,
it's completely invalidated by the 

1274
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:14,210
historical data.
So,

1275
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:15,763
all right.
What does my average daily schedule 

1276
01:09:17,511 --> 01:09:18,680
consist of?
Well,

1277
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:19,514
that's fairly straight forward.
I get up around somewhere between six 

1278
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:23,024
and eight and then I work till 10 as,
as hard as I can flat out every single 

1279
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,301
day.
So,

1280
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:32,960
and I've been doing that for,
with very little variation,

1281
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:35,780
although it's been much more extreme in 
the last year for like,

1282
01:09:35,781 --> 01:09:38,510
since 1985,
like I work probably,

1283
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,960
well I work,
I would say 14 hours a day,

1284
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:44,600
at least 14 hours a day.

1285
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,160
And so that said about a hundred hours a
week and that time that I don't do that,

1286
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:52,790
I spend with friends and,
but mostly with my family.

1287
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,140
And so,
um,

1288
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:55,603
yeah.
And I work as efficiently as I possibly 

1289
01:09:57,531 --> 01:10:00,170
can.
I'm always trying to do everything I can

1290
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,004
as fast as I possibly can.
And I'm accustomed to that because like 

1291
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:04,910
I said,
I've been doing it for,

1292
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:09,050
I've been doing it for 30 years.
So that's my daily schedule.

1293
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,350
And I don't know even what I would do if
I didn't do that.

1294
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:14,840
Um,
I have this cottage that I go to,

1295
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:15,674
although I generally spend time writing 
up there and I go swimming with my wife 

1296
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:22,700
and we go canoeing and I can take a 
break in that way.

1297
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,330
But most of the time if I take a break 
even up at the cottage,

1298
01:10:26,331 --> 01:10:29,030
generally what I do is like carpentry 
and fix the place up.

1299
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,863
And I don't like to be unoccupied.
I have to be occupied doing something 

1300
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:38,330
productive all the time because 
otherwise I'm not pleased with myself.

1301
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,410
And so,
I mean,

1302
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:40,244
you know,
I decided a long time ago that I was 

1303
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:43,910
going to try to live a hyper efficient 
and hyper productive life.

1304
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,780
And so it's been a challenge.
I,

1305
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,693
uh,
it's an enjoyable thing for me to some 

1306
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:48,494
degree because I'm very interested in 
trying to figure out how much I can 

1307
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:53,120
possibly do in the shortest period of 
time,

1308
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:53,954
all the time.
And that keeps you alert and awake and 

1309
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:59,690
it's a great challenge and it lends my 
life a substantial amount of meaning and

1310
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:01,160
it's,
it's been very successful.

1311
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:02,210
So,
um,

1312
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:04,370
you know,
so that's kind of what it's like.

1313
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:06,501
Oh,
okay.

1314
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:08,720
Let's see what else these chat people 
say,

1315
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:13,040
um,
oh wow.

1316
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,943
Apparently.

1317
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:14,880
Okay.

1318
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,670
Broken mind.
In tolstoy's confession,

1319
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:18,504
he talks about meaning in faith.
He had many problems with religion and 

1320
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,044
the church.
How can a nonreligious person find a 

1321
01:11:23,791 --> 01:11:26,520
meaningful nonreligious faith?
Oh,

1322
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,630
well,
you know,

1323
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:29,640
it depends on what you mean by 
nonreligious.

1324
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,100
You know,
I would say for broken mind,

1325
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,323
you know,

1326
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,360
let's,
I was thinking about this today.

1327
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,194
I was writing about this today.
I was reading about Dostoyevsky as 

1328
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,810
compared to Nicha,
you know,

1329
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:43,440
and nature was a great critic of 
Christianity and so as Dostoyevsky,

1330
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:44,663
but dusty Yefsky I think trumped Nicha 
with regards to his attitude towards 

1331
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:50,490
Christianity.
And I think you could really see this.

1332
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:54,810
He could read the brothers [inaudible] I
would really recommend that broken mind.

1333
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,790
Everything.
Get your hands on Dostoevsky,

1334
01:11:56,791 --> 01:12:00,420
read everything you can.
He wrote cause Dostoyevsky re really and

1335
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:02,130
you like tolstoy's confession,
you know,

1336
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,260
read Dostoyevsky.
But you know,

1337
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:07,130
Dostoyevsky has this character in the 
brothers Karamazov um,

1338
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:08,213
Alioscha

1339
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:09,583
and Osha is a monastic novitiate and 
who's kind of a naive guy 

1340
01:12:13,641 --> 01:12:15,410
intellectually,
although very good person.

1341
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,410
I'm a simple person intellectually,
let's say,

1342
01:12:18,411 --> 01:12:21,140
perhaps not naive and he has this older 
brother Ivan,

1343
01:12:21,141 --> 01:12:24,770
who is a devastating intellect and a 
handsome man and a rake with a women and

1344
01:12:24,771 --> 01:12:25,570
like really,
uh,

1345
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:26,403
like a well put together human being.
Although quite nihilistic and cutting 

1346
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:29,954
and his intellect and Ivan can 
absolutely demolish Ellie Osha in a 

1347
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:35,533
debate and does quite regularly.
But Ellie Osha basically wins the 

1348
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:39,524
argument in the book,
let's say as the book plays itself out 

1349
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:44,750
by acting like a good person.
And I would say,

1350
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,720
you know,
if you want to develop a religious faith

1351
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,583
in some sense,
forget about trying to develop faith in 

1352
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:53,180
God.
I don't think you can will yourself into

1353
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,710
that.
I'm not even sure that you should,

1354
01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:55,843
but I do think that you can decide that 
you're going to do what you can to live 

1355
01:13:00,531 --> 01:13:04,100
a meaningful life and be a good person 
and start to meditate on what that means

1356
01:13:04,101 --> 01:13:05,720
and then to start to put it in practice.

1357
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,553
And then you find your religious faith 
in the domain of action rather than 

1358
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,584
conceptualization.
And that's really the primary domain in 

1359
01:13:11,931 --> 01:13:14,120
which it should be manifested anyways.
Like the,

1360
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:16,490
the primary Christian commitment for 
example,

1361
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,780
is the imitation of Christ,
not the belief in his divinity,

1362
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:21,614
you know,
or the belief that he died for the sins 

1363
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,250
of mankind or any of that.
And I'm not making light of that.

1364
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,473
But the primary moral injunction is to 
try to live the archetipal life within 

1365
01:13:30,951 --> 01:13:32,990
the confines of your own subjective 
being,

1366
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:36,200
to try to live the most divine life that
you can.

1367
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,393
And if you try that and if you take that
seriously and if you meditate upon that 

1368
01:13:40,401 --> 01:13:41,234
and ask yourself what it might mean,
that I think you'll find the religious 

1369
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:46,940
element of your life fleshing itself out
quite nicely.

1370
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:52,300
So that's the answer to that question.
Thoughts on the drug epidemic?

1371
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,673
Well,
I'm not sure there is an epidemic any 

1372
01:13:59,020 --> 01:13:59,853
more than there always has been.
I know that there is now a tilt towards 

1373
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:08,570
drugs in,
in the u s in particular like meth and,

1374
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,570
and,
um,

1375
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:12,400
fentanyl and the other opiates.
Now it's quite a catastrophe.

1376
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,613
Um,

1377
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:20,970
a lot of that is occurring among people 
who don't have meaning in their lives.

1378
01:14:20,971 --> 01:14:23,280
I would say you might think that's a 
fast I'll answer,

1379
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:24,180
but it's not,
you know,

1380
01:14:24,181 --> 01:14:25,800
like here,
here's the wrap literature.

1381
01:14:25,801 --> 01:14:28,140
Like it's,
if you take a rat lab rat,

1382
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:30,180
typical lab rat is,
you know,

1383
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,300
genetically bred to be identical with 
many other lab routes and he lives alone

1384
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:37,554
in a cage and he,
he's got a pretty miserable route life 

1385
01:14:40,321 --> 01:14:41,154
because routes are social animals and 
they don't like to live in cages by 

1386
01:14:43,291 --> 01:14:44,124
themselves.
And you can get a lab rat in a cage 

1387
01:14:45,661 --> 01:14:47,790
addicted to cocaine,
cocaine and no time flat.

1388
01:14:47,791 --> 01:14:48,624
And he'll,
he'll like press a lever for cocaine 

1389
01:14:50,881 --> 01:14:51,714
reward to pretty much to the,
to the exclusion of all else including 

1390
01:14:55,261 --> 01:14:56,094
sex and often including food.
But if you take that same rat and you 

1391
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:01,500
put them in a rat family,
you know,

1392
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:02,334
in a rat social hierarchy,
in a rat environment and give him 

1393
01:15:04,411 --> 01:15:08,010
something that rat rat like to do so 
that he can be satisfied,

1394
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:10,500
it's very difficult to get them addicted
to cocaine.

1395
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,693
And so I would say the reason that 
people take psychomotor stimulants and 

1396
01:15:13,921 --> 01:15:14,754
all the drugs have serious abuse or 
psychomotor stimulants regardless of 

1397
01:15:17,671 --> 01:15:20,670
what else they might be,
they activate the dopaminergic system,

1398
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:25,440
which is the system that tracks reward 
and that that is associated,

1399
01:15:25,441 --> 01:15:28,830
that's activated when you pursue velop 
valuable goal directed behavior.

1400
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,930
Um,
if you don't have that,

1401
01:15:30,931 --> 01:15:33,640
if you don't have a valid goal,
if you don't have no,

1402
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:36,690
no real valid meaning in your life,
you don't have a valid ambition,

1403
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:39,690
then you don't have any way of 
activating that system.

1404
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:41,340
And why the hell wouldn't you take 
drugs?

1405
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:45,960
It's like you have to have something 
better to do to not addict yourself,

1406
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:46,883
you know,
so,

1407
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:50,540
so I would say that a huge part of the 
current epidemic in,

1408
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:52,410
in,
in the u s in particular is,

1409
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:57,650
is manifest among broken men who have no
real place in society and providing them

1410
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:58,554
with money isn't going to help that they
need a productive and meaningful 

1411
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,880
existence.
And which is the paramount,

1412
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:06,270
the paramount goal should be the 
paramount goal of social,

1413
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,890
of social policy.
For example,

1414
01:16:08,891 --> 01:16:09,350
we,
we,

1415
01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:10,183
it isn't the alleviation of poverty.
That's really the issue because people 

1416
01:16:12,721 --> 01:16:13,554
in the West aren't poor.
There might be a bit of a distribution 

1417
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:16,620
problem,
but we're not poor.

1418
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:19,680
What we have is a,
uh,

1419
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,510
what would you say?
Hey,

1420
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,183
we have a problem of meaningful 
engagement and that's what has to be 

1421
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:27,990
addressed and that's why I do the work 
that I'm doing.

1422
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:29,243
So

1423
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:32,233
yeah.

1424
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:33,203
Are you aware of the similarities in the
work of Anthony Robbins and with lot of 

1425
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:37,590
what you are doing in the self authoring
suite?

1426
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:38,773
Um,
I'm not specifically aware of the 

1427
01:16:39,961 --> 01:16:40,794
similarities,
although I know that Anthony Robbins is 

1428
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:43,134
a well known motivational speaker and 
generally motivational speakers try to 

1429
01:16:46,801 --> 01:16:49,560
motivate people to pursue something 
productive in their life.

1430
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:50,700
So,
um,

1431
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:51,953
you know,
I would say likely that there are 

1432
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,170
motivational.

1433
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:56,420
Okay.

1434
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,550
There are people who are concerned with 
motivation that are working at different

1435
01:16:59,551 --> 01:17:00,384
levels of the communication strata.
And I'm working at a fairly abstract 

1436
01:17:03,571 --> 01:17:08,571
level and hopefully Mr Robinson's 
working at a level that is productive,

1437
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:10,093
helpful to lots of people.
He certainly had a very stable and long 

1438
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:12,674
career.
So,

1439
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:13,853
um,
although I'm not aware of any specific 

1440
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:17,510
similarities past that.
So

1441
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:26,040
what do you think about Adhd?
I have it,

1442
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,510
I am frustrated by my failures in life 
because of it.

1443
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,600
I am trying to become a cam a chemist 
and I am failing at school.

1444
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:36,370
Um,
I think adhd is a catch all diagnosis.

1445
01:17:36,371 --> 01:17:40,930
I think that people who are extroverted 
and unconscientious for example,

1446
01:17:40,931 --> 01:17:43,330
often manifest the traits of,
of,

1447
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,250
uh,
attention deficit disorder.

1448
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:46,563
Um,
I know that there isn't any real 

1449
01:17:47,981 --> 01:17:51,730
evidence of longterm utility and cycle 
and cycle.

1450
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,790
What a psycho pharmacological treatment 
for Adhd.

1451
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:56,410
Um,
I would say though,

1452
01:17:56,411 --> 01:17:59,740
if you are having a hard time 
concentrating on your goals,

1453
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:03,160
that what you should probably do is set 
yourself up with a therapist,

1454
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:04,660
find someone you can talk to,
you know,

1455
01:18:04,661 --> 01:18:07,120
so see two or three therapists.
I know it's expensive,

1456
01:18:07,121 --> 01:18:07,954
but so is not having a life.
Find someone you can talk to and then 

1457
01:18:11,261 --> 01:18:14,410
make it and someone practical,
probably a behavioral therapist would be

1458
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,130
best.

1459
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:20,080
And then have them set goals with you 
and help you strategize to stay on track

1460
01:18:20,081 --> 01:18:21,820
week to week.
That's the best thing.

1461
01:18:21,821 --> 01:18:24,610
Or to set that up with a friend if he 
can't do it with the therapist.

1462
01:18:24,611 --> 01:18:28,390
So that's,
that's the best advice I have for that.

1463
01:18:28,391 --> 01:18:29,530
And keep at it,
man.

1464
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,350
You know,
but break your,

1465
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:35,710
you gotta learn to schedule.
You got to learn to break your days down

1466
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:36,544
into disciplined sub sections and you 
got to practice out at and practice at 

1467
01:18:40,271 --> 01:18:41,104
it.
And there isn't an easier answer that I 

1468
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:43,594
know of.
But having someone that will help keep 

1469
01:18:45,431 --> 01:18:47,200
your responsible,
I think can be useful.

1470
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:51,040
I've seen that be useful for people who 
have attention deficit disorder.

1471
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:51,874
Let's say

1472
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:57,673
you compare at once compared religion 
and science as tools that can be used 

1473
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:02,330
more accurately to understand your 
position.

1474
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:06,920
Do you think gender and biological sex 
are two tools in describing an identity?

1475
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,503
Not really.
I think that most of what I think most 

1476
01:19:11,091 --> 01:19:14,540
of the work on gender is rubbish to put 
it bluntly.

1477
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,510
Um,
I get what is meant by it.

1478
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:18,344
You know that there is a socio cultural 
layer specifying gendered behavior on 

1479
01:19:21,771 --> 01:19:22,604
top of biological sexual identity.
But I think it's been so polluted by 

1480
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,730
political idiocy that it's,
it's a concept.

1481
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:32,660
It's almost entirely invalidated.
It's used for perverse purposes.

1482
01:19:32,661 --> 01:19:35,600
It's not used as a tool of understanding
in most situations.

1483
01:19:35,930 --> 01:19:36,960
So,
um,

1484
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:37,843
I think that the concept of gender could
be useful if it was used to specify the 

1485
01:19:42,871 --> 01:19:47,570
purely socio cultural layer of,
of like sex type behavior.

1486
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,030
And I think it could conceivably be used
in that way.

1487
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:52,250
But I see very little evidence that it 
ever is.

1488
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:53,443
So,

1489
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:56,040
okay.

1490
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,340
My brother is a soldier in Iraq as a 
clinical psychologist.

1491
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,263
What should one do when coming from such
a chaotic place back to a tame and 

1492
01:20:03,181 --> 01:20:05,130
structured one?
Well,

1493
01:20:05,131 --> 01:20:09,030
I guess that would depend to some degree
on exactly the nature of his experiences

1494
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,450
in Iraq.
Um,

1495
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,620
so it's hard for me to elaborate on that
further.

1496
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,650
I mean I would say though that one thing
he could really do,

1497
01:20:16,651 --> 01:20:17,484
and,
and this is somewhat self serving I or 

1498
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:19,884
could appear to be somewhat self serving
I suppose is I would strongly recommend 

1499
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:23,993
that your brother do the self authoring 
suite when he comes back because it'll 

1500
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,043
help him and probably concentrated on 
the future authoring program to begin 

1501
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,930
with because it might take a while when 
he gets back,

1502
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:34,764
before he can meditate on his 
experiences without that meditation 

1503
01:20:38,871 --> 01:20:40,610
being harmful.
So for example,

1504
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,623
there's pretty good evidence if you've 
had a traumatic experience that you 

1505
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:44,534
shouldn't re subject yourself to the 
traumatic experience repeatedly before 

1506
01:20:49,431 --> 01:20:52,160
say about 18 months or something like 
that is past.

1507
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:54,860
And it isn't exactly obvious why that's 
the case,

1508
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:57,170
but there's a pretty good literature 
indicating that it is.

1509
01:20:57,410 --> 01:20:58,243
So I would say that when he makes the 
transition from Iraq back to enormous 

1510
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,933
normative society,
that the first thing you should do is 

1511
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:05,210
generate a plan.

1512
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:05,960
Yeah.

1513
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:06,793
And our plan about how we would,
and this would be the same even if you 

1514
01:21:08,921 --> 01:21:10,600
were coming out of something like prison
or,

1515
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,050
or making a change,
a radical change in your occupation,

1516
01:21:14,051 --> 01:21:15,710
is you need a plan,
right?

1517
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:16,563
You need a plan so that you can fake 
because you can't just make that 

1518
01:21:19,631 --> 01:21:21,310
adjustment without knowing what you're 
doing.

1519
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:24,580
So that's what I would recommend.
And if he does come back traumatized,

1520
01:21:24,581 --> 01:21:26,200
and I would say,
you know,

1521
01:21:26,201 --> 01:21:27,034
traumatic,
traumatized soldiers often have to 

1522
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,590
develop a very comprehensive philosophy 
of good and evil.

1523
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:32,424
And,
and so that would either mean perhaps 

1524
01:21:33,731 --> 01:21:34,564
talking to a,
a decent clinical psychologist about 

1525
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:40,480
what his experiences were or perhaps 
reading some of the literature.

1526
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:41,314
And I've outlined those books on my 
website@jordanbpeterson.com that can be 

1527
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,124
really helpful in understanding and 
helping someone understand the evils of 

1528
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:52,390
atrocity and warfare didn't.
And even the necessary evils,

1529
01:21:52,391 --> 01:21:54,010
let's say,
of atrocity and warfare.

1530
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:59,370
So,
okay,

1531
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:02,274
let's see here.
Do you think a lot of your work is the 

1532
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:10,431
form of the bargaining stage of grief?
No.

1533
01:22:12,490 --> 01:22:13,323
No.
I don't think that there's these stages 

1534
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:16,870
of grief that had been identified.
Uh,

1535
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,100
I can't remember who did the work.
Um,

1536
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:20,130
um,
it,

1537
01:22:20,130 --> 01:22:22,510
it seems to have been quite helpful work
for many people.

1538
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:23,533
Um,

1539
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:30,030
but I don't think,
I don't think I'm bargaining exactly.

1540
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,860
I don't think I'm suggesting that people
bargain.

1541
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:35,680
I think I'm suggesting that people work 
in sacrificing,

1542
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:37,530
you could think about that as 
bargaining.

1543
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:40,750
Bargaining has the connotation more of 
pleading.

1544
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:41,530
Yeah.

1545
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:42,363
Well let's say,
and I don't think that work and 

1546
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:46,130
sacrifice constitute pleading.
I,

1547
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,973
I think that they're actually really 
effective means of dealing with the 

1548
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:50,124
world.
And I think that people can be highly 

1549
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:53,340
effective and competent much more than 
they think.

1550
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,683
And so,
uh,

1551
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:57,630
it's an interesting question and I can 
see why you posed it,

1552
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:57,961
but,
no,

1553
01:22:57,961 --> 01:22:59,430
I don't.
I don't believe it.

1554
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:00,503
So,

1555
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:01,853
okay.

1556
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:02,833
Could you comment on the Buddhist 
concept of impermanence and the nature 

1557
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:08,710
of reality being given,
being what gives it meaning?

1558
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,360
Oh yeah.
That's a good one.

1559
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:14,260
And how that concept conflicts with 
ideas of eternal life in heaven.

1560
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,123
Jesus,
man,

1561
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,650
that's a lot of questions.
That's a lot of hard questions.

1562
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:20,910
Well,
whoa.

1563
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,370
Let's start with,
I'm going to only answer one of those.

1564
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:27,940
I think it's just too much effort to get
all three of them in the same.

1565
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,630
It's like hitting three fast balls with 
the same swing of the bat.

1566
01:23:31,631 --> 01:23:32,740
I don't think I can manage it.

1567
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:38,710
How does the finite nature of reality 
give it?

1568
01:23:38,711 --> 01:23:39,544
Meaning?
How is it that the finite nature of 

1569
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:43,120
reality is what gives it meaning?
God,

1570
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:45,340
that's such a good question.
Well,

1571
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:47,590
I can answer this.
Oh,

1572
01:23:47,591 --> 01:23:48,424
Bleakley I'm going to talk about 
something that happened to the comic 

1573
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:51,994
book character Superman in the late 
seventies so superman was 

1574
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:56,553
extraordinarily popular from the 1930s 
right up to the 1970s but one of the 

1575
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:03,760
things that happened is that as he 
became more and more popular,

1576
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:06,040
he also got more and more powerful.
Right?

1577
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,140
So by the 80s Christ,
you know,

1578
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:11,080
you could bounce a hydrogen bomb off 
superman's chest and he could,

1579
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:14,620
he could juggle planets and you know,
that's all well and good.

1580
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:15,454
Except what are you going to,
what kind of adventure is he going to 

1581
01:24:17,171 --> 01:24:18,130
have?
Right?

1582
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,570
Like,
you know,

1583
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,870
if you can't blow them up with an a 
hydrogen bomb and he can juggle planets,

1584
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,450
nothing interesting can happen to him.

1585
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:26,463
He can be anywhere he wants at any time 
and he can do anything he wants with no 

1586
01:24:29,561 --> 01:24:31,220
effort at,
at,

1587
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:31,930
at,
at,

1588
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:35,200
at an under any circumstances 
whatsoever.

1589
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:38,800
So he's like a permanent deus ex ex 
Makena.

1590
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:39,634
I think I've got that right,
which is superman is boring because God 

1591
01:24:43,271 --> 01:24:47,050
always comes in at this last moment and 
saves him from whatever predicament he's

1592
01:24:47,051 --> 01:24:48,190
in.
Well,

1593
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:52,180
you know,
contemplating that perversely enough can

1594
01:24:52,181 --> 01:24:54,820
give you some appreciation for the 
finitude of life.

1595
01:24:54,821 --> 01:24:58,510
It's like we're,
we're like infinity captured in,

1596
01:24:58,690 --> 01:24:59,800
in the finite,
like,

1597
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:02,620
like a genie and capsulated in the,
in the lamp,

1598
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:03,520
you know,
and genius,

1599
01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:07,240
the gene root word of genius by the way.
So that's not an accidental comparison.

1600
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,613
And it's this strange combination of,
of infinite capacity that characterized 

1601
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,533
as human beings to some degree with this
terrible finite limitation that does in 

1602
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:20,530
fact make our lives the adventures that 
they are.

1603
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:24,130
And so this is quite nicely documented 
in the Tao Te Ching,

1604
01:25:24,131 --> 01:25:25,900
by the way.
And I would really recommend,

1605
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:26,734
uh,
the,

1606
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,380
the,
the translation by Seth Rosenthal.

1607
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:32,320
I already think it's elegant and that 
the Taoists are very good at,

1608
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:33,213
at,
at,

1609
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,450
at formulating the utility of 
nonexistence.

1610
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,293
In fact,
I think there's actually a verse in the 

1611
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,800
Tao Te Ching called the utility of 
nonexistence where they talk about the,

1612
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:44,310
the,
the empty space in a part,

1613
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,510
giving it its utility and the,
you know,

1614
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,353
the,
so that's what the pot isn't in some 

1615
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:51,780
sense that makes it what it is.
And,

1616
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:52,913
and that's also the case with human 
beings is that we have these intense 

1617
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:56,314
limitations that we can then attempt to 
transcend and that it's meaningful to 

1618
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:04,310
transcend those limitations in such an 
interesting way.

1619
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:07,250
And I don't know what that means in the 
final metaphysical analysis,

1620
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:10,640
but you see that we do this voluntarily 
to ourselves too,

1621
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:11,474
because board people will place 
restrictions on themselves just for 

1622
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:16,250
entertainment.

1623
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,260
That's exactly what we do when we play a
game.

1624
01:26:18,261 --> 01:26:19,190
So,
for example,

1625
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:20,713
if you're playing chess,
you subject yourself to all sorts of 

1626
01:26:22,341 --> 01:26:24,080
arbitrary limitations,
right?

1627
01:26:24,081 --> 01:26:24,914
There's only a certain number of things 
you can do with the chessboard and the 

1628
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:29,030
chest chessmen and then,
um,

1629
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:30,673
you,
you open up a whole universe of 

1630
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:35,330
possibilities by adopting those 
limitations.

1631
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:36,164
And there's something about that that 
speaks deeply to the absolute nature of 

1632
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:43,340
reality and maybe justifies the,
the tragic finitude of being.

1633
01:26:43,341 --> 01:26:44,460
It's something like that.
And,

1634
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:46,250
and that's,
that's how it looks to me.

1635
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:47,690
And I've thought about that quite 
deeply.

1636
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:48,524
So

1637
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:55,650
can an introvert thrive in the field of 
law or should they avoid it altogether?

1638
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,440
Yes,
actually we,

1639
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,690
we gathered a lot of,
of data on lawyers and,

1640
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:03,300
and extroversion.
It doesn't predict law.

1641
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:05,550
Uh,
what would you say proficiency at law at

1642
01:27:05,551 --> 01:27:08,730
all?
It's not associated with it at all.

1643
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,490
Um,
what predicts proficiency in law,

1644
01:27:11,491 --> 01:27:16,170
his intelligence and conscientiousness.
And then after that,

1645
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,350
relatively low agreeableness because 
it's a very competitive enterprise,

1646
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,770
high emotional stability.
So low neuroticism,

1647
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,350
but introverted lawyers do fine.
Now,

1648
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:28,710
if you're an introverted lawyer,
there's going to be some challenges.

1649
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,330
And those challenges would be developing
the social skills necessary,

1650
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,164
say to stand up in the courtroom if you 
happen to be a lawyer who's going to do 

1651
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:40,410
courtroom work,
but there's plenty of like solitary work

1652
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:41,244
that a lawyer can engage in.
But then the other problem might be for 

1653
01:27:43,861 --> 01:27:44,694
an introverted lawyer that you know,
you want to develop your web of 

1654
01:27:47,401 --> 01:27:49,170
connections,
your social network,

1655
01:27:49,171 --> 01:27:51,030
and of course you want to do that in any
enterprise,

1656
01:27:51,031 --> 01:27:51,270
right?

1657
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:53,430
So it's a challenge for introverts in 
general.

1658
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,473
But I would say there's absolutely no 
reason whatsoever to assume that law is 

1659
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:59,550
a discipline that an introvert should 
avoid.

1660
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:00,361
So,
you know,

1661
01:28:00,361 --> 01:28:02,820
go for it.
But you need to be conscientious,

1662
01:28:02,821 --> 01:28:03,560
right?
Cause low.

1663
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:06,840
It really matters if you're 
conscientious as a lawyer and you should

1664
01:28:06,841 --> 01:28:07,674
have a pretty decent verbal intelligence
because otherwise it's going to be a 

1665
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:10,464
hard road because the lawyers have to 
deal with an awful lot of verbal 

1666
01:28:13,171 --> 01:28:15,510
material and they have to formulate 
complex arguments.

1667
01:28:15,511 --> 01:28:17,190
They have to be able to write and 
communicate.

1668
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:18,420
And so,
you know,

1669
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:19,283
you got it.
You want to think about those elements 

1670
01:28:20,281 --> 01:28:21,810
of your temperament more.
I would say.

1671
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:28,913
Okay.

1672
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:29,853
Okay.

1673
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:30,700
Okay.

1674
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,330
Dr. Peterson,
do you believe the evidence for God lies

1675
01:28:33,331 --> 01:28:35,200
primarily inner inner,
inner,

1676
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:37,170
inner personal experiences?

1677
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,473
Okay.

1678
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,060
Well,
it,

1679
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:53,000
it lies to a great degree in 
interpersonal experiences,

1680
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:56,540
although I don't even know if you could 
call that necessarily evidence for God.

1681
01:28:56,780 --> 01:28:59,300
It depends on what you're willing to 
accept as evidence.

1682
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:02,060
Like even that experience that I had,
um,

1683
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:07,440
that I described earlier in the q and a 
isn't evidence for the existence of God.

1684
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:08,251
You know,
it was,

1685
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:12,090
it was certainly a religious experience 
and I found it extremely,

1686
01:29:12,091 --> 01:29:14,610
extremely compelling.
But from a scientific perspective,

1687
01:29:14,611 --> 01:29:17,460
it's almost worthless as evidence 
because it's purely subjective.

1688
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:20,100
Now,
I think there are elements of experience

1689
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:20,934
that cannot be God at objectively.
And so I'm willing to take subjective 

1690
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:24,894
experience under some circumstances as 
evidence in so far as if I have a 

1691
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:30,090
subjective experience that I find 
credible,

1692
01:29:30,270 --> 01:29:33,210
I'm willing to act on what I believe to 
be its meaning.

1693
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:37,410
And so I'll test out my interpretation 
of that experience pragmatically.

1694
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:40,410
And that's good enough for me.
I'm willing to consider that evidence,

1695
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:42,720
but you can't really consider that 
scientific evidence.

1696
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:44,820
So,
um,

1697
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,920
but then what other evidence is there?
Well,

1698
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:50,754
there's also,
let's call it the evidence that's 

1699
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,560
instantiated in the great religious 
texts of mankind,

1700
01:29:55,561 --> 01:29:58,380
the great philosophical texts and the 
great literary text as well.

1701
01:29:58,381 --> 01:30:02,430
And I wouldn't exactly call that 
subjective experience because you can,

1702
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,390
you can garner it through your exposure 
to culture and,

1703
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,503
but you know whether or not that 
constitutes evidence depends on what 

1704
01:30:09,301 --> 01:30:12,390
you're willing to define as and accept 
as evidence.

1705
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:13,493
So

1706
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,800
I'm told that my overanalyzing is double
edged sword,

1707
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,750
but I'm suffering from being this way.
Yeah,

1708
01:30:25,751 --> 01:30:27,610
well you're probably,
you know,

1709
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:30,550
hi and openness and maybe you're very 
verbally intelligence,

1710
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:31,384
so you're pretty much stuck with that.
Maybe you've got a bit of mania to you 

1711
01:30:33,491 --> 01:30:34,324
too.
And I don't mean that in a negative 

1712
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:37,870
sense.
I find relief when I drink alcohol,

1713
01:30:37,871 --> 01:30:41,110
smoke or take certain drugs because it 
slows down my thought process.

1714
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,750
How can I use my over analysis to my 
advantage?

1715
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,823
Well,
I would say find yourself a difficult 

1716
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:47,890
cognitive problem to solve.
You know,

1717
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:49,630
pick a challenge,
pick a challenge.

1718
01:30:49,631 --> 01:30:51,730
But you know,
you also might consider,

1719
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,560
you might consider talking to someone 
you find relief when you drink alcohol.

1720
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,620
That might be,
that might be an indication that some of

1721
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:04,060
what you're overanalyzing isn't so much 
a consequence of access cognitive power,

1722
01:31:04,061 --> 01:31:06,280
but an excessive of high negative 
emotion.

1723
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:10,210
And so that would be illustrated in say 
high trait neuroticism.

1724
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:11,403
We're going to release the big five 
aspects scale here later this month and 

1725
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:14,763
you'll be able to take that and it'll 
give you a pretty good detailed 

1726
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:17,823
description of your personality.
And there's two dimensions of 

1727
01:31:19,691 --> 01:31:21,760
neuroticism,
withdrawal and volatility.

1728
01:31:21,761 --> 01:31:25,600
And you know,
if you're overanalyzing because you're,

1729
01:31:25,660 --> 01:31:27,580
you're um,
what do you call that?

1730
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:32,230
Ruminating that can be a consequence of 
high levels of anxiety.

1731
01:31:32,231 --> 01:31:33,064
And the reason I'm suggesting that is 
because you said you find relief when 

1732
01:31:35,441 --> 01:31:36,274
you drink alcohol.
And alcohol is a very powerful and 

1733
01:31:37,870 --> 01:31:40,210
anxiety lytic agent,
antianxiety agent.

1734
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:41,403
And so lots of people who have high 
levels of anxiety do ruminate and so 

1735
01:31:44,741 --> 01:31:46,180
overanalyze,
let's say.

1736
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:50,150
And they find relief when they drink 
because alcohol is a primary anxiety.

1737
01:31:50,151 --> 01:31:52,140
Lytic like valium,
like Benzodiazepines,

1738
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:53,053
barbiturates.
So the fact that alcohol gives you 

1739
01:31:55,631 --> 01:31:56,464
relief probably indicates that some of 
what's driving your overanalysis is 

1740
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:04,690
anxiety and then you could exercise can 
really help with that.

1741
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:05,673
I would also recommend,
this is something we need to think 

1742
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:08,620
about.
I don't know what your eating habits are

1743
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:09,454
like are your sleeping habits.
But if you are an anxious person and 

1744
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:15,040
that's manifesting itself in say 
neurotic over analysis,

1745
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:17,080
there's two things you can do very 
rapidly.

1746
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:19,390
Three things really that will help quell
that.

1747
01:32:19,710 --> 01:32:22,150
Um,
well for things even number one,

1748
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,150
okay,

1749
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:23,983
get up at the same time everyday and I 
would recommend in the morning cause 

1750
01:32:26,391 --> 01:32:27,224
that's when people generally get up and 
it's good to do what everyone else does 

1751
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:31,040
is nuts.
You have a good reason not to.

1752
01:32:31,550 --> 01:32:34,760
Number two,
eat a large breakfast,

1753
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:37,340
right?
Keep it carbohydrate light,

1754
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:38,203
you know,
don't,

1755
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:40,450
don't eat toast,
toast and like uh,

1756
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,500
fruit loops.
That's not going to do the trick.

1757
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:46,040
Make it fat and protein heavy and eat 
more than you want.

1758
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:47,550
You might say,
I'm not hungry in the mornings.

1759
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:51,410
Like this has nothing to do with what 
you want or what your appetite is.

1760
01:32:51,411 --> 01:32:53,150
It's like you need to eat in the 
morning.

1761
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:54,463
If you're an anxious person and you 
don't eat in the morning and then you 

1762
01:32:57,621 --> 01:33:00,230
stress yourself out,
your body hyper produces insulin,

1763
01:33:00,231 --> 01:33:01,064
it takes all the blood sugar out of your
blood and that disregulates your 

1764
01:33:04,281 --> 01:33:05,810
metabolism for the entire day.

1765
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:07,730
You can't reset it till you go to sleep 
at night.

1766
01:33:07,731 --> 01:33:08,564
And I've had lots of anxious clients who
would say fall into the over analytic 

1767
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:12,584
category who were like virtually cured 
by eating a large breakfast every 

1768
01:33:16,101 --> 01:33:16,934
morning.
I would highly recommend that you could 

1769
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,124
try some physical exercise.
Weightlifting is really good for curing 

1770
01:33:21,501 --> 01:33:23,390
anxiety.
And the other thing you could do,

1771
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:24,224
as I alluded to earlier today,
is to make a schedule and start 

1772
01:33:27,231 --> 01:33:30,980
attending to your daily micro routines.
So you know,

1773
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:33,080
you've got to figure out what your over 
analysis is.

1774
01:33:33,081 --> 01:33:37,250
It might be cognitive,
like maybe you have a very active mind,

1775
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:40,310
you know you're fast,
verbally are you fast verbally.

1776
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,233
One way you can find that out is to do 
something like write down as many 

1777
01:33:43,491 --> 01:33:44,324
letters,
words as you can that begin with the 

1778
01:33:46,011 --> 01:33:48,770
letter s for example.
In in three minutes,

1779
01:33:48,771 --> 01:33:49,604
do that with a bunch of your friends.
And if you're someone who writes down 

1780
01:33:51,411 --> 01:33:52,244
way more words than anyone else,
then you're verbally fluent and that 

1781
01:33:55,011 --> 01:33:56,900
might be driving some of your over 
analysis.

1782
01:33:56,901 --> 01:33:57,734
But my guess is that you're suffering 
from some rumination that's related to 

1783
01:34:01,791 --> 01:34:03,160
anxiety.
And so I told,

1784
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:06,290
told you what I think the simplest ways 
aren't to rectify that.

1785
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,870
So hope that works out for you.

1786
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:12,440
Let's see,
what else have we got here?

1787
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:17,710
Okay.
Alhmad warrior says,

1788
01:34:24,601 --> 01:34:27,000
can you answer this question,
Dr. Peterson?

1789
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,840
And the answer is I can,
but I'm not going to.

1790
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,060
Okay,
let's see.

1791
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,533
Yeah,

1792
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,460
Loki doodle says I cleaned my room 
finally.

1793
01:34:42,461 --> 01:34:45,400
That's good.
I hope that it has a pronounced positive

1794
01:34:45,401 --> 01:34:46,234
effect on the rest of your life.
You know it's funny because since last 

1795
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:50,553
September I would say I redid my house.
I'm going to put a video online about 

1796
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:53,854
that cause I had a camera crew in here 
this week videoing the whole house 

1797
01:34:56,471 --> 01:34:58,550
because it's quite interesting I would 
say.

1798
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,630
But since I've stepped into this chaotic
domain last September,

1799
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:03,643
my room has been a mess.
The rest of the house hasn't been too 

1800
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:07,070
bad,
but I've never got to cleaning my room.

1801
01:35:07,071 --> 01:35:07,904
I finally did this weekend.
And what was interesting because when I 

1802
01:35:10,281 --> 01:35:11,114
did it,
I mean I've been doing a lot of other 

1803
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:13,520
things,
but that's,

1804
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:14,330
no,
no,

1805
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:16,350
that doesn't help.
Uh,

1806
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:17,263
keep at bay.
The negative psychological consequences 

1807
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:21,710
of being in,
in,

1808
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:25,100
in material chaos.
When I cleaned my room this weekend,

1809
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:28,430
it made it easier for me to finish this 
chapter that I've been obsessing about.

1810
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:29,930
So that was quite interesting.
So,

1811
01:35:30,290 --> 01:35:31,123
you know,
cleaning and organizing your room is no 

1812
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:34,700
joke.
It's a great meditative exercise,

1813
01:35:34,701 --> 01:35:38,510
especially if you take it seriously and 
you're not trying to make it look neat.

1814
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:39,583
Although that's not a bad aim.
You're trying to turn the room into 

1815
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:44,690
somewhere that the person you want to be
could live.

1816
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:46,003
So

1817
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,873
what

1818
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,213
do I believe that there was any 
connection between leftist identity 

1819
01:36:02,261 --> 01:36:03,094
politics of past decades in the emergent
white identity politics of the alt 

1820
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:06,401
right?
Yes,

1821
01:36:06,401 --> 01:36:08,350
I think there's a direct causal 
connection.

1822
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,513
It only stands to reason that if 
identity politics is going to be the 

1823
01:36:13,661 --> 01:36:15,960
acceptable mode of communication,
that the,

1824
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:20,020
that there are people who are on the 
white side of the equation.

1825
01:36:20,021 --> 01:36:20,854
Let's say we're going to decide that 
they're going to play exactly the same 

1826
01:36:23,021 --> 01:36:24,100
game,
clearly,

1827
01:36:24,101 --> 01:36:25,600
obviously,
and,

1828
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:27,240
and horribly.
You know,

1829
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:28,173
because I'm no fan of identity politics,
but what's sauce for the goose is sauce 

1830
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:33,040
for the Gander.
So,

1831
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:35,920
but I would recommend that people don't 
do it because you know,

1832
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,560
the radical leftists and their damn 
identity politics is,

1833
01:36:38,561 --> 01:36:39,394
that's unbelievably pathological.
And if you decided to fight that by 

1834
01:36:42,221 --> 01:36:43,720
playing the same game,
you think,

1835
01:36:43,721 --> 01:36:44,554
well,
I'll play the same game and then I'll 

1836
01:36:45,071 --> 01:36:45,340
win.

1837
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:45,911
It's like,
you know,

1838
01:36:45,911 --> 01:36:48,970
you won't because by playing the game 
you lose.

1839
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:49,953
That's the thing about your political 
opponents is you don't play the damn 

1840
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:54,310
game.
You play a different game.

1841
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:55,750
And so,
you know,

1842
01:36:55,751 --> 01:36:56,584
what I've been trying to encourage 
people to do is instead of playing the 

1843
01:36:58,571 --> 01:36:59,404
collectivist game,
and that would include alt-right 

1844
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:02,410
identity politics,
say,

1845
01:37:02,670 --> 01:37:03,503
um,
is to play the individual's game and to 

1846
01:37:05,561 --> 01:37:07,930
get their act together the best revenge 
I would say,

1847
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:09,760
but you shouldn't be doing it for 
revenge.

1848
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:10,623
But the best revenge against the 
collective last of us collectivist 

1849
01:37:13,341 --> 01:37:14,174
leftists is to live a stalwart,
meaningful and high quality individual 

1850
01:37:18,161 --> 01:37:18,994
life.
And that's also the pathway that 

1851
01:37:20,531 --> 01:37:23,170
requires the most responsibility and 
sacrifice.

1852
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:26,380
And so I think is the most honorable and
least self deceptive.

1853
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:27,543
So

1854
01:37:35,740 --> 01:37:38,200
what is your view on the Book Slash 
Movie Fight Club?

1855
01:37:38,201 --> 01:37:41,680
I thought fight club was deeply fascist 
in a very interesting way.

1856
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:43,420
Um,
I mean I,

1857
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:44,323
I'm saying that I'm saying that some in 
some way dismissively although I 

1858
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:50,070
actually liked the movie.
I also think it was a,

1859
01:37:50,071 --> 01:37:52,970
it was fascist because it,
it,

1860
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,590
it was a celebration in some sense of 
force.

1861
01:37:55,591 --> 01:37:59,460
It was fascist sort of in the same way 
that the iron man character is fascist,

1862
01:37:59,461 --> 01:38:00,540
you know?
Um,

1863
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:01,763
but I also thought it was a really 
interesting exploration of the idea of 

1864
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:06,930
developing the shadow.
And so,

1865
01:38:07,290 --> 01:38:10,590
and I do believe that if men don't 
become consciously dangerous,

1866
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:11,424
they become unconsciously dangerous.
And so it's much better to become 

1867
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:16,110
consciously dangerous.
And it's something that every man should

1868
01:38:16,111 --> 01:38:16,944
really aim at.
So you should be someone that no one 

1869
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:19,854
will mess with now,
but then you should keep that under 

1870
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:22,710
control,
right?

1871
01:38:22,711 --> 01:38:24,000
You should be,
first of all,

1872
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:26,430
you should be harmless and naive,
then you're a child,

1873
01:38:26,820 --> 01:38:29,130
then you should develop your capacity to
be dangerous,

1874
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:32,550
then you should bring that capacity to 
be dangerous under control.

1875
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:35,190
Then that makes you a man as far as I'm 
concerned.

1876
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:36,353
So

1877
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,630
Jared Chan says,
I just wanted to thank you very much.

1878
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,830
Love you heaps,
man.

1879
01:38:44,270 --> 01:38:46,550
Lol.
I'm slowly reading all of hume's books.

1880
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:47,361
Thanks to you.
Well,

1881
01:38:47,361 --> 01:38:49,490
you have to read them slowly,
man.

1882
01:38:49,491 --> 01:38:51,590
There's no way you can read those fast.
Like,

1883
01:38:51,591 --> 01:38:52,424
watch out for yourself because those 
things play vicious games with your 

1884
01:38:54,831 --> 01:38:56,660
mind.
So praying for you.

1885
01:38:56,690 --> 01:38:58,340
Well good.
I could use some prayer,

1886
01:38:58,341 --> 01:39:00,050
man.
So thanks jared.

1887
01:39:00,051 --> 01:39:03,170
Much appreciate it.
So good luck with the reading and,

1888
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:04,100
uh,
you know,

1889
01:39:04,101 --> 01:39:04,934
make sure you're doing something 
practical and easy at the same time 

1890
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,870
because young,
he's hard on person.

1891
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:09,973
That's for sure.
If you really want to twist your head 

1892
01:39:11,391 --> 01:39:13,040
and a knot,
you could do some reading.

1893
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,320
You could read some niche at the same 
time.

1894
01:39:15,321 --> 01:39:16,450
It's a nice adjunct.
Uh,

1895
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:19,100
though you'll wrote some books on nature
like,

1896
01:39:19,140 --> 01:39:19,910
um,
his,

1897
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:22,400
his commentaries on thus spake Sarah 
Booster.

1898
01:39:22,730 --> 01:39:23,563
So,
uh,

1899
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,340
yeah.
Good to hear from you.

1900
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:26,780
Thanks.
Thanks very much man.

1901
01:39:28,260 --> 01:39:28,550
Okay,

1902
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:29,660
so let's see.

1903
01:39:51,530 --> 01:39:52,363
Whoa,
still haven't quite mastered this live 

1904
01:39:53,601 --> 01:39:55,340
chat thing.
It zooms around quite a bit.

1905
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:56,593
Hey,
when was that high school student 

1906
01:39:57,291 --> 01:39:58,124
program?
You were coming without coming out with 

1907
01:39:59,301 --> 01:40:00,200
happening?
Oh,

1908
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,034
that's the,
uh,

1909
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,293
that's the future authoring.
But the self authoring program for high 

1910
01:40:04,071 --> 01:40:04,970
school students,
man,

1911
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:07,490
we're trying to get that out by,
within a month,

1912
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:10,580
but I can't say for sure because it's a 
software development program,

1913
01:40:10,581 --> 01:40:13,010
but we're aiming out to fall,
that's for sure.

1914
01:40:13,011 --> 01:40:14,270
So,
um,

1915
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:15,980
I know we're hoping it'll be a killer.
Like,

1916
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,890
like the university self authoring 
program was,

1917
01:40:18,891 --> 01:40:19,610
you know,
uh,

1918
01:40:19,610 --> 01:40:20,443
for those of you who don't know,
you probably all know cause you're 

1919
01:40:22,281 --> 01:40:23,114
patriotic subscribers.
But the future authoring program seems 

1920
01:40:25,551 --> 01:40:28,700
to improve the performance of college 
students by about 25%.

1921
01:40:28,701 --> 01:40:30,830
We're hoping with the high school 
students to uh,

1922
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:32,713
um,

1923
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:34,813
we'll have the same impact at a much 
earlier age and to teach kids to define 

1924
01:40:37,921 --> 01:40:40,800
themselves voluntarily and to start 
charting their destiny.

1925
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:41,634
That would be a lovely thing.
And we're going to sell directly to the 

1926
01:40:42,871 --> 01:40:46,230
high school students instead of trying 
to go into schools and so forth,

1927
01:40:46,231 --> 01:40:49,680
which I think would be just an exercise 
in frustration and utility.

1928
01:40:50,340 --> 01:40:52,920
I shouldn't say that.
And I don't know how this got set up.

1929
01:40:52,921 --> 01:40:53,754
I probably push some button that I 
didn't even notice is that some of you 

1930
01:40:55,691 --> 01:40:56,524
seem to be donating money and the money 
is associated with questions and I've 

1931
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:00,754
clicked on some of those and I hope,
I'm not sure what to make of that 

1932
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:04,594
exactly.
Because I don't know how it happened 

1933
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:06,934
exactly.
And I want to make sure that I get 

1934
01:41:08,561 --> 01:41:10,450
questions from everyone as much as I 
can.

1935
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:13,780
So if I miss you,
I hope that you're not donating unless I

1936
01:41:13,781 --> 01:41:15,280
actually click on your question.

1937
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,560
So,
but if that isn't the case,

1938
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:18,394
then I apologize.
I'm trying to keep up with as many 

1939
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:23,980
questions as I possibly can't.
Thoughts on the Jews.

1940
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,173
Well,
the first thing I could say about Jews 

1941
01:41:26,111 --> 01:41:28,690
is that a lot of my friends are happen 
to be Jewish.

1942
01:41:28,691 --> 01:41:29,524
And I think that's partly because Jewish
people and me and that's in part a 

1943
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:35,650
cultural thing,
are very,

1944
01:41:35,651 --> 01:41:36,484
very interested in ideas.
And I happened to be very interested in 

1945
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:41,410
ideas and so I have a great affinity for
Jewish people.

1946
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:42,640
And so,
um,

1947
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:43,533
and I think that Jewish people are 
overrepresented in positions of 

1948
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:47,434
competence and authority and that's 
often because they're extraordinarily 

1949
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:50,951
competent.
So,

1950
01:41:50,951 --> 01:41:51,970
you know,
hurry for them.

1951
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:54,220
That's how it looks to me.
So

1952
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:58,720
what do you have to say about girls who 
grew up without fathers?

1953
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:01,443
Be Very careful in who you choose as a 
mate because you don't have that much 

1954
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:06,400
experience with what constitutes a good 
man.

1955
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,620
And so I would say be cautious,
man.

1956
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,850
Be Cautious.
Look for someone who treats you well and

1957
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,320
not because of weakness.
You know,

1958
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:15,670
who's who,
don't be,

1959
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:19,330
don't confuse being afraid to offend you
with treating you well.

1960
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:20,433
Someone who treats you well as someone 
who's tough and forthright and self 

1961
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:23,934
reliant,
but who is able to listen and to 

1962
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,960
negotiate in particular and to tell you 
the truth.

1963
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:30,370
And so,
and,

1964
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,670
and don't give yourself away too easily.
And that's what I would say to girls,

1965
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:35,860
period is don't give yourself away too 
easily.

1966
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:37,780
It's a big mistake.
You'll regret it.

1967
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:39,250
You'll regret it.
So

1968
01:42:50,410 --> 01:42:54,430
I'm starting to slow down here.
Nature was pretty fun to read.

1969
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:55,690
Got All his works.
Nino,

1970
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:56,524
the sinner.
Well that should really help you with 

1971
01:42:57,611 --> 01:42:58,840
your sitting there,
Nino.

1972
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,700
So yeah.
Nicha he's a,

1973
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:02,080
he's a trip,
that's for sure.

1974
01:43:02,081 --> 01:43:03,810
If you guys are thinking about reading 
each of,

1975
01:43:03,811 --> 01:43:06,090
don't start with thus,
thus spake Sarah through story.

1976
01:43:06,091 --> 01:43:08,740
You should read that last,
I would start with beyond good and evil.

1977
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:10,053
And uh,
a fun is a pretty weird way to describe 

1978
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:14,020
it though.
Read Dostoyevsky too.

1979
01:43:14,021 --> 01:43:14,854
That'd be good for you.
What advice would you give to a person 

1980
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:18,124
high in agreeableness and 
conscientiousness get a significant 

1981
01:43:20,621 --> 01:43:24,490
other who is left leaning or one who is 
leaning towards radical leftism?

1982
01:43:25,450 --> 01:43:26,283
I would say get a significant other.
Don't get a significant other based on 

1983
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:31,330
their political,
uh,

1984
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,680
predispositions,
you know,

1985
01:43:33,210 --> 01:43:34,043
um,
get a significant other that you can 

1986
01:43:35,861 --> 01:43:36,694
trust and that you are attracted to and 
that you want to build a life with and 

1987
01:43:39,490 --> 01:43:40,323
leave the political stuff for,
for when it's necessary because the 

1988
01:43:43,421 --> 01:43:46,120
political stuff should only be engaged 
in when it's necessary.

1989
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:49,300
Do you think Islam is compatible with 
the West?

1990
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:55,060
Not In any self evident manner.
So,

1991
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,313
um,
although I would also say that Islam is 

1992
01:43:57,341 --> 01:43:58,360
part of the West,
you know,

1993
01:43:58,361 --> 01:44:00,520
we should actually give that some 
consideration.

1994
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,520
Do you mean is Islam compatible with 
Christianity?

1995
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:06,490
Um,
I hope so,

1996
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,353
but it isn't obvious to me in what 
manner it's compatible with 

1997
01:44:10,151 --> 01:44:11,260
Christianity.
We'll see.

1998
01:44:11,261 --> 01:44:14,380
That doesn't mean that Muslims aren't 
compatible with Western society.

1999
01:44:14,381 --> 01:44:15,214
You know,
I mean,

2000
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:19,960
many Muslims are no more radical Muslims
than Christians are radical Christians.

2001
01:44:19,961 --> 01:44:20,794
In fact,
many Muslims aren't any more Muslims 

2002
01:44:22,511 --> 01:44:24,490
than many Christians are Christians.
And so,

2003
01:44:24,910 --> 01:44:25,743
you know,
I would say generally speaking across 

2004
01:44:27,671 --> 01:44:28,504
populations,
people are pretty decent and as 

2005
01:44:31,061 --> 01:44:32,170
individuals,
you know,

2006
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,273
generally speaking,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that 

2007
01:44:35,741 --> 01:44:38,200
the belief systems that they inhabit or 
commensurate.

2008
01:44:38,201 --> 01:44:39,034
So,

2009
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:40,743
okay.

2010
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:41,920
All Cap,
right?

2011
01:44:41,921 --> 01:44:44,600
Says I think you should fortify your 
ideas on Christianity.

2012
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:49,660
I am doing my best to do exactly that.
So Dr. Peterson,

2013
01:44:50,391 --> 01:44:53,390
what was your relationship like with 
your mother and father hits pr?

2014
01:44:53,410 --> 01:44:54,920
It was,
andy is pretty good.

2015
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:56,480
They're both still alive.
Thank God.

2016
01:44:56,481 --> 01:44:59,840
I just went up and saw my dad for his 
80th birthday.

2017
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:01,530
He's in good shape.
Um,

2018
01:45:01,910 --> 01:45:04,310
I actually gave him a Keka Stan,
he flag as a joke,

2019
01:45:04,311 --> 01:45:05,144
which he really appreciated.
So I think he's got that flying up in 

2020
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:09,800
his cabin way the hell up in northern 
Saskatchewan,

2021
01:45:09,801 --> 01:45:12,150
which I think is pretty comical.
Um,

2022
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:13,423
I loved my parents deeply there.
They've been a great source of support 

2023
01:45:16,611 --> 01:45:18,200
for me.
My father,

2024
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,930
I had some struggles with my father when
I was an adolescent,

2025
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:24,620
partly because I think partly because I 
was depressed and so was he.

2026
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:27,620
Um,
he was a great father when I was a young

2027
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:28,130
child.

2028
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:31,490
He spent so much time with me and paid 
so much attention to me and taught me to

2029
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:36,140
read and like I have nothing but great 
memories of him before grade six.

2030
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:38,820
And then we had about three years that 
were rocky mall,

2031
01:45:38,821 --> 01:45:39,654
more than that,
probably about five years that were 

2032
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:42,320
rocky,
um,

2033
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:45,620
which we both contributed to.
And so did other circumstances,

2034
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:49,310
but mean since I moved away from home,
which I did at 16,

2035
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:51,950
um,
we've got along just fine and I think we

2036
01:45:51,951 --> 01:45:52,784
have an absolutely superb relationship 
and they've been incredibly useful and 

2037
01:45:55,581 --> 01:45:57,120
supportive in the last year.
So,

2038
01:45:57,350 --> 01:46:01,160
and my mother is a wonderful person.
She's a little too agreeable for her own

2039
01:46:01,161 --> 01:46:02,390
good,
but she's tough.

2040
01:46:02,990 --> 01:46:04,520
And she had a,
you know,

2041
01:46:04,650 --> 01:46:05,483
she raised three kids and she went out 
and had a career and she's put up with 

2042
01:46:07,941 --> 01:46:10,220
my dad who's a pretty tough,
stubborn guy.

2043
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,503
And,
uh,

2044
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:13,213
she's a lovely person.
I love her deeply and she's been very 

2045
01:46:15,381 --> 01:46:16,460
good to my kids.
And,

2046
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:17,690
uh,
um,

2047
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:18,650
I've had,
uh,

2048
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:21,050
I have,
I have had a good relationship with them

2049
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:21,884
and I,
I would say it's just gotten better and 

2050
01:46:22,791 --> 01:46:25,280
better as we've got older and straighten
ourselves out.

2051
01:46:25,281 --> 01:46:27,290
And I would say that about my whole 
family,

2052
01:46:27,291 --> 01:46:31,310
including my sister and my brother and 
their family and it's functioning pretty

2053
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:33,680
damn well.
And so thank God for that man.

2054
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:35,143
So

2055
01:46:37,410 --> 01:46:39,780
I have a friend who's considering 
majoring in psychology.

2056
01:46:39,781 --> 01:46:41,440
What advice would I give them?
Um,

2057
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:44,670
stick to the biological end of it as 
much as possible.

2058
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:47,160
Uh,
with the exception of the clinical great

2059
01:46:47,161 --> 01:46:47,994
clinical works because they're very much
reading master your damn statistics 

2060
01:46:51,691 --> 01:46:54,360
because that'll open up career doors for
you,

2061
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:56,460
nail your grades,
go get a degree.

2062
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:57,294
In clinical psychology,
a phd in clinical psychology is so 

2063
01:46:59,281 --> 01:47:01,860
valuable that it's,
it's almost incomprehensible.

2064
01:47:02,250 --> 01:47:03,083
So,
um,

2065
01:47:03,330 --> 01:47:05,640
that's what I would say and,
and uh,

2066
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:07,103
learn to analyze the research reports 
and pay attention and it can be an 

2067
01:47:10,141 --> 01:47:13,530
absolutely great career.
All right guys,

2068
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:18,560
it's been a long day.
I spent most of today writing my chapter

2069
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:22,770
seven of my new book called 12 rules for
life,

2070
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:25,860
which is absolutely deadly chapter.
It's just about killed me.

2071
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:27,053
I have gone over today,
I went over every word and every 

2072
01:47:29,911 --> 01:47:34,170
sentence and rewrote them.
And it's a chapter on sacrifice and work

2073
01:47:34,171 --> 01:47:38,430
and the battle between good and evil and
Christianity and,

2074
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:42,000
and the nature of a meaningful life.
And it's,

2075
01:47:42,030 --> 01:47:44,440
it's been hard.
And um,

2076
01:47:45,310 --> 01:47:45,750
yeah.

2077
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:46,583
And I'm tired and although this has been
great fun and I would like to say in 

2078
01:47:50,431 --> 01:47:51,600
closing,
once again,

2079
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:54,840
thank you very much for the support and 
for all of the,

2080
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:55,973
I mean,
I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the 

2081
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:01,230
positive response my work has got over 
the last year.

2082
01:48:01,560 --> 01:48:04,250
It's been very,
uh,

2083
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:09,470
I've been amazingly well compensated 
both financially and psychologically for

2084
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:13,140
my efforts,
which I'm thrilled about.

2085
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:18,170
And I hope that I can keep delivering to
you what it is that you seem to be.

2086
01:48:19,650 --> 01:48:21,750
Um,
what would you say?

2087
01:48:22,590 --> 01:48:23,423
I hope that I can continue to deliver 
whatever it is that I'd been delivering 

2088
01:48:28,201 --> 01:48:29,034
in the past.
That all of you have been finding a 

2089
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:32,880
value.
I am doing my best to do that.

2090
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:33,714
I think it's the right way forward out 
of this bloody chaotic political mess 

2091
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:38,130
that we're in.
It's the,

2092
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:38,791
Oh,
and I mean,

2093
01:48:38,791 --> 01:48:39,624
I've been thinking about that for years.
You know that the way out of the 

2094
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:46,641
ideological morass is the strengthening 
and fortification of the individual.

2095
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:50,010
And I hope you all participate in that 
because it's,

2096
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,260
there's,
there's,

2097
01:48:53,190 --> 01:48:55,980
there's,
it's a Cliche,

2098
01:48:55,981 --> 01:48:57,930
but I'm getting tired.
So it's the best I can do.

2099
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,764
There's no limits to what a person who 
decides to put themselves together can 

2100
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:03,114
do.
And so I would very much encourage all 

2101
01:49:05,161 --> 01:49:05,994
of you to aim at that because what the 
hell else have you got to do in this 

2102
01:49:09,151 --> 01:49:11,070
like veil of tears?
That's tragic.

2103
01:49:11,071 --> 01:49:14,250
Veil of tears,
but put yourself together and prevail.

2104
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,230
And so on that note,
man,

2105
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:18,900
over now,
and I'll talk to you all in a month.
