00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,040
Hello Vancouver.
Thank you.

2
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,600
Alright,
so we have an interesting situation 

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:42,600
here.
Um,

4
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,780
obviously this is part two and a few of 
you were here for what took place last 

5
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,880
night.
We're going to find a way to catch you 

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,200
all up pretty quick on what took place,
but before we do that,

7
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,310
I thought it might make sense to talk to
you about where we are in this 

8
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:03,271
discussion and why it matters and it 
matters not just for those of us on 

9
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,661
stage,
but it matters very much for you all in 

10
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:07,000
the audience.
The point is basically this,

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,560
we've arrived at a place in history 
where the sensemaking apparatus,

12
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:13,810
that usually helps us figure out what to
think about.

13
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:16,780
Things has obviously begun to come 
apart.

14
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,330
The political parties,
the uh,

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,500
the university is journalism.
All of these things have stopped making 

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,781
sense and alternative sensemaking 
networks have begun to rise.

17
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,850
And the one that we ended up being a 
part of seems to be beating the odds 

18
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,411
with respect to staying alive and being 
a vibrant part of the conversation.

19
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,500
But that depends on something.
It depends on our ability to upgrade.

20
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,930
What we can discuss and navigate and Sam
and Jordan have run a foul of each other

21
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,690
in the past,
as you all know,

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,750
and so our ability to upgrade the 
conversation such that they're able to 

23
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,400
find common ground and for us to move 
forward together is potentially very 

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,940
important.
A very important upgrade.

25
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,330
Now that upgrade in the modern era 
includes you all because our 

26
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,060
conversation and your conversations are 
all now linked through the Internet.

27
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:18,061
So the ground rules for tonight involve 
you not filming what takes place on 

28
00:02:19,151 --> 00:02:24,151
stage tonight.
And the reason for that is because what 

29
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:27,751
takes place on stage tonight has 
consequences and the freer that Sam and 

30
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:32,791
Jordan feel to use new tools to try out 
positions that maybe they haven't 

31
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,550
explored before.

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,390
The more likely we are to succeed.
So please don't film,

33
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,630
but that does not mean that we don't 
want you talking about what was 

34
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,630
discussed here tonight.
In fact,

35
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,191
we're very excited to see what you all 
make of this conversation and where it 

36
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:51,781
heads so in an effort to get you up to 
speed on where we got yesterday.

37
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:57,841
And I think the evidence is strong.
We all felt and the discussion online 

38
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:03,121
suggests that we actually accomplished 
quite a bit yesterday that we made 

39
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:07,531
headway in an effort to attempt to keep 
that momentum going,

40
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,810
but we're going to do is we're going to 
have sam and Jordon Steele,

41
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:15,811
man each other's points from last night 
so that you can hear what that sounds 

42
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:15,880
like.

43
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,180
Now,

44
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,610
for those of you who have ever tried 
steel manning,

45
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:29,280
somebody point with whom you have a 
severe disagreement,

46
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:33,420
you know just how hard this is,
so let's give them some leeway.

47
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,430
Sam,
would you be willing to start?

48
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,450
Sure,
sure.

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,200
Thank you.

50
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,970
Well,
first let me just make the obvious point

51
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:49,971
that that probably isn't so obvious once
you take the time to put yourself in our

52
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:55,101
shoes,
but just imagine how surreal it is for 

53
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:59,400
us to be who we are.
Simply having a conversation about ideas

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,300
and to be able to put a date on the 
calendar and have all of you show up for

55
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:03,860
this.
I mean,

56
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:05,260
it's just an amazing privilege.

57
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,940
Thank you for coming out.

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,960
So,
so here's what I think,

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,570
Jordan,
things I'm getting wrong.

60
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,140
I think that was grammatically correct.
Maybe there's another note in there,

61
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:28,141
but clearly I don't understand how 
valuable stories are,

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,640
how deep they go,
how did the degree to which story is in 

63
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,500
code,
not only the wisdom of our ancestors,

64
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:43,501
but quite possibly the wisdom borne of 
the hard knocks of evolution of the 

65
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,650
species.
Right,

66
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:49,651
so there's no telling how deep the 
significance of the information encoded 

67
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:54,600
in stories goes and there's a class of 
stories that are religious stories and 

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,371
their religious for a reason because 
they're dealing with the deepest 

69
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:01,150
questions in human life.
They're questions about what constitutes

70
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:03,040
a good life,
what's worth living for,

71
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:08,041
what's worth dying for.
These are things that if each individual

72
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,390
just thrust from onto the stage of his 
own life not knowing where he is and 

73
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:21,421
tasked with figuring out how to live all
on his own or even in a collection of of

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,870
others who are similarly unguided by 
ancient wisdom,

75
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,440
this is not knowledge we can.
We can recapitulate for ourselves easily

76
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,751
and so we we edit or ignore the these 
ancient stories at our apparel at some,

77
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,070
at minimum,
and some considerable risk because we 

78
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,341
don't know how much we don't really know
what baby is in the bath water and so we

79
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:56,401
should have immense respect for these 
traditions and the,

80
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,960
this is well,
this has yet to be discovered tonight.

81
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:09,740
I'm still not quite clear about how this
links up with,

82
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:15,290
with more metaphysical propositions 
about the origins of these have certain 

83
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,981
of these stories,
but at minimum my criticism of religion 

84
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,130
because it tends to focus on the most 
obvious case of a zero sum contest 

85
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:33,031
between religious dogmatism and 
scientific open ended discussion is 

86
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,590
doesn't address this core issue of the 
significance of religious thinking and 

87
00:06:41,591 --> 00:06:46,591
religious narrative because I am,
for the most part just shooting fishing 

88
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,900
in a barrel,
criticizing fundamentalists,

89
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
uh,
and the kind of God that the 

90
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,991
fundamentalists believe in the God who 
is an invisible person who hates 

91
00:06:57,991 --> 00:07:00,700
homosexuals.
Obviously that's not the deep,

92
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,150
the deepest version of these religious,
this or this.

93
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,010
This essentially what is a narrative 
technology for orienting human life.

94
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,380
In the cosmos,
so maybe I'll leave it there,

95
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:13,360
but that's I think what Jordan thinks.

96
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,910
Thanks

97
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,720
for use steel man.
Sam's point.

98
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,320
How did you feel about his encapsulation
of yours?

99
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,970
Well,
I'm convinced.

100
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:30,600
Yeah,

101
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,240
I mean,
well,

102
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,960
I got a couple of things to say about 
it.

103
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:37,680
It's like,
first of all,

104
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,530
I think it was accurate,
concise,

105
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,640
fair.
I also think that this is a more 

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,121
technical note in some senses that if,
if you ever want to think about 

107
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:50,640
something that's exactly what you have 
to do,

108
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,030
right?
You want to take arguments that are 

109
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,561
against your perspective and you want to
make them as strong as you possibly can 

110
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,320
so that you can fortify your arguments 
against them.

111
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:00,630
You don't want to make them weak because
that just makes you weak.

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,490
And so,
you know,

113
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Sam and I are both scientists and it 
really is the case that what scientists 

114
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,121
are trying to do.
And I think what we're actually trying 

115
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,011
to do in this conversation genuinely is 
to try to find out if there's something 

116
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:15,270
that we're thinking that's stupid,
you know,

117
00:08:15,271 --> 00:08:20,271
because when,
when I'm laying out the arguments that 

118
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:23,481
Sam just summarize so well,
I've tried to generate a bunch of 

119
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,680
opposition to them in my own 
imagination.

120
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,280
And the arguments I put forward are ones
I can't undermine.

121
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,090
But that doesn't mean they're right.
It doesn't mean that at all.

122
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,810
And so if someone comes along who is,
and this is certainly the case,

123
00:08:36,811 --> 00:08:38,670
if you're a scientist who's worth his or
her salt,

124
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:40,080
if someone comes along and says,
hey look,

125
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:42,150
you made a mistake in this fundamental 
proposition,

126
00:08:42,151 --> 00:08:43,230
it's like,
yes,

127
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,300
great.
That means I can make progress towards a

128
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,170
more solid theory of being so.
And that's what we're trying to do.

129
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:51,870
And I do think it's working.
And so I thought that was just fine.

130
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Exactly dead on.
And I hope I can do justice to your 

131
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:56,900
position as so.
Okay.

132
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,401
So to summarize Sam's argument briefly 
and then I'm going to tell him lately 

133
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:05,400
that you guys know why he thinks I'm 
things.

134
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:07,050
At what things I'm not taking into 
account,

135
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,530
so sam believes that there are two 
fundamental dangers to psychological and

136
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:18,861
social stability,
religious fundamentalism essentially on 

137
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:23,391
the right and moral relativism and 
nihilism on the left and so the danger 

138
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:29,181
of the right wing position is that it 
enables people to arbitrarily 

139
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:33,351
established certain revealed axioms as 
indisputable truth and then to 

140
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:38,390
tyrannized themselves and other people 
with the claims that those are divine 

141
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,201
revelations and he sees that as part of 
the danger of religious fundamentalism 

142
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:45,280
and maybe religious thinking in general,
but also as something that characterizes

143
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,810
second or totalitarian states that also 
has a religious aspect.

144
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,940
So that's on the right and then on the 
left.

145
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:55,941
Well the problem with the,
with the moral relativism nihilism 

146
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:59,930
position is that it leaves us with no 
orientation and it also flies in the 

147
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,810
face of common sense observations.
That there are ways to live that are bad

148
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,430
and that there are ways to live that are
good,

149
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:10,431
that people can generally agree on.
And that statements about those general 

150
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,150
agreements about how to live can be 
considered factual.

151
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Now so and then the next part of Sam's 
argument is that we require a value 

152
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,550
system that allows us to escape these 
twin dangers.

153
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,190
One stultifies us and the other leaves 
us hopeless,

154
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:26,430
let's say,
and that value system has to be grounded

155
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,431
in something real and the only thing 
that he can see that actually 

156
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:35,391
constitutes real in any provable sense 
and there's a certain amount of 

157
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,660
historical and conceptual weight behind 
this claim,

158
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:41,190
is the domain of empirical facts as as 
they'd be manifested in the sciences and

159
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,191
technologies that have made us 
incredibly powerful and increasingly 

160
00:10:46,191 --> 00:10:49,551
able to flourish in the world,
and so we need to ground our value 

161
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:50,910
propositions in something that we've 
been able to determine,

162
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:55,911
has genuine solidity to so that we can 
so that we can orient ourselves properly

163
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:59,310
so that we can make moral claims and 
that we can avoid these two endangers.

164
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,300
We can begin with some basic facts that 
we can identify,

165
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,510
as I mentioned very briefly,
what constitutes a bad life.

166
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,160
Endless pain,
suffering,

167
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,910
anxiety,
tremendous amount of negative emotions,

168
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:15,911
short term lifespan.
All the things that no one would choose 

169
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:15,911
voluntarily for themselves.
If,

170
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:20,290
if we would all agree that they were 
thinking in a healthy manner and we can 

171
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,801
contrast that sort of domain of horror 
with the good life which might involve 

172
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:29,010
while certainly freedom from privation 
and want and undo threat and anxiety and

173
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,160
hope for the future and all of that,
and that we can agree that those are 

174
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,160
polls,
good,

175
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,850
bad and good,
and that that's a factual claim,

176
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,510
so he,
Sam also claims that we can define the 

177
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,541
good life.
This is an extension of it with 

178
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:46,670
reference to flourishing and wellbeing 
and that that that can actually be 

179
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,881
measured and that we should and can 
inform the idea of flourishing and 

180
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:50,730
wellbeing with empirical data.

181
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,330
Having said all that,
he also a what would a domain of inquiry

182
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:03,090
open that would be centered on the 
possibility that some of the ideas that 

183
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,050
have been encapsulated in religious 
phenomenology,

184
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:08,110
if not in religious dogma,
it might be worth pursuing as well.

185
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:13,111
That there might be wisdom that can 
practically be applied in terms of 

186
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,610
perception too,
to spiritual practices.

187
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,650
Although those become dangerous,
dangerous,

188
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,350
increasingly dangerous as they become 
ensconced in dogma.

189
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,860
And so that's Sam's position,
and then his criticism of my ideas I'm 

190
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,680
take,
he would say that it's facts,

191
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
not stories that constitute the ground 
for the proper science of wellbeing and 

192
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,600
that we don't need to be connected to 
stories,

193
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,660
ancient stories in particular to thrive 
and the reason for that or that these 

194
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,550
ancient stories are pathological in 
certain details,

195
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,680
especially in this specific claims they 
make up,

196
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,710
which,
which looks outrageous in some sense 

197
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,710
from a modern moral perspective.

198
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,230
And he believes that it's hand waving to
ignore those specific topics.

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,520
And with,
uh,

200
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,960
with uh,
what would you call it,

201
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:03,961
an optimistic overview of the entire 
context that they're dangerously 

202
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,720
outdated now,
if they ever were useful,

203
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:13,830
that they're subject to too many 
potential interpretations for any modern

204
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:19,371
usage to be reliably derived.
And so he believes that attempts to 

205
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:20,950
interpret these stories,
let's say,

206
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:26,790
are rife with so many potential errors 
of bias and interpretation and 

207
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,621
subjectivity that all the 
interpretations in some sense are 

208
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:34,951
unreliable and perhaps equally 
unreliable that their day is that worse 

209
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:36,520
than that.
Not only are they unreliable,

210
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,650
but they're dangerous in so far as the 
claims they lay out our pose,

211
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,290
a threat to scientific and enlightenment
values,

212
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,040
which are the true saviors of humanity 
as evidenced by our progress,

213
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,080
let's say over the last two or 300 
years,

214
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,400
and that they're also susceptible to the
totalitarian interpretation,

215
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:59,401
which I described earlier,
which confer upon the interpreter a 

216
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,820
sense of and then a claim to reveal 
truth.

217
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,300
And so I would say that Sam's argument 
and his and his criticisms of my 

218
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,880
position,
so.

219
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,150
Okay,
so you write my next book.

220
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,151
All right,
thanks Sam.

221
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,920
Feel about that characterization of your
position.

222
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,230
Uh,
certainly close enough to get the 

223
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,230
conversation started.
I met.

224
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,200
There's a few the grounding stuff we 
have yet to talk about and I'm not as,

225
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I'm not as much a stickler for 
materialistic scientific empiricism as I

226
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,690
heard implied there,
but we can,

227
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:36,690
can,

228
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,640
we can come to that.
Okay.

229
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,680
So hold on.
I think from the point of view of the 

230
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:42,680
audience,
this is a,

231
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,271
this is a good barometer of where we got
to last night and I think actually the 

232
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:51,561
gains are really impressive,
which I have to say is me because 

233
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,870
there's something called regression to 
the mean.

234
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,590
Now if I catch either one of you 
regressing to the mean tonight,

235
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:02,591
I will hunt you down and I will ridicule
you on twitter tomorrow so you have a 

236
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:03,300
warrant.
Okay.

237
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,220
Right.
So do either one of you wants to now 

238
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,300
talk about what was missing from the 
other characterization or how do you 

239
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,680
want to move?
I think we should

240
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,150
touch this issue of,
of metaphorical truth because I think it

241
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,780
still gets at the distance between us.
Sure.

242
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:28,550
As a.
and it's happily this is you're afraid 

243
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,550
that you have.
You might want to do

244
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,480
prop up this phrase,
why not?

245
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,260
So the idea of metaphorical truth,
which I think actually is the 

246
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,191
reconciliation between at least the 
points that you guys each started out 

247
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:44,691
with,
is the idea that there are concepts 

248
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:47,721
which are literally false,
that we can falsify in a scientific 

249
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:52,430
rational sense,
but that if you behave as if they were 

250
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,241
true,
you come out ahead of where you were if 

251
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:56,880
you behave according to the fact that 
they are false.

252
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,230
And so to call these things simply false
is an error in effect.

253
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:06,231
The universe has left them true in some 
sense other than a purely literal one.

254
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:11,811
And so religions with them according to 
actually what you heard from both Sam 

255
00:16:11,811 --> 00:16:16,051
and Jordan,
religions would fall into this class of 

256
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,730
things.
These are encapsulations of,

257
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,210
uh,
stories and prescriptions that if you 

258
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,991
follow them,
irrespective of whether they literally 

259
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,900
describe the universe,
you end up with certain advantages that 

260
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,260
you may not know why they are there.
But nonetheless,

261
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:32,930
you are ahead of your,
uh,

262
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,040
your,
your head of your position if you were 

263
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,100
to navigate just simply on your,
your perceptions.

264
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,600
That's the concept.

265
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,910
Yeah.
So I think there's a good analogy that 

266
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,100
you and I stumbled onto after we did a 
podcast together.

267
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,130
You had a,
an analogy about a porcupine that could 

268
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:50,740
shoot its quills,
which many people balked at,

269
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,760
but listener and gave us a better one,
which was the idea that anyone who's 

270
00:16:56,801 --> 00:17:01,801
worked with guns at all must've heard 
this admonishment to treat every gun as 

271
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,200
if it is loaded.
Right?

272
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:10,201
And you actually last night when I 
alleged that you believed in God,

273
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,100
you corrected me.
He said,

274
00:17:12,101 --> 00:17:14,530
no,
you live as if God exists.

275
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,880
Right?
And so this seems like a,

276
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,950
there's a connection here.
So if,

277
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:25,210
if,
if I had a gun here that I wanted to 

278
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:25,210
show Brett,
if I know anything about guns,

279
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,180
I'm going to make damn sure that is 
unloaded,

280
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,550
right?
I'm going to pull back the slide.

281
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:30,490
I'm gonna,
drop the magazine,

282
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:35,491
pulled back the slide,
check the chamber and do this in a 

283
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:38,881
redundant fashion that that really looks
like I'm suffering from obsessive 

284
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,030
compulsive disorder.

285
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Maybe if it is truly redundant and then 
I'll hand it to Brad and Brett knows 

286
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,480
anything about guns.
He will do the same thing,

287
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,120
having just seen me do it and if he 
hands it back to me again,

288
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,820
I will do the same thing even though 
there,

289
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,140
there may be no ammunition around.
Right?

290
00:17:55,141 --> 00:18:00,141
So it really is crazy at the level of 
our explicit knowledge of the situation 

291
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:03,940
and yet absolutely necessary to do.
And it's,

292
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,630
it's not merely,
it's,

293
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,790
it runs very deep.
I mean,

294
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:12,990
I would even add to that whole time,
you were careful not to point the barrel

295
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,780
of the gun at anything you would be 
afraid to shoot.

296
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,590
And when people fail to live this way 
around guns,

297
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,620
they with some frequency actually shoot 
themselves or people close to them by 

298
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,350
accident.
Uh,

299
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,820
so it is really the only proper hedge 
against just the,

300
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,530
the,
the odds of being in proximity to,

301
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,740
to loaded weapons.

302
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,550
And yet if someone in the middle of this
operation came up to us and said,

303
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:46,550
you know,
actually there's a casino that just 

304
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,931
opened across the street that will take 
your bets about whether or not guns are 

305
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:52,491
loaded.
Would you like to bet a million dollars 

306
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:52,491
as to whether or not this gun is loaded?
Well,

307
00:18:52,491 --> 00:18:57,110
of course I would bet those million 
dollars every time that it's not loaded 

308
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:57,840
because I know it's not loaded.
So there's.

309
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,080
There's a,
there's a literal truth and a 

310
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,080
metaphorical truth where you know 
otherwise known as a very useful 

311
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,161
fiction,
which in this case is actually more 

312
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:10,470
useful than the truth.
Right?

313
00:19:10,471 --> 00:19:14,700
But the only way I can understand its 
utility is,

314
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,290
and,
and even utter the phrase metaphorical 

315
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,190
truth in a way that is comprehensible is
in the context of distinguishing it from

316
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:24,450
literal truth.
And

317
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,330
Go ahead.
This is fascinating Sam.

318
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,920
Actually this is,
this is I think next year.

319
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,350
I'm a little worried by how excited you 
are.

320
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,370
So I have a story that might be helpful 
about that.

321
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,980
And so you could,
you could tell me what you think about.

322
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,910
Okay.
Think about this.

323
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:42,420
Okay.
So,

324
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,230
so one of the things that I've been 
reconsidering since we talked last night

325
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,810
is,
is the nature of our dispute about the 

326
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,571
relationship between facts and values.
Because I think I can make a case that 

327
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,850
what I've been trying to do,
especially in my first book,

328
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:04,851
was to ground values in fact,
but I'm not doing it the same way that 

329
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:04,851
you are.
Exactly.

330
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,610
So.
So I,

331
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,520
I don't want to make that a point of 
contention so.

332
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,730
And I'll get to that moment.
But with regards to this metaphorical 

333
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:13,730
truth,
let me tell you something.

334
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,410
You tell me what you think about this.
So one of them,

335
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:21,411
things that's been observed by 
anthropologists worldwide is that human 

336
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:24,240
beings tend to make sacrifices.
So I'm going to spend two minutes,

337
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:27,330
three minutes laying out a sacrificial 
story.

338
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:32,331
And the reason I want to do it is 
because see what I think happened with 

339
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:36,531
regards to the origin of these profound 
stories is that people first started to 

340
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:40,650
behave in certain ways that had a 
survival significance.

341
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,400
And that was selected for.
And as a consequence of,

342
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:46,050
of,
of,

343
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,980
of,
of this standard

344
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,520
selection practices.
And so that was instantiated,

345
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:56,521
didn't behavior.
And then because we can observe 

346
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:56,521
ourselves because we're self conscious 
creatures,

347
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:00,920
that we started to make representations 
of those patterns and dramatize them.

348
00:21:00,921 --> 00:21:04,260
And then encapsulate them in stories,
so it's a bottom up from the.

349
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,390
So it would be sort of like chimpanzees 
or wolves become aware of their 

350
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,100
dominance hierarchy structures and the 
strategies that they use.

351
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,390
So a wolf,
for example,

352
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,520
if two wolves are having a dominance 
dispute,

353
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,620
one the wolf that gives up first lays 
down and puts his neck open so the other

354
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,930
wolf can tear it out.
And then the other wolf doesn't.

355
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,070
And you could say,
well,

356
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:28,480
it's as if a wolf is following a rule 
about not killing a weaker member of the

357
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,850
pack.
Of course wolves don't have rules,

358
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:35,851
they have behavioral patterns,
but a self conscious wolf would watch 

359
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,540
what the wolves were doing and then say,
well,

360
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,650
it's as if we're acting out the idea 
that each wolf in the pack has intrinsic

361
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,100
value.

362
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:47,550
And then that starts to be maybe that 
wolves would have a little story about 

363
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,550
the heroic for bearing wolf that doesn't
tear out the neck of its opponents and 

364
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,350
that that's good.
Well,

365
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,170
that's good wolf ethics and,
and,

366
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:54,850
and so,
but it's grounded,

367
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,710
but it's grounded in the actual 
behavior.

368
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,150
Okay.
So let's,

369
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,150
we'll put that aside for a second.
Now here,

370
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,090
here's the sacrificial story to human 
beings have made sacrifices.

371
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:09,091
It seems to be a standard practice all 
around the world and in the biblical 

372
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:12,541
narratives,
they would often sacrifice something of 

373
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,881
value like a,
like a valuable animal or like a child 

374
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:14,881
start.
Well,

375
00:22:14,881 --> 00:22:15,110
no,
no,

376
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,610
no.
Look,

377
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,360
look,
I'm not.

378
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,390
I'm not making light of this.
I know that human sacrifice was a part 

379
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,390
of this.

380
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,640
Yeah,
but that again,

381
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,000
so just to give you a crib on where my 
mind goes,

382
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,010
there is human.
Human sacrifice is as old a religious 

383
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,740
precept as we know about as a cultural 
universal.

384
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,170
The other sacrifices are derivations 
from Ed and circumcision is a surrogate 

385
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:43,350
for the far more barbaric act of human 
sacrifice and you know it,

386
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,490
it answers every test you would put to 
it with respect to its archetypal 

387
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:53,701
significance and it's,
it's compelling a presence in stories 

388
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:59,011
across all cultures,
but the horror is that it actually has 

389
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:03,841
taken place in all these cultures based 
on explicit beliefs in the presence of 

390
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,110
just just right Arthur scientific 
ignorance.

391
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,040
Flirt used that as the argument for the 
essential insanity of humanity.

392
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,470
We have nobody.
It's not just the insanity of humanity,

393
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,130
it's the misapprehension of the causal 
structure of the cosmos.

394
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,730
You don't know what the weather.
You don't know why people get sick.

395
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,790
You think your neighbor is capable of 
cast a magic spell.

396
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,310
It's on you.
You're ignorant of everything and you're

397
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:32,311
trying to force some order on things,
and so when you don't in the absence of 

398
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:35,920
engineers and you don't know why bill 
certain buildings fall down,

399
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,190
you actually can agree with your 
neighbor that maybe you should barrier 

400
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,500
first born child into every post hole of
this new building,

401
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:49,501
which in fact has took place and it's 
the consequence of ignorance and so that

402
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:55,530
the problem is if you're only going to 
talk about this notion of sacrifice,

403
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,530
very strange consequence of ignorance 
like you.

404
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:04,010
It's the notion that we're in 
relationship to invisible others that 

405
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,330
can,
that can mistreat us based on not having

406
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:09,420
offered enough were we are.
We're not precisely those others well,

407
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,440
but we're in relationship to the 
invisible others who will judge us in 

408
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:14,800
the future.
So again,

409
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,090
you're changing,
you're changing the noun in important 

410
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:20,090
way,
but I'm also trying to understand,

411
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,910
I'm not trying to argue against the 
horror of child sacrifice.

412
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,700
No,
I would never imagine,

413
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,760
but I'm also.
But I'm also find out what my work would

414
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,990
be much easier if you did that.

415
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,310
Yes,
yes,

416
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,190
yes.
And,

417
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,820
and the work of journalists as well,
they've tried that.

418
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,020
Pretty much anyone,

419
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,070
right?
That would be,

420
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,410
that would even be worse than enforced 
monogamy.

421
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:47,090
Hypothetical.
So,

422
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,150
okay.
So see,

423
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:54,151
I'm,
let's say that I'm trying to give the 

424
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:56,231
devil his due and I'm trying to 
understand from an evolutionary 

425
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:59,501
perspective,
like cognitive behavioral evolutionary 

426
00:24:59,501 --> 00:25:02,291
perspective,
let's say why that particular set of 

427
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:02,291
ideas would emerge and in many,
many,

428
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:07,031
many places perhaps autonomously or once
having emerged would spread like 

429
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:07,031
wildfire.
It's like,

430
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,040
because I'm not willing to only 
attribute it to ignorance,

431
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,060
now we can attribute it to ignorance.
No problem man,

432
00:25:13,061 --> 00:25:18,061
but,
but there's more going on there because 

433
00:25:18,061 --> 00:25:20,021
it is a human universal and like there's
all sorts of things that happened in 

434
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:23,321
nature as a consequence of biological 
and evolutionary processes that don't 

435
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,300
work out well for our current state of 
moral intuition,

436
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:27,290
like saying,
okay,

437
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:32,291
so one of the things,
because I've been thinking about this 

438
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,530
sacrificial motif for a very long time,
trying to figure out what that,

439
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,240
what,
what the hell's the idea here?

440
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,470
Exactly.
And so,

441
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,780
so here's,
here's one way of thinking about it.

442
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,910
If you give up something of value,
now you can gain something of more value

443
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:46,490
in the future.
Okay?

444
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,500
So let's think about that idea for a 
minute.

445
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,190
So the first thing is that's an,
that's a hell of an idea.

446
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,630
That's delayed,
delayed,

447
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,250
delayed gratification,
right?

448
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,550
That's the discovery of the future as 
well.

449
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,990
And so you might say,
well,

450
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,020
the notion of sacrifice is exactly the 
same thing as the discovery of the 

451
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:07,250
future.
If we give up something we really value,

452
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:12,251
now we can make a pact with the 
structure of existence itself such that 

453
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:14,150
better things will happen to us in the 
future.

454
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,150
Now,
okay,

455
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,170
now what's weird about this,
and it's hard to understand is that it 

456
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,130
works.
So when I talked to my students,

457
00:26:22,131 --> 00:26:23,330
for example,
and I say,

458
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,740
what did your parents sacrifice to send 
you to university?

459
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,010
Many of them are children are first 
generation immigrants and so like,

460
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,080
man,
they're on that story in a second,

461
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,940
right?
They know all sorts of things that their

462
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:39,941
parents sacrificed and they're delaying 
gratification in the present for a 

463
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:43,530
radically delayed return in the future.
Now you think animals,

464
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:48,531
generally speaking,
they might act out the idea of delayed 

465
00:26:48,531 --> 00:26:49,560
gratification as a consequence of 
running out their instincts,

466
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:54,561
but they don't conceptualize it.
It's not obvious that animals give up 

467
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:56,400
something they valued right now in order
to thrive in the future.

468
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,770
There's an old story about how to catch 
a monkey,

469
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,710
right?
So you put a jar up with rocks in it.

470
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,110
Then you put little candies and it's a 
narrow neck jar.

471
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:05,820
You put little candies on top of the 
rocks,

472
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,970
but if you candies in front of the of 
the jar,

473
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,100
then the monkey comes along and picks up
the candies,

474
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,230
puts his hand in the jar,
grabs the candies,

475
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,190
and can't get it out.

476
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,550
I still don't know if this actually 
works on monkeys or it's just a great 

477
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:19,550
story.
I don't know.

478
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,700
I don't know either and that I've heard.
I've heard,

479
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,370
I've heard various claims,
but.

480
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:24,810
But the point is you can go pick up the 
monkey.

481
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,970
He won't let go of the candidates.
Now perhaps he would,

482
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,210
but the.
The,

483
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,470
the issue is,
is that it's not obvious that animals 

484
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,010
will forgo and immediate gratification 
for a future gratification.

485
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,230
Now that don't think.
I don't think that's right actually,

486
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,180
and I actually want to hold the question
is,

487
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,150
will they do it consciously?
They might act it out.

488
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,520
They act it out.
That's not the issue.

489
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:49,580
It's very hard to know if it's conscious
because they won't respond to the 

490
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:49,580
questionnaires,
but I know,

491
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:53,100
I know obviously the,
the line between acting it out and 

492
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,210
becoming,
starting to consciously represented is a

493
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:55,890
tenuous one.

494
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,890
But what looks to me like what happened 
is that after we observed that people 

495
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,440
who were capable of delaying 
gratification,

496
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:08,580
sacrifice things that they valued in 
order to obtain a future goal,

497
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,610
and it work,
that we started to codify that as a 

498
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,370
representation and then started to act 
it out.

499
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,670
And so,
so the story and,

500
00:28:16,671 --> 00:28:19,290
and you'd say,
well that produced strange variance,

501
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,060
but,
but there's a reason for that too,

502
00:28:21,061 --> 00:28:23,490
as far as I can say.
So imagine this,

503
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:28,491
imagine that there's a rule of thumb 
sacrificing what you find valuable now 

504
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:32,310
will ensure certain benefits in the 
future.

505
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,830
Well then the question becomes how good 
could those future benefits be?

506
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,880
And so that might be heavenly,
let's say in the archetypal extreme and 

507
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,000
what's the ultimate sacrifice that you 
have to perform?

508
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,230
And then I would say,
well,

509
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,630
the child sacrifice fits into that 
category.

510
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:53,870
And so it's,
it's as if those ideas were pushed to 

511
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:53,870
the radical extreme.
And you could say,

512
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,560
well that's a pathological extreme.
It's like,

513
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,010
well it is,
it is a pathological extreme.

514
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,520
But,
but I think we also have to understand 

515
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,790
that some of the things that we've 
learned as we've evolved towards our 

516
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,271
current state of wisdom such as it is,
is that they were learned in a very 

517
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:15,831
bloody and catastrophic way.
They were learning with incredible 

518
00:29:15,831 --> 00:29:19,311
difficulty and delay of gratification 
was certainly one of those because it's 

519
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:20,790
a hell of a thing to learn when you're 
in conditions of privation.

520
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:21,090
Okay?

521
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,230
Yeah.
I think that the issue here for me is 

522
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,301
that you don't need a conception of.
You don't need any kind of positive 

523
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:35,691
gloss on human sacrifice as a meme or as
an archetype in order to form a coherent

524
00:29:38,221 --> 00:29:40,260
picture of the future that can motivate 
you.

525
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,560
So delayed,
delayed gratification is fully separable

526
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,930
from a notion that it might ever be 
rational or good to sacrifice a child as

527
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:55,600
an offering to an invisible other

528
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,460
that doesn't exist.
How do you know it's separate will?

529
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,230
Because that's the developmental 
history,

530
00:29:59,231 --> 00:29:59,980
as you said.

531
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,230
Well,
that so sacrifice,

532
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:04,870
and I think it is in fact historically 
separable,

533
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,340
but let.
Let's just say it's not.

534
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:08,620
Let's just say as a matter of our 
origins,

535
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,170
they're united,
they're of a piece,

536
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,070
it's just,
it is the genetic fallacy to care about 

537
00:30:17,231 --> 00:30:22,231
that origin.
I mean to say that the that is the only 

538
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:25,690
path forward toward an ocean of the 
future,

539
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,810
given where we've come from or that it's
somehow necessary to to venerate now or 

540
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:30,910
that it's.

541
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,620
But we do venerate the idea of sacrifice
now,

542
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:35,370
but I would say

543
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,600
we do a to to the detriment of our moral
intuitions in the religious context.

544
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:45,601
So for instance,
I think that the notion that 

545
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,260
Christianity,
Christianity is actually a cult of human

546
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:52,261
sacrifice.
It Christianity is not a religion that 

547
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:52,810
repudiates human sacrifice.
Christianity is a religion that says,

548
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,320
actually no human sacrifice is necessary
and there was only one that in fact was 

549
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:01,240
necessary and effective and that's the 
sacrifice of Jesus.

550
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,810
And I think that is when you dig into 
the details,

551
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,440
a not only a morally uninteresting 
vision of our circumstance and how we 

552
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:15,190
are,
how we can be redeemed,

553
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,170
it's morally a parent,
right?

554
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:18,690
So I think there's a better version.

555
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,430
Okay.
Let me ask you a question about that.

556
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:23,760
So in,
in,

557
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,570
in,
in the moral landscape,

558
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,630
you lay out this pathway,
there's the bad life and there's the 

559
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:30,700
good life,
right?

560
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,940
And you described what they were at.
The bad life is a variation of hellish 

561
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,631
circumstances.
In the good life is a variant of 

562
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:39,631
hypothetically the life that we would 
like to lead.

563
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,010
And your conception is that,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

564
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,430
your conception is that the proper 
pathway forward.

565
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:50,550
So that would be the moral endeavor is 
to move away from the bad and towards 

566
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:50,550
the good.

567
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,820
Yeah.
And so far as we understand which way is

568
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:53,370
up,
yes,

569
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,250
yes,
yes.

570
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,720
The basic claim is that we can be right 
or wrong with respect to,

571
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,000
to release.

572
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,700
We don't necessarily know how to do that
in an uncaring manner and we could 

573
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,840
subject that to approximation correction
along the way and we should.

574
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:14,050
But we can outline the broad scheme 
which is progressive way from hell 

575
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,560
towards something that's positive.
Yes.

576
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,250
Yes.
Okay.

577
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:19,940
So I would say that there is an implicit
claim in that,

578
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,800
that you should sacrifice everything in 
you that isn't serving that to that.

579
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,100
And I would say that that's essentially 
the same claim that's made in 

580
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Christianity.

581
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,100
Well,
again,

582
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,870
that is a,
I understand the impulse to up level 

583
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,890
these ignorance derived beliefs,
right?

584
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,990
To something that is morally that is 
interesting and palatable in the current

585
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:51,350
context.
And I understand you can do that.

586
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,690
My concern there is you can do that with
everything.

587
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:58,691
I mean you could do it with witchcraft.
Why not do the exact same thing you're 

588
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:01,400
doing with religion to the history of 
witchcraft.

589
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:02,930
Witchcraft is as,
as,

590
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,090
as well,
Margaret Lynch's would do that.

591
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,050
So that's a perfectly valid yet.
But so it's.

592
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:13,150
But it's a.
That should be of concern me that there 

593
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:13,150
are reasons why we don't want to endorse
them.

594
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,080
Modern witchcraft,
right?

595
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,350
Absolutely.
And so,

596
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,380
so you know,
when you're talking to and monitor 

597
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,380
witchcraft currently exists.
I mean,

598
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,930
you go to Africa,
they're there.

599
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,290
People are hunting albinos for their 
body parts because they believe in 

600
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,890
sympathetic magic kit and kids get 
killed as witches.

601
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:31,010
So this belief endures in certain 
pockets of humanity.

602
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,970
And we're right to it.
I just think at a certain point you have

603
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:39,020
to acknowledge that some ideas are not 
only wrong,

604
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,050
but they're,
their effects are disastrous or have 

605
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,741
been disastrous or will likely be even 
if good in certain circumstances will 

606
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:51,761
likely be disastrous in the future.
And then we shouldn't be hostage to 

607
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:52,850
these,
these ancient memes.

608
00:33:52,851 --> 00:33:57,851
We shouldn't have to figure out how to 
make the most of the worst idea that 

609
00:33:57,851 --> 00:34:00,300
anyone's ever had,
which is you should make,

610
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,990
you should sacrifice your first born 
child to

611
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,000
and you've never seen.

612
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Hold on Sam.
I want to hold your feet to the fire 

613
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,080
here.
Okay.

614
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,460
Two points.
One interesting observation.

615
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:16,880
When you presented the example,
so on your podcast,

616
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,440
I had argued that,
uh,

617
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:24,610
believing that porcupines can throw 
their quills might protect you from a 

618
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,941
porcupine.
That might we'll around even though 

619
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,690
porcupines can't throw their quills,
your listener sent the better example,

620
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,860
which was all guns are loaded.
When you presented it,

621
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:36,260
you didn't say all guns are loaded.
Well,

622
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,960
you said treat all guns as if they are 
loaded,

623
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:43,250
which is I think,
the same or reflects that you have faced

624
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:47,090
with any metaphorical truth,
which is that it can always be unpacked,

625
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,120
but it's actually.
That's the way Jordan talks about 

626
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,120
believing in God as well.

627
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,270
Right,
and actually so,

628
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:57,490
so this is.
But then if we take something like a 

629
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:57,490
you,
so you say,

630
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,860
right,
sacrifice of children is abhorrent,

631
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,800
let's say it is,
and then you say,

632
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,920
well,
Christianity hasn't a foregone the 

633
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,191
sacrifice of children.
In fact it's described one child who is 

634
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:14,611
sacrificed for everybody else,
but arguably that's an upgrade of some 

635
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:19,120
metaphorical truth that freeze those who
are adhering to this tradition from ever

636
00:35:19,121 --> 00:35:24,121
considering sacrificing your child and 
what it does is it provides a 

637
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,510
motivational structure that may in fact 
have very positive outgrowths though not

638
00:35:30,821 --> 00:35:35,821
literal.
The idea that someone would have 

639
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:38,160
sacrificed their own child for the 
benefit of everybody else,

640
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,340
not to have to.
That idea might engender a large amount 

641
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,280
of good work that would result as 
Jordan.

642
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,350
Let me just concede that the hardest 
case for me,

643
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:56,210
I met with,
which I did up top just in defining when

644
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,730
after you define metaphorical truth and 
I use the gun example,

645
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
there's certainly cases where the useful
fiction is more useful than the truth.

646
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,750
I would grant that,
but I think those cases are few and far 

647
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,870
between,
but handling guns is one of them.

648
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,170
It's just not useful when the.
When the casino opens across the street 

649
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,170
and you can play some million dollar 
bet,

650
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,900
right?
Then you want,

651
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,930
you want to have some purchase on the 
literal truth so you want to be able to.

652
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,740
And again this is psychologically 
interesting because,

653
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,960
and I keep coming,
coming back to the gun example because 

654
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,160
the one that that is viscerally real to 
me,

655
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:35,480
like if I have a real gun that I know to
be unloaded,

656
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,670
I still emotionally can't treat it as a 
harmless object.

657
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,670
I can't pointed at my child just for the
fun of it because you know that we're 

658
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,230
going to play cops and robbers and now 
with a real gun,

659
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:49,120
right?
This,

660
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,390
this.
I have A.

661
00:36:50,391 --> 00:36:55,391
I have a superstitious attachment to 
always being safe with a gun,

662
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,600
right,
edit,

663
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,780
and it's important.
It's important that that gets ingrained 

664
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,560
and yet it is not strictly raw if it's 
not irrational because it has good 

665
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,701
effects,
but it's not actually in register with 

666
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:10,940
what I know to be true factually in each
moment.

667
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,080
Right?
So very low cost,

668
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,200
very low cost,
very low cost.

669
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:18,380
It's not divided societies and causing 
people to go to war

670
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,280
and if you were going to teach a child 
gun safety,

671
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,400
you would want to encode this so that 
they would automatically know never to 

672
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,121
behave as if a gun is unloaded because 
that's what gets you into trouble as an 

673
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:30,160
adult.
Every,

674
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,190
every gun owner recognizes the 
distinction between the metaphorical 

675
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,301
truth in the literal truth here,
but I guess what I suspect is going on 

676
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:44,371
here is that your mechanism for dealing 
with the world involves unpacking all of

677
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:49,270
these things and I think it's highly 
productive,

678
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:54,300
but it also means that you have a hard 
time understanding why anybody would do 

679
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,651
anything different.
And that's the question is just because 

680
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,060
we can track fully the difference 
between guns.

681
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,200
Actually all being loaded and behaving 
as if all guns are loaded,

682
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,980
right?
That one,

683
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:07,900
there's no leftover,
there's nothing,

684
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,470
there's no mystery there,
right?

685
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:14,670
But there may be many of these things 
for which there is some difficulty 

686
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:18,391
lining up the metaphorical truth with 
the literal truth and operating 

687
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:20,800
according to the metaphorical truth 
might have advantages,

688
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,800
which I think is what your getting at so
well.

689
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,080
So here's,
here's another situation,

690
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:31,081
because you know,
we have to remember what kind of 

691
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:31,081
catastrophic past we emerged from.

692
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,840
How much privation ruled the world prior
to 18,

693
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:36,190
95 essentially,
and certainly

694
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,800
the farther back you go,
the more bloody and horrible it was.

695
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,670
I mean,
how often do you think it was necessary,

696
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:47,671
and this is not obviously something I'm 
in favor of and this is also one of 

697
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:51,691
these situations where we get to play 
with ideas that we might not otherwise 

698
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:55,081
play with.
How often do you think it was necessary 

699
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:58,231
for people in the past who had 
absolutely no access to birth control 

700
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:02,100
and who didn't have enough food to 
sacrifice a child for the survival of 

701
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,410
their family mean God only knows and 
that's it?

702
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,690
Well,
but that's worth thinking about.

703
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:08,870
It's like,
you know,

704
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
life is unbelievably cruel and difficult
and one of the problems that comes when 

705
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,911
you discover the future is that you 
might have to make the most painful of 

706
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:20,260
sacrifices and lots of lots of archaic 
people do this sort of thing.

707
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,200
They do that with their elderly people.
They do that with sick people.

708
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:28,201
They do that with infants that they 
deemed too fragile to survive like so 

709
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:32,431
part of child sacrifice,
and I know the literature on child 

710
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:34,300
sacrifice reasonably well.
Part of child sacrifice seemed to emerge

711
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:39,301
out of the observable necessity to leave
someone behind so that everyone else 

712
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:44,230
didn't die and we don't know how often 
that had to happen in the past.

713
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,470
It might've had to happen a lot.
Right now,

714
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,850
obviously just just in the interest of 
kind of conceptual clarity here,

715
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,630
human sacrifice is a larger horror than 
that,

716
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:58,960
so you have.
It was very common is the sacrificing of

717
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:03,961
other captives.
They didn't take the Aztec sacrifices 

718
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:03,961
where you,
you now have slaves,

719
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:06,880
some of whom you're going to have.
The aztecs sacrificed about 25,000

720
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:08,310
people a year.
Yeah,

721
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,900
look,
I mean it's clearly a bloody mess.

722
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,790
There's no doubt about that,
but you know,

723
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,370
one of the things that you see happening
in the biblical narrative,

724
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,371
which is extraordinarily interesting is 
that you see echoes of child sacrifice 

725
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:24,241
at the beginning,
but what happens is the sacrificial 

726
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:24,820
notion gets increasingly psychologized 
as the story progresses.

727
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:28,510
So you know,
you see that transition with Abraham and

728
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:32,260
Isaac were the were the sec or the child
sacrifice is actually forbidden,

729
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:36,520
although previously demanded by God and 
then you also see it as you already laid

730
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:41,521
out in the substitution of the 
circumcision for the idea of sacrifice 

731
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,550
itself and then what seems to happen.
See,

732
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:47,551
I'm trying to figure out how these ideas
developed site psychologically from 

733
00:40:47,551 --> 00:40:50,761
their behavioral underpinnings is that 
eventually it becomes psychologized 

734
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:51,130
completely so you can say,
well,

735
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,400
we can.
We can conceptualize a sacrifice in the 

736
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,981
abstract so my parents can sacrifice to 
send me to university without anything 

737
00:40:58,981 --> 00:40:59,980
or anyone having to die.

738
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,280
It transforms itself from something 
that's enacted out as a dramatic ritual 

739
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,010
into something that's a psychological 
reality,

740
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,280
but all that blood and catastrophe along
the way as part of the process by which 

741
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,380
the idea comes to emerge.
So what is the connection of all of this

742
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:19,381
because so there there is this history 
and I would argue we are busily trying 

743
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:23,920
to outgrow much of it,
if not most of it,

744
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:29,320
and whether its evolutionary history or 
just trying to transmute it so that it 

745
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,520
becomes.
We can,

746
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,230
we can maintain as you suggested,
we do.

747
00:41:33,231 --> 00:41:38,231
We can maintain what's useful in the 
tradition and throw out everything 

748
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:38,231
that's pathologic.

749
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes,
but we're constantly discovering a lack 

750
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,290
of fit between both our,
what we perceive ourselves as biological

751
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:51,350
imperatives and the cultural legacies of
just what Mommy and daddy taught me was 

752
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:51,900
true,
right,

753
00:41:51,901 --> 00:41:56,901
which we have now.
Every reason to believe might not be 

754
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:59,991
true and we're trying to optimize our 
thoughts and institutions and and 

755
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,540
relationships with one another for our 
current circumstance,

756
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:11,541
and yet we have this legacy effect of 
certain books and certain ways of 

757
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,630
speaking have a completely different 
status and they have the status because 

758
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,760
they may in fact it's imagined not be 
the products of merely previous human 

759
00:42:24,301 --> 00:42:29,301
minds,
but they may be the products of 

760
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:31,401
omniscience and that this is where the 
respect accorded to religious tradition 

761
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,360
is totally unlike the respect we would 
accord to anything else.

762
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,120
Mythology,
literature,

763
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,550
past science,
past philosophy.

764
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:46,551
I mean people can read Plato and 
aristotle for their entire lives without

765
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:50,970
ever,
without ever being fully captured by the

766
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:55,971
kind of dogmatism that,
that every religion demands that you be 

767
00:42:56,581 --> 00:43:01,581
captured.
If you're really going to be an 

768
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:01,581
adherence.

769
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:01,581
I say that's actually an archetypal 
truth.

770
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:05,060
You know the idea that the pathological 
tradition stands in the way of update.

771
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,650
That's an archetypal truth.
I mean,

772
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:09,120
one of the reasons why in creation 
myths,

773
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,140
one of the variants of a creation myth 
is that the hero has to slay a 

774
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,871
tyrannical giant in order to make it 
make the world out of his pieces and 

775
00:43:16,871 --> 00:43:20,960
it's a metaphorical restatement of the 
idea that tradition can become hidebound

776
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:26,050
and when it becomes hidebound and too 
rigid that it interferes with current 

777
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,050
adaptation.
But the problem is,

778
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,270
and this is,
I think this is something we really need

779
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:34,271
to hash out.
The problem is the problem that you're 

780
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,370
describing is the problem of a priori 
structure.

781
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,780
Now,
some of that's textual,

782
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,200
but some of it isn't textual.
Some of it resides in us as our psyche 

783
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:41,200
in so far say

784
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,000
no problem.
I'm I'm describing here is that we have 

785
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,530
two categories of,
of books in this case,

786
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:53,560
right?
We have those written by people like 

787
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,411
ourselves just endlessly open for 
criticism and and conjecture and those 

788
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,380
written by invisible omniscient.

789
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:05,870
But I would presume that if these 
religious systems weren't codafide in 

790
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,951
books,
if they were still just enacted or 

791
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:08,951
dramatized,
you'd have the same objection.

792
00:44:08,951 --> 00:44:10,280
It's not the fact that they're in books 
that's relevant,

793
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,710
but it is the dogmatism is the fact that
we can't.

794
00:44:12,711 --> 00:44:14,930
We can't jettison bad part.
Okay.

795
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:16,130
It's the dogmatism.
Okay.

796
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:18,620
So to me that's the same as the problem 
of structure.

797
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:19,970
Now here,
here's the.

798
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,030
Here's the problem.
I think with the way that your argument 

799
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,430
is laid out,
and I'm not saying it's wrong,

800
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:28,850
it seems to me that this is a place 
where it needs to be developed because I

801
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:33,840
see that the attempt that you make to 
derive the value from the world of facts

802
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:37,620
as as justifiable given what it is that 
you're attempting to do,

803
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:39,780
which in principle is to make the world 
a better place.

804
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,720
But there's a massive gap in there.
It's like how do you do it?

805
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,840
Because the objection that you place on 
my,

806
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,250
my reasoning,
let's say,

807
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:47,910
which is.
Well,

808
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,150
the problem with these texts is that 
there's an infinite number of 

809
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,150
interpretations and which of them can 
you.

810
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:57,290
How can you determine which of those is 
canonically correct is exactly and 

811
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,041
precisely the same criticism that can be
levied against your attempt to extract 

812
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:01,710
the world of value from the domain of 
facts.

813
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,880
It's the same.

814
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:06,220
It's not an infinite number of 
interpretations in either case,

815
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:10,110
but I allow for enough to infinite.
So that might be.

816
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,120
I mean that's why the moral landscape 
for me is a landscape of peaks and 

817
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,120
valleys and so,
you know,

818
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,820
I am totally open to the possibility in 
fact certainty that there are different 

819
00:45:20,561 --> 00:45:25,561
ways for similar minds and certainly 
different ways for different minds to be

820
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:32,370
constellated so that they have 
equivalent but irreconcilable peaks on 

821
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:34,330
the landscape.
So you,

822
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:36,820
there's,
there's a lot of wellbeing over here and

823
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:39,640
there's a lot of wellbeing over here and
there's a valley in between.

824
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,370
And so it's,
it's a kind of moral relativism.

825
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:43,060
It's kind of like,
you know,

826
00:45:43,061 --> 00:45:45,280
this is,
this is great and this is great,

827
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:46,630
but these are irreconcilable.

828
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,900
Well,
I'd like to see that made more concrete 

829
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,891
and I need to know how that fits in with
your conception because one of the 

830
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:57,401
claims that you make in the moral 
landscape is that the distinction 

831
00:45:57,401 --> 00:46:00,521
between the bad life and the good life 
is normally it's like it's a factual 

832
00:46:01,311 --> 00:46:02,200
distinction.
Yes,

833
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:06,170
it's universally,
universally apprehensible and true.

834
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,200
It's your.
I think it's your fundamental axiomatic 

835
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,781
claim and I don't see how that's 
commensurate with the position that you 

836
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:13,781
just put forward.

837
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:18,150
Was it?
So here's the position and you can 

838
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,410
forget about morality as a concept for 
this man.

839
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:22,290
I think the starting point is deeper 
than morality.

840
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:23,610
The starting point,
and this is all,

841
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,900
this is our starting point,
all of us right now in the universe,

842
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,430
the starting point is we are conscious,
right?

843
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,440
We have a,
we have a circumstance that admits of 

844
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:41,610
qualitative experience,
and again,

845
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:42,630
this is true.
Whatever,

846
00:46:42,631 --> 00:46:45,720
however we understand consciousness,
whatever is actually happening,

847
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,510
they could be living in a simulation.
This could be a dream.

848
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,810
You could be a brain in a Vat.
A consciousness could just be the 

849
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,460
product of neurochemistry or we could 
have eternal souls running on on,

850
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,320
so how he is somehow integrated with the
brain.

851
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:03,950
Whatever is true,
something seems to be happening and the 

852
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:07,680
Siemens can be really,
really bad or really,

853
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:10,200
really good.
We know each one of us in our lives have

854
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:13,050
experienced this range of possibility 
and yes,

855
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:17,340
there are caveats here and there are 
hard and painful experiences that have a

856
00:47:17,341 --> 00:47:18,360
silver lining,
right?

857
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,160
That give you some other capacity where 
you can say,

858
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,970
well,
you know,

859
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,520
that really sucked,
but I'm a better person for it.

860
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,580
Right?
And we can understand what it means to 

861
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:28,580
be a better person for it.
In terms,

862
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,130
again,
of this range of experience,

863
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:30,610
which I,
you know,

864
00:47:30,611 --> 00:47:35,611
I'm calling subsuming all of this,
the positive end of this as well being,

865
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,920
which is to say that you now I'm a 
better person for it because now,

866
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,890
you know,
having endured that ordeal,

867
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,300
I am capable of much greater compassion 
where I appreciate my life more.

868
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:48,220
You know,
the cancer made me a better person.

869
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,840
Now that I've,
I'm cured.

870
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,450
I value each moment of life more than I 
ever did.

871
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,960
All of these claims are intelligible 
within a context of an open ended 

872
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,580
context of exploring this space of 
possible experience.

873
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:03,310
So what I'm saying is forget about 
morality.

874
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,470
Forget about right and wrong and good 
and evil.

875
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,950
What is undeniable is that what we have 
here is a navigation problem.

876
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,220
We have a,
a space of possible experience.

877
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,680
And again,
this is not just a human problem.

878
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,990
This is a problem for any possible 
conscious mind.

879
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:26,370
We have a space of possible experience 
in which we can navigate and we and 

880
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,481
things can get excruciating and 
pointlessly horrible where there are no 

881
00:48:30,881 --> 00:48:32,620
silver linings.
And we get this.

882
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:37,660
This can happen individually in some 
episode of madness that never ends.

883
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,930
If there really is a Christian hell to 
go to,

884
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:43,450
well then it can.
It's going to happen to me after I die,

885
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:45,130
right?
Given what I've said on the stage,

886
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,530
uh,
if,

887
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:49,300
uh,
so it matters who's right.

888
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,950
Obviously,
if I knew that a,

889
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:57,110
uh,
an eternity of fiery torment awaited 

890
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,110
somebody who didn't make the right 
noises about one or one faith or another

891
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:04,111
will,
then it would only be rational to make 

892
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:04,111
those right noises,
right?

893
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:04,111
So it's,
it's my bet.

894
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:07,480
I'm placing a bet on certain pictures of
reality being wrong.

895
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,930
But the reality is,
is we're navigating in this space and 

896
00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:16,831
morality and ethics are the terms we use
for how we think about our behavior 

897
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,390
affecting one another is experienced.
So if you're in a moral solitude,

898
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:29,050
if you're on a desert island or if 
you're alone in the universe,

899
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,320
morality is not the issue you need to 
worry about.

900
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:34,660
But wellbeing still is an ever present 
issue.

901
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:39,590
It's possible to suffer and as possible 
to experience bliss and,

902
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:43,270
and perhaps something beyond that.
And we,

903
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,160
the horizon in both directions is 
something we will,

904
00:49:48,161 --> 00:49:49,840
we'll never fully exposed,
explore,

905
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:54,860
very likely in the way we don't know how
good things can get and we don't know 

906
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:54,860
how bad they can get,
but,

907
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,130
but that there's a spectrum here is 
undeniable.

908
00:49:57,131 --> 00:49:58,420
And I,
I would say that,

909
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,780
that my moral realism simply entails 
that we acknowledged that it's possible 

910
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:08,470
not to know what you're missing is 
possible to be living in a way where you

911
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:11,980
are less happy than you could be and not
to know why.

912
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Right?
And to not have the wisdom to make the 

913
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,051
changes and that matters if anything 
matters that matters and it matters to 

914
00:50:19,051 --> 00:50:20,800
us individually and it matters to us 
collectively.

915
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:26,220
And that mattering is our,
is that subsumes everything we can 

916
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:29,660
intelligibly want in this domain of 
value.

917
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,700
And that's.
And so again,

918
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:33,070
it's,
it's the,

919
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:38,100
the,
the cash value of any value claim is in 

920
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,231
the,
the actual or potential change in 

921
00:50:41,231 --> 00:50:42,350
consciousness for some conscious system 
somewhere sometime.

922
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,370
And that's,
that's my claim.

923
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:43,790
And that's.

924
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,380
Can I try to get,
would like to clarify something.

925
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,630
So it sounds to me,
Sam,

926
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,740
like you are hypothesizing that a 
rationalist approach will always beat a 

927
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:05,370
traditional metaphorical approach with 
respect to the generation of wellbeing.

928
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:06,920
Well,
not always,

929
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:11,921
but there's so many obvious downsides to
the traditional sectarian dogmatic 

930
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:18,761
approach that we should want to get out 
of the religion business as fast as 

931
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:18,761
possible.

932
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:18,761
Okay.
So,

933
00:51:18,761 --> 00:51:19,510
okay.
But as fast as possible.

934
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:24,511
But do you mean that it has always been 
true that we should always have gotten 

935
00:51:24,511 --> 00:51:29,221
away from it as fast as possible or do 
you mean now we should get away from it 

936
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:33,511
as fast as possible,
but there is a point somewhere in the 

937
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:34,480
past where it might have been true that 
actually the best,

938
00:51:34,481 --> 00:51:37,720
the most,
the richest path to wellbeing might have

939
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:39,130
been encoded metaphorically.

940
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,710
Oh yeah.
That's certainly possible.

941
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:46,740
And in fact you might even say it was 
likely based on the fact that we have 

942
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,410
all of these systems still around.

943
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,990
We still have the systems around in part
because our,

944
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,060
like we still,
we still think in metaphor and we 

945
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,790
actually can't help it because half of 
our brain is oriented towards metaphor.

946
00:51:58,791 --> 00:51:59,000
But

947
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,680
can I get you to clarify something now?
Yes.

948
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:05,460
Okay.
So you have argued,

949
00:52:05,461 --> 00:52:07,560
and you've actually quite surprised me 
by doing so.

950
00:52:07,561 --> 00:52:12,090
You argued that the dogmatism is a bug 
and not a feature.

951
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,240
You've argued it's a bug and a feature.
Okay.

952
00:52:15,241 --> 00:52:16,350
It's a bug and a feature.
Good.

953
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:21,351
So yes,
but what I thought I heard you say was 

954
00:52:21,351 --> 00:52:23,670
that the resistance to update,
yes,

955
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,380
was a problem that effectively it was an
obstacle yet.

956
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,720
So his lack of resistance to update.
There's problems everywhere,

957
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:31,410
man.
Well,

958
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,840
there's a tension.
There is a tension.

959
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:35,120
Is tension.
Terrible.

960
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,100
Look at it this way.

961
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,460
Most new ideas are stupid and dangerous,
but most some of them are fighter as 

962
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:45,240
well.
Some of them are vital,

963
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,620
right?
And so we have.

964
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:48,330
We're screwed both ways.
It's like,

965
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,850
well,
if we stay locked in our current mode of

966
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:53,700
apprehension,
all hell's gonna break loose.

967
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,620
If we generate a whole bunch of new 
solutions,

968
00:52:55,621 --> 00:52:57,390
most of them are going to be wrong and 
we're going to die.

969
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,210
And so what we need to do is it's a 
Darwinian claim in some sense,

970
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:05,850
is that despite the fact that most new 
ideas are stupid and dangerous,

971
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:08,460
a subset of them are so vital that if we
don't incorporate them,

972
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:13,461
we're all going to perish.
That's the bloody existential condition 

973
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:14,550
and so now and part of the issue here 
and see,

974
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,870
I think that this is the problem is,
is that let's take the dogma idea.

975
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,010
Okay,
so there's the dogma incorporated in the

976
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:28,011
books,
but I'm gonna throw away the books 

977
00:53:28,011 --> 00:53:29,421
because the dogma was there before the 
books and then the question is where it 

978
00:53:29,421 --> 00:53:32,271
was the dogma and the answer was the 
dogma was in the cultural practices but 

979
00:53:32,271 --> 00:53:37,150
and in and in the agreement that people 
made with regards to those cultural 

980
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,941
practices,
but it was also part and parcel of the 

981
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:42,240
Inter psychic structure that enables us 
to perceive the world as such.

982
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:47,750
Now the problem is,
and I think this is the central place 

983
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,291
where we need to flesh out these ideas,
is that you cannot view the world 

984
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,450
without an a priori structure and that a
prior structure has a dogmatic element,

985
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,490
and so you can't just say,
well,

986
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,810
let's get rid of the dog one,
because you can't perceive the world

987
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:04,190
structure has an uninspected element.
Because if you're talking about just 

988
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:04,990
perceiving the world,
yes we have.

989
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,120
We have perceptual structure that allows
for us to perceive the world and we know

990
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,790
that there are failures states,
right?

991
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:13,780
So we know,
we know for instance,

992
00:54:13,781 --> 00:54:14,980
that we are,
we are,

993
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:19,981
we have evolved to perceive visual space
based on a literally neurological 

994
00:54:22,331 --> 00:54:25,180
expectation that light sources will be 
from above.

995
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:30,210
Right.
And so we know that we can produce 

996
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:30,210
visual illusions based on gaming that 
expectation.

997
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,560
Right?
But that's not the same thing as a,

998
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:39,350
a dogma we subscribed to by some,
some subset of humanity that is 

999
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:45,691
antithetical to another dogma subscribed
to by another set of humanity that has 

1000
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:48,700
nothing to do with underlying biology.
That's something that is changeable,

1001
00:54:48,701 --> 00:54:53,701
obvious.
Nobody's changeable in real time based 

1002
00:54:53,701 --> 00:54:54,290
on just conversations like this.
Like,

1003
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:54,930
you know,
we could,

1004
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,120
you know,
I get emails from people who can point 

1005
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:03,331
to these,
the paragraph where they lost their 

1006
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:03,331
faith,
right?

1007
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:07,500
Where in reading somebody's reading,
reading Richard Dawkins or newborn 

1008
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,500
hearing,
a debate between between me and some 

1009
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,530
theologian where it's just a was a 
collision against rationality,

1010
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:18,630
which is so useful in every other 
context suddenly proves its utility in 

1011
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,840
this context where they think,
well,

1012
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:24,841
okay,
clearly I know the Muslims are wrong 

1013
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:24,841
about the status of the Koran.
Let me,

1014
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,910
let me take that.
That that spirit of criticism in the 

1015
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:33,721
internal space of my own culture and 
what moves well,

1016
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:38,790
a dogmatic attachment to Christianity 
has to move by that same standard and 

1017
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:42,871
that's and and it's possible to do that 
and that's not a matter of getting into 

1018
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:43,180
the brain and changing your perceptual 
apparatus.

1019
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:43,510
That has.

1020
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,880
Well the distinction between different 
levels of what would you call it,

1021
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:54,660
structure related processing in the 
brain and the relationship to the 

1022
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,021
underlying biology isn't clear.
Like it isn't clear when that's 

1023
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:58,240
biological and when is it,
when it isn't.

1024
00:55:58,241 --> 00:55:59,930
So you know,
your,

1025
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,960
your,
your comments about our a priori 

1026
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,930
perceptual structures not withstanding,
there's no clear line between what 

1027
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:10,720
constitutes and instantiated accurate 
biological perception and something that

1028
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:14,560
shades more into a cultural.
A presupposition,

1029
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,120
so it's a.
it's a gray area.

1030
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,920
Now here,
let me ask you a question.

1031
00:56:17,921 --> 00:56:19,960
So this is one of the things I've been 
thinking about.

1032
00:56:19,961 --> 00:56:24,961
So this is.
This is designed to point out 

1033
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:28,130
difference.
I'm not making the claim that the idea 

1034
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:28,870
that we should ground values in fact is 
wrong.

1035
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,680
I'm not going to make that claim,
although we think it's way more 

1036
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,111
complicated than we've opened up so far,
but I would say is I can relatively 

1037
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:42,220
easily demonstrate a situation in which 
you cannot find the value from the fact.

1038
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,440
Let's say you own an antique,
it's valuable and you think I'm going to

1039
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:50,380
take this antique apart and I'm going to
find out where the value is.

1040
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,520
Good luck.
It's not valuable in that sense where 

1041
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:56,520
I'll.
Wait a sec,

1042
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:56,620
wait a sec.
So we need to know.

1043
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:01,910
So that's right.
It's not valuable in that sense because 

1044
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:04,321
the value of the antique is a social 
agreement about its position in a 

1045
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:07,891
hierarchy.
It has nothing to do with the material 

1046
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:07,891
substrate at the end.

1047
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,550
Yeah,
but it's not

1048
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,500
claim already that you can derive value 
from fat.

1049
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:15,720
It's like,
then what are you willing to.

1050
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:20,890
These are facts about again,
so there are facts about the facts exist

1051
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:22,750
in intersubjective space.
Right?

1052
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,100
So if I,
if I tell you,

1053
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:24,910
well,
this glass,

1054
00:57:24,911 --> 00:57:27,370
this isn't just an ordinary glass.
I know it looks just like that one,

1055
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:32,371
but this is the glass that Elton John 
Drank from his last concert here.

1056
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,280
Right?
So what do you want to pay me for it?

1057
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,440
Right.
It could be that,

1058
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:43,441
you know,
you're just the biggest Elton John Fan 

1059
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:43,441
ever and it's worth quite a lot to you 
now.

1060
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:48,421
That is,
it's a kind of evidence is not value 

1061
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,360
intrinsic to the glass,
but it is,

1062
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,070
it is,
it is a.

1063
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:52,480
where's the value located?
Was,

1064
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,160
is a measure in the change.
This provokes in your experience,

1065
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:57,930
right?
There's the idea.

1066
00:57:57,931 --> 00:58:00,710
I mean we value ideas as much as 
anything else and that's,

1067
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:04,300
that's hence the,
the mad work done by religion,

1068
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,740
right?
I mean because it's not.

1069
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:10,910
These aren't facts on the ground.
These are ideas that rural people's 

1070
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,250
lives.
People spend their whole life afraid of.

1071
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:12,520
Hell,

1072
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:17,570
okay.
It seems to meet that it's easier in 

1073
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,570
some sense rather than to relate the 
value of that,

1074
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:22,620
and I love the Elton John's class 
example to use Elvis Presley is here.

1075
00:58:22,621 --> 00:58:23,630
I will.
I will tell you,

1076
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:28,870
it's like where in the guitar is the 
fact that it's Elvis Presley's and 

1077
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:29,340
guitar,
while it's nowhere in the guitar.

1078
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:30,450
Well,
what is it in?

1079
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,480
Where is it that,
and the answer is it's in the dominance 

1080
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,620
hierarchy values that's been socially 
constructed around the guitar.

1081
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,730
It's located at an interpersonal space 
and that that location,

1082
00:58:41,731 --> 00:58:45,090
so value is located in interpersonal 
space and if you want to say,

1083
00:58:45,091 --> 00:58:46,410
well,
that's also a fact.

1084
00:58:46,411 --> 00:58:47,040
It's like,
okay,

1085
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:47,310
but

1086
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:52,430
we're starting to stretch the beliefs 
and desires and conscious dates of all 

1087
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:56,220
the people involved.
That's the only place where it exists.

1088
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:59,350
That's the only fair enough with the 
idea of Elvis' guitar can show up.

1089
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,470
Well,
I'm trying to figure out then you see,

1090
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:06,471
because what seems to me to be happening
at least in part is that we can stretch 

1091
00:59:06,471 --> 00:59:10,941
the the domain of what constitutes of 
facts so that the domain of fact starts 

1092
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:15,711
to incorporate the domain of values,
but we do that with some doing some 

1093
00:59:15,711 --> 00:59:16,770
damage to the domain of fact.
No,

1094
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,260
no,
no,

1095
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,940
no.
Hang on.

1096
00:59:17,941 --> 00:59:18,500
Don't,
don't say,

1097
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,440
don't just say no,
I'll more.

1098
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,290
This is really complicated because you 
see,

1099
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:29,350
part of what the postmodernists have 
done is they've pushed away the domain 

1100
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:29,960
of facts entirely and they say,
well,

1101
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,860
the only thing is is that the only thing
that actually exists is that this domain

1102
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,100
of intersubjective agreement and

1103
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:37,220
no.
Yeah,

1104
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,800
you and I are on the same page with 
respect to postmodern.

1105
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:40,370
Right?
But,

1106
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,550
but,
but you have to give,

1107
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:46,551
but you have to give them.
You have to give the devil his due as 

1108
00:59:46,551 --> 00:59:49,281
well.
They're pointed out something and what 

1109
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,920
they pointed out is that it's not so 
easy to localize the structure that 

1110
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,790
attributes to fax their value.
It's not a simple thing that we were 

1111
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:55,790
way.
Yes.

1112
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,110
You would surely agree that if we had 
Elvis Presley's guitar,

1113
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,520
that that guitar would have a material 
impact on people.

1114
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,040
We could tell them this is Elvis 
Presley's guitar.

1115
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:09,670
Some fraction of them would disbelieve 
it.

1116
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,810
Somebody might be able to establish it 
based on a picture or something like 

1117
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,991
that,
and the point is it would have a value 

1118
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:21,260
that would alter the behavior of people 
with respect to that object in a 

1119
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,440
material way.
Yes,

1120
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:26,700
it would alter the behavior of the p 
values manifest in physical space.

1121
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,810
Which part of it?
The detective.

1122
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:33,950
We could figure out what the value of 
this guitar is based on some 

1123
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:33,950
intersection.

1124
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:37,670
Sure.
We can take a behaviorist approach and 

1125
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,670
we could see how much work people were 
willing to do to contact.

1126
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:42,220
We can scan their brains and see what we
can do that well.

1127
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,800
Well,
clearly I ran it evolved.

1128
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,250
Hypothetically.
We can do it,

1129
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:48,580
but practically we're not so good 
because the MRI data,

1130
01:00:48,581 --> 01:00:50,100
generally speaking is junk.
Well,

1131
01:00:50,101 --> 01:00:55,101
the way we can table that,
that's controversial statement in Mri 

1132
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,720
circles.
It's fair enough.

1133
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:00,430
I don't think we need it.
We need it,

1134
01:01:00,431 --> 01:01:03,410
but we go with that.
A market will establish the brain.

1135
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:08,470
The brain as yet incompletely understood
is surely involved in the value of this 

1136
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,860
object.
Right?

1137
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:11,140
And so if I take,
if I tell you that this is,

1138
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:16,170
and again we can take it out of 
intersubjective space because it 

1139
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,601
couldn't you,
you could be in a value solitude with 

1140
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:18,910
respect to any given object,
so it could just be,

1141
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:24,150
you could have a sentimental attachment 
to your watch that's worth exactly $25 

1142
01:01:25,001 --> 01:01:27,990
because that's what you paid for it,
but this is the watch that you know,

1143
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:33,090
this is your first watch or whatever it 
is and you wouldn't sell it for any 

1144
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:33,090
amount of money.

1145
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,630
That's a measure of your but behavioral 
measure of how much you value it.

1146
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,150
And if I told you,
oh well,

1147
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,790
you know,
sorry,

1148
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,791
I brought your watch and lost it.
What the cascade of negative effects 

1149
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:46,251
that I see on your face as correlated 
with something that's happening in your 

1150
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:46,251
head and the brain is involved.
Right?

1151
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:49,980
So that the quality of that picture 
basically state is devalued.

1152
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:55,350
Tell us that there'd be a socio cultural
agreement as to the value of whatever 

1153
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:59,881
this entity is and that would find it's 
mirroring the brain and that's a 

1154
01:01:59,881 --> 01:02:00,210
noncontroversial stated,
Ecos,

1155
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,260
all socio cultural phenomena that are 
experienced find a reflection of the 

1156
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,091
brain.
The fact that you can say that that's 

1157
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:09,091
reflected in the brain.

1158
01:02:09,091 --> 01:02:12,720
Yeah.
Continually run into with religion is 

1159
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,661
that there you have a domain of so 
called sacred values where people who 

1160
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:19,310
are otherwise rational ceased to be 
rational actors,

1161
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:24,320
so the reason why Israel and the 
Israelis and the Palestinians can't 

1162
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,121
negotiate as though their problems could
be solved by a real estate transaction 

1163
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,240
is because they have irrational and 
irreconcilable claims upon land and 

1164
01:02:35,791 --> 01:02:40,791
building.
Do you think there are any more 

1165
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,341
irrational than the claim that that 
class is worth something when no one 

1166
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:47,460
knows that it's like that,
but I'm not irrational by your own 

1167
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,131
definition.
You just said that that was actually 

1168
01:02:52,131 --> 01:02:52,470
constituted a fact.
It's a fact about people,

1169
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:55,460
right?
So this is okay.

1170
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,260
Just be a little careful here because it
gets confusing.

1171
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:03,710
The there are.
We can make objective claims about 

1172
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,200
subjective experience,
right?

1173
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:08,910
It's not as,
it's there are,

1174
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:11,730
we use this word objective and 
subjective in,

1175
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:12,630
in different ways.

1176
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:15,630
We use it in an epistemological ways and
ontological ways,

1177
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:19,470
and give me just one sec to make sure 
I'm on the same,

1178
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:20,980
uh,
by.

1179
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,890
I can illustrate it by way of example.
If I say no,

1180
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,470
that's just your subjective opinion,
right?

1181
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,890
I'm saying I'm denigrating.
I'm saying that this is an expression of

1182
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:30,220
your bias.
This is this,

1183
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,880
this is true for you,
but it's not true out in the world,

1184
01:03:32,881 --> 01:03:35,110
right?
That's one way I can use the,

1185
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:39,780
the subjective objective distinction,
and that's an epistomological way.

1186
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:40,410
Like you're,
you're,

1187
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:42,660
you're ruled by bias.
You're not thinking straight.

1188
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:47,690
You know,
I don't have to take your opinion 

1189
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:47,690
seriously.
That's subjective.

1190
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,690
I'm worried about objective facts,
but people get confused.

1191
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:52,620
They think that objective facts only 
means the material world.

1192
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:57,890
And what's the,
what's really in this glass as a 

1193
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:57,890
material object.
No,

1194
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:59,160
we can be much more objective than that.

1195
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:04,160
We can,
we can make objective claims about the 

1196
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,580
subjective experience of,
of people like ourselves.

1197
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:06,390
I can,
I can,

1198
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:12,140
I can make an infinite number of 
objective claims about the experience 

1199
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,380
of.
This is the example I always use,

1200
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,780
but I just happen to love it.
What,

1201
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,990
what was jfk thinking the moment he got 
shot right there.

1202
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:24,991
That's it.
We don't know that we'll never get the 

1203
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:24,991
data right.
So the,

1204
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:25,230
the,
the truth or falseness of,

1205
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:29,160
of what I'm about to say can't be 
predicated on actually getting access to

1206
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:32,970
the data because because he's not around
and his brain's not around to scan.

1207
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,490
Uh,
so,

1208
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:40,750
but we,
you and I both know an infinite number 

1209
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:43,380
of things he wasn't thinking about.
We can make an objective claim about his

1210
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:46,020
subjectivity.
I know he wasn't thinking,

1211
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:51,230
well,
I hope Jordan Peterson has Sam Harris' 

1212
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:53,361
work it out on stage that night and an 
infinite number of things like that.

1213
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:58,520
He was thinking something.
He was experiencing something but we 

1214
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,530
don't know what it is that.
So I saw what I'm talking about.

1215
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:06,531
This domain of value.
I'm saying that it exists in the this 

1216
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:12,050
landscape of actual impossible conscious
experience for human beings and any 

1217
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:17,571
other system like us,
they can experience this range of 

1218
01:05:17,571 --> 01:05:17,571
suffering and happen.
Well.

1219
01:05:17,571 --> 01:05:18,040
So partly

1220
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,220
what I'm trying to do is to actually 
determine what that structure is.

1221
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:26,810
So in our case it's certainly connected 
to the evolved structure of our brain by

1222
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:29,690
everything else.

1223
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:34,870
They want to go way deeper into to the 
idea then it's connected with brain 

1224
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,870
states because it's.
Yes,

1225
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:36,590
it's definitely connected with brain 
states.

1226
01:05:36,591 --> 01:05:39,800
The question is at least in part how and
what does that mean?

1227
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,860
And I think that the neuroscience has 
progressed far enough so that we can do 

1228
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,071
quite a good job of this.
And so what I want to return to one 

1229
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:51,371
thing,
and maybe I'll outline a little bit of 

1230
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:52,700
this and when you talked about the 
Israeli Palestinian conflict,

1231
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:55,490
you said that that was irrational.
And so look,

1232
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,420
you know,
fair enough,

1233
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,080
people have been locked with their hands
around each other's necks there for 3000

1234
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:05,081
years.
But there's a problem there and the 

1235
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:07,631
problem is that people are looking at 
the landscape from a contextualized 

1236
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,520
perspective,
right?

1237
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:13,460
It's not just a piece of land,
it's their piece of land.

1238
01:06:13,461 --> 01:06:15,590
It's like your house or your favorite 
shirt.

1239
01:06:15,591 --> 01:06:16,070
It's like,
what?

1240
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:16,490
You say,
well,

1241
01:06:16,491 --> 01:06:18,050
I have a favorite shirt.
It's like,

1242
01:06:18,051 --> 01:06:23,051
well,
there's nothing inherent in the shirt 

1243
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:23,051
that makes it your favorite.
No,

1244
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:23,051
it's a subjective judgment.
It's like,

1245
01:06:23,051 --> 01:06:23,930
well then is that a fact?
Well,

1246
01:06:23,931 --> 01:06:24,740
yes,
it's a fact.

1247
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:26,870
It's a fact about subjective judgment.
It's okay.

1248
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:32,080
While the Israeli claim on the land and 
the Palestinian claim on the land is a 

1249
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:32,080
subjective judgment that

1250
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,310
it's like,
so how is it saving it?

1251
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:39,110
Because it is the.
The true analogy here.

1252
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:44,111
The complete analogy is rather like 
we're about to fight over Elton John's 

1253
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:49,220
glass and Elton John was never here.

1254
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,470
Right?

1255
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,230
Not saying it clearly still matters to 
us.

1256
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,520
In our misapprehension of our situation,
we still really care.

1257
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:10,550
And these are.
These are objectively true claims about 

1258
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:12,300
the level at which we value things and 
hence the impasse.

1259
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:16,140
But it matters if it's counter 
productively dismissive,

1260
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,310
like you could say,
well,

1261
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,090
when you look at this specific claim,
there's really not.

1262
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:26,930
Look you took,
you took the contextual interpretation 

1263
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:26,930
to its absolute extreme.
You said,

1264
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,281
well there's multiple reasons why 
different people who occupied the same 

1265
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:32,280
piece of land are going to feel about it
in different ways.

1266
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,060
Sure.
Okay.

1267
01:07:33,310 --> 01:07:38,310
And those reasons are amenable to some 
kind of rational compromise actually 

1268
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,520
studies on this.
I mean there's studies done by people 

1269
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:44,520
who,
when you say this rewrap it,

1270
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:45,390
you say the word rational in that 
context,

1271
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:50,391
you're using it as a black box that 
contains the concept proper way of 

1272
01:07:50,391 --> 01:07:54,291
thinking about it.
It's like it's not so obvious in most 

1273
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:54,291
situations what the rational approach 
is.

1274
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:59,330
I always have an obvious one here and 
that's that whatever the Christians and 

1275
01:08:00,891 --> 01:08:05,891
the Muslims and the Jews think they're 
getting from their attachment to their 

1276
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:10,121
dogmatic and irreconcilable and 
religious worldviews can be gotten just 

1277
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:15,010
as well by a deeper understanding of 
the,

1278
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:20,050
of our universal and non culturally 
bound capacity for ethical experience,

1279
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,290
spiritual experience,
community building.

1280
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,620
And we can.
What's that?

1281
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:31,380
We can touch that specs without.
It's almost like the status quo is,

1282
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,730
it's almost like your content to live in
a world or your at least your content,

1283
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:39,731
not to judge too harshly a world where 
fans of rival soccer teams or baseball 

1284
01:08:41,061 --> 01:08:44,870
teams regularly kill one another over 
their fandom.

1285
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:45,400
Right?
Like,

1286
01:08:45,401 --> 01:08:47,120
oh,
like what if that were the status quo?

1287
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:48,710
So He's been this way for thousands of 
years.

1288
01:08:48,711 --> 01:08:51,230
There must be a reason for it,
but I really like sports.

1289
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,380
I'm not trying to justify the Israeli 
Palestinian conflict.

1290
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,700
No,
but I'm saying that too quick to judge 

1291
01:08:59,700 --> 01:08:59,700
the sanctity of their,
of their differences of opinion.

1292
01:08:59,700 --> 01:08:59,780
Okay,

1293
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:01,060
but wait a minute,
Sam,

1294
01:09:01,061 --> 01:09:06,061
there you made a claim.
Your claim was that if the Christians 

1295
01:09:06,061 --> 01:09:09,661
and the Jews and the Muslims would just 
stop their stupidity and adopt this 

1296
01:09:09,661 --> 01:09:10,330
universal ethic,
then everything would be okay.

1297
01:09:10,331 --> 01:09:11,200
It's like,
okay,

1298
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,440
what's the basis for the universal ethic
like that sets.

1299
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:19,660
That's the truth isn't.
But that's an interesting problem for 

1300
01:09:20,801 --> 01:09:25,801
philosophers and for scientists.
That's not actually where the rubber 

1301
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:28,380
meets the road for people living their 
lives.

1302
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:28,840
Well,
I mean,

1303
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:33,970
is this analogous to me,
the difference between the band?

1304
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:38,560
I really care about all of this and I 
and my job as a,

1305
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,620
as a philosophy,
as a moral philosopher in that case is 

1306
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:44,470
to make the best case I can for these 
ideas,

1307
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:49,471
but the truth is it is analogous to when
when you get into a debate with a 

1308
01:09:49,471 --> 01:09:54,270
Christian fundamentalists in the states,
very often this per this person will 

1309
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:59,551
pretend to care about cosmology as or 
evolution as though it's the most 

1310
01:10:00,521 --> 01:10:05,521
important thing in the world as though 
you can't get out of bed in the morning 

1311
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:08,191
and figure out how to treat your friends
and family well unless you figure out 

1312
01:10:08,191 --> 01:10:08,740
what happened before the Big Bang,
right?

1313
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:13,741
No one really lives their lives that way
and yet we have convinced ourselves that

1314
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:19,500
this is a sensible way of talking about 
the conflict between religion and 

1315
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:19,500
science.

1316
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:23,940
I think you have arrived at the core of 
your conflict right here,

1317
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,070
and I actually hear you both loud and 
clear.

1318
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,420
Your point is that if the people faced 
with the question where to start with a 

1319
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:35,580
fresh sheet of paper,
look at the Middle East,

1320
01:10:35,581 --> 01:10:40,581
they could arrive at a compromise that 
they as individuals might find a put 

1321
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:46,461
them way ahead and is more profitable 
than the situation that they are 

1322
01:10:46,461 --> 01:10:48,360
continually finding themselves and that 
might be the case.

1323
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:53,420
On the other hand,
the reason that they don't is that 

1324
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:57,270
historically those who have have been 
out competed by those who haven't,

1325
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:02,660
so the point is the universe and the 
fact that it refuses to solve that 

1326
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:07,221
conflict is telling us that there is 
some reason that people who take that 

1327
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:11,571
prospect seriously are not actually 
correct in some at least metaphorical.

1328
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:18,350
So in other words,
what is it to have a sentimental 

1329
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:21,081
attachment to some piece of territory 
somewhere that sounds completely 

1330
01:11:21,081 --> 01:11:22,230
irrational.
On the other hand,

1331
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:27,320
that sentimental attachment may result 
in you continuing for 500 or a thousand 

1332
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,150
or 2000 years.
Whereas if you surrendered it because it

1333
01:11:30,151 --> 01:11:32,040
was irrational,
you might go extinct.

1334
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:37,070
Now,
should you care that your lineage is 

1335
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:37,070
going to go extinct?
Maybe,

1336
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:37,380
arguably not.
On the other hand,

1337
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:41,760
it's hard to imagine that what you're 
saying is so thoroughly grounded that it

1338
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:46,761
can justify causing people to alter 
their perspective on value in such a way

1339
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,080
that it might actually drive them 
extinct.

1340
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,090
It's not clear that that's good.

1341
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:55,120
Clearly secularism made.
You were talking about the fringe here.

1342
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,390
We're talking about that when you're 
talking about this case,

1343
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,520
the Israeli settlers and the Palestinian
terrorists,

1344
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:05,860
right?
Like that is that is it.

1345
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:09,490
We should all breathe a sigh of relief 
that that doesn't,

1346
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:09,840
that,
that,

1347
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:14,841
that kind of passion,
that attachment to land doesn't 

1348
01:12:14,841 --> 01:12:17,620
characterize most of humanity if you're 
trying to defend your house.

1349
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,310
So,
but,

1350
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:18,910
but that's.

1351
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,790
Can I kind of different topic on Jordan,
because I think this is.

1352
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:26,370
This is where,
this is where the crux of it is.

1353
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,120
If,
if we follow the idea that this is 

1354
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,971
actually some,
that the seemingly sentimental and 

1355
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:37,380
irrational attachment to the piece of 
land is some sort of Meta rationality,

1356
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,500
which sounds like your perspective than 
we are now confronted with the question 

1357
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,100
of,
all right,

1358
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:49,101
if it is an evolved kind of a 
rationality that is being manifest in 

1359
01:12:49,101 --> 01:12:53,151
stories that cause people to behave in 
ways that Sam sees as clearly 

1360
01:12:53,151 --> 01:12:56,660
irrational,
then we are stuck with the naturalistic 

1361
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:59,691
fallacy,
which is to say so for those who don't 

1362
01:12:59,691 --> 01:13:02,421
know,
the naturalistic fallacy says that just 

1363
01:13:02,421 --> 01:13:02,450
because something is doesn't mean it 
ought,

1364
01:13:02,490 --> 01:13:05,220
right?
The fact that selection favors something

1365
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:09,510
doesn't make it good and the aztecs 
sacrificed their enemies.

1366
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:14,660
It is good for continuing as Technis,
but it may not be good in some absolute 

1367
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:15,570
moral sense.

1368
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:20,780
So here's the question for you.
You're arguing for an I think an 

1369
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:25,440
evolutionarily very viable explanation 
for religious belief and dogma,

1370
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:27,570
but aren't you stuck with the downside 
of it?

1371
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,520
Where much of what is encoded in that 
way may actually be abhorrent,

1372
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,260
morally unconscious?
Absolutely.

1373
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,790
Okay,
so what are you doing about it?

1374
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,840
What do we do about what this is?
This is exactly how a sorting algorithm.

1375
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,270
Yes.
What is it?

1376
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,530
Trying to get to it.
Okay.

1377
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:44,910
Okay,
so this is actually why I asked Sam this

1378
01:13:44,911 --> 01:13:45,660
question.
It wasn't.

1379
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:47,130
It wasn't an attack.
It's like,

1380
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:49,290
okay,
so look,

1381
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:51,540
people have these belief systems,
Christian Muslim,

1382
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:54,600
Jew will say for that,
and you're saying abandoned analysts,

1383
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:58,500
let's say two to and move towards this 
transcendent rationality.

1384
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,490
It's like,
okay,

1385
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,940
two problems.
It's not so easy to abandon the belief 

1386
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,920
system because you ended up in the 
morally relativist nihilist pit problem.

1387
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:11,560
One doesn't have to tend to and so

1388
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:18,520
they don't have to claim that.
We would be.

1389
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,350
We'd have to find out whether that is 
true.

1390
01:14:20,430 --> 01:14:22,970
There's a lot of evidence against that.
Well,

1391
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:25,960
there's plenty of evidence for it too,
but it's beside the point to some degree

1392
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:30,961
because that isn't.
That isn't something that I want to 

1393
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:30,961
quibble about.
The perhaps there are trends.

1394
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:35,250
There are transitional paths and 
sometimes people find a collapse of 

1395
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:35,290
their faith.
Actually freeing.

1396
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,320
It's certainly the case that many of the
people who are are are happy about what 

1397
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,371
you're doing have found exactly that in 
what you've been saying and more power 

1398
01:14:44,371 --> 01:14:44,920
to you and so I'm not willing to dispute
that,

1399
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,200
but what you said was,
okay,

1400
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:52,201
here's these belief systems that are 
ancient and complex and we can step 

1401
01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:56,611
outside of the men.
There's this transcendent rationality 

1402
01:14:56,611 --> 01:14:56,980
that we could all aspire to that would 
solve the problems.

1403
01:14:56,981 --> 01:14:57,700
It's like,
okay,

1404
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:00,670
what is it?
Well,

1405
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:05,890
what is it exactly?
It is at a minimum to value all of the 

1406
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:09,960
variables that conspire to make the one 
life.

1407
01:15:09,961 --> 01:15:13,410
We know we have key value.
All those variables.

1408
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,650
Well,
no,

1409
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:18,750
we were doing it right.
We do it every day in how we organize 

1410
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:18,750
ourselves.

1411
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:20,410
Why an a priori framework to the 
variables to say,

1412
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:24,130
to reduce them to a tiny subset that we 
can manage and it's the nature of that.

1413
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:26,980
A priority framework that we haven't 
been able to have a discussion about.

1414
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,120
We have an API framework that narrows 
our perception to almost nothing.

1415
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,970
It's built into us.
It's partly socially constructed.

1416
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:38,560
It has a deep neurological substrate and
we actually understand how it emerges to

1417
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:41,600
a large degree and the thing is is that 
I don't

1418
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:44,960
think that's actually our difference.
So this is a priority for framework,

1419
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:47,780
operates in many different spaces,
which again,

1420
01:15:47,781 --> 01:15:50,210
we can't necessarily analyze,
but it makes it no less true.

1421
01:15:50,211 --> 01:15:52,940
So if you,
if you put your hand on a hot stove,

1422
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:57,620
you will immediately feel a good,
a very good reason.

1423
01:15:57,621 --> 01:16:00,440
In fact,
in unarguably good reason to remove it.

1424
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,550
Right?
And that's,

1425
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:04,490
it doesn't require a moral philosophy to
get you there.

1426
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:09,700
You don't need a,
you don't need to inspect your a priori 

1427
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:09,700
framework.
You just have to feel,

1428
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,700
Holy Shit,
this is the worst thing I've ever felt.

1429
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:13,550
Right?
And there's so many moments like that in

1430
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:17,540
life that we dimly under that we 
understand that sometimes to rescue your

1431
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:18,620
child from a fire.
Well,

1432
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:19,300
exactly.
Then you have,

1433
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,220
you have some other goal,
right?

1434
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,580
Cause you to brave that,
that suffering,

1435
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,560
right?
And,

1436
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:31,630
but again,
trying to rescue your child from a fire 

1437
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,600
is pretty close to as the hot stove in 
not needing to be analyzed.

1438
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,910
Right?
The imperative to rescue your it,

1439
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
it becomes harder when you have to 
rescue someone else's child from a fire 

1440
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,610
and you're and you're worried about 
orphan in your child who's standing next

1441
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:47,630
to you on the sidewalk,
right?

1442
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,330
Then we get into the domain of moral 
philosophy and then you can say,

1443
01:16:50,331 --> 01:16:52,370
well,
what do what?

1444
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:54,110
How much do each of us?
Oh,

1445
01:16:54,170 --> 01:16:56,120
the children of other people,
right?

1446
01:16:56,180 --> 01:17:00,530
How much did I risk my life and risk 
orphaning my child to rescue your child?

1447
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:05,740
That's when things get interesting in a 
philosophy seminar and that's where 

1448
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:09,460
people begin to hesitate.
People begin to w we we are biased 

1449
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:10,610
toward protecting,
protecting our kin,

1450
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:15,700
protecting our friends,
and only then do we begin to extend the 

1451
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:15,700
circle and again and again,
moral,

1452
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,870
but it's not a mystery where we w,
W,

1453
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:23,880
we want to go here.
We want to extend the circle more and 

1454
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,390
more and build institutions and 
societies that,

1455
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:30,480
that,
that implement our best selves at our 

1456
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,130
best moments.
More and more.

1457
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:35,220
It makes it more effortless to be good 
in the defendant.

1458
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:37,770
Take your example seriously here for a 
sec.

1459
01:17:37,771 --> 01:17:37,910
Yeah.

1460
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:43,430
Alright,
so you are built to be more likely to 

1461
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,840
rescue your own child in someone else's 
child from a fire we in society,

1462
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:50,990
might like for the minimum number of 
children to die in fires as possible,

1463
01:17:51,571 --> 01:17:56,571
which gets you to sideline that 
consideration in favor of is there a 

1464
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:57,250
child,
uh,

1465
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,500
who,
who's faced with a fire,

1466
01:17:58,501 --> 01:18:01,440
who I'm,
who I might rescue religions,

1467
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:06,470
do exactly this restructuring of values 
because they say something like,

1468
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:11,730
actually your goodness in risking your 
own life to save that other child from a

1469
01:18:11,731 --> 01:18:16,731
fire is observed and it is,
it is calculated and you will be 

1470
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:17,310
rewarded for it in some way.

1471
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:22,400
That's,
that's one possible benefit of some 

1472
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,070
religions.
Right?

1473
01:18:23,190 --> 01:18:24,730
Good.
And okay,

1474
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:29,750
so he put that on the balance.
But I have a lot to put on the other 

1475
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:30,170
side of the boundary.
Do I know you list?

1476
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,110
I want to,
I,

1477
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,040
which that's what I'm trying to point 
out to Jordan here,

1478
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:35,690
which he actually

1479
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:40,840
knowledges,
which is that he's got a big stack of 

1480
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,020
good things that come from this 
heuristic,

1481
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:42,620
but

1482
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:44,590
he's also acknowledging,
get this.

1483
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,560
This is our core of disagreement here,
which is however you want to,

1484
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,600
however the balance is going to swing.
The difference between us here is that I

1485
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,230
think we read the utility of real,
of,

1486
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,210
of anything,
but in this case,

1487
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:04,211
religious thinking as evidence of you,
you read it as evidence of something 

1488
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,840
perhaps is literally true inevitability,
and I view that as a kind of version of 

1489
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,880
either genetic or naturalistic fallacy 
that is just telling you the weather,

1490
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,560
whether that's it's,
it's useful.

1491
01:19:21,561 --> 01:19:24,370
Now here for us,
it doesn't,

1492
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:28,250
doesn't argue that it's the best way of 
getting those good things.

1493
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:33,251
I mean,
my argument here is that religion gives 

1494
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:33,560
people bad reasons to be good.
We're good reasons are available.

1495
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,710
So that's a problem,
right?

1496
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:39,050
Because good real good reasons.
Scale better than bad reasons,

1497
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:44,470
and I think we can under even if you 
take the case where religion is clearly 

1498
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,740
useful,
Leah,

1499
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:49,280
in a life saving utterly benign way,
uh,

1500
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,920
in,
in virtually all of those cases,

1501
01:19:51,921 --> 01:19:56,921
I think I can,
I can get you there by some other way 

1502
01:19:56,921 --> 01:20:00,371
without the downside or if not,
that's just one of those cases where 

1503
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:06,071
yes,
the fiction was more useful than any 

1504
01:20:06,071 --> 01:20:06,071
possible.

1505
01:20:06,071 --> 01:20:08,160
Distinguish a religious system from an 
eight perceptual

1506
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:08,610
structure.

1507
01:20:09,630 --> 01:20:12,060
Well,
if you can convert to it or away from it

1508
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:15,270
in a single conversation,
I would say if it doesn't go very deep,

1509
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,630
well you're,
you're only.

1510
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,960
I would say that for much of that,
you're only converting at a very 

1511
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:21,960
superficial level.
Well,

1512
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,661
no converting at the level of conscious 
apprehension and most of your cognition 

1513
01:20:25,661 --> 01:20:25,880
is done through unconscious process.

1514
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,200
It's just a fact about us that most of 
people's religious attachment is born of

1515
01:20:32,521 --> 01:20:34,740
having it drummed into them by their 
parents.

1516
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:35,760
Right?
If I made it,

1517
01:20:35,761 --> 01:20:40,761
but the truth,
they don't know their parents and their 

1518
01:20:40,761 --> 01:20:40,761
parents' parents and their parents 
aren't exactly.

1519
01:20:40,761 --> 01:20:42,210
But if we did the same thing with Batman
and Spiderman,

1520
01:20:42,211 --> 01:20:44,560
they would have the same effect,
right?

1521
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,130
Like if,
if you relentlessly told children,

1522
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:48,280
right?
I mean,

1523
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:53,310
I've,
I've got two little girls who were 

1524
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:53,310
dressed up like bankroll right now.
They love batgirl.

1525
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:56,340
There's nothing.
I don't have to do anything to make them

1526
01:20:56,341 --> 01:21:01,341
more enthusiastic about superheroes 
apart from just showing them the 

1527
01:21:01,341 --> 01:21:01,341
pictures of superheroes,
right?

1528
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,520
If I told them,
in addition to how,

1529
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:05,850
look how fun this is to dress up like 
batgirl.

1530
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:11,690
In addition,
you're going to burn in hell for 

1531
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:14,520
eternity.
If you lose your emotional attachment to

1532
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,680
batgirl even for a minute,
right?

1533
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,260
Well then it's going to be bad girl for 
the rest of their lives,

1534
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:25,320
especially if the entire culture is,
is doing likewise.

1535
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:26,400
And again.

1536
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,870
Well,
as Brett pointed out already,

1537
01:21:29,871 --> 01:21:31,850
a bad tool is better than no tool at 
all.

1538
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:36,880
And if batgirl is the closest 
approximation to a divine sacred that 

1539
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:37,730
you can conjure up at beats the hell out
of none at all.

1540
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:41,270
And if bad girl didn't partake of 
certain archetypal structures,

1541
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:42,350
no one would give a damn about you

1542
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:43,120
after.
Okay,

1543
01:21:43,121 --> 01:21:44,740
I'm going to fight a minute,
Batman.

1544
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:45,470
I'm going to spare you

1545
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:50,560
play a role in the car because 
accidental,

1546
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,030
not accidental,

1547
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,340
that superhero stories have a structure 
and to say that,

1548
01:21:55,370 --> 01:22:00,370
well,
Batman and Spiderman are obvious 

1549
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:00,370
fictions and we could use

1550
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,280
picking the wrong end.
You're taking the wrong into this.

1551
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:06,300
I'm not.
I'm not minimizing the power of stories,

1552
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:08,520
right?
I'm saying we can understand their power

1553
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:13,521
without recourse to believing things we 
shouldn't believe now and

1554
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,760
21st century,
we still need an answer to the question 

1555
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:19,560
about what it is that's this 
transcendent,

1556
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:24,260
transcendental rational structure 
without an an a priori don't want,

1557
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:25,520
because I don't see it.

1558
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:26,960
Again,
we.

1559
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:32,080
We touched on this a little bit last 
night in that I freely admitted that in 

1560
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:37,320
every domain of human inquiry,
no matter how the most hard headed,

1561
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,010
so mathematics,
logic,

1562
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:44,190
physics,
at some point we have to pull ourselves 

1563
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:46,630
up by our bootstraps.
At some point we make a move that is not

1564
01:22:46,631 --> 01:22:51,631
self justifying and is not justified by 
any other move that's more rudimentary,

1565
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:57,150
right?
That's a statement of faith that callow 

1566
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:00,350
use of the term faith.
Same precise definition of an axiom,

1567
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:02,380
my faith,
my faith.

1568
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:05,680
That two plus two makes four.
That's not what?

1569
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:06,010
No,
it didn't.

1570
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:10,540
No.
Is My intuition that this is a valid and

1571
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:13,480
replicable and generalizeable principle,
right?

1572
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:18,030
Neither your statement that that's a 
useful claim is a statement of faith.

1573
01:23:18,031 --> 01:23:19,670
But neither of those two were statements
of faith.

1574
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,290
No,
it was their statements.

1575
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:21,990
Tuition.

1576
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,910
None of those.
These are intuitions.

1577
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:28,660
These are because and their intuitions 
that can run a foul of other discoveries

1578
01:23:28,661 --> 01:23:31,360
and other intuitions as you know.
Which.

1579
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,350
Well,
if mathematical facts or intuitions then

1580
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,490
what are we doing with?
Take a tape.

1581
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:37,610
So we've arrived.
No,

1582
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:37,850
no,
no.

1583
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:38,160
Wait,
wait,

1584
01:23:38,161 --> 01:23:38,450
wait,
wait,

1585
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:39,490
wait.
We have to decide.

1586
01:23:39,491 --> 01:23:41,910
The super important that we don't lose 
it.

1587
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:42,240
Okay.

1588
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:48,770
So we,
for what 2000 years people have been 

1589
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:53,361
studying geometry and had a very well 
worked out set of mathematical 

1590
01:23:53,521 --> 01:23:56,610
intuitions with respect to Euclidean 
space,

1591
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:01,640
you know,
flat geometry and then some brilliant 

1592
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:01,640
guy.
You know,

1593
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,030
Remonde might've been the first said,
well they actually,

1594
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:07,070
you can curve space.
I can bend this triangle and all of a 

1595
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:09,130
sudden it has more than 180 degrees.
Right?

1596
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,780
That's an intuition that people tuned up
pretty quickly,

1597
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:16,830
but all of humanity was blind to it for 
the longest time.

1598
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:21,890
Right?
These are what I mean by intuition is 

1599
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:25,020
it's the thing you're using to 
understand something that you.

1600
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,770
You are not in a position to analyze.
Now that's,

1601
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:31,680
but that's not faith of the sort which 
is.

1602
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:37,130
Listen,
I know the Bible was dictated by the 

1603
01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:38,040
creator of the universe.
I know Jesus was his son.

1604
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:40,740
I know he rose from the dead.
I know he'll be coming back

1605
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:43,510
and a thousand other propositional claim
statement.

1606
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,970
It's a highly valuable.
If it's a statement of faith and it's in

1607
01:24:46,971 --> 01:24:49,430
a value domain,
how is it drivable from fact?

1608
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:55,780
So we've arrived at the point where we 
have to decide whether to go to q and a 

1609
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:59,570
or to continue the discussion.
While you all are thinking about that,

1610
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:04,630
I would like to level the challenge to 
each of you and then I will pull the 

1611
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:04,790
audience and see what they think about q
and a.

1612
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:05,660
okay?
Okay.

1613
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:10,690
So Jordan is arguing to you that you 
cannot ground the values that would 

1614
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:20,380
undergird the modality of increasing 
wellbeing in anything factual and you 

1615
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:24,980
are arguing in response to that.

1616
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:30,180
Not Without an intermediary.
Let me just argue in a whole lot of 

1617
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:30,910
sense.
Not Without an intermediary struck.

1618
01:25:30,911 --> 01:25:32,910
What I've heard you argue is something 
that I,

1619
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:33,230
that I agree

1620
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:36,140
with,
which is that you can ground many things

1621
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,050
in a nearly,
um,

1622
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:44,260
objective observation of the universe,
but it doesn't say anything about the 

1623
01:25:44,271 --> 01:25:46,370
value part of the equation.
And in fact,

1624
01:25:46,371 --> 01:25:51,371
I think having thought about the 
question from an evolutionary point of 

1625
01:25:51,371 --> 01:25:54,191
view,
that in order to do what you're talking 

1626
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:54,191
about,
to increase wellbeing,

1627
01:25:54,191 --> 01:25:58,210
you are going to have to accept that.
That is going to leave you with an 

1628
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:00,560
arbitrary grounding.
There is no absolute grounding for it.

1629
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:05,561
And you're going to have to just simply 
accept that it's going to you arbitrary 

1630
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:09,101
that you are in fact going to have to do
inconsistent things like decide to honor

1631
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:15,010
the love of a mother for her child and 
dishonor the love of country that causes

1632
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,800
one population to gas another 
population.

1633
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,310
That's inconsistent and then will need 
to embrace that in kind of inconsistent.

1634
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:23,660
I've it.
It's just a different.

1635
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,400
I don't think we even have the grounding
problem.

1636
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:29,180
I think it's a pseudo problem.
I think what you just said,

1637
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:32,530
we have to put your stuff in somewhere.
We have a navigate.

1638
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:38,130
The way it's grounded is the 
acknowledgement that what we have is ms 

1639
01:26:38,191 --> 01:26:43,191
dot.
It's analogous to what people do with 

1640
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:44,600
the notion of of meaning in life like 
what's the meaning of life?

1641
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,840
How do you find meaning in life?
What?

1642
01:26:45,841 --> 01:26:48,560
What's the purpose of life?
These are bad questions.

1643
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,530
These are questions that when you pose 
them,

1644
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:56,650
they seem to demand.
They suggest a space in which an answer 

1645
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,320
must be put,
but it's.

1646
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,670
It's just you put an answer.
They'll.

1647
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:01,940
People should work towards the good.
Yes,

1648
01:27:01,941 --> 01:27:03,830
there's a different.
There's a different way of framing it,

1649
01:27:03,831 --> 01:27:06,650
which is what we have.
Here is an opportunity.

1650
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:07,310
It's not about.

1651
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:12,310
It's not a matter of meaning.
It's not a matter of purpose and it's 

1652
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,461
not a matter of grounding.
It's a matter of we are in a 

1653
01:27:15,461 --> 01:27:18,401
circumstance where that where we have 
consciousness and its contents in every 

1654
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:24,311
moment and all of this is that the light
the lights are on and they're on for 

1655
01:27:24,441 --> 01:27:27,070
reasons that we dimly understand right 
there.

1656
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,070
These are the reasons that are 
biological in our case,

1657
01:27:31,071 --> 01:27:36,071
but perhaps at bottom there just based 
on information processing and their 

1658
01:27:36,350 --> 01:27:41,350
platform independent and then we would 
build machines for whom the life of the 

1659
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:43,250
light is actually on or not.
Right.

1660
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:48,251
This is,
it remains to be seen whether we could 

1661
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:50,081
actually build in our computers,
conscious minds that can thrive or 

1662
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:51,320
suffer,
right,

1663
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:56,150
and that the difference matters,
but we're in a circumstance where we are

1664
01:27:56,151 --> 01:28:01,151
trying to understand how conscious 
consciousness and it states arises,

1665
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:07,210
but one thing that is undeniable is that
the lights are on and being on.

1666
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:16,030
They reveal a spectrum of experience 
that w,

1667
01:28:16,581 --> 01:28:16,980
w,
W,

1668
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:20,000
which has one end that we the,
the,

1669
01:28:20,070 --> 01:28:25,070
the worse it gets,
the more compelling it is to move away 

1670
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,150
from it.
That reading that's meaning,

1671
01:28:26,151 --> 01:28:26,510
right?
Yeah.

1672
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,520
Okay.
So and then and all of our meaning talk 

1673
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,840
and value talk relates to navigating in 
this space.

1674
01:28:32,841 --> 01:28:37,841
So there's,
there's one end of it where things get 

1675
01:28:37,841 --> 01:28:40,330
needlessly horrible without a silver 
lining and there's another end where it 

1676
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:43,871
gets better and better and non zero sum 
that all boats are rising with the same 

1677
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:44,820
tide and the Israelis and the 
Palestinians,

1678
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:47,490
the landscape cable and good.
So okay.

1679
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:52,300
So these are compelling ways to talk 
about this space of,

1680
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,530
of navigation.
What do you do?

1681
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:54,530
So

1682
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:58,980
when you accept your space of navigation
and there's a conflict between wellbeing

1683
01:28:58,981 --> 01:29:03,981
for the living population,
earth versus wellbeing over the maximum 

1684
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:08,991
populations that could possibly live 
into the future when there's a big 

1685
01:29:08,991 --> 01:29:12,621
conflict between how much wellbeing 
we're going to feel now versus how much 

1686
01:29:12,621 --> 01:29:14,000
wellbeing future human beings will get 
to feel.

1687
01:29:14,060 --> 01:29:14,800
Yeah.
Well that,

1688
01:29:14,801 --> 01:29:18,830
that those are legitimate ethical 
problems which we,

1689
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:24,040
I think we often live in the space where
we know there's a right answer,

1690
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:29,710
that we are too selfish to fulfill or 
too short sided to fulfill.

1691
01:29:30,141 --> 01:29:35,141
Like so I know there are things I do 
every day that not only will other 

1692
01:29:35,141 --> 01:29:38,180
people as yet unborn,
wish I hadn't done,

1693
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,240
I might wake up tomorrow wishing I 
hadn't done those things right,

1694
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:46,241
so like I'm a,
I'm a bad friend to my future self in 

1695
01:29:46,241 --> 01:29:49,961
some respect to say nothing of the rest 
of humanity so we can be so we can have 

1696
01:29:49,961 --> 01:29:51,140
failures,
we can have weakness of will,

1697
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:54,230
we can have failures that we can just be
wrong about certain things,

1698
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:58,880
but it's nowhere written that is easy to
be a good person.

1699
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:00,260
Right?
In that case,

1700
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,980
it's not even clear what good means is 
clear.

1701
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:05,750
I'm saying cases really knows the 
answer.

1702
01:30:05,751 --> 01:30:10,751
It might be hard to be motivated by that
knowledge and that because we're not a 

1703
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:10,751
unity,
right?

1704
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:10,751
I mean,
part of,

1705
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:15,550
part of what wisdom is morally is an 
ability to be,

1706
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:19,630
to live integrated enough with your own,
you know,

1707
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:24,940
better self.
We have the advice you would give to a 

1708
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:27,791
friend of this.
This just falls right out of your work 

1709
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:28,970
as well as live as though,
but basically treat yourself the way you

1710
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:30,710
would treat.
I think this is your line,

1711
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:33,170
so you know someone you you're you're 
responsible for,

1712
01:30:33,171 --> 01:30:34,610
or there's somebody,
a friend of yours,

1713
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:35,990
right.
If you can,

1714
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:41,140
if you can do that,
you're already ahead of who most people 

1715
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:41,140
are most of the time,
but there's no.

1716
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:45,790
There's no reason to say that because 
it's difficult or because sometimes 

1717
01:30:46,251 --> 01:30:49,640
we're looking through a glass darkly and
can't figure out what the answer is.

1718
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:52,070
The answer doesn't exist or there is no 
right one.

1719
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,450
Okay.
Now let me try with you.

1720
01:30:58,350 --> 01:30:59,230
Yeah,

1721
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,560
so Jordan,
you have argued for a and evolved 

1722
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,560
framework of religious belief in which 
there are elements that are morally 

1723
01:31:12,141 --> 01:31:14,000
defensible,
that will be carried through time.

1724
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:19,030
There are elements that are morally 
reprehensible that will be carried 

1725
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:22,031
through time by virtue of the fact that 
they are effective and you have argued 

1726
01:31:22,281 --> 01:31:27,281
that these things,
because they have withstood the test of 

1727
01:31:27,281 --> 01:31:29,780
time,
have some kind of value,

1728
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:33,230
which is not necessarily something that 
we should honor,

1729
01:31:33,231 --> 01:31:38,231
but some large fraction of it must be,
but that would seem to suggest that the 

1730
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:45,040
degree to which these belief structures 
has value is contingent on the degree to

1731
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:51,701
which the environment in which we 
attempt to deploy these structures 

1732
01:31:51,701 --> 01:31:52,530
matches the environment in which they 
evolved.

1733
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,170
Absolutely.
Now,

1734
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:59,410
I would argue that no population of 
humans has lived farther from its 

1735
01:31:59,410 --> 01:32:00,670
ancestral environment,

1736
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,390
and we do think that's a fallacy.
You think so because,

1737
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:05,110
well,
it isn't.

1738
01:32:05,111 --> 01:32:06,070
It isn't.
And look,

1739
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:08,890
I think that's an absolutely valid 
point.

1740
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:09,940
Okay,
so,

1741
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:13,600
so this gets esoteric relatively 
rapidly,

1742
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:18,601
but the question is,
let's say at the highest levels of 

1743
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:22,981
adaptation,
we're adapted to the things that last 

1744
01:32:22,981 --> 01:32:23,860
the longest periods of time.
Those are the most permanent things.

1745
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,620
Now the question is what are those most 
permanent things?

1746
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:31,950
And you know,
one answer would be the fundamental 

1747
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:32,470
material substrate of the world,
and that's true.

1748
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,590
I'm going to leave that be like we were 
evolved to deal with gravity.

1749
01:32:35,690 --> 01:32:40,690
Okay?
But there are other elements that are 

1750
01:32:40,690 --> 01:32:44,050
higher order abstractions in some sense 
that are also apparently hyperreal.

1751
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:45,980
So for example,
there's.

1752
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:48,490
There's a problem that we have a 
bifurcated,

1753
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,710
right?
The question is,

1754
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:52,480
well,
why did we have a bifurcated brain?

1755
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:54,220
And the answer seemed to not just us.

1756
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:56,350
Animals to Nasser seems to be,
well,

1757
01:32:56,351 --> 01:33:01,351
there's two necessary ways of looking at
the world and they have to be in 

1758
01:33:01,351 --> 01:33:01,480
conflict to some degree in order to work
properly.

1759
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,910
The right hemisphere and the left 
hemisphere,

1760
01:33:04,360 --> 01:33:07,300
the right hemisphere mode is a lot more 
metaphorical than the left hemisphere.

1761
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:12,780
The right hemisphere is the hemisphere 
that seems to deal with exceptions to 

1762
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,600
the rule,
and it seems to deal with the exceptions

1763
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:16,780
to the rule by men,
by treating them,

1764
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:21,810
by aggregating them,
and then trying to recognize patterns 

1765
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:25,111
that unite them as a corrective to the 
totalitarian system in some sense that 

1766
01:33:25,111 --> 01:33:29,461
the left hemisphere imposes.
You could say that the right and the 

1767
01:33:29,461 --> 01:33:32,431
left are adapted for something like 
explored territory for the left and 

1768
01:33:32,431 --> 01:33:36,091
unexplored territory for the right.
I've characterized that is order versus 

1769
01:33:36,091 --> 01:33:40,501
chaos and I think the religious 
landscape is good versus evil to Sam's 

1770
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:46,471
point that we should strive for a good 
life on a landscape of chaos versus 

1771
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:47,710
order,
and I think that landscape is permanent.

1772
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:50,710
Now I know we moved from our African 
ancestral homeland,

1773
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:53,710
but these,
this underlying abstraction,

1774
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:59,190
this underlying,
this underlying reality is so profound 

1775
01:33:59,190 --> 01:34:02,551
that it it,
it maintains its validity across all 

1776
01:34:02,551 --> 01:34:02,740
sets of potential environmental 
transformations.

1777
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:04,030
Okay?
Okay.

1778
01:34:04,031 --> 01:34:06,250
Can I just jump in here because here's 
why.

1779
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,040
Just to see is on one piece you put in 
play there.

1780
01:34:12,041 --> 01:34:16,330
Here's why good and evil can't be 
permanent in the usual sense.

1781
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:18,610
Certainly not in the Christian Judeo 
Christian sense.

1782
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:23,850
One is the Judeo Christian notion of 
good and evil doesn't even map onto to 

1783
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:27,730
eastern religion.
You made a good evil versus good claimed

1784
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,840
in the moral but it,
but it's also in an eastern context and 

1785
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,930
a Buddhist or Hindu context.
The evil isn't really evil.

1786
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:39,931
It's just ignorance.
Now you might dispute that you might 

1787
01:34:39,931 --> 01:34:39,931
say,
well that's not really.

1788
01:34:39,931 --> 01:34:41,350
They haven't met a sufficiently evil 
person to if they can think that,

1789
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:46,380
but the reality is that billions of 
people who have a different rubric under

1790
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:50,710
wisdom make the case,
but let's let.

1791
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:54,550
Let me add another another piece here.
We're just going to ask them,

1792
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:55,300
okay,
we need.

1793
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:58,490
You guys need to go guys want this to 
continue?

1794
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,380
Or do you want q and a to begin?

1795
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:03,340
I don't know which one you're fearing 
for.

1796
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,250
Give them.
Give them

1797
01:35:05,730 --> 01:35:10,160
first group is the group that wants this
conversation to continue.

1798
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:21,500
Now the group that would prefer

1799
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:22,170
q and a,

1800
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,520
it was the former.
What?

1801
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,250
What's disturbing is that many of the 
same people were laughing.

1802
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:35,230
Proves what Jordan was saying about the 
two hemispheres,

1803
01:35:35,380 --> 01:35:40,380
the brain metaphor.
So I mean it seems to me,

1804
01:35:41,081 --> 01:35:42,850
and again,
correct me if I'm wrong,

1805
01:35:42,851 --> 01:35:47,851
is that you made an absolute world claim
in the moral landscape and that's what 

1806
01:35:47,851 --> 01:35:48,320
grounds here argument

1807
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,440
these because it'll be interesting if 
it's not totally on point.

1808
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:57,980
The reason why evil is susceptible to 
total deflation is if you agree with me,

1809
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:05,450
evil is a category of human misbehavior,
human intention that we don't understand

1810
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:13,970
significantly at the level of the brain,
but if we did understand it totally at 

1811
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:18,321
the level of the brain than every evil 
person we had in the doc at trial would 

1812
01:36:18,691 --> 01:36:23,691
be just like Charles Whitman with his 
brain tumor after he shot up everyone at

1813
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,070
the University of Texas.
Right?

1814
01:36:26,071 --> 01:36:27,740
So like he,
he is,

1815
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:30,810
he's the prototypically evil mass 
murder,

1816
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:36,080
but he's complaining about this change 
that overcame his personality and he 

1817
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,911
thinks it would be good.
A good idea that if after the cops kill 

1818
01:36:40,911 --> 01:36:44,511
me,
you autopsy my brain because I don't 

1819
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:44,511
know why I'm doing any of this.
Right.

1820
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:48,470
And Lo and behold,
he had a glioblastoma pressing on his 

1821
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:51,201
amygdala and all of a sudden it made 
sense of his behavior in a way that a 

1822
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:55,161
full understanding of psychopathy or 
every other variant of human evil would 

1823
01:36:55,161 --> 01:36:58,620
make sense of it in a way that would be 
deflationary ethically.

1824
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:03,620
And then you would look at.
So then you look at someone like Saddam 

1825
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,560
Hussein or the worst evil person you 
could imagine,

1826
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:06,570
and you would say,
well,

1827
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:12,080
he's actually unlucky you know there,
but for the grace of biology,

1828
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:15,210
go on.
Because if I had that brain,

1829
01:37:15,211 --> 01:37:20,211
if I had those jeans,
if I had those influences that gave me 

1830
01:37:20,211 --> 01:37:21,060
those synapses,
I would be just like him.

1831
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:26,210
Now if you think there's some other 
element that gives us free will and now 

1832
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:26,210
then,
then,

1833
01:37:26,210 --> 01:37:28,200
then you and I are disagree that that's 
a factual claim.

1834
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,360
That's at variance with mind.
But,

1835
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:35,390
but if we are just on some level now a 
malfunctioning biological systems when 

1836
01:37:36,421 --> 01:37:41,421
we're being evil than a complete 
understanding of evil would cancel that 

1837
01:37:41,421 --> 01:37:43,290
category.
Can you define evil?

1838
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:45,830
So we know what you're talking about.
Well just take,

1839
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:50,760
take the just the worst people who have 
statistically victimized the most people

1840
01:37:50,761 --> 01:37:52,970
and those are the evil,
evil people.

1841
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:58,830
So when you say,
so I think this is actually really 

1842
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:01,101
important.
So I think actual evil of that kind is 

1843
01:38:01,101 --> 01:38:03,801
pretty darn rare.
And there's a lot of badness that email 

1844
01:38:03,801 --> 01:38:06,900
from one of the most troubling thing or 
all the good people doing evil because 

1845
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:10,370
they're ruled by bad ideas,
but that I think is more consequential 

1846
01:38:10,370 --> 01:38:13,641
than we actually.
We introduced a whole set of other 

1847
01:38:13,641 --> 01:38:14,790
things here in the last little round 
with freewill and evil,

1848
01:38:14,791 --> 01:38:15,170
but,
but,

1849
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:15,880
but just to

1850
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:19,170
want to make it clear why I went there,
you were saying this is,

1851
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:20,970
this is,
this is,

1852
01:38:21,060 --> 01:38:26,060
I forgot the word.
You used inevitable or ineluctable 

1853
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:30,780
Lloyd's permit applications that this 
category is permanent.

1854
01:38:30,781 --> 01:38:35,781
And I'm saying that I don't think but 
equal in that sense as a permanent 

1855
01:38:35,781 --> 01:38:39,411
category for us.
They do weights more information and 

1856
01:38:39,411 --> 01:38:39,411
insight.

1857
01:38:39,411 --> 01:38:40,070
Okay,
we're going to distinguish for a minute.

1858
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:45,130
Good versus evil and good versus bad.
Just for the sake of conceptual clarity 

1859
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,520
in the moral landscape,
you make a fundamental axiomatic plane,

1860
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:52,890
looks like a moral claim.
Maybe it's claim of fact.

1861
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:56,150
And the claim is there are bad lives and
good lives.

1862
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:58,070
Sure.
And the claim you make is that,

1863
01:38:58,071 --> 01:39:03,071
that's universally true.
It's true for the requisite lines,

1864
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,000
Buddhist,
Hindu,

1865
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,050
it doesn't matter.
Okay,

1866
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,770
but evil,
so yes,

1867
01:39:07,810 --> 01:39:12,810
I'm not.
I'm not telling you that you should 

1868
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:12,810
purge the word evil from your your 
vocabulary.

1869
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:16,350
I use the word all the time and I think 
it's useful to motivating word.

1870
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,240
I'm just saying that it's there.
We can understand this continuum of good

1871
01:39:21,241 --> 01:39:26,241
and bad or positive and negative in ways
that don't use the.

1872
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:32,120
The.
Certainly don't use the Judeo Christian 

1873
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:32,740
framework for value in these things 
because if you.

1874
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:35,570
If you take the Buddhist framework and 
map it onto this,

1875
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:38,280
this continuum,
you don't get good and evil.

1876
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:43,580
You get essentially wisdom and ignorance
in an evil is ignorance of all the 

1877
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:48,120
wellbeing you would you and others would
experience if you behaved another way.

1878
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:53,420
Right?
That's the Buddhist game and we're even 

1879
01:39:53,420 --> 01:39:53,520
within Hinduism and they get this 
connects to your.

1880
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,830
Your,
your love of stories.

1881
01:39:55,831 --> 01:39:56,690
You take the,
the,

1882
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,110
the,
the Hindu texts.

1883
01:39:58,110 --> 01:40:00,380
The Ramayana,
which is just a foundation,

1884
01:40:00,590 --> 01:40:05,590
is doing the work that the Bible is 
doing for Jews and Christians in that.

1885
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:09,330
The worst guy in the Ramayana,
the 10 headed Demon Rovena,

1886
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:12,660
the prototypically evil person is at 
bottom.

1887
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:17,870
Really not a bad guy.
He's a great sage who is just in a bad 

1888
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:18,160
mood essentially.
Right?

1889
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:23,430
He was was.
He was obscured by ignorance and so it 

1890
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:23,430
isn't the Buddhist cannon,
the Buddhist,

1891
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:28,030
the Buddha made say a serial killer who 
knows wearing a garland of human fingers

1892
01:40:28,801 --> 01:40:32,010
around his neck,
named ongoing on Gooley Mala,

1893
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:36,480
but he was just one conversation away 
from being fully enlightened.

1894
01:40:36,481 --> 01:40:36,810
Right?
I mean,

1895
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:41,811
he was like,
this is a different picture of a 

1896
01:40:41,811 --> 01:40:41,811
possibility.
I'm not saying one is right or wrong.

1897
01:40:41,811 --> 01:40:43,170
Let's be agnostic about that.
I'm just.

1898
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:48,171
I'm challenging your claim that there's 
something so precious and useful and 

1899
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:49,650
durable about the Judeo Christian

1900
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:52,420
I wasn't making.
I wasn't making what we're stuck with it

1901
01:40:52,421 --> 01:40:54,340
for all time.
You see making that claim.

1902
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:59,341
I was making the claim that in the moral
landscape you laid out a distinction 

1903
01:40:59,341 --> 01:41:02,260
between the bird life and the good life.
Forget about rutten evil,

1904
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:04,660
the bad life and the good life Hell and 
heaven,

1905
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:10,040
bad life and the good life,
and that that distinction was not only 

1906
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:11,110
factual but universal

1907
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:16,010
and so you the right mind so that we 
could imagine a mind.

1908
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:17,360
I mean,
this is an example.

1909
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:22,361
I think in a right mind you we can,
we can create circumstances that seem 

1910
01:41:22,361 --> 01:41:24,230
perverse to us that we were would recoil
from.

1911
01:41:24,231 --> 01:41:28,070
You could you could create a universe of
perfectly matched,

1912
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:33,100
say this and masochists say right,
so you have the people who are real 

1913
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,030
sadists who in our world would be 
terrible actors,

1914
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,050
but in their world they're surrounded by
people who want to be mistreated.

1915
01:41:39,100 --> 01:41:39,690
Now again,
this may

1916
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:42,890
real estate is you never mistreated 
masochist when he asks you,

1917
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:43,210
okay,

1918
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:48,320
well these are not

1919
01:41:53,010 --> 01:41:58,010
for the human categories even exists,
but in some we undoubtedly we could 

1920
01:41:59,881 --> 01:42:03,440
create something like an artificial 
intelligence that could be google.

1921
01:42:03,530 --> 01:42:08,530
It could be paired this way and that 
would be weird,

1922
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,250
but on my,
in my framework,

1923
01:42:11,530 --> 01:42:16,530
it is a conceivable space of equivalent 
wellbeing and if it's not matched at all

1924
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:19,180
to our space,
right?

1925
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:20,370
It's,
but it's if,

1926
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:25,460
if in fact we could inspect the 
conscious minds of all parties 

1927
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:29,450
participate in that.
It is not obviously absurd by in my view

1928
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,720
to say that they are just as happy as we
are in this conversation.

1929
01:42:33,730 --> 01:42:38,730
In fact,
some moments in this conversation I 

1930
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:38,730
would say that they might be happier.

1931
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:38,730
No,
it's been good.

1932
01:42:38,730 --> 01:42:39,270
It's been good.
So let me,

1933
01:42:39,271 --> 01:42:42,720
let me ask you a question here about 
wellbeing because this is something I've

1934
01:42:42,721 --> 01:42:45,780
wanted to ask you about but we never 
seem to get to is.

1935
01:42:45,870 --> 01:42:50,870
So you think that we should maximize 
wellbeing and that's part of your 

1936
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:54,351
proposition,
which which I don't entirely disagree 

1937
01:42:54,351 --> 01:42:55,370
with by the way that we should ground 
our value starches in fact,

1938
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:56,670
but,
but,

1939
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:59,280
but there's a black box problem.
They're like,

1940
01:42:59,281 --> 01:43:03,570
I think the black box problem about the 
April restructure that we use to extract

1941
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:08,780
the facts of the world out and the black
box problem is if we could measure 

1942
01:43:09,481 --> 01:43:11,060
wellbeing,
it's like,

1943
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:13,320
yeah,
that's a big problem Sam.

1944
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:15,660
Like we have measures of wellbeing and 
their terrible.

1945
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,160
Yes they are.

1946
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:17,950
No,
no,

1947
01:43:17,951 --> 01:43:19,220
I'm agreeing.
I think.

1948
01:43:19,221 --> 01:43:24,221
I don't think it's,
but it's not a problem for my thesis is 

1949
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:24,910
we don't have measures for anything we 
care about.

1950
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:26,580
But I mean,
if you're,

1951
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:31,670
if your thesis is that if we had the 
measures of wellbeing that were 

1952
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:35,131
appropriate,
we could use them in a positive way and 

1953
01:43:35,131 --> 01:43:35,470
the responses,
but we don't have those measures.

1954
01:43:35,471 --> 01:43:36,190
It's like,
okay,

1955
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:36,940
well then what do we do?

1956
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,500
Oh No,
no,

1957
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:39,050
but we have measures.
I mean,

1958
01:43:39,140 --> 01:43:42,270
this conversation is a measure.
I don't like that.

1959
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:43,530
That's a measure,
right?

1960
01:43:43,531 --> 01:43:46,260
You step on my toe and I say out,
that's a measure.

1961
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:46,960
Don't do that and get

1962
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:49,730
for your wellbeing.
It might be a measure of your treat.

1963
01:43:49,731 --> 01:43:50,390
Neuroticism.

1964
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:55,720
What it is a measure of.
I mean there's technically,

1965
01:43:56,990 --> 01:43:59,870
if you look at the wellbeing measures 
that we have,

1966
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:03,020
they degenerate it to measures of 
neuroticism.

1967
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:04,400
No,
we don't.

1968
01:44:04,401 --> 01:44:07,970
We don't.
But we don't have measures of certainty,

1969
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:10,550
of belief,
of compassion,

1970
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:12,500
of joy,
of,

1971
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:14,390
of any,
any of these conscious states we have.

1972
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:16,100
We have neural correlates of some of 
them,

1973
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:17,760
but we don't have.
We got,

1974
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:22,840
there's no.
Well then how helmet writes about them 

1975
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:23,330
to Orient Ourselves in the world,
Dan,

1976
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,820
because we're doing that.
We're doing this all the time.

1977
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:29,000
If you've got an instantaneous measure 
though,

1978
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,190
you've got an instantaneous measure of 
wellbeing,

1979
01:44:31,191 --> 01:44:33,260
we can all check with ourselves,
see how we feel,

1980
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:35,330
but it's possible to be wrong about 
that,

1981
01:44:37,450 --> 01:44:39,250
but,
uh,

1982
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:44,680
it degrades as you get away from the 
individual's ability to check internally

1983
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:50,590
on the internal,
the internal thing isn't reliable or 

1984
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:54,110
happy when you're doing things that will
take a drug that would make you feel 

1985
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:57,371
very good and would cause you to take 
apart your own life because it would be 

1986
01:44:57,371 --> 01:44:57,371
like cocaine.

1987
01:44:57,371 --> 01:45:00,340
It would destroy the motivational 
structure that gets you to do stumps,

1988
01:45:00,380 --> 01:45:02,050
stuff of value that,
uh,

1989
01:45:02,051 --> 01:45:04,400
that your rights,
we can't use emotion.

1990
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:08,000
That emotion as an indicator of 
instantaneous is not good,

1991
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:13,180
but you have a parallel problem.
It looks to me like the exact mirror 

1992
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:17,261
image,
which is that you've got an integrative 

1993
01:45:17,261 --> 01:45:21,100
long term measure of wellbeing 
instantiated in an evolutionary belief 

1994
01:45:21,201 --> 01:45:26,201
system,
but it's coming apart because we are 

1995
01:45:26,201 --> 01:45:27,590
living in circumstances that are less 
well mirrored.

1996
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:33,070
The president does not mirror the past 
and therefore these truths which you 

1997
01:45:33,070 --> 01:45:34,900
believe are timeless or degrading.
Yeah,

1998
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:36,120
rapidly.
That's part of.

1999
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:37,400
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

2000
01:45:37,401 --> 01:45:41,570
Okay,
so what Sam is arguing is that the tools

2001
01:45:41,571 --> 01:45:45,170
to pivot in order to improve our way of 
interacting,

2002
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:48,530
those are not the tools of long standing
tradition.

2003
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:51,110
Those are the tools of rational 
engagement,

2004
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:54,260
respect for that process as part of the 
longest standing tradition.

2005
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,640
Yes,
that's true.

2006
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:57,020
Yeah,
but that's a big truth,

2007
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:58,810
man.
That's a major league truth.

2008
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:04,330
In fact,
I would say the fundamental tradition 

2009
01:46:04,330 --> 01:46:06,830
that most fundamental tradition of the 
West says that respect for the process,

2010
01:46:06,831 --> 01:46:11,831
that updates moral judgment is the 
highest of all possible values and 

2011
01:46:11,831 --> 01:46:12,950
that's also built into the tradition.
Strangely enough,

2012
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:15,440
I agree it's built into the,
into the tradition,

2013
01:46:15,441 --> 01:46:19,790
but I would argue that it is very likely
to be compartmentalized.

2014
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:24,850
In other words.
I was a little bit struck when you said 

2015
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:24,850
that.
Um,

2016
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:29,530
what did you say about scaling?
You said that,

2017
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:34,960
uh,
the good reasons scale and batteries is 

2018
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,920
don't,
isn't that the opposite of the truth 

2019
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,240
calling if you're calling these stories 
that give prescriptions for how to 

2020
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:46,841
behave bad ideas.
The point is those stories propagate 

2021
01:46:46,841 --> 01:46:47,030
very easily,
was so.

2022
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:52,270
Whereas,
so if we want to talk about the gun and 

2023
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:55,431
whether it is loaded,
the idea that the gun is definitely 

2024
01:46:55,431 --> 01:46:56,310
loaded that scales really easily,
right?

2025
01:46:56,311 --> 01:46:58,050
You can pass that along in one sentence.

2026
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,500
I'm wrong about a loaded gun also scale,
right?

2027
01:47:02,501 --> 01:47:03,600
So no,
no,

2028
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:05,000
they're not.
Want to talk to

2029
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:10,560
about very small possibilities of very 
dire things happening.

2030
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:13,270
They trip over it.
It's hard thing to get.

2031
01:47:13,271 --> 01:47:15,580
It's almost impossible for them to get 
it.

2032
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:18,640
So the point is the one thing does scale
story that says yeah,

2033
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,800
every gun is loaded.
It's a false story,

2034
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:25,690
but that one definitely scaled this 
statistical reality of guns and the fact

2035
01:47:25,691 --> 01:47:30,691
that they may indeed beyond loaded,
but you don't want to play around with 

2036
01:47:30,691 --> 01:47:32,290
the remote possibility that one day 
you'll get it wrong,

2037
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:37,500
right?
That doesn't scale because it requires 

2038
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:37,630
you to have experienced with stuff that 
is not common.

2039
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:38,460
Right?
Well,

2040
01:47:38,530 --> 01:47:39,530
so,
so the two things there,

2041
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:42,980
one of you bring up as an ancillary but 
very important point,

2042
01:47:42,981 --> 01:47:47,981
which is that moral progress here is 
often the result of moving from our 

2043
01:47:53,720 --> 01:47:58,720
story-driven protagonists driven 
intuitions to something far more 

2044
01:47:59,151 --> 01:48:00,500
quantified.
Right?

2045
01:48:00,501 --> 01:48:01,700
So I mean,
this is a classic,

2046
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,010
you know,
moral study done by Paul Slovako,

2047
01:48:05,030 --> 01:48:10,030
I'm sure you are aware of where you tell
people about one needy little girl in 

2048
01:48:11,061 --> 01:48:12,830
Africa and you give her a name and,
and,

2049
01:48:12,831 --> 01:48:16,430
and show her picture,
and what you elicit is the maximum,

2050
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:19,250
our truest compassionate response from 
subjects.

2051
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:24,550
You go to another group of subjects,
you tell them about the same little 

2052
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,550
girl,
give her the same name,

2053
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:26,660
but also tell them about her needy 
little brother,

2054
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:30,770
right?
Who has the same need and their response

2055
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:31,940
diminishes,
right?

2056
01:48:31,941 --> 01:48:35,990
That just the addition of a single 
person diminishes the response.

2057
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:40,990
And this is just,
this is a moral fallacy that we're all 

2058
01:48:40,990 --> 01:48:41,690
living out every day because if you care
about this one little girl,

2059
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:45,170
you should care at least as much about 
the fate of her and her brother.

2060
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,070
And when you ask statistic,
no,

2061
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:51,610
no,
you shouldn't because this is a man.

2062
01:48:51,670 --> 01:48:53,730
You'll exhaust yourself in the attempt.
No,

2063
01:48:53,731 --> 01:48:58,731
because we need.
What do you wanting to know for 100 

2064
01:48:58,731 --> 01:48:58,940
people?
This is what this,

2065
01:48:59,070 --> 01:49:04,070
this is what this software flog gets us.
It gets us people who will watch four 

2066
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:06,290
hours a day with,
with,

2067
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:11,320
with effortless and and Peter Tear,
stained compassion,

2068
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:16,350
the saga of the little girl who fell 
down the well,

2069
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:21,770
but who will blindly turn the channel 
when they're hearing about a genocide 

2070
01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:24,150
that is raging and there's a thousands 
have already died.

2071
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:26,490
Listen guys,
if you have something,

2072
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:31,491
we have to.
If you for this know I'm not talking 

2073
01:49:31,491 --> 01:49:31,960
about you're misunderstood.

2074
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:33,880
You're misunderstanding me to great 
effect here.

2075
01:49:34,090 --> 01:49:39,090
That if I'm not saying that you should 
personally be overwhelmed by the death 

2076
01:49:40,001 --> 01:49:45,001
toll every day you.
I'm not saying that it's functional for 

2077
01:49:45,001 --> 01:49:47,791
you and I to each personally get up each
morning and just drink deep of the full 

2078
01:49:48,821 --> 01:49:50,830
horror of all the bad luck that is 
spread.

2079
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:51,700
No,
maybe it is,

2080
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:55,030
but maybe we can't have that,
but as societies we need.

2081
01:49:55,330 --> 01:49:58,690
When you're talking about how we report,
how we spend our money,

2082
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:03,960
how we get a portion foreign aid,
the kinds of wars we fight or don't 

2083
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:03,970
fight,
it had to interpret.

2084
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:07,990
Then we have to correct for what is in 
fact a moral illusion,

2085
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:10,510
which is we know that if we tell one 
little,

2086
01:50:10,980 --> 01:50:14,650
we tell one compelling story about a 
little girl,

2087
01:50:14,740 --> 01:50:17,020
right.
We could go to war over that.

2088
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:22,080
Right.
Whereas we won't be motivated by a 

2089
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:22,080
genocide.

2090
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,080
That's the kind of thing that moves 
whole societies now and if,

2091
01:50:23,081 --> 01:50:23,520
if,
if it's.

2092
01:50:23,530 --> 01:50:26,110
If you add to it the bogus religious 
sanctity,

2093
01:50:26,111 --> 01:50:26,920
he's,
if you,

2094
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:27,440
if,
if you,

2095
01:50:27,450 --> 01:50:30,160
if we burn the Koran on this stage 
tonight,

2096
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:31,950
the rest of our.
Yeah,

2097
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:35,200
the rest of our lives would be spent in 
hiding,

2098
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:38,500
right?
Because of how motivated people would be

2099
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,080
to,
to,

2100
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,890
to address that pseudo problem.
Right.

2101
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:47,130
That's the world we're living in and 
we're at civilization so far as we have 

2102
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:51,541
a purchase on.
It is a matter of correcting for those 

2103
01:50:51,541 --> 01:50:53,560
errors and religion for the most part,
not across the board,

2104
01:50:53,561 --> 01:50:56,920
but for the most part is standing in the
way of those course corrections.

2105
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,920
Thank you.

2106
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:05,490
Well,
okay.

2107
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:08,610
There was a tremendous amount to unpack 
in that.

2108
01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,250
I mean and,
and like in some sense,

2109
01:51:11,251 --> 01:51:12,510
a surprising amount.
It's like,

2110
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:14,850
well,
we have,

2111
01:51:15,050 --> 01:51:20,050
we're,
we're wired to feel intense empathy for 

2112
01:51:20,050 --> 01:51:24,141
individuals who are close to us and we 
can be told stories in a manner that 

2113
01:51:25,310 --> 01:51:30,310
that makes that system manifest itself 
and everyone and their dog thinks that 

2114
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:32,040
that's a wonderful thing and we call 
that empathy,

2115
01:51:32,090 --> 01:51:37,090
right,
and empathy has a narrow domain of 

2116
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:37,210
utility as it turns out,
because how?

2117
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,290
I mean maybe if you were all who you 
should be,

2118
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:45,320
you'd be weeping constantly for the 
catastrophic fate of sentient beings on 

2119
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:45,660
the earth,
but you can't handle it.

2120
01:51:45,720 --> 01:51:48,090
You know what I mean?
It's that you can barely handle your own

2121
01:51:48,091 --> 01:51:52,080
suffering and maybe you can handle a bit
of the suffering of your family and more

2122
01:51:52,081 --> 01:51:57,081
power to you.
If you could rectify that and if you 

2123
01:51:57,081 --> 01:51:57,090
were better human beings,
maybe you could expand that outwards,

2124
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:02,360
but the fact that our empathy doesn't 
scale up to the level of genocide with 

2125
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,730
the same intensity that we treat 
instances of individuals,

2126
01:52:04,731 --> 01:52:07,020
suffering isn't an indication that we're
irrational.

2127
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:09,120
It's just an indication that we're 
limited.

2128
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:14,090
I think this is an indication of exactly

2129
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:15,620
the problem

2130
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:20,650
of our evolved structure is not matching
the present because the point is match 

2131
01:52:20,780 --> 01:52:22,400
because we take care of our families 
know,

2132
01:52:22,401 --> 01:52:27,401
but they don't match because if you 
encountered the starving girl that's 

2133
01:52:27,401 --> 01:52:32,101
some sort of a.
it's a crude measure of suffering in 

2134
01:52:32,101 --> 01:52:36,611
your local environment.
Were you in the past now that you can 

2135
01:52:36,611 --> 01:52:39,821
encounter this girl on the television?
It's not clear what it should mean to 

2136
01:52:39,821 --> 01:52:39,821
you.
Right?

2137
01:52:39,821 --> 01:52:44,260
Right.
You can't calibrate how many your act 

2138
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:44,260
together.
Right,

2139
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:46,460
and so the.
So the point is your indifference

2140
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:48,980
to a genocide,
which is an abstraction,

2141
01:52:49,420 --> 01:52:51,800
right,
is altered.

2142
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:55,370
Should you see pictures of the bodies,
for example,

2143
01:52:55,550 --> 01:53:00,550
you shouldn't actually feel differently 
about the genocide in the abstract case 

2144
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:04,421
versus the the case that you're looking 
at the bodies and the fact that we have 

2145
01:53:04,421 --> 01:53:07,430
access to photo realistic 
representations breading.

2146
01:53:08,410 --> 01:53:13,410
Of course that was actually a rational 
because I can show you the case where 

2147
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:18,020
you care at level 10 about the little 
girl named Lila and you care at level 

2148
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:25,220
eight about the little girl named Layla 
and her brother named Jaunty.

2149
01:53:25,830 --> 01:53:28,980
Right?
And you care at level four if I've added

2150
01:53:28,981 --> 01:53:33,981
a few more kids,
but the little girl named Lila who you 

2151
01:53:33,981 --> 01:53:35,820
was ostensibly care about is there and 
each one of these,

2152
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:38,000
right,
so nurses are diminished,

2153
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,740
diminished nobody beautification of the 
sufferer.

2154
01:53:40,741 --> 01:53:45,741
You have $10 to give away every month to
help start struggling in humanity and 

2155
01:53:45,741 --> 01:53:48,300
you tell me you'll give 10 to lila this 
month and I,

2156
01:53:48,450 --> 01:53:50,580
and then I catch you in another moment.
And I say,

2157
01:53:50,581 --> 01:53:51,750
well,
you know,

2158
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,180
it's Leila and her brother.
So it's like,

2159
01:53:54,181 --> 01:53:56,790
if you only can give 10,
I understand,

2160
01:53:56,791 --> 01:54:00,000
but you know the problem is actually 
worse than I suspected.

2161
01:54:00,210 --> 01:54:05,210
And you say,
well actually album's going to give 

2162
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:05,210
eight.
Right?

2163
01:54:05,210 --> 01:54:06,510
You,
it's not coherent with your how much you

2164
01:54:06,690 --> 01:54:08,220
cared about Leila and the first place

2165
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:13,280
we do know we do know quite well.
The risks that we use to orient 

2166
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:17,000
ourselves in the world can be placed 
into frameworks where they produce 

2167
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,761
contradictory outcomes.
But that doesn't mean that the 

2168
01:54:19,761 --> 01:54:22,161
heuristics themselves are deeply flawed.
It's that it's a problem with the work 

2169
01:54:22,161 --> 01:54:22,161
of people like condiment and diversity

2170
01:54:22,161 --> 01:54:25,840
is that we need to correct for that we 
need to correct for them because they're

2171
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:31,220
producing reliable results that we 
recognize that you can put them in a 

2172
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:31,220
situation where they

2173
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:35,990
produce a counterproductive response,
but that doesn't mean that generally 

2174
01:54:35,990 --> 01:54:38,811
speaking,
in most situations they don't produce a 

2175
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:40,821
useful outcome because the question is 
why in the hell would they evolved if 

2176
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:40,821
they didn't?

2177
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:45,780
Most of the time evolved to live with 
150 people with whom we're related and 

2178
01:54:45,911 --> 01:54:49,870
to be terrified of the people in the 
next valley who may want to kill and eat

2179
01:54:49,871 --> 01:54:50,660
us.
Yes,

2180
01:54:50,670 --> 01:54:51,370
and that's,
I mean,

2181
01:54:51,371 --> 01:54:56,371
that's our ancient circumstance which 
doesn't map onto a common humanity of 7 

2182
01:54:56,371 --> 01:55:01,350
billion people trying to figure out how 
to get to Mars without killing each 

2183
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,350
other.
Well,

2184
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:04,120
it does map onto it sometimes,
unfortunately,

2185
01:55:04,121 --> 01:55:07,170
because there are many times when we 
still face the same kind of effect,

2186
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:08,570
but hence,
look at maps.

2187
01:55:08,571 --> 01:55:13,571
Sean does the hierarchy.
You wouldn't be concerned about the 

2188
01:55:13,571 --> 01:55:16,510
fundamentalists,
terror of Islam if you weren't driven by

2189
01:55:16,511 --> 01:55:20,520
those essentially tribal considerations 
suggesting not trauma.

2190
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:25,550
It doesn't require if my a mere 
identification with humanity,

2191
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:31,260
it can ground not wanting to be murdered
by people who are identified with a 

2192
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:32,550
subset of humanity.
Right?

2193
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:37,560
Like I don't need to be part of a 
smaller tribe to care that people will 

2194
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:39,940
murder me over burning the Koran.

2195
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:40,660
Right?
It's,

2196
01:55:40,661 --> 01:55:41,260
it's,
it's just,

2197
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:46,320
it's clearly counterproductive that we 
live in a society where some objects are

2198
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:51,060
held with such totemic attachment for 
irrational reasons,

2199
01:55:51,061 --> 01:55:54,830
by many,
many millions of people were,

2200
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:57,290
you know,
you should be sympathetic with this.

2201
01:55:57,291 --> 01:55:59,850
Our free speech is actually canceled on 
this point,

2202
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:02,640
right?
We literally can't produce cartoons.

2203
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:06,000
I have scholarly words about the cartoon
price if we don't show the cartoon,

2204
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:11,210
no argument whatsoever.
So if we miss about the lack of utility 

2205
01:56:11,210 --> 01:56:12,320
of you,
you don't have to be identified as a,

2206
01:56:12,690 --> 01:56:16,380
as a Christian or a Jew to push back 
against that.

2207
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:21,410
You just have to be a human being that 
sees the dysfunction of a smaller kind 

2208
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:22,710
of provincialism.

2209
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:28,480
Well,
the thing that I'm struggling with is 

2210
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:28,540
that I still can't understand in what 
your ethos is,

2211
01:56:28,630 --> 01:56:33,440
is is grounded because you claim like a 
transcendental rationalism,

2212
01:56:33,441 --> 01:56:35,690
but you won't identify the structures 
that produce it.

2213
01:56:35,691 --> 01:56:40,691
It's a black box and when I tried to 
push you on the absolute nature of your 

2214
01:56:40,691 --> 01:56:42,530
ethical claim,
which is that the bad life is worse than

2215
01:56:42,531 --> 01:56:46,450
the good life and that we should in fact
university work towards the good life.

2216
01:56:46,790 --> 01:56:51,790
It doesn't seem to me that you'll accept
the proposition that that's a universal 

2217
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:51,790
claim.

2218
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:51,790
It.
No,

2219
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:51,790
it is.
It is.

2220
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:53,700
Well,
I should is irrelevant here.

2221
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:58,620
It's just the fact that there is the 
possibility of moving in this space.

2222
01:56:58,621 --> 01:57:02,970
If you move in the wrong direction,
if you move far enough,

2223
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,590
you'll like it less and less,
but why is it relevant?

2224
01:57:06,660 --> 01:57:09,390
Give given the given the mines you have.

2225
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:14,890
Well,
what if you had to accept moving in the 

2226
01:57:14,890 --> 01:57:18,931
wrong direction and experiencing less 
and less wellbeing in order to get to a 

2227
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:19,220
better place it.
Well,

2228
01:57:19,221 --> 01:57:21,550
and maybe even just to survive,
suppose the,

2229
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:26,600
suppose the population has to endure a 
generation and a half of misery in order

2230
01:57:27,251 --> 01:57:28,060
to persist

2231
01:57:28,550 --> 01:57:33,550
ethically,
that's a perfectly intelligible 

2232
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:35,891
circumstance that people have had to 
face and it's in my,

2233
01:57:37,941 --> 01:57:42,941
on my moral landscape,
it's analogous to what we were were we 

2234
01:57:42,941 --> 01:57:45,000
might be at one local maximum or some 
high point,

2235
01:57:45,860 --> 01:57:50,420
but we're moving in a down a slope to 
get to yet some higher place.

2236
01:57:50,421 --> 01:57:51,230
Right?
So certain things,

2237
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:56,740
some things may only be possible if we 
made some painful and net unpleasant 

2238
01:57:57,651 --> 01:58:00,140
sacrifice for sure.
Yes.

2239
01:58:00,260 --> 01:58:01,050
And so that,
but that's,

2240
01:58:01,100 --> 01:58:04,400
that can be rationally apprehended.
There can be an argument for that.

2241
01:58:04,580 --> 01:58:05,490
It could be a way.
Well,

2242
01:58:05,491 --> 01:58:06,890
you know,
we all have to go on a diet,

2243
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:10,880
otherwise we're going to,
we're going to die of this problem,

2244
01:58:10,881 --> 01:58:15,881
right?
We all have to stop eating whatever it 

2245
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:15,881
is,
wheat,

2246
01:58:15,881 --> 01:58:16,100
right?
It's a hard sacrifice for.

2247
01:58:16,101 --> 01:58:18,870
People will have to stop it as you know,
uh,

2248
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:22,610
if that were just true wealth and 
there'd be an argument for it,

2249
01:58:22,611 --> 01:58:24,710
there'd be evidence that would convince 
us we would stop,

2250
01:58:24,740 --> 01:58:29,740
we would feel the pain and we would,
we would get whatever benefit with that 

2251
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:29,740
was on the other side of that sacrifice.

2252
01:58:29,750 --> 01:58:31,310
But again,
you don't have to,

2253
01:58:31,640 --> 01:58:35,380
if the utility again to come bring it 
back to stories at which is,

2254
01:58:35,570 --> 01:58:36,920
as you know,
not my emphasis,

2255
01:58:36,921 --> 01:58:38,930
but it is yours.
The,

2256
01:58:38,990 --> 01:58:43,300
the utility of stories is not something 
I'm arguing against.

2257
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:46,630
I mean there's no question that certain 
stories are incredibly compelling.

2258
01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:49,180
And in our conversation with one 
another,

2259
01:58:49,450 --> 01:58:52,450
the moment you begin to frame something 
in terms of a story,

2260
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:55,420
people become much more interested right
now if,

2261
01:58:55,490 --> 01:59:00,490
if,
if 90 percent of what we said together 

2262
01:59:00,490 --> 01:59:01,900
tonight,
we're afraid each,

2263
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:04,700
each point we were making as a matter of
philosophy or,

2264
01:59:04,890 --> 01:59:09,520
or,
or science were framed in will.

2265
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:09,970
Actually,
you know,

2266
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:12,640
yesterday I was walking down the street 
and I met this guy,

2267
01:59:12,660 --> 01:59:17,660
the terrifying looking guy and all of a 
sudden people become much more 

2268
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:17,660
interested.
Right?

2269
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:22,291
And then that's not an accident and that
says something deep about us that we 

2270
01:59:22,291 --> 01:59:26,911
could understand that in evolutionary 
terms and we might in fact one to 

2271
01:59:26,911 --> 01:59:29,890
creatively leverage to be better people,
to have better conversations.

2272
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:30,970
Definitely,
yes.

2273
01:59:31,370 --> 01:59:33,160
So that's what I think.
There's nothing.

2274
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:38,220
There's nothing that I say in opposition
to religious dogmatism and religious 

2275
01:59:38,921 --> 01:59:43,921
sectarianism that discounts that reality
and that's a psychological reality is a 

2276
01:59:44,201 --> 01:59:49,201
cultural reality.
And I'm not against making the most of 

2277
01:59:49,201 --> 01:59:49,201
it.
My,

2278
01:59:49,201 --> 01:59:50,320
my basic claim,
however,

2279
01:59:50,321 --> 01:59:55,321
is that we never need to believe that 
one of our books may not have a human 

2280
01:59:56,261 --> 01:59:58,390
origin.
In order to do that effectively,

2281
01:59:58,630 --> 02:00:03,630
you can.
You can be just as compelled by the 

2282
02:00:03,630 --> 02:00:06,241
example of somebody like Jesus or some 
more modern person who strikes you as a 

2283
02:00:08,261 --> 02:00:13,261
moral hero and a deeply wise without 
believing anything on insufficient 

2284
02:00:13,901 --> 02:00:14,770
evidence.
And if,

2285
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:18,730
as I,
as you alluded to,

2286
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:24,040
purely fictional stories about 
superheros can have immense effect on us

2287
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:26,800
and that's something we could understand
and also leverage.

2288
02:00:27,070 --> 02:00:32,070
But again,
that takes us out of the religion 

2289
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,070
business and that's,
that's all I've been arguing for.

2290
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:33,100
So do you really believe

2291
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:33,780
that's

2292
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:40,830
the belief in the supernatural aspect of
these stories,

2293
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:44,730
never alters the calculus of what people
should do,

2294
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:50,480
that the divine nature of a story about 
Jesus doesn't motivate people to do 

2295
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,750
something that they might not have the 
courage to do otherwise.

2296
02:00:51,751 --> 02:00:56,751
The belief that they might end up in 
heaven because their good work is going 

2297
02:00:56,751 --> 02:00:57,480
to be observed,
doesn't alter their behavior.

2298
02:00:57,580 --> 02:00:57,940
Well,
yeah,

2299
02:00:57,941 --> 02:01:01,850
I know it alters their behavior,
but rather often for the bad.

2300
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:06,960
Well,
I mean this is why this is what worries 

2301
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:06,960
me about.
Hey,

2302
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:10,170
I think there's something there.
There's a profound net negative that we 

2303
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:15,301
are paying the price for everyday by 
believing in paradise,

2304
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,380
right?
The belief,

2305
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:22,400
a belief that this life,
it probably doesn't matter very much at 

2306
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:27,031
all because we get what we really want 
after we die is forget about the 

2307
02:01:28,241 --> 02:01:31,330
evidentiary basis for that belief.
It is.

2308
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:36,130
It's ruinous for prioritizing what we 
should be prioritizing in this life.

2309
02:01:36,190 --> 02:01:37,720
And if I agree with that,
by the way.

2310
02:01:37,721 --> 02:01:38,590
Yeah.
Okay.

2311
02:01:38,591 --> 02:01:39,230
Well that's interesting.

2312
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:47,840
So let me ask you this,
I hear from you what might be a kind of 

2313
02:01:49,461 --> 02:01:52,490
confirmation bias where I hear that,
you know,

2314
02:01:52,491 --> 02:01:56,150
we've got a mixed bag,
you've got supernatural claims,

2315
02:01:56,151 --> 02:02:01,151
these supernatural claims,
we all agree have effects on the way 

2316
02:02:01,151 --> 02:02:04,391
people actually behave and you're quite 
focused on the negative and you tend to 

2317
02:02:04,851 --> 02:02:09,851
discount the positive which might be an 
artifact of the fact that we're talking 

2318
02:02:09,851 --> 02:02:14,081
about the present and therefore maybe 
something that's not well matched to 

2319
02:02:14,081 --> 02:02:18,011
these stories or it might be from the 
idea that you have the sense that there 

2320
02:02:18,011 --> 02:02:22,091
is actually a bias that these belief 
structures do and have always produced 

2321
02:02:22,790 --> 02:02:25,040
more harm than good.

2322
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:30,320
And also my sense that the positive can 
be had without those structures.

2323
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:32,170
So they,
if you're talking about the,

2324
02:02:32,171 --> 02:02:33,380
the,
the,

2325
02:02:33,490 --> 02:02:38,490
the contemplative experience like is it 
possible to feed the wake up tomorrow 

2326
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:42,491
morning feeling like my heart right?
Feeling like you're just inseparable 

2327
02:02:43,461 --> 02:02:47,990
from the pure capital b being that is 
consciousness,

2328
02:02:48,350 --> 02:02:50,540
right?
And there's no separate self,

2329
02:02:50,590 --> 02:02:55,590
their,
the self transcending union with 

2330
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:56,120
everything you can proceed.
Right?

2331
02:02:56,210 --> 02:03:01,210
I think that can be had without any kind
of religious dogmatism masters that 

2332
02:03:01,210 --> 02:03:02,300
matter of paying close enough attention 
to the nature of consciousness,

2333
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:05,660
so the contemplative life is the bay is 
one baby in the bathwater.

2334
02:03:05,690 --> 02:03:08,840
We can save the ethical life is another 
baby.

2335
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:13,870
We can say if you don't have to 
presuppose anything on insufficient 

2336
02:03:13,870 --> 02:03:17,171
evidence to argue about what is right 
and wrong and good and evil in in the 

2337
02:03:17,171 --> 02:03:17,240
21st century.

2338
02:03:17,730 --> 02:03:22,730
Is it fair to call that a hypothesis 
that not just for some people but for 

2339
02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:27,561
everyone.
The level of wellbeing can be enhanced 

2340
02:03:27,561 --> 02:03:31,530
through rational interaction with the 
questions that dictate what we do.

2341
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:33,960
Is that a hypothesis?
Whoa.

2342
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:39,380
That's a hypothesis that the one 
additional fact that we that makes that 

2343
02:03:40,590 --> 02:03:43,800
more or less mood is that on certain 
points,

2344
02:03:44,610 --> 02:03:49,610
even if we felt that really believe in 
the fiction were what was it was 

2345
02:03:51,481 --> 02:03:56,481
advantageous to people.
Depending on which fiction you're 

2346
02:03:56,481 --> 02:03:56,481
talking about,
there's simply just.

2347
02:03:56,481 --> 02:03:58,770
There's too much evidence against it.
You can't.

2348
02:03:58,771 --> 02:04:03,771
You can't decide to believe something 
for which you have no evidence simply 

2349
02:04:04,831 --> 02:04:06,850
because of the good effects.
The good,

2350
02:04:06,860 --> 02:04:11,860
the good experience.
It will give you or you imagine it will 

2351
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:11,860
give you.
I mean,

2352
02:04:11,860 --> 02:04:12,690
that's.
That's why Pascal's wager never made any

2353
02:04:12,691 --> 02:04:17,691
sense.
We can't say the only way you can 

2354
02:04:17,691 --> 02:04:17,910
believe something to be true,
really true,

2355
02:04:17,940 --> 02:04:22,940
not just metaphorically true,
is to believe that if it weren't true,

2356
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:28,730
you wouldn't believe it.
They you stand at some relationship to 

2357
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:30,300
its truth such that that is the reason 
why you believe it.

2358
02:04:30,330 --> 02:04:32,580
Now you can't say,
you can't be telling yourself,

2359
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:34,380
you know,
I have no evidence for this thing,

2360
02:04:34,381 --> 02:04:37,650
but I know life would be better if I 
believed that to true,

2361
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:39,660
and so therefore,
I really believe it's true.

2362
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:41,130
You don't think people do that all the 
time?

2363
02:04:41,190 --> 02:04:46,190
I don't think they do.
I think they do things much more like 

2364
02:04:46,190 --> 02:04:46,950
we're talking the metaphorical truth.
We're talking about you.

2365
02:04:46,951 --> 02:04:51,951
We act as if things are true without 
forming any strong propositional claim 

2366
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:54,640
and that's fine.
That's fine.

2367
02:04:54,830 --> 02:04:57,590
That has its own utility.
You don't think this is

2368
02:04:57,700 --> 02:04:58,600
basically.
I mean,

2369
02:04:58,660 --> 02:05:03,660
we all suspend disbelief when we go and 
watch a movie and we sort of entitled a 

2370
02:05:03,671 --> 02:05:07,420
movie maker to,
to set the ground rules of the space and

2371
02:05:07,421 --> 02:05:10,240
if it's Harry Potter,
than there are magic magical things that

2372
02:05:10,241 --> 02:05:12,340
can happen and if it's some other story,
maybe there aren't.

2373
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:17,580
So we all have a mechanism whereby we 
know we can suspend disbelief and it's 

2374
02:05:17,831 --> 02:05:22,831
interesting to me that you seem not to 
imagine that people are doing that with 

2375
02:05:22,831 --> 02:05:27,481
respect to metaphysical beliefs that 
have implications for what the right 

2376
02:05:27,481 --> 02:05:29,680
actions that they should take art.
Why?

2377
02:05:29,710 --> 02:05:33,520
Why wouldn't it be the case that that 
same sort of mechanism would apply?

2378
02:05:34,190 --> 02:05:35,630
Well,
it does apply,

2379
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,480
but there are people who are clearly 
doing much more than that.

2380
02:05:39,320 --> 02:05:40,660
So I'm not.
If,

2381
02:05:40,730 --> 02:05:44,840
if that's all people were doing under 
the ages of religion,

2382
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:47,300
I wouldn't spend much time worrying 
about religion,

2383
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:50,240
but that to some degree that's what 
people do.

2384
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:51,140
You know,
as you say,

2385
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:56,170
go into caring about things that I 
bought them we really shouldn't care 

2386
02:05:56,170 --> 02:05:59,321
about.
So the World Cup is on right now and we 

2387
02:05:59,321 --> 02:06:02,980
literally billions of people care care 
down to their toes.

2388
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:07,490
What happens to this little ball as it 
traverses a lawn.

2389
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:10,670
Right?
And if it goes into the net,

2390
02:06:10,760 --> 02:06:15,760
it really matters if it fails to,
it really matters and always matters if 

2391
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:17,360
we hit the target Sam.
But this is,

2392
02:06:17,380 --> 02:06:20,120
this is something we have manufactured 
to care about,

2393
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:22,040
right?
It speaks to us.

2394
02:06:22,330 --> 02:06:26,450
It's quite literally a game,
a game that people are playing.

2395
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:31,450
But some people take it in taking it 
further than you,

2396
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:36,290
than,
than seems truly rational is part of the

2397
02:06:36,291 --> 02:06:37,270
fun.
That's but,

2398
02:06:37,271 --> 02:06:42,271
but the fee that the people who can't 
turn that off metaphor soccer's a 

2399
02:06:42,271 --> 02:06:42,880
metaphor but there.
But there are people who there,

2400
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:43,610
you know,
there are people,

2401
02:06:43,611 --> 02:06:48,611
you know the,
the fullback who kicks an own goal and 

2402
02:06:48,611 --> 02:06:50,960
then goes back to his South American 
village and gets murdered.

2403
02:06:50,990 --> 02:06:53,000
Right?
He's surrounded by people who are taking

2404
02:06:53,001 --> 02:06:54,320
the game too seriously.
Yeah.

2405
02:06:54,321 --> 02:06:55,520
Okay.
I agree.

2406
02:06:55,521 --> 02:07:00,521
Yeah.
And so my problem with religion is that 

2407
02:07:00,521 --> 02:07:03,191
so much of a time we're meeting those 
people and we're at work and we're not 

2408
02:07:03,191 --> 02:07:07,271
criticizing those people.
We have no place to stand to criticize 

2409
02:07:07,271 --> 02:07:07,271
those people because

2410
02:07:07,271 --> 02:07:08,950
so attached to the game.
Fair enough.

2411
02:07:10,020 --> 02:07:15,020
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we each take three minutes to 

2412
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,020
sum up.

2413
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:15,020
So I think,
yeah,

2414
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:16,640
we are there.
We're at the end of time.

2415
02:07:16,641 --> 02:07:18,500
So why don't you each take three 
minutes,

2416
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,480
some up and then we'll call it.
Good.

2417
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:24,200
Okay.
I'm sure Sam went last.

2418
02:07:24,201 --> 02:07:26,050
Do you want to go first here?
Okay.

2419
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:31,830
So there's lots of things about which 
seminar.

2420
02:07:34,161 --> 02:07:34,870
I agree,

2421
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:38,620
but the devil's in the details.
Of course.

2422
02:07:39,790 --> 02:07:44,790
Now I,
I'm very sympathetic to his claim that 

2423
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:49,381
we need to ground our ethical systems in
something solid and demonstrable.

2424
02:07:51,370 --> 02:07:56,370
My problem is I'm not sure how to do 
that when I don't believe that you can 

2425
02:07:56,741 --> 02:08:01,741
derive a value structure from your 
experience of the observable facts.

2426
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:07,950
There's too many facts.
You need a structure to interpret them 

2427
02:08:07,950 --> 02:08:10,720
and there isn't very much of you.
And so part of the reason,

2428
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:15,810
part of the way that that's addressed 
neurologically is that you have an 

2429
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:18,280
inbuilt structure.
It's deep,

2430
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:23,880
it's partly biological,
it's partly an emergent consequences of 

2431
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:28,060
your socialization and you view the 
world of facts through that structure 

2432
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:32,940
and it's a structure of value.
Now that structure of value may be 

2433
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:35,620
derived from the world of facts over the
evolutionary timeframe,

2434
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:40,950
but it's not derived from the world of 
facts over the timeframe that you 

2435
02:08:40,950 --> 02:08:40,950
inhabit and it can't be.

2436
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:46,740
So.
The problem I have with our discussion 

2437
02:08:46,740 --> 02:08:50,191
so far isn't really any of Sam's 
fundamental ethical claims because I do 

2438
02:08:50,191 --> 02:08:54,841
believe there's a distinction between 
the hellish life and the heavenly life 

2439
02:08:54,841 --> 02:08:57,820
say the life that everyone would agree 
with absolutely not worth living and the

2440
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:02,821
life we could imagine as good.
And I do believe that we should be 

2441
02:09:02,821 --> 02:09:05,641
moving from one to the other.
The question is exactly how is it that 

2442
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:09,940
we make the decisions that will guide us
along that way.

2443
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,330
And I don't believe we can make them 
without that April to restructure.

2444
02:09:13,331 --> 02:09:18,331
In fact,
I think the evidence is absolutely 

2445
02:09:18,331 --> 02:09:20,641
overwhelming that we can't.
And I mean also the scientific evidence 

2446
02:09:20,641 --> 02:09:23,200
and I would like to go further into the 
devil that's in those details.

2447
02:09:23,710 --> 02:09:27,520
And so that's my situation.

2448
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,550
Thanks.

2449
02:09:43,340 --> 02:09:47,640
Hope part of these conversations.
And now if you,

2450
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:50,050
and I've had I think four conference 
done,

2451
02:09:50,051 --> 02:09:51,970
two podcasts in this or a second live 
event.

2452
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,540
And thank you for doing this.
By the way,

2453
02:09:55,541 --> 02:09:56,360
this is,
hey,

2454
02:09:56,361 --> 02:10:01,361
it's my pleasure,
honor to do this.

2455
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:06,270
And it's,
uh,

2456
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:09,280
it comes with risks for both of us to do
this.

2457
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,740
I think you can sense we don't have 
precisely the same audiences.

2458
02:10:14,050 --> 02:10:19,050
All of you are sort of rooting for one 
or the other of us to some degree for 

2459
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:20,480
the spirit of truth.
And

2460
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:26,040
yes,
but clearly

2461
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:30,960
the conversation is the point,
right?

2462
02:10:30,961 --> 02:10:35,961
This is not though this conversation,
the character at many moments of a 

2463
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:40,331
debate,
I don't think either of us view it as a 

2464
02:10:40,331 --> 02:10:43,511
debate in,
in the trivial sense is not about point 

2465
02:10:43,511 --> 02:10:46,751
scoring.
It's about making sense in a way that's 

2466
02:10:46,751 --> 02:10:51,040
consequential because we're talking 
about issues of great consequence and 

2467
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:54,920
you obviously care about these things 
and it matters whether we converge on 

2468
02:10:56,511 --> 02:10:59,630
the most important questions in human 
life and as you know,

2469
02:10:59,631 --> 02:11:04,631
I'm worried that religion doesn't give 
us the tools we need to converge what 

2470
02:11:05,180 --> 02:11:10,180
does give us the tools is a truly open 
ended conversation and then you simply 

2471
02:11:15,561 --> 02:11:19,220
have to look honestly at the obstacles 
toward any conversation.

2472
02:11:19,221 --> 02:11:24,221
Being open ended and religion presents 
those first and most readily.

2473
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:31,211
It's.
It is a had the idea that certain things

2474
02:11:31,311 --> 02:11:36,311
have been decided for all time and 
there's no future evidence or argument 

2475
02:11:37,610 --> 02:11:39,500
that is admissible on those points.

2476
02:11:39,860 --> 02:11:42,890
Now that is clearly bad.
Everywhere in science.

2477
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:48,280
It's bad everywhere in in how we 
renegotiate our proximity to one another

2478
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:54,080
in society.
It a new laws and new ideas are born all

2479
02:11:54,081 --> 02:11:59,081
the time about how to structure 
institutions and social relationships 

2480
02:11:59,081 --> 02:11:59,690
because new things happen.
I mean,

2481
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:01,820
we didn't have an internet and then we 
did,

2482
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:06,850
so our old laws and our old expectations
of human communication simply don't work

2483
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:09,080
in the presence of this new thing.
Right?

2484
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:10,240
So we have to figure out.
We,

2485
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:15,250
again,
it's a navigation problem and what I'm 

2486
02:12:15,250 --> 02:12:18,640
perpetually in contest when even in 
conversations like this is the sense 

2487
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:26,080
that the rules need to change just a 
little bit for this class of books that 

2488
02:12:27,800 --> 02:12:30,950
literally this side of the bookstore,
right?

2489
02:12:30,951 --> 02:12:35,951
There's like any other part of the 
bookstore will then there's no barrier 

2490
02:12:35,951 --> 02:12:37,850
to honest conversation,
but you move over here.

2491
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:42,880
They got this shelf of books there.
You have to hold your tongue right 

2492
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,750
there.
We can't pick and choose.

2493
02:12:45,110 --> 02:12:50,110
We can't say that.
While we can say that Shakespeare wrote 

2494
02:12:50,110 --> 02:12:53,171
some fantastic players,
the best players ever written and some 

2495
02:12:53,171 --> 02:12:53,171
are actually not that good,
right?

2496
02:12:53,171 --> 02:12:55,010
We can't say that about God,
right?

2497
02:12:55,011 --> 02:13:00,011
We have to find some tortured way to 
make the most of his diabolical 

2498
02:13:00,011 --> 02:13:00,011
utterances.
Right.

2499
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:05,800
That's the thing we have to outgrow and 
so what I'm continually intention with 

2500
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:10,001
you is the degree to which your style of
talking about religion and narrow the 

2501
02:13:12,321 --> 02:13:17,321
power of narrative and the meaning 
derived from it aligns that point and 

2502
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:21,480
seems to let people off the hook on that
very point and that's the.

2503
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,960
That's where we need to hold the line.
In my view,

2504
02:13:23,961 --> 02:13:25,520
we need to.
We need to

2505
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:27,140
sure

2506
02:13:32,080 --> 02:13:37,080
that,
that it has to be clear to us at this 

2507
02:13:37,080 --> 02:13:41,491
moment in history that no one has the 
right to their religious sectarianism.

2508
02:13:43,060 --> 02:13:45,580
Really.
I mean it it up to the point.

2509
02:13:45,970 --> 02:13:50,970
Clearly there's a soccer,
there's a World Cup version of it that 

2510
02:13:50,970 --> 02:13:54,010
has benign,
but once it gets taken past that point,

2511
02:13:54,670 --> 02:13:59,670
we we have to figure out how to pull the
brakes and that becomes a real problem.

2512
02:14:00,730 --> 02:14:04,300
If your.
If you going to dignify the foundational

2513
02:14:04,301 --> 02:14:09,301
claims of these faiths claims like 
revelation and paradise and blast 

2514
02:14:09,301 --> 02:14:14,001
swimming and apostasy,
and these are things that you come up 

2515
02:14:14,001 --> 02:14:16,801
against and I think conversations like 
this are incredibly important because we

2516
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:23,880
need to convince the better part of 
humanity that is possible to live the 

2517
02:14:23,981 --> 02:14:28,981
best life possible without recourse to 
divisive nonsense and where we draw the 

2518
02:14:31,271 --> 02:14:33,790
line between divisive nonsense and 
reasoned,

2519
02:14:33,791 --> 02:14:37,050
unnecessary discourse is what we're,
we're dickering over and I think,

2520
02:14:37,150 --> 02:14:39,250
I think it's important that we continue.

2521
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:48,310
Thank you.
Thank you.

2522
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:59,580
Thank you.

2523
02:15:00,090 --> 02:15:01,620
In closing,
let me say,

2524
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,920
first of all,
I'm tremendously honored that you asked 

2525
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:08,190
me to moderate these debates.

2526
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:14,150
Fantastic.
Thank you.

2527
02:15:15,800 --> 02:15:16,930
Thank you.

2528
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:21,070
It was a truly remarkable experience.
As for what was accomplished,

2529
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:25,150
I think it was a tremendous amount.
I saw both of you move.

2530
02:15:25,151 --> 02:15:30,151
I saw both of you exhibit tremendous 
generosity of spirit towards the other 

2531
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,660
and I think,
um,

2532
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:36,720
this has exceeded my expectations of 
what might've been possible in these 

2533
02:15:36,720 --> 02:15:37,960
discussions by quite a bit.
Um,

2534
02:15:37,961 --> 02:15:42,961
and that also I will say,
has a lot to do with the fact that for 

2535
02:15:43,121 --> 02:15:47,530
reasons I think none of us can explain a
huge amount of people,

2536
02:15:47,531 --> 02:15:52,531
a huge population seems to care about 
these issues because they matter a great

2537
02:15:53,381 --> 02:15:54,400
deal.
So anyway,

2538
02:15:54,401 --> 02:15:59,401
I think this has been a very successful 
exercise and I think you both justly be 

2539
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:00,010
quite proud of what you've done.

2540
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:02,290
Alright,
let's give a huge round of applause.

2541
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:09,040
Thank you.
Thanks.
