Hi,
I'm here at the airport in Portland,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,090
about 50 cities into what is going to be
100 city tour.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,943
It's going exceptionally well.
Audiences in each city and the people 

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:17,580
I've met afterward and being very 
enthusiastic.

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,093
There seems to be a rapidly developing 
market for relatively long form 

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:22,944
intellectual discourse driven by Youtube
and podcasts which have none of the 

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:30,270
bandwidth limitations of traditional 
media forms.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,493
I just had two evenings of productive 
discussion with Sam Harris in Vancouver 

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,450
who going to post my notes from those 
talks on my blog@JordanPeterson.com.

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,413
We talked about the relationship between
facts and values and the role that 

11
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,524
narrative and story might play in 
bringing the two together for better or 

12
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:53,160
worse,
the Vancouver event sold out.

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,863
The next discussion was Sam the third,
which will also feature Douglas Murray 

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,080
will take place in Dublin,
Ireland on the 14th of July at the three

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:04,914
arena,
followed by the final fourth discussion 

16
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:09,300
at the o two arena in London.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,373
On the 16th.
Tickets for those discussions are still 

18
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,394
available.

video and podcast form within the next 

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,240
few months after the remaining two 
discussions in Dublin and London because

23
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:40,230
of the positive response from audiences 
and from individual audience members,
