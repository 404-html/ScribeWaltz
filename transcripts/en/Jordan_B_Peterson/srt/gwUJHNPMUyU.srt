1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,513
Well,
this selectors called virtue as a 

2
00:00:02,641 --> 00:00:03,480
necessity.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,623
And

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,873
the reason I,
I gave it that title is because Virtue 

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,990
Ethics,
morality isn't a field of study.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,840
It's a mode of being upon which all 
fields of study rest.

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,590
It's also a mode of being on which 
everything you do in your life rests the

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:26,674
way you understand yourself or fail to 
the way you understand other people or 

9
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:35,101
fail to.
And more deeply than not what role it is

10
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:39,970
that you play in your life in the world.
And one of the things I've learned,

11
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:40,804
for example,
being a clinical psychologist who spent 

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,090
thousands of hours helping people sort 
out difficult problems,

13
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,924
is that lack of virtue makes people ill.
I'm not saying that my clients 

14
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,134
themselves lack virtue.
I suppose some of them do and some of 

15
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:56,494
them don't.
But to the degree that they're embedded 

16
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:02,230
in a network of relationships where 
virtue is fundamentally absent,

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,933
they're tortured and tormented and 
they're unable to find firm ground and 

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,550
that's not a biological problem.

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,510
Even though biologically fragile people 
might be hurt more by a lack of virtue.

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,570
A lot of what you do in a real 
relationship with people,

21
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:20,170
and at least to some degree of clinical 
relationship is supposed to be real,

22
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:23,080
is provide a forum where people tell the
truth.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,980
And that's hard because people don't 
like to tell the truth.

24
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:31,810
Particular the truth is difficult.
It's difficult for a variety of reasons.

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,230
So when I first thought about this 
lecture,

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,123
I had a slightly different title.
The title was virtue as an existential 

27
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,250
necessity,
and that's a bit philosophical.

28
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:45,940
So I modified it,
but there was a reason for that because

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,230
the concept of virtue means to be 
virtuous and existentialism is the study

30
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,064
of being right.
And I think that you can't really 

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:00,081
understand what makes up virtue until 
you modulator modify your notion of what

32
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:05,430
constitutes being.
This is a hard thing to do.

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,403
Modern people are fundamentally 
materialistic and there's some utility 

34
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:11,934
in that we're,
we're masters of material 

35
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,214
transformation.
And the fact that we're materialist in 

36
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,250
our scientific philosophies has made us 
extremely powerful,

37
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,473
maybe too powerful for our morality,
extremely powerful from a technological 

38
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:26,880
perspective,
but it's blinded as to certain things.

39
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,043
And I think one of the things that it's 
really blinded us to is the nature of 

40
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
our own being because we make the 
assumption that the fundamental 

41
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,730
constituent elements of reality,
our material,

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,713
we fail to notice that the fundamental 
constituent elements of our own reality 

43
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,350
are not material.
They're emotional,

44
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:48,090
they're motivational,
their dreams,

45
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:50,310
their visions,
their relationships with other people.

46
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,623
They're conscious,
they're dependent on consciousness and 

47
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:54,714
self consciousness.
And we have absolutely no materialist 

48
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,074
explanation whatsoever,
either for consciousness or self 

49
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,024
consciousness.
And we don't deal well from a 

50
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:05,770
materialistic perspective with the 
qualities of being.

51
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,500
And everyone knows those qualities 
exist.

52
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,760
I mean,
for most people,

53
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,430
there's nothing more real than their own
pain,

54
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
right?
Pain transcends rational argument in 

55
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:20,301
that you can't argue yourself out of it.
It's just there and materialist or not.

56
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,720
There's very few people that are willing
to allow their,

57
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,610
the claim that their pain is merely a 
napa phenomenal episode.

58
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,520
Nomina of some more fundamental material
process.

59
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,010
Pain is fundamental.
Consciousness is fundamental,

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,873
and I think that unless you understand 
that you can't think properly about 

61
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:38,754
virtue,
so I might start the discussion of 

62
00:03:42,271 --> 00:03:44,210
virtue with a discussion of Ba,
well,

63
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,030
what is human being look like?
Well,

64
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,893
the Buddhists say life is suffering.
That's the first fundamental Buddhist 

65
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:53,934
dictum and I suppose a modern person 
would tend to think of that as a very 

66
00:03:58,501 --> 00:03:59,334
pessimistic claim.
But I've found when I've shared that 

67
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,980
information with my students,
once they understand what it means,

68
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:05,814
it's actually a relief because people 
run around madly suffering away and all 

69
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:13,260
of them inside their little shell think,
well,

70
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,570
there must be something wrong with me 
because here I am suffering and you know

71
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,404
what I mean?
That that isn't how things are supposed 

72
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,750
to be.
Well then you might say,

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,420
who says that's not the way things are 
supposed to be?

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,733
The Buddhist say life is suffering so 
that what that means is if you're not 

75
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:30,720
suffering,
that's a good thing.

76
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,400
That's lucky.
That's fortunate.

77
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,380
That's not the way of the world.
That may be something to be grateful for

78
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:38,700
ecstatic about.
Even,

79
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,863
and of course in Christianity the 
central symbol of Christianity is a 

80
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:42,924
crucifix,
which is not a positive symbol in any 

81
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,900
way.
It's a symbol of betrayal by friends,

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,000
opposition from the state and mortal 
vulnerability.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,193
It's about as powerful a symbolic 
representation of the idea that life is 

84
00:04:59,161 --> 00:05:02,640
suffering as you can put together,
which is of course why the power of that

85
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:05,010
symbol extends across several thousand 
years.

86
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,200
Judy is,
well,

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,513
I don't think it's going to come as a 
shock to anybody in the audience that 

88
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,640
Jews are acutely aware of the suffering 
that's involved in life.

89
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,213
Okay,

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,520
so it's useful to know to understand 
what it means that life is suffering.

91
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,383
It's a fundamental ontological truth.
It's a fundamental statement about the 

92
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,470
nature of being,
and there's a reason for that.

93
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,000
It,
it's not incomprehensible.

94
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,960
It's perfectly comprehensible.
We're finite,

95
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,783
right?
We have a lifespan that's bounded 

96
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,823
temporarily.
You're going to live maybe a hundred 

97
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,373
years and that'll pretty much be it,
and then there's other forms of extreme 

98
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:52,300
limitations that are imposed on you that
have very little to do with you.

99
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,570
They're arbitrary facts of being.
You're a certain height,

100
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,280
you're a certain weight,
you're a certain amount of attractive,

101
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,940
you're a certain amount of intelligent,
you're a certain amount of athletic,

102
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,803
you're a certain amount of mentally ill,
you're a certain amount of 

103
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:11,411
predisposition to cancer.
And it's frequently the case that people

104
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:17,381
like to attribute those vulnerabilities 
to some flaw in their own nature,

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,470
what they are instead.
Our conditions of existence,

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,083
human being is,
is predicated on a kind of fundamental 

107
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,740
limitation in that we are what we are 
and we're not other things.

108
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,533
And so that means inevitably that the 
awareness of human being comes along 

109
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,390
with suffering in life poses the 
question

110
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,240
how to conduct yourself in the face of 
suffering.

111
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,103
Not only yours but everyone else's.
And it's an inescapable question except 

112
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,214
that maybe you're fortunate and you'll 
have periods of time where something 

113
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,700
absolutely horrible isn't helping 
happening to you.

114
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,343
Now you,
you think about this because you might 

115
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,100
think this is pessimistic,
but it's not pessimistic.

116
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:03,934
It's,
it's actually one of the most freeing 

117
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:09,130
things that you can realize.
Maybe there's nothing particularly wrong

118
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:09,964
with you at the moment,
but there's a high probability that you 

119
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:13,384
have a family member that has something 
seriously wrong with them and there's a 

120
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:20,020
very high probability that if you don't,
you will soon,

121
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,620
or maybe you'll have a partner that has 
something serious wrong with them.

122
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,763
And,
and to know this frees you from the 

123
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,904
false illusion that life can be 
conducted without suffering suffering's 

124
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:36,730
an integral part of the now why is that?
Well,

125
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,130
who knows?
It's a metaphysical question.

126
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,640
Would I have some ideas about that that 
have helped me and that there are things

127
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:44,320
that I've read.
I read,

128
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:45,154
for example,
an old Jewish commentary about the 

129
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:51,430
reason for creation there.
It's like a Zen Koan.

130
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,290
This idea of you take the uh,
um,

131
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,253
uh,
being with the classical attributes of 

132
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:58,024
God,

133
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,850
omnipotence,
Omnipresence,

134
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,380
and omniscient.
All right?

135
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,010
It's a totality.
And the question is,

136
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,200
well,
what is it being with those attributes?

137
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:12,780
Lack and is limitation.

138
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,570
Okay.

139
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,740
And then you think,
well,

140
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,680
what's so important about limitation?
Well,

141
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:22,370
if you can be anything or do anything at
any time whatsoever,

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,070
there's no being,
because everything is one thing.

143
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,050
There's no differentiation between 
things.

144
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,720
So something that's absolute and total 
has no being.

145
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:33,350
It has to be parceled out into limited 
being just,

146
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,390
and you know this because you'll all 
play games.

147
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,430
You play video games,
you play games with other people.

148
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,280
You may play games you don't even know 
you're playing.

149
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,410
And when you play those games,
you put,

150
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,400
you put limits on yourself,
you play by a set of rules.

151
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,060
And the reason you do that is when you 
limit yourself arbitrarily,

152
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,270
in some ways whole new worlds of 
possibility emerge.

153
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,003
And so there's a powerful metaphysical 
idea that being is not possible without 

154
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,430
limitation.

155
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,263
Okay,

156
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,160
so that's an interesting question.
That's an interesting idea.

157
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:04,994
So you say,
well what's the price you pay for being 

158
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,603
the price you pay for being his 
limitation and the price you pay for 

159
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:10,364
limitation is suffering.
So the price you pay for being is 

160
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:17,261
suffering.
So what's the problem with that?

161
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,743
Wrong

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,100
suffering makes people question the 
validity of life,

163
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,350
right?
Every everyone does that.

164
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,330
If something terrible is happening to 
you,

165
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,550
you're gonna wonder why you that.
That's for sure why not?

166
00:09:37,551 --> 00:09:40,460
You might be a better question because 
it's inevitable,

167
00:09:40,461 --> 00:09:43,130
but you will wonder that why you and 
you'll wonder,

168
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:44,240
well,
is it worth it?

169
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,930
Especially if what's happening to you is
terrible and prolonged.

170
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,003
Is it worth it?
That was the cars that you have to pay 

171
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:52,544
for being justified itself and therefore
is being justifiable and everybody has 

172
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,140
it asks and answers these questions.
In fact,

173
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,143
okay.

174
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,180
The process of asking and answering 
those questions underlies everything you

175
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,740
do all the time because you're answering
when you act one answer,

176
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:17,741
which is yes being justifies itself and 
you're answering a different way.

177
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,584
Sometimes when you act,
which is no being does not justify 

178
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,104
itself and the question then might be 
what happens when you answer one of 

179
00:10:28,011 --> 00:10:28,844
those two ways.

180
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,813
Well,

181
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,413
Don untangle this.
The first thing I want to do is to talk 

182
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:34,964
to you about the antithesis of virtue 
because it's always struck me that when 

183
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:40,814
you're talking about something that 
could conceivably be regarded as 

184
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:43,784
optimistic,
it's difficult for people to 

185
00:10:46,431 --> 00:10:48,830
fundamentally believe you.
You know,

186
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,420
gave.
If I stood on stage and said,

187
00:10:50,421 --> 00:10:53,070
well,
the purpose of life is to be happy you,

188
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,993
you might find out vaguely comforting,
but there's not a chance in the world 

189
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,390
that you believe that if you have an 
ounce of sense,

190
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:00,224
because if you lived,
you know that there will be periods of 

191
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:07,280
time where happiness is not your state.

192
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:08,820
Okay?

193
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,653
And so there has to be more to life than
happiness because there'll be a lot of 

194
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:13,080
your life that isn't happy.

195
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,620
Okay?

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,453
Solzhenitsyn,
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who wrote the 

197
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:19,704
book the Gulag Archipelago,
that was one of the axes that brought 

198
00:11:23,161 --> 00:11:23,994
down the thick tree of call me.
This utopian hasn't said over the idea 

199
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,430
that human beings are made for 
happiness.

200
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:37,431
He said that that's a philosophy that's 
undermined by the first blow of the work

201
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:39,714
assigners Cudgel.
And what he meant by that was if you 

202
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,970
find yourself in a particularly terrible
situation,

203
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,500
if you're in slaved,
for example,

204
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,334
by

205
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,350
okay

206
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,183
malevolent utopians and they're pushing 
into a form of slavery and they're 

207
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:55,834
beating you to attain their ends,
the idea that you're made for happiness 

208
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:01,810
is not going to be of much comfort under
those circumstances.

209
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,180
And so social insistence point was your 
weakened by your belief that life is for

210
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,014
happiness because that philosophy cannot
sustain any sustained challenge and you 

211
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:15,250
will for sure encounters such as sustain
challenge.

212
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,593
Oh,

213
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,890
I don't think that modern people can 
believe in virtue,

214
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:26,880
but not easily because it's virtue 
sounds religious in a sense.

215
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:27,714
And we have real trouble whether we're 
religious or not with religious 

216
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,004
preconceptions because our scientific 
forms of knowledge and our fundamental 

217
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:41,691
materialism has really radically 
undermined our ability to believe in any

218
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,100
transcendent being.

219
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,660
Okay.

220
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,760
But one thing that modern people can 
believe in,

221
00:12:47,761 --> 00:12:50,010
I think without much difficulty,
it all is evil.

222
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,260
Solzhenitsyn said,
for example,

223
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:59,261
that the most important event of the 
20th century as far as he was concerned,

224
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,840
was the Nuremberg judgment.

225
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,623
And

226
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,000
you,
you may know,

227
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:07,983
you should know that after World War II,
a group of national socialists from 

228
00:13:13,441 --> 00:13:14,274
Germany who were deemed particularly 
responsible for the absolute horrors of 

229
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:24,471
the final solution and a mass factory 
genocide that accompany,

230
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,850
that were put on trial

231
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,723
and

232
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,380
a standard defense for their actions 
was,

233
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,210
well,
I was ordered to do it.

234
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:35,650
Okay.

235
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,483
And the Nuremberg decision denied human 
beings regardless of their ethnicity or 

236
00:13:43,521 --> 00:13:48,521
national background or beliefs.
The legal right to use that as a defense

237
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,503
under certain limited circumstances.
And the argument was there are some 

238
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:58,670
things that are so self evidently not 
good,

239
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,220
not virtuous,
that if you engage in them,

240
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,420
you're existentially guilty.
You're guilty outside the bounds of your

241
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,254
culture.
There's a trans national and Trans 

242
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,970
ethnic morality.
We don't know what it is,

243
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:15,971
but we know what it isn't.
It isn't pointless torture in genocide,

244
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,133
okay?

245
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,420
At minimum to be virtuous is to live 
your life in such a way

246
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,943
that

247
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,393
the probability that you would engage in
such actions given the opportunity is 

248
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:35,240
minimized.
Now people think,

249
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,443
well,
they're already doing that because if 

250
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,294
they were in Nazi Germany,
they would have been rescue or not a 

251
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,790
perpetrator,
but that's wrong.

252
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,150
You could take this audience and put 
them back in 1939 or thereabouts and 90%

253
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:52,460
of you would,
95% of you,

254
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,353
99% of you would either be in the 
perpetrator class or the going along 

255
00:14:58,401 --> 00:14:59,234
with the perpetrator class and you may 
sit and believe that you'd be in the 1% 

256
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,234
maybe you would because how do I know?
But that isn't how the historical facts 

257
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,010
sort themselves out

258
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,993
and it turns out that it's not that 
difficult generally to put people in a 

259
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:18,760
situation,
normal people where they'll do something

260
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,863
that really doesn't look very good.
Those of you who are familiar with 

261
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,630
psychology know about the milgram 
experiments,

262
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:26,464
for example,
and know about the Zimbardo prison 

263
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:28,864
experiment to take perfectly normal 
college students and put them into a 

264
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:37,060
situation that they know is a dramatic 
forest they know isn't real.

265
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,360
Give some of them the power of prison 
guards and make some of them,

266
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,630
some others arbitrarily into prisoners.
In three days,

267
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,464
you have to shut the whole experiment 
down because of the prison guards have 

268
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:51,790
turned into Nazis and they're enjoying 
torturing the prisoners even though they

269
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:54,250
know whatever.
No means that they're innocent.

270
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,230
Yeah,

271
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,063
well that says something about the 
manner in which people conduct their 

272
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,024
existence.
They're very susceptible to mlevel into 

273
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:07,360
action.
If you look at Genesis,

274
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,583
very old book and very influential book,
there's a strange sequence of events 

275
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:16,210
that be falls,
Adam and Eve,

276
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,423
right?
Uh,

277
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,573
it's in two sentences.
That snake gives them an apple and that 

278
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:26,470
wakes them up.
Well,

279
00:16:26,471 --> 00:16:27,650
there's a good book by a

280
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,553
southern California primatologist that 
was just published last year that 

281
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:34,694
suggests that the reason that humans 
have such great vision way better than 

282
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:38,954
most animals except for raptors birds,
is because our visual systems were 

283
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:43,874
designed to detect predatory snakes.
And the way she discovered that was by 

284
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:48,524
comparing the populations of predatory 
snakes around the world to the visual 

285
00:16:51,141 --> 00:16:53,570
acuity of the primate groups that lived 
in those areas.

286
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,070
And what she found was essentially a one
to one correspondence our visual system,

287
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:01,430
which is the ability to see and to be 
enlightened,

288
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:03,230
let say because enlightenment,
for example,

289
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,950
is associated with vision.
The snake gave that to us because we had

290
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:07,784
to pay attention to predatory things 
that were after us for tens of millions 

291
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,710
of years and fruit.
That's interesting.

292
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,530
We have color vision because we were 
fruit eaters.

293
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,360
Our color vision is precisely evolved to
detect right fruit,

294
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,700
so that part of the stories,
right.

295
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,483
There's a story that involves women too,
but I'm not going to tell that one 

296
00:17:28,501 --> 00:17:33,360
today.
You have to be awake out smart women.

297
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,063
That's the story.
And so that's why they're tangled in 

298
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:38,184
there with the Syrup and Sam the fruit.
And what happens when Adam and Eve wake 

299
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:43,510
up?
Oh,

300
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,420
say it's this series of strange things.
The first thing that happens is that the

301
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,930
scales fall from their eyes so they can 
see all of a,

302
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,033
they're awake in a way they weren't 
before and the next thing that happens 

303
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,520
is they realize they're naked.

304
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,150
Now,
one of the things that people,

305
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,750
okay

306
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,160
to have nightmares about his being naked
on a stage,

307
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,370
which is often why when you see people 
on a stage,

308
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,213
they don't tell you anything.
They think because they don't only not 

309
00:18:05,981 --> 00:18:06,814
want to be physically naked,
they don't want to be metaphysically 

310
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:13,000
naked either and they protect themselves
from the inquiring eyes of the audience.

311
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,820
No one likes to be naked on stage.
Why?

312
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,803
Well,
to be naked is to have your defenses 

313
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,633
stripped from you.
When the Soviets wanted to really 

314
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,110
torture the hell out of you at two 
o'clock in the morning,

315
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:27,250
they'd stave in your door and then 
they'd strip you and shave you when they

316
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:32,251
got you to prison because it's once you 
were exposed in all your suffering,

317
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,820
catastrophe,
then you are much easier to torture.

318
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,913
To be naked.
To realize you're naked is to realize 

319
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:44,320
that you're vulnerable.
You're vulnerable.

320
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,540
That's why Adam and eve immediately 
cover themselves up,

321
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:46,750
right?

322
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,310
They realize they're naked,
they cover themselves up.

323
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:49,144
It's a story about culture.
Once people woke up and realize their 

324
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,850
limitations,
their mortal limitations,

325
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:55,684
which is also their knowledge of death,
the first thing they do is cover 

326
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:58,174
themselves up.
And the second thing that happens is 

327
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:02,530
they know the difference between good 
and evil,

328
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,500
and that's a strange thing.
It's not good and bad.

329
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:06,334
It's good and evil specifically.
It's also something that animals don't 

330
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,214
know.
And I think I thought about this really 

331
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,240
for 20 years.
What does that mean?

332
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,940
And then earlier this year,
I think I figured it out.

333
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:16,774
I think what it means is you don't know 
how to torture people until you realize 

334
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,214
that you're vulnerable.
As soon as your self conscious of your 

335
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:25,024
own vulnerability,
then you can take what might only be a 

336
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:28,384
predatory act,
say on the part of a wolf because of 

337
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:31,244
wolf will bring down a moose or 
something like that and eat it and drag 

338
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:37,840
that out in two,
three months of artistic torturing.

339
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,693
And so that means that your recognition 
of your own vulnerability immediately 

340
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:49,121
allows you to determine what's evil.
Well,

341
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:52,790
so then you might ask yourself,
well,

342
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:57,791
under what conditions would you be 
likely to manifest that drive?

343
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,620
Well,
I think that's easy to figure out if you

344
00:20:02,621 --> 00:20:04,840
watch yourself,
you know,

345
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,430
if you watch yourself without 
presupposition,

346
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,910
which is,
which means to watch yourself honestly,

347
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,900
or to watch yourself as if you're 
someone you don't know because you don't

348
00:20:13,901 --> 00:20:16,830
know yourself because you're too 
complicated to know yourself anyway.

349
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:19,930
So you might as well just come right out
and know that.

350
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,633
I mean,
one of the things that's kind of useful 

351
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,760
about recognizing your capacity for 
evil,

352
00:20:24,761 --> 00:20:25,594
if,
if you can do that without traumatizing 

353
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:27,484
yourself,
is that it's the pathway to recognizing 

354
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:29,704
your ability for good.
You don't get to one without the other 

355
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,220
because you have no idea what your life 
before you know how terrible you can be.

356
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,054
And not only that,
you won't take yourself sufficiently 

357
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,300
serious,
seriously.

358
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,313
If you know you're a loaded weapon and 
an unstable loaded weapon and you're 

359
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,730
much more likely to pay attention to 
what you do,

360
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,850
but that means you're not particularly 
nice.

361
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,510
And it means that,
hey,

362
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,453
if you were given the opportunity,
maybe you would have been a Nazi prison 

363
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:02,180
guard.
Now in genesis,

364
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:04,810
the first thing that happens after Adam 
and eve wake up is they,

365
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,691
they,
they,

366
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:06,524
they have two sons,
Cain and Abel and Cain who's ables 

367
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,710
brother.
He doesn't get along very well with God.

368
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,633
Now,
I don't really care if you believe in 

369
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:18,164
God because I don't know what people 
mean when they say they believe in God 

370
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:22,184
anyways,
but

371
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,180
the story goes that cane doesn't get 
along very well with God.

372
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,014
And the reason for that is came,
keeps doing things and they don't work 

373
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,550
his everything cane touches turns to 
ash,

374
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:36,960
whereas his brother,
Abel,

375
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,973
God likes him.
God only knows why and everything goes 

376
00:21:40,111 --> 00:21:40,944
real well for a,
and so Kane Kane is kind of a failure 

377
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,863
and enables a smashing success.
And not only is he successful at 

378
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,340
everything he does,
but he's a good guy too,

379
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,790
which is really rude because if you're 
really successful at things,

380
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:54,624
you should at least be wretched 
interpersonally so that people can 

381
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:58,930
forgive you.
So,

382
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,840
so kane takes this for,
you know,

383
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:05,550
a decade or two and then he's just had 
it,

384
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,380
he's had it with God.
He thinks,

385
00:22:07,381 --> 00:22:08,214
ah,
how can God make this sort of universe 

386
00:22:09,271 --> 00:22:10,104
where I'm,
you know,

387
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,123
breaking myself and half here and get 
nowhere in my brother's doors open for 

388
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:14,491
him,
left,

389
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:15,120
right and center.

390
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,010
So it goes and complains to God.
He says,

391
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,120
look what?
What's going on here?

392
00:22:18,121 --> 00:22:20,040
What sort of reality did you conjure up 
here?

393
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,570
Mabel has it good.
I'm having a miserable time.

394
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,610
Maybe you should do something about 
that.

395
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:28,970
And you think that's pretty interesting.
You know that,

396
00:22:28,971 --> 00:22:29,804
that cain would think that because you 
have to ask yourself what sort of 

397
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,160
presumption does cain house to assume 
that the digital quality of his being is

398
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:44,160
attributable to God?
Because what Kane does,

399
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:48,240
it not instant is to make himself the 
judge of being.

400
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,740
And I would say that you should be 
cautious about making yourself the judge

401
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:53,574
of being,
because there's always the possibility 

402
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,760
that there's a few things that you don't
know.

403
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,370
So go ahead and sort of lets paint in on
the secret.

404
00:22:59,371 --> 00:23:00,204
He says,
look,

405
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,600
the fact that you're a suffering 
miserably away actually isn't my fault.

406
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:05,310
It's your fault.
He says to Cain,

407
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:10,410
Sin Crouches at the door like a 
predatory cat ready to jump on you.

408
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:13,170
But if you wanted to you could overcome 
it.

409
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,880
This is not what cain wants to hear.
Take.

410
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,723
Cain wants to hear that he's an innocent
character and he has nothing to do with 

411
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,760
his own misery and it's all God's fault 
and God says instead,

412
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,550
straighten the hell up.
You know you could do it

413
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,560
and even though you know you could do 
it,

414
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,590
you won't.
And so that that's that for cane.

415
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,091
Like,
I mean,

416
00:23:35,091 --> 00:23:37,370
he was upset when he first went into the
discussion,

417
00:23:37,371 --> 00:23:38,204
but after he got this little piece of 
news that his suffering was to be laid 

418
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:44,990
at his own doorstep,
then he's out of the realm of human.

419
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,820
And the story says his countenance.
Falls means he's angry and upset and the

420
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:51,620
first thing he does is run off and kill 
Abel.

421
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,010
Why walks revenge?
Right.

422
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,853
Table was God's favorite and Cain has 
already judged being and found it 

423
00:24:01,271 --> 00:24:03,850
wanting.
And the best way that he can express his

424
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:04,684
desire for revenge is to find someone 
who's having a pretty good time of it 

425
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,630
and to arbitrarily eliminate them.

426
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,090
Okay.

427
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,923
It might be of some interest to note 
that one of keynes grandchildren is the 

428
00:24:18,931 --> 00:24:19,764
first person who makes weapons of war.
So that brilliant little story so long 

429
00:24:25,051 --> 00:24:25,884
ago,
associates the moral failings of the 

430
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:28,854
resentful individual who's unwilling to 
take responsibility for the nature of 

431
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:38,211
their own being directly with atrocious 
acts of social conflict.

432
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,510
Yes.
And that's another thing to know because

433
00:24:42,511 --> 00:24:44,940
if you're going to be virtuous,
you have to take yourself seriously.

434
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,120
And if you start to understand that 
you're networked with other people,

435
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:53,121
you're not one little dark among 7 
billion year network with other people.

436
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:57,030
So you know a thousand people and they 
know a thousand people and so you're two

437
00:24:57,031 --> 00:25:00,750
people away from a million people and 
three people away from a billion people.

438
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,960
You're in a causal network and all of 
your actions matter.

439
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:05,843
Yeah.
Solzhenitsyn said there's many centers 

440
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:10,510
of the universe says there are 
individual consciousnesses,

441
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,500
and that's a very interesting way to 
think and why can't it be that way?

442
00:25:14,501 --> 00:25:15,334
We don't know anything about conscious 
consciousness and it certainly seems to 

443
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:21,730
be how it feels if you're one of those 
conscious centers.

444
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,950
And so maybe it is that what you do 
matters.

445
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,103
I think that often people come to the 
conclusion that life is meaningless 

446
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:32,920
because that's a better conclusion to 
come to then the reverse because if life

447
00:25:32,921 --> 00:25:36,130
is meaningless,
well then who cares what you do?

448
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,920
But if life is meaningful,
if what you do matters,

449
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:39,754
then everything you do matters and that 
puts a terrible responsibility on the 

450
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:48,280
individual and I think that people are 
generally unwilling to bear that.

451
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,683
Okay,

452
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,900
so life is suffering.
What does that do to people?

453
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,070
Makes them resentful.
These are pitfalls of being so being has

454
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,604
a structure.
One of its fundamental structural 

455
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:09,290
elements is suffering,
but suffering produces other.

456
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,680
Okay.

457
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,220
Characteristics of being resentment is a
characteristic of being.

458
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,293
People feel resentful when they believe 
that they've been taken advantage of it 

459
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,693
and maybe if you feel resentful,
it may be that you're being taken 

460
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:24,594
advantage of.
It may also be that you should screw 

461
00:26:26,491 --> 00:26:27,324
your head on straight and look at things
properly and it may also be that you 

462
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:32,820
should talk to somebody to find out if 
you're

463
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,660
being taken advantage of or if you're 
head just isn't screwed on straight,

464
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,940
but to talk to them.
Then you have to tell them the truth and

465
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:40,774
in order to tell them the truth,
you have to have practiced being honest 

466
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,780
because if you haven't practiced being 
honest,

467
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,730
then you're not going to have a friend 
you can talk to.

468
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,713
And even if you did,
you won't be able to tell them what the 

469
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,484
problem is and then they won't be able 
to help you sort out whether or not 

470
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:55,650
you're being taken advantage of or 
whether you're a little bit insane.

471
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:00,840
Okay.

472
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,673
If you're resentful,
then maybe you have to tell the person 

473
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,970
who's taking advantage of you that they 
should stop doing that.

474
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,630
And maybe you have to tell them in a way
that will make them stop,

475
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,670
which is no easy thing.
Or maybe you're resentful because you're

476
00:27:13,671 --> 00:27:14,504
a nasty little bit of the world and you 
know you have a chip on your shoulder 

477
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,120
and no matter what people do with you,
you're resentful,

478
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,750
in which case you have some internal 
restructuring to do.

479
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,610
And you might ask,
well,

480
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,940
why should you do the restructuring?
And the answer to that is that well,

481
00:27:29,941 --> 00:27:30,774
resentment along with hopelessness and 
nihilism and all sorts of other moral 

482
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:37,800
pitfalls puts you on the road to cruelty
and atrocity.

483
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,593
Misery loves company.
And if you feel that things are 

484
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:42,954
fundamentally unjust and that the slings
and arrows of being are aimed 

485
00:27:46,451 --> 00:27:47,284
specifically at you,
why should you treat anyone else with 

486
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,424
compassion or justice?
Because things are fundamentally unfair 

487
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:54,883
and and even more deeply,
why shouldn't you conclude that things 

488
00:27:57,541 --> 00:28:01,260
should be eradicated?
Because fundamentally they're unfair.

489
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,533
I think that's what Hitler conclude.
I also think that's what stolen 

490
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:06,544
concluded.
The evidence suggest that Stellan was 

491
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:10,480
gearing up for the Third World War.
I mean,

492
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:14,560
he had hydrogen bombs,
he'd already killed 30 million people.

493
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,050
I mean he had his practice trials

494
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,583
and you know,
there's an old psychoanalytic idea and 

495
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:24,930
the idea is if you can't understand the 
motivations for the behavior,

496
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:27,090
look at the outcome and in further 
motivations.

497
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:27,924
And so Hitler killed 100 million people.
If you include the whole Second World 

498
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,374
War and God only knows how many Stalin 
killed in my old killed more than 

499
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:38,850
stellar.
Why?

500
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:43,890
Well of their cover story was utopia.
And I guess people belief that,

501
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,560
well,
why did look very utopian when all those

502
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:47,394
millions of people were dying?
I think all those people who 

503
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:50,604
participated in those processes used 
their rational utopianism as a cover 

504
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:58,410
story for their willingness to 
participate in the atrocity.

505
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,950
Because what they wanted to do was 
participate in the atrocities.

506
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,500
They didn't give a damn about utopia.
Then you ask yourself,

507
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:04,981
well,
you know,

508
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:09,240
how much do you try to force the world 
to behave according to your terms?

509
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,583
You know,
there Catholics have always had trouble 

510
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:12,744
with rationality and modern people,
especially this sort of hyper atheists 

511
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,674
that you hear from now and then.
Or you don't like that because they 

512
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,000
believe that rationality is the highest 
virtue.

513
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,980
And that's wrong.
I mean,

514
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,780
it's a terrible thing to say in a 
university,

515
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:27,660
except maybe the university isn't here 
to teach you to be rational.

516
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,733
Maybe it's here to teach you to be 
virtuous and those aren't the same 

517
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:32,910
thing.
And the rational person says,

518
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:33,744
well,
I understand and having understand 

519
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,534
stood,
I impose an order and then I work to 

520
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:39,504
make that imposed order or reality.
That's what every Indian log does it 

521
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:46,750
what's whatever you Topian does.
It's convincing.

522
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:48,930
And I think the reason that people do 
that is because they,

523
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:49,973
it's complicated.
Partly they want an explanation for 

524
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,620
their Ba,
but more importantly than that,

525
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,830
they want to mask that covers up their 
tendency to atrocity with the appearance

526
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:01,210
of virtue and most Utopian thinking.

527
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,043
It's of that sort.
Even though the mass can be very well 

528
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:07,480
argued.
And you asked me why I believe that.

529
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,433
The reason I believe that it's because 
we had a hundred years of it and that's 

530
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:11,854
how it turned out.
One of the things that was terrible 

531
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:15,214
about living in the Soviet Union was 
that you couldn't suffer because things 

532
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,014
were perfect.
So if you were suffering and you even 

533
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:23,944
admitted it,
then you are instantly an enemy of the 

534
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:26,644
state.
So if you're an idiot log your own 

535
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,250
suffering makes you a heretic,
right?

536
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:31,084
Do you undermine the boat,
your belief and your own bloody system 

537
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:35,770
by suffering while,
and that's fine if,

538
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:38,800
if your belief has stopped you from 
suffering while more power to you.

539
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:43,210
But if you're still suffering a bit or a
lot or a tremendous amount,

540
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,830
then you can ask yourself,
maybe there's something I don't know.

541
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,830
Here's an existential exercise.

542
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,130
So in this is not rational,
we have say it.

543
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:56,590
Let's assume that virtues worth 
pursuing.

544
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:57,424
And I say it's worth pursuing because a 
virtuous path is the only path that 

545
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,380
justifies being to itself as the 
definition of virtue.

546
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,000
A virtuous pass path justifies being to 
itself being as suffering.

547
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,330
So you need a justification for your 
suffering.

548
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:14,164
So then you might ask yourself,
are there times in my life when I feel 

549
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:22,210
that my suffering is justified?
And this is a good question.

550
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,460
And you could ask yourself the reverse 
question two,

551
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:25,294
which is are there times in my life when
my my suffering is clearly not 

552
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:30,790
justified?
And I could say,

553
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,440
well,
watch yourself for three weeks.

554
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,333
Just watch like,
like you don't know anything and see 

555
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,720
when you're somewhere that justifies 
itself.

556
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,090
Now I might say,
you might say,

557
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:43,811
well,
how do I know?

558
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:44,411
And I'd say,
okay,

559
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:45,550
well here,
here's some hints.

560
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,800
You're not self conscious.
You know,

561
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,510
it's not good to be self conscious,
right?

562
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,780
It loads on neuroticism.
It's a negative emotion.

563
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,614
I mean,
we think of it as a higher order 

564
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:56,950
cognitive function,
but people find it unpleasant.

565
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,370
You tend to be self conscious when 
you're false or shamed.

566
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,030
If you're deeply engaged in something,
your self consciousness disappears.

567
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,350
So engagement and something meaningful 
seems to make selfconsciousness vantage.

568
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,120
It also makes time vanish,
right?

569
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:13,810
Because if you're doing something that 
is intrinsically meaningful,

570
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:16,690
then the sense of passing time 
disappears.

571
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,840
And so that temporal limitation that 
plagues you vanishes.

572
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,943
And I could say maybe you're having a 
miserable time of it and you only spend 

573
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:27,190
2% of your waking hours in that 
condition.

574
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,840
And maybe you don't even know when that 
is,

575
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,780
but you could watch,
you could see,

576
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,100
and you could say,
hey look,

577
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,620
wow,
I spent 10 minutes there.

578
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,053
I hardly even noticed.
And I felt that the of my being 

579
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,620
justified itself all.
Maybe you wouldn't say that to yourself,

580
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,220
but you could.
You could say that was worth it.

581
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,280
And then I could say,
Whoa,

582
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,860
practice that above all else.
Forget about everything else.

583
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,530
And then there,
there's an alternative exercise.

584
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,330
Pay attention and figure out when 
absolutely you're being does not justify

585
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,190
itself.
That's even easier,

586
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,780
you know,
because that'll happen.

587
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:10,010
Whenever you do something that you 
immediately regret or ashamed of or that

588
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,510
even more precisely makes you feel 
disintegrated in devalued.

589
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:19,190
Nisha said,
people betray themselves for the sake of

590
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:20,570
their good name.
All the time.

591
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,740
You can feel this,
it seems to center in your solar plexus.

592
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,940
When you say something or do something 
that is not virtuous,

593
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,133
then you will disintegrate and then 
you're weak and you can feel that and 

594
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,670
then you'll cover it up with bunch of 
rattling arguments,

595
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:35,504
trying to convince yourself and other 
people that what you were doing was 

596
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:39,320
actually okay,
but you know,

597
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,453
and it's your rational arrogance and 
authoritarianism that forces you not to 

598
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:44,474
drop your stupid presuppositions and 
just pay attention to what you're being 

599
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,370
is revealing to you.

600
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:52,820
We don't think that way.
We don't think being reveals things.

601
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,000
It reveals things all the time.
We just don't pay any attention.

602
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:59,990
Why I think we don't want the 
responsibility.

603
00:33:59,991 --> 00:34:02,090
I really believe I've thought about this
for a long time.

604
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:06,440
I really believe that that's the case.
Here's a quote from the Tao Te Ching.

605
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,423
I have a great translation of this book.
It was written by louts loud see years 

606
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,250
and years ago to one of the world's 
classics of Literature.

607
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,690
The person who wrote this wasn't a 
philosopher.

608
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:23,120
The person who wrote this was a master 
of being.

609
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,133
That's a different thing cause if 
philosopher thanks but a master being 

610
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,134
doesn't think because thinking is a tool
and being is something that supersedes 

611
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,693
any tool.
He said it is by she thing intellects 

612
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,764
bright light that the sage remains at 
one with his own self ceasing to be 

613
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:44,390
aware of it.
By placing it behind detached.

614
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:47,900
He is unified with his external world by
being selfless.

615
00:34:47,901 --> 00:34:51,210
He is fulfilled.
This is selfhood is assured.

616
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,050
I show my students in my maps of any 
class.

617
00:34:58,051 --> 00:34:58,884
Pinocchio.
Nokia is a very complicated story for 

618
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,260
the Disney version in the previous 
version.

619
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:05,094
It's got a deep mythological base and 
one of the thing that's happened in 

620
00:35:07,741 --> 00:35:08,574
Pinell kill,
a lot of strange things happen that 

621
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,680
people just swallow,
right?

622
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,843
There's a puppet.
It turns into human being and there's a 

623
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,330
talking cat.
There's blue fairies,

624
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:17,760
there's stars,
there's whales that eat people,

625
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:19,860
and everyone's swallows that with the no
problem,

626
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:21,060
right?
You'll go to see Pinocchio.

627
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:25,470
You don't even notice that a puppet has 
just gone into a whale and you know what

628
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,304
the hell is going on.
And the reason you don't notice that is 

629
00:35:29,011 --> 00:35:31,200
because it means something and you don't
know what it means,

630
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,034
but you know that it means something and
you're willing to ride on it weirdly 

631
00:35:35,521 --> 00:35:39,330
enough because it compromises your 
rational principles completely.

632
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,190
It does.
It does.

633
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,800
These are religious experiences that 
people have in movie theaters.

634
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:46,710
They suspend disbelief.
They go along with it.

635
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,840
It's not rational,
but they believed it.

636
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:51,870
And if someone says they lbu and saying,
that's not real,

637
00:35:51,871 --> 00:35:52,704
you say to them,
you maybe you could shut up so I could 

638
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,860
watch a movie.
All right?

639
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:58,050
You don't want their rationality inter 
because it's,

640
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:00,160
it's the wrong time for it's the wrong 
place for it.

641
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,493
Japan or wishes that his pep puppet 
could become real is a very unlikely 

642
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,800
wish,
which is something he says,

643
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:09,810
very unlikely.
It's unlikely to happen.

644
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:13,500
I think actually Jimminy cricket says 
that to have that happen in Japan,

645
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:15,120
Oh,
has to wish on a star.

646
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,593
It was a strange idea.
Wistar is something that's partakes of 

647
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:20,994
the divine.
You could say that if you look at the 

648
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:25,260
night sky where you can really see it,
you know that,

649
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,094
right?
You look at the night sky and infinity 

650
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:30,740
opens itself up before you,
and there's nothing to say except,

651
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,790
okay.

652
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:33,623
There's nothing to say and to wish on a 
star is to put your eyes above the 

653
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:38,574
horizon and to pick a transcendent point
and to wish for something to want for 

654
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:43,614
something that's beyond the concreted 
and immediate and to become virtuous 

655
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:50,724
and,
and to not be a puppet is to aim at 

656
00:36:53,191 --> 00:36:54,690
something transcendent.
I could say,

657
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,810
well at least it's the absence of evil.
That something,

658
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,250
well,
maybe it's even more than that.

659
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,170
Maybe it's virtue in and of itself.

660
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,330
Okay.

661
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,420
There's a line in the sermon on the 
mount.

662
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:07,254
It's a very strange sermon and the line 
is take therefore no thought for the 

663
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:13,860
morrow,
for the moral shell.

664
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:14,694
Take thought for the things of itself 
sufficient unto the day is the evil 

665
00:37:17,731 --> 00:37:22,731
thereof.
It's a very strange

666
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,620
piece of advice.
It sounds completely impractical,

667
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,473
right?
I mean,

668
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,970
limit the focus of your consciousness to
the day and leave the worries alone.

669
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,520
Well,
it means something meditative.

670
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,970
I think when I do therapy with people 
are trying to do this,

671
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,140
I don't think,
because I don't know if I do sometimes,

672
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:49,974
but I shouldn't.
I don't necessarily know what their 

673
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:55,920
problem is or what they should do about 
it,

674
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,983
but I can listen and if I listen and 
maybe I learned this in part from Carl 

675
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,770
Rogers writings,
if I listened,

676
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:07,740
then thoughts will occur to me.
I'm not thinking them.

677
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,603
It's different.
I'm letting the thoughts come up and I 

678
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:11,714
do.
I tell my clients try to tell me the 

679
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:13,524
truth and I'll try to listen without 
being too much of a son of a bitch and 

680
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,170
maybe you know,
maybe we can work something out and then

681
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,910
they'll say something to me and maybe 
I'll think,

682
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:21,744
well that thing you said now in the 
thing you said half an hour ago don't 

683
00:38:24,481 --> 00:38:27,240
seem to be,
they don't seem to be coherent.

684
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,580
So maybe you can straighten that out or 
you know,

685
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,150
it seems more like I'm tracking what 
they're saying and when I'm listening to

686
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:37,120
them I'm in the same place they are.
We know the neural mechanisms for that.

687
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,954
You are in the same place with someone 
when you really listen to them and then 

688
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:41,970
thoughts come up and I tell them what 
they are and it's,

689
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:42,804
it's impersonal,
it's impersonal because I'm not trying 

690
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:47,794
to get them to do anything particularly.
I'm just aiming maybe at helping them 

691
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:52,324
figure out what's going on and having a 
little bit less suffering and it's not 

692
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,950
the imposition of an ideological 
structure.

693
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,510
And the idea behind this particular 
piece of advice is you can try this too.

694
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,400
You wake up in the morning and you 
think,

695
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:06,610
okay,
this could be a good day,

696
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,500
whatever that means.
You don't know,

697
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:09,334
right what a good day is.
But maybe you've had a couple and 

698
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,160
they're not so bad.

699
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,980
And so maybe you think you could have 
another one but you don't know.

700
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:15,814
And you think,
okay,

701
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,310
you ask yourself,
and this is meditative.

702
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,150
What is it that I need to do today?
So that this would be a good day.

703
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,310
And your brain will tell you,
it'll say,

704
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,293
you know that build,
it's hiding under five pieces of paper 

705
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:27,724
on your desk.
You should hall that sucker out and pay 

706
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,824
it.
Or there's something you're avoiding 

707
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,020
that makes you anxious that your brain 
will pick on right away.

708
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,560
And it'll say you have to do these 
whatever number of commitments today.

709
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,400
And if you do them,
then you fulfilled your obligations.

710
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,923
And the idea behind this piece of advice
is that if you fulfill your obligations 

711
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:47,494
every day,
then you don't have to worry about the 

712
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:51,190
future.
And that's a very interesting idea.

713
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,173
And it's predicated on the notion that 
there's a wisdom inside people that 

714
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:55,414
steeper than mere rationality,
and I believe that to be the case 

715
00:39:58,511 --> 00:39:59,344
because we're far older than mere 
rationality from an evolutionary 

716
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,960
perspective,
from any perspective you want.

717
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,243
We're deeper than rationality,
and we know old psychologists have 

718
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:10,204
learned in the last 20 years that 
rationality is bounded ridiculously and 

719
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,580
all sorts of different ways.
It's not the master,

720
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:18,070
it's a servant and it's an unruly 
servant.

721
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:19,840
Even though it can be a very powerful 
one.

722
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,003
That totality of you,
the wisdom that's embodied in the 

723
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:25,690
totality of you is far outstrips 
rationality.

724
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,943
And if you listen to yourself and do the
difficult things that you're self tells 

725
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:31,084
you to do,
the idea is you don't have to compute 

726
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:34,444
the Utopian future because following 
what it is that you tell yourself to do 

727
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:41,410
every moment is the best path to 
whatever the best outcome is.

728
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,910
That's a strange way of thinking because
if you're a utopian and a rationalist,

729
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:46,744
you already know what the right outcome 
is and then you have to run around 

730
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:49,804
pointing guns at people to make bloody 
sure that they do the right thing so 

731
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:56,530
that the outcome you've computed ochres 
and that doesn't seem to work very well.

732
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,723
And so you see this idea in Taoism too.
The idea is to give up the end because 

733
00:41:02,981 --> 00:41:04,990
you don't know what it is and you and 
you don't.

734
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:06,940
It's an admission of ignorance.
Where are you headed?

735
00:41:06,941 --> 00:41:07,774
You don't know.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be 

736
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:09,784
headed somewhere.
Follow your moral intuitions stopped 

737
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,600
doing the things that make you feel 
weak.

738
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:19,060
I'm not talking about following a moral 
code,

739
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:19,894
although that can come into it.
If you really don't know what the hell 

740
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:22,714
you're doing at all,
then following a moral code is a good 

741
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,130
idea because it'll at least get the ball
rolling.

742
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,920
It's a form of apprenticeship.
So,

743
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:30,754
you know,
not doing the obviously bad things is a 

744
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:36,270
form of discipline and it isn't the,
the,

745
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:39,440
the notion that I'm talking about now,
this is a different thing.

746
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,563
This is

747
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,010
bay attention to what's meaningful.
Cause you can see what that is.

748
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:46,844
You may find you're terrified of it 
because everybody's got this little 

749
00:41:48,591 --> 00:41:52,340
secret wish I really love doing.
I don't know what it is.

750
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,230
It's different things for different 
people,

751
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,540
but they're afraid to do it,
to really do it.

752
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,400
Because as soon as you do what you 
really love,

753
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:00,590
then you expose your nakedness,
right?

754
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,330
You say,
this is what I'm really like.

755
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,313
Instead you just shove that under the 
bed and you do something you don't care 

756
00:42:05,661 --> 00:42:07,240
about at all.
And then if people judge you,

757
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,500
it doesn't matter.
But the problem with that is you,

758
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,120
you,
there's no life there.

759
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:15,140
There's no force.
There's no you and without that,

760
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,710
the suffering will do you in and then 
you'll become a bad person.

761
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,600
And that's not a good thing.

762
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:21,920
Yeah.

763
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,320
So you have to see what it is that you 
find meaningful,

764
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,780
whatever that is,
and then you have to fight for it.

765
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,823
You have to fight against yourself.
You have to fight against other people 

766
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,990
because what do they know about it?
And you have to fight against.

767
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,800
Nature may be even to stand up for what 
it is that sustains you.

768
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,590
And that takes courage.
It also takes honesty,

769
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,180
partly because if you're not honest,
you can't trust your own intuition.

770
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:45,014
So this is an important thing.
You think about this and this is why 

771
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:48,584
virtue is a necessity.
If you lie to yourself or to other 

772
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,070
people,
then you

773
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,070
okay,

774
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,070
you corrupt the structure that you use 
to interact with being.

775
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,920
You corrupt it.
And if you corrupt it,

776
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,150
then if you listen to it,
it will guide you the wrong way.

777
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,760
Or maybe it will be so corrupted,
you can't listen to it at all.

778
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:16,570
Then you have to listen to somebody else
and that might not be a good thing,

779
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,430
especially if you're already corrupted,
because then you'll listen to the person

780
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,980
who tells you to do what you really want
to do.

781
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:24,814
But won't admit it to yourself,
and that explains how Hitler found all 

782
00:43:28,931 --> 00:43:32,560
his followers.
They abandoned their own motive being it

783
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:37,561
made the bitter and resentful and empty 
and hollow and weak and cruel,

784
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,390
and then they trained their leader to 
tell them what they wanted to hear.

785
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:48,400
If you're honest,
which is painful,

786
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,400
you'll see that a lot of things you say 
aren't real.

787
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,710
You'll see a lot of things that you do 
make you weak.

788
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:54,903
You'll see that a lot of people you 
associated with are probably not good 

789
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:57,904
for you,
and then you have a lot of difficult 

790
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:00,364
choices to make.
You can stop with the obvious lying 

791
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:04,323
that'll clear things up for you a lot 
and you can start communicating with 

792
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,374
people.
One of the things I teach my clients is 

793
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,390
if you're resentful,
say something about it.

794
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,400
Say something about it.
You tell the person,

795
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:16,234
look,

796
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,380
yeah,

797
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,420
what you asked me to do is making me 
resentful.

798
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,583
Now,
if they're your wife or husband or 

799
00:44:21,281 --> 00:44:22,114
someone you love,
you should listen to them because they 

800
00:44:23,051 --> 00:44:24,490
might say,
well,

801
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,383
grow up.
Take your damn responsibility and leave 

802
00:44:27,311 --> 00:44:29,560
me alone.
And maybe,

803
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:33,210
and maybe they're right or maybe they're
a bit of a bully and you have to say,

804
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:34,044
quit pushing me around.
And then maybe you have to have an 

805
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:37,410
argument with them,
an honest argument where you say,

806
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,880
look,
this is what's happening to me.

807
00:44:38,881 --> 00:44:39,571
And they say,
look,

808
00:44:39,571 --> 00:44:40,404
this is what's happening to me.
And you battle it out until you reach 

809
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:44,064
some sort of settlement.
And then you don't have to be resentful 

810
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,970
anymore.
And then you won't be mean and cruel,

811
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,360
vicious.
And you have to be honest in order to do

812
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:52,194
that.

813
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,690
Here's a,
here's a way of thinking about error.

814
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,120
You don't exactly know what you're 
doing.

815
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,280
So how do you get to the point where you
know what you're doing?

816
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,593
I think follow your internal intuitions,
be honest about it and know what will 

817
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:09,301
happen is a star will appear and then 
guide you and the star is whatever makes

818
00:45:09,371 --> 00:45:10,204
your life meaningful.
And maybe you'll take some tentative 

819
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:15,820
steps in that direction and you'll get a
little ways and you'll think,

820
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:16,840
no,
that's wrong.

821
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,070
And then the thing that makes you like 
meaningful will appear over there.

822
00:45:21,071 --> 00:45:23,530
And then you take a few tentative steps 
in that direction,

823
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,110
but as you step and walk towards these 
things,

824
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:28,240
you change and as you change,
you get wiser.

825
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,283
And what happens is if you keep 
following these things that make your 

826
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,300
life meaningful,
then you correct yourself across time.

827
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,093
You see the thing there and that's wrong
and you see it there and that's wrong 

828
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:40,080
and you see it there and that's wrong,
but you keep chasing it.

829
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:43,030
It as you chase it,
you move forward and as you move forward

830
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:43,864
and you do things and you learn from 
your mistakes because you're honest and 

831
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:47,274
you're watching,
you get wiser and wiser and the 

832
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:50,224
consequence of all those mistakes is 
you'll self correct the mistakes and 20 

833
00:45:52,991 --> 00:45:55,630
years down the road maybe you won't be 
making so many mistakes.

834
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,870
They say it takes 10,000
hours to be an expert at something.

835
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,513
So you would need 10,000
hours of practice following what it is 

836
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:04,840
that you need to follow.

837
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,910
I'm going to close with two things.

838
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,240
Okay?

839
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,073
I've come to the conclusion as a 
consequence of studying the things I've 

840
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:16,554
been telling you about,
that belief has a religious 

841
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:18,864
substructure.
If you go all the way down into 

842
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:21,660
someone's belief structure right to the 
bottom,

843
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,090
what you find or religious 
presuppositions,

844
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:26,190
they,
the person might not agree,

845
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,880
but I don't think that matters.
I think generally people don't know.

846
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:35,040
Here's an old religious presuppositions 
older than Christianity.

847
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,110
It's supposed Christianity is the most 
powerful proponent of this viewpoint.

848
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,153
There's a heaven and there's a hell and 
you should live your life so that you 

849
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:45,354
end up in one of them.
What's happened to Christianity is that 

850
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:49,980
that's an afterlife thing.

851
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,320
I don't think it is an afterlife thing.
I think it's a now thing.

852
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,290
I see people who are in hell all the 
time.

853
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,320
You can see them if you walked down 
Bluer Street,

854
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,230
if I'm not kidding,
it's,

855
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,630
it's no joke.
If you walk by someone in Hell,

856
00:47:06,631 --> 00:47:08,970
you can't look at them.
You won't look at them.

857
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:10,590
You'll,
you'll give them a wide berth.

858
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,240
And if you look at them and you really 
look at them,

859
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,313
they'll either become aggressive or 
ashamed because they do not want you to 

860
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:18,570
see where they are because they don't 
want to see where they are.

861
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,130
Yeah.

862
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:20,963
And by the same token,
heaven's a real place to and now and 

863
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:24,084
then you're in it,
but you don't notice because you don't 

864
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:28,320
believe in it.
There was an old Gospel,

865
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,130
Gnostic Gospel that was dug up in 1957 
he gospel of Thomas and in the Gospel of

866
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:33,964
autonomous Christ says,
the Kingdom of Heaven is spread out on 

867
00:47:36,551 --> 00:47:38,860
the earth,
but men do not see it.

868
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,210
And I don't think that's a metaphor or,
or maybe it is a metaphor,

869
00:47:43,211 --> 00:47:47,320
it's a deep metaphor.
It means that life,

870
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:49,990
human life is very expensive and we live
in the middle.

871
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:50,824
It's kind of a mediocre middle often.
And at one extreme there's a hell and 

872
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:54,724
the other extreme is heaven.
And we bounced back and forth between 

873
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:59,920
them without really noticing.
And I could say,

874
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,810
well here,
here's something to consider.

875
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:06,670
If the things you're doing are landing,
you inhale stop.

876
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,650
Unless you want to be there.

877
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,660
And you know,
if you think you,

878
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:13,100
all you have to do is think about your 
life over the last year,

879
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:13,934
you,
you can be certain that you can call to 

880
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:19,240
mind times when you would have rather 
that did not happen.

881
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,950
And so the lesson from that is clear.
Don't set up those conditions anymore.

882
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,870
And by the same token,
if you watch yourself,

883
00:48:25,871 --> 00:48:27,640
you can tell when you're where you want 
to be.

884
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:28,361
And I could say,
well,

885
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:31,720
if you're where you want to be and 
that's really the right place,

886
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:34,930
then all you should ever do is practice 
to be there.

887
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,810
The Kingdom of Heaven is spread out on 
the earth,

888
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:38,644
but men do not see it.
So this is what I would say about 

889
00:48:40,781 --> 00:48:41,614
virtue.
Virtue first is the attempt to see that 

890
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,710
heaven and it's a questioning thing.
And it,

891
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:49,330
I'm not saying it's the same for 
everyone.

892
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:53,260
I don't believe that at all because 
people are individuals just to see it.

893
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,550
And the second thing is to attempt to 
live in it.

894
00:48:58,570 --> 00:48:59,403
And I truly believe,
I truly believe that there is nothing 

895
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,830
that you can do that's better for being 
not only for yourself,

896
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:15,020
but for everyone that you interact with.
None of you know your potential.

897
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,180
People are amazing creatures that you 
know that people can be a Biz mully

898
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,613
awful,

899
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,670
but they can be as remarkably good as 
they are.

900
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,050
Uh,
uh,

901
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,110
Bismilaahi awful.
I think it's rare,

902
00:49:28,111 --> 00:49:33,111
but it's not beyond the realm of 
possibility.

903
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,700
What's a human possibility?
Well,

904
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,690
no one knows.
Maybe it's,

905
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:39,903
it's near infinite.
We know nothing about our own being or 

906
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,940
about our relationship with the totality
of things.

907
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,303
We may occupy a more important place 
than we all think and the consequences 

908
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:56,170
of our actions,
our virtues or our lack thereof.

909
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,790
Echo may echo far beyond what we want to
believe.

910
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:08,490
So I would say try to find out what's 
good for you.

911
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:15,270
Just watch,
don't listen to anybody else.

912
00:50:15,271 --> 00:50:17,400
Or maybe you should.
Maybe they'll give you some hints,

913
00:50:17,401 --> 00:50:18,234
you know,
but you've got to sort it out for 

914
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:19,854
yourself.
And when you find out what's good for 

915
00:50:22,201 --> 00:50:24,690
you and what isn't,
do the things that are good for you.

916
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,060
Until you like being alive and to,
until you're thrilled to be alive.

917
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Let's see what happens.
And I would also suggest there's nothing

918
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,200
you could possibly do that will be more 
profound and useful than that.

919
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,473
That's all

920
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,810
[inaudible].
