1
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,940
Short while ago,
I had the honor of talking with Ian 

2
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:25,960
Hirsi Ali,
who I regard as a genuine modern day 

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,451
heroin and a role model for all 
individuals who desire to speak and 

4
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:32,831
embodied the truth.
I'll tell you a little bit about her 

5
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,430
before the discussion starts.
Ali Born in 1969 as a Somali Dutch 

6
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:42,491
American author and scholar.
She's received international attention 

7
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:47,171
as a critic of Islam and an advocate for
the rights and self determination of 

8
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:51,401
Muslim woman opposing honor violence,
arranged marriage from which she escaped

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:55,400
by immigrating from Somalia and female 
genital mutilation,

10
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,610
to which she was subject as a child.
She's a fellow at Stanford's Hoover 

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,180
Institution and Harvard's Kennedy 
School,

12
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,800
a visiting scholar at the American 
Enterprise Institute in Washington DC,

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,830
and a member of the council on Foreign 
Relations.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,070
She founded the Ion Hirsi Ali Foundation
explicitly for the defense of women's 

15
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,361
rights in 2003 Hirsi.
Ali was elected to the lower house of 

16
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,761
the Dutch House of Representatives,
a political crisis related to her Dutch 

17
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:28,721
citizenship led to her resignation and 
indirectly to the fall of the second 

18
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,520
Balkan end.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,790
Cabinet did not.
In 2006,

20
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,670
a former devout Muslim Hirsi Ali left 
the faith and became a vocal critic of 

21
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,830
Islam,
particularly in radical forums.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,980
She collaborated on a short movie with 
Theo van Gogh in 2004 entitled 

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,720
submission.
The film depicted the oppression of 

24
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,201
women under fundamentalist Islamic law,
sparking controversy and threats of 

25
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:56,540
death.
Van Gogh was in fact stabbed to death by

26
00:01:56,541 --> 00:02:01,541
Mohammed booberry,
a Moroccan Dutch Islamic terrorists 

27
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:04,400
later that year,
Hirsi Ali maintains that quote,

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,360
Islam is part religion and part a 
political military doctrine.

29
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,810
The part that is a political doctrine 
contains a worldview,

30
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,870
a system of laws,
and a moral code that is totally 

31
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,750
incompatible with our constitution,
our laws,

32
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:22,751
and our way of life.
Her best and influential books include 

33
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,640
the caged virgin 2004,
infidel,

34
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,790
2006 no mad,
2010 and most recently heretic 2015 

35
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,520
where she calls for a reef formation of 
Islam and the defeat of the Islamists in

36
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:42,521
2005 Hirsi.
Ali was named as one of Time Magazine's 

37
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,220
100 most influential people in the 
world.

38
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:47,030
She's also received a free speech award 
from the Danish newspaper,

39
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,100
Yellen's posting the Swedish Liberal 
Party's democracy prize and the moral 

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,831
courage award.
Her critics accused Ellie of building 

41
00:02:56,831 --> 00:03:00,071
her career on the denigration of Islam 
and Muslims questioning her right to 

42
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,200
authoritatively about Islam and the Arab
world,

43
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:07,350
and portraying her as the embodiment of 
the western colonial civilizing mission 

44
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,020
discourse.

45
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,130
I guess you'll be able to render 
judgment on that yourself.

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,160
After watching our discussion.
The first thing I'd like to say is,

47
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,950
thank you very much for agreeing to do 
this video.

48
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,310
I'm very happy to be talking to you.
I'd be nervous about it all day 

49
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,310
actually.
Oh,

50
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,860
well,
anything?

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
No,
she tells me to do.

52
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,970
I see,
I see.

53
00:03:32,971 --> 00:03:33,930
Okay.
Okay.

54
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,610
So,
well,

55
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,210
I sent you some,
some questions the other day and I 

56
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,110
thought that I would first of all ask 
you,

57
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,980
I read your,
your recent paper,

58
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:50,790
the one that you wrote for the Hoover 
Institute called the challenge of Dawa.

59
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,140
Yes.
And so I thought maybe I'd ask you if 

60
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,140
you would,
to begin with just to tell people if you

61
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,011
could give them a brief summary of what 
you were attempting to accomplish with 

62
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:01,011
that.
That might be a good way to start.

63
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,740
So what I was trying to accomplish was 
to get the attention.

64
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,730
Oh,
I also say,

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,810
especially if the government,
uh,

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,460
to the ideology that underlie this,
the alphabet tentative thing,

67
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,310
the misogyny against women,
homophobia by Islam is to eliminate all 

68
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,340
homosexuals,
again,

69
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,060
increase in antisemitism,
the persecuted Christians

70
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,590
guys like me who are ex Muslims and draw
attention to the venues where these 

71
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:41,721
ideas are disseminated to these schools.
It's in the mosque them address that.

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,060
It's in the neighborhood and it's a 
photo to use.

73
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,990
Sometimes it's these professionals who 
say that they asked you a large gates 

74
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,740
for telling young people as young as age
how to hate and hate.

75
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,630
And once we understand,
once we understand these commitments to 

76
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,030
get into the heads and across people,
the ideas with radical Islam that I fit 

77
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:18,411
it in,
they'll be able to do with the tenor of 

78
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:23,630
the outcomes of the call.
Radical Islam is an extension of doubt.

79
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,920
That's what I'd like to see it as an 
extension of and for me to have 

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,641
constitutes the violence,
the terrorist attacks and the political 

81
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,690
violence it's used to make that's 
intended to change.

82
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,680
Society will be able to

83
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,660
eliminate,
to eliminate eliminated.

84
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,870
Okay,
so what exactly would you say is the 

85
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,871
relationship between Darwin and Jihad?
You're formulating it by the sounds of 

86
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,761
it that Darwin is the to Jihad and these
are the concepts reasonably separable 

87
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:05,651
and I guess a subsidiary question with 
that would be we're talking about 

88
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:06,980
radical Islam,
but of course many of the people who are

89
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:11,981
watching are going to be.
It's going to be difficult for them to 

90
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:14,570
distinguish between moderate Islam and 
radical Islam and I'm also curious about

91
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:19,571
your feelings about exactly that 
distinction and how such a thing might 

92
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:19,571
be pursued.

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,870
So my approach to it is there is one 
Islam,

94
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,300
but there are three sets of most 
letters.

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
There's one Islam and that one is land.
It's of different components.

96
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,460
It has religious components,
it has a political component,

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,010
a social component,
but it's all encompassing.

98
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Now,
if you look at the different sets of 

99
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Muslims,
what you see is one set of Muslims,

100
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,321
we just here to the religious 
prescriptions and they see being a 

101
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,260
Muslim as something private

102
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,560
and when they're confronted by others 
about the political activist,

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,640
other bad things that other Muslims who 
they involved with the Koran and the 

104
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,810
Prophet Muhammad who is the founder of 
Islam by mentioning of his life in the 

105
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,980
early days when he first started with 
this religion and sway people and using,

106
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,650
but then there's the other set of 
Muslims I called them.

107
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,480
Then the Dean's list,
the other ones who they're the ones that

108
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,490
engage in Dallas.
They're the ones who have the objective 

109
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,340
of viewing the world.
Who is the other ones to hate 

110
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,350
homosexuals.
To date,

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,360
women who hate Muslims tend to say that 
it's their duty to die.

112
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,550
Converse with people.
It's not,

113
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,180
I call it the Medina Muslims because 
they invoke the prophet Muhammad's life 

114
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,100
and example,
and the legacy in Medina.

115
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I called the modifiers.
These are limbs could sending up to the 

116
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:04,930
Medina,
Muslims within Islam.

117
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,120
As a civilization,
as a culture,

118
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,550
as a political philosophy,
we have a theological problem and we 

119
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,360
have to deal in theological problem.

120
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,490
So these are for me,
these are the three different sets of 

121
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Muslims,

122
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,940
the problem of the Medina Muslims,
the other ones were engaged in your work

123
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,980
to differentiate between what's in the 
dino Muslims to Israel and the 

124
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,300
attendant.
And why don't we first start with 

125
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,140
Dallas.
We've called you to this love and if you

126
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:40,141
reject it,
then you are an enemy of his love and 

127
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:43,820
use violence in their circular.
They're good arguments.

128
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,340
Why should we or Islamic law was good 
for you,

129
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,740
for women and Muslims?
Uh,

130
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,570
this is what is in the club.
This is what Muhammad said,

131
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,770
informing anything confused and this,
this fall to persuade,

132
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,400
to,
to buy it.

133
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,030
Then they apply for.
And that was the reputation of course 

134
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:20,080
better,
but you have been for the Muslims,

135
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,750
but there's to convinced non Muslims 
from that,

136
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,910
for that status.
There's this other project,

137
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,900
status of purgatory.
You know,

138
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,910
where you have to pay discriminatory 
taxes and lead a life of second class 

139
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,350
citizens.
If you look at the Christians who live 

140
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,350
in Egypt,
Christmas,

141
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,641
who live in Pakistan,
patients who live in the majority of 

142
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:46,641
countries,
it's that kind of status.

143
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:49,520
So,
so the Mecca Medina distinction seems to

144
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:54,521
be very,
I would say both complicated and 

145
00:09:54,521 --> 00:09:54,980
problematic because.
So,

146
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,320
so tell me if I'm wrong.
Okay.

147
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:02,321
Because my understanding is that 
Mohammed spent most of the part of his 

148
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:07,811
life that was associated with the 
establishment of Islam in Medina and 

149
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:10,610
noting that guy and that it wasn't until
he went to Medina,

150
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,260
that Islam actually became a force.
So back in Mecca,

151
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,030
although his doctrine appears to have 
been,

152
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,200
let's say,
more peaceful.

153
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,140
It was also much less successful as a,
as a,

154
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,120
both a religious and a political 
movement.

155
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,710
So then he left Mecca and I believe 
under pressure from the inhabitants,

156
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:30,140
at least to some degree,
moved to Medina.

157
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,070
And then that's when Islam became more,
uh,

158
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,320
more,
more revolutionary and expansive.

159
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,130
And so what do you see now?
I know that it isn't universally 

160
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,040
accepted among the Islamic community 
that,

161
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:47,420
that Mecca Medina distinction is a 
reasonable one to make.

162
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,450
Because of course,
the presumption is that there's an 

163
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:52,450
essential unity of thought across the 
doctrines,

164
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,190
but,
but given,

165
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,060
given your interpretation,
and I've read the similar interpretation

166
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:00,650
among other,
among other people,

167
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,400
do you see,
what do you see as hopeful within the 

168
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,611
Islamic community with regards to 
bridging the gap between the say the 

169
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,990
earlier works,
so to speak of Mohammed and the later,

170
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,920
the later,
more,

171
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,730
more revolutionary element of the,
of his actions and his faith.

172
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,800
Is there a way that that can be 
reconciled?

173
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,100
Do Muslims into Mecca,
Mecca,

174
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,830
Medina,
and modifiers.

175
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,240
That's not,
of course an official,

176
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,300
a distinction not accepted anywhere you 
really wanted to get to,

177
00:11:34,301 --> 00:11:35,120
you know,
who,

178
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,380
which individuals,
which Muslims,

179
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,320
uh,
at war with us.

180
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,360
And should we be worried about what 
about the vasculature?

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,560
What about these other Muslims who are 
speaking up labels?

182
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,480
We will give him,
if you said the word Islam most work.

183
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,450
One thing that I noticed is that 
selected and we justified it.

184
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,560
I actually,
they invoke method.

185
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,910
Oh,
Mohammed's legacy in Mecca.

186
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,790
Because as unfortunately if my sister 
tells me,

187
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,880
Oh yeah,
and you've listed there,

188
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,760
you need to get up and say I want to 
invoke some best for my parents,

189
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:17,150
say,
oh,

190
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:22,151
come on my relationship with intimate 
and then make it your business to tell 

191
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:28,271
him what to do,
and then she would come up with some 

192
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:30,881
other ideas or some other,
but it's my duty to come in and go,

193
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:37,570
so this limit,
but then it's the Medina Muslims extent 

194
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,540
and I'm not the only one that other 
scholars like.

195
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,510
There are many others who have 
preserving a position as a culture,

196
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,970
as a civilization,
and at the same time putting this 

197
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,200
violence and providing courses within 
Islam.

198
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,140
If you're trying to do that,
then you'll go to see your way to make a

199
00:13:09,141 --> 00:13:14,141
list of all the concepts that we really 
don't have any problem with.

200
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:22,690
People being told to pay five times.
This is letter of cost in the market and

201
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,980
also they just don't have a problem with
all of that data that's been referenced 

202
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,420
to the early days in Medina.
As you said,

203
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,750
a political philosophy.

204
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,030
Mohammed,
we just wars because he would spend and 

205
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,890
that's exactly where was successful and 
that Islam is to end and they say,

206
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,370
listen,

207
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,360
to be,

208
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,700
you know,
it could be emulating.

209
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,170
So that's I think where the public 
market that we apply in the social 

210
00:14:11,241 --> 00:14:15,720
sciences has its problems,
but this simplifies because it focuses,

211
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,030
it should work.

212
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,230
Okay.
So you see this as an externally 

213
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,230
applied,
um,

214
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,270
uh,
a category system essentially that 

215
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:29,270
that's useful,
that's useful for,

216
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,620
for,
for outsiders who were trying to assess 

217
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,561
the situation to determine who it is 
that you're dealing with that might be 

218
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,180
regarded as an ally and who it is that 
you're dealing with.

219
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,280
It might be regarded as a fold,
so to speak,

220
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,560
and that would be on the more militant,
tend to have things that,

221
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,200
that,
that,

222
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,290
that's a reasonable way of looking at 
it.

223
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,660
That's reasonable.
That's a reasonable way of looking at 

224
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:53,660
it.
But if you take

225
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,890
the moderates versus extreme 
classification or categorization,

226
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:00,570
that has become common place.
It doesn't tell you what,

227
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,620
when we look at model,
we think of people who are not using 

228
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,020
violence.
Whereas if you look at Medina,

229
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,440
you will see that there are hundreds of 
thousands of Muslims who do not apply 

230
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:17,030
violence now,
but who do preach about this and they do

231
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,090
preach the Medina legacies and they 
leave that Sharia should be instituted 

232
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,870
and in places where they get where you 
get a majority of these violent and 

233
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,720
ideally types,
then suddenly they apply and forces 

234
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,950
Sharia alone.
So I think the terms model is an extreme

235
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,490
are just not good enough.
They don't cover.

236
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,990
They also seem to bear any relationship 
to the internal dynamics of the faith 

237
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,460
itself.
So whatever.

238
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,550
That's also problematic.
Okay.

239
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:51,570
So does that because you have to keep 
going back to the theology.

240
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:55,510
You have to keep going back to the 
internal debate among Muslims,

241
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,070
how to move on and how to relate to the 
test.

242
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,980
So I personally think Mecca and Medina 
is much more useful as a tool,

243
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,430
as an external conceptual framework for 
understanding the problem we face with 

244
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,300
Islam.
Then extreme versus freshwater and all 

245
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,310
the,
you know,

246
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,480
all the other terms that we have.
So let me ask you another question about

247
00:16:17,481 --> 00:16:18,890
that then.
So see,

248
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,360
one of the problems that I've had

249
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,800
[inaudible] I've been trying to look at,
at the potential for true relationship 

250
00:16:26,141 --> 00:16:27,910
between Islam and Christianity,
you know,

251
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:30,340
to the degree that I understand Islam or
Christianity,

252
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:33,190
which of course there's plenty to 
understand about both,

253
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:36,640
so it's no easy thing to manage,
but there is this claim as well that,

254
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,550
that that's widespread and rather vague 
that,

255
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,670
that Islam is in essence a religion of 
peace.

256
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:45,670
And,
but when I look at the historical data,

257
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,240
say stemming from Medina,
the Medina time,

258
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:54,450
and then moving forward and the fact 
that that Mohammed was definitely 

259
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,970
someone who engaged personally in 
warfare and in expansionist warfare,

260
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,150
it's not,
it's not an easy thing for me to make 

261
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,150
the leap to,
uh,

262
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:07,980
to see comprehending or being able to 
accept the claim that the fundamental 

263
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,570
doctrines of Islam are peaceful,
are,

264
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,200
are,
are associated with peace.

265
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:14,260
Because it looks to me like there's an 
element of it that's quite militaristic.

266
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,820
And I've also thought that let's say 
there's a religious element to Islam.

267
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:20,290
And I mean this is not an original 
thought.

268
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,360
Obviously there's a religious element to
Islam,

269
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:27,361
but there's also something that's 
clearly more like a political movement 

270
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:30,931
and more like a governmental movement 
and that's also complicated by the fact 

271
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:35,041
that there isn't any clear separation 
between church and state in Islamic 

272
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,750
doctrine as far as I can tell,
so when we hear claims that are,

273
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,200
when claims are made that Islam is 
essentially a religion of peace,

274
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,710
then that doesn't seem to be the case 
with Medina,

275
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,280
end of the theological discourse or the 
actions that that emerged there of and 

276
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,071
then part of the problem is how do you 
reconcile that with the contradictions 

277
00:17:55,071 --> 00:17:56,490
in relationship to the earlier,
earlier,

278
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,580
as you say,
Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to 

279
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:01,580
me how that can be done so

280
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,230
as a political force obligated to 
enforce it.

281
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,460
So number one,
they did not give have his message.

282
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,760
You guys are worshiping false gods,
these that you live in a time and I'd 

283
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:32,610
like to and come work with.
You know what,

284
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,710
these peaceful,
peaceful.

285
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,370
It's because he applied for.
Didn't personally.

286
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,390
Do you have an attacker describe 
ourselves in Levina then?

287
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,590
He does.
That was in the war and the numbers with

288
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,010
Muslims and these are people who come 
from with them by then.

289
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,320
Then the says everywhere,
wherever that is,

290
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,160
destination is only after you accept 
Islam as long as you refuse to abide by 

291
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:24,670
Islamic law or accept to be subdued by 
Islam,

292
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,470
you are at war.
That's why they.

293
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,830
The Medina is make this distinction 
between the house of Islam piece and the

294
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,880
horrors of war is everywhere where 
they're introduced and it's the job of 

295
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:38,970
the Muslims in the house feed to 
congrats.

296
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,900
So it's a religion of peace in so far as
it's final utopian aim is the cessation 

297
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:50,061
of conflict,
but it's the cessation of conflict in 

298
00:19:50,061 --> 00:19:51,800
part as a consequence of of conquests.
Okay.

299
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

300
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:54,300
Well that was more or less how I 
understood it.

301
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,270
So when the claim is made that it's a 
religion of peace,

302
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:01,410
then that isn't precisely.
It's a slight of hand in some sense.

303
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,690
With regards specifically to that phrase

304
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,110
that are individuals.
That was I skype as maker will say when 

305
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:13,970
they say what they really wanted to say,
peaceful individual,

306
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,360
no problems with other religions and I 
want to be engaged with any politics or 

307
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,930
to link politics with religion please.

308
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,490
Right,
right,

309
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:29,491
right.
And that I wouldn't say it wouldn't be 

310
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:29,491
the majority of Muslims worldwide.
I'm not sure you agree with that,

311
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:34,111
but it seems to me that it isn't self 
evidently the case that the majority of 

312
00:20:34,111 --> 00:20:38,221
human beings are violent and war like 
and so my sense is is that given the 

313
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:41,800
essential peace peacefulness of most 
people,

314
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:46,801
they're going to take a look at the 
Islamic doctrine and extract from it 

315
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,470
those elements that are supportive of 
that more individual pace,

316
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,650
but that still leaves open the question 
of exactly what the doctrine means as a 

317
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,270
set of motivational principles and now 
it seems to be a big part of the current

318
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:59,300
problem and also the need for current 
discourse.

319
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,420
What I would hope is that it would be 
possible to undertake a dialogue with 

320
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,110
Islam.
Let's say between Islam and the West are

321
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:10,460
between Islam and Judeo Christianity and
defined within Islam itself.

322
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,730
The seeds that would enable that 
dialogue to occur so that some sort of 

323
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,440
long term negotiated conceptual and 
practical piece could be attained,

324
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,980
but the more I've read about Islam,
the more difficult it is for me to 

325
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,011
understand how that might be managed,
especially because of it's because of 

326
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:31,091
the war like tradition that emerged from
from Medina and then move outward in at 

327
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:35,591
a staggering rate from that and also the
thing that's quite quite disconcerting 

328
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:38,060
to me.
I mean it's not like Christianity hasn't

329
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:43,061
been rife with internal divisions like 
that between the steps and the 

330
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,720
Catholics,
but it also was the case that what you 

331
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,400
might describe as the civil war that's 
been occurring within Islam,

332
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,620
more or less started as far as I can 
tell,

333
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:56,621
more or less started that day that 
Mohammed died and has never stopped 

334
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,921
since that and that also seems to be.
Well obviously it's a problem for the 

335
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,150
Islamic community itself,
but it also seems to be a problem,

336
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,390
an increasing problem for the west 
because we can't not be tangled up in 

337
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,390
that.

338
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,110
Yeah.
We we have to share the planet with one 

339
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,590
fifth of humanity and it's very clear 
that things have to change and that's is

340
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,750
the beauty of Muslims to change the 
theological underpinnings of their 

341
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,910
religion and as far as I'm concerned,
this is being pushed by those that I 

342
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:30,751
call the farmers or modifies and these 
are individuals maybe now a little 

343
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,940
bigger groups are forming views and 
maybe even being led by some nation 

344
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,690
state for that.
The big question is either going to 

345
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:50,701
agree on what to change.
So what is in built into Islam is this 

346
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,160
idea that you.
I'm submit edits to the Koran and it's 

347
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:00,430
the same thing.
You know,

348
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:05,431
Mohammed was a by Muslims as infallible 
as somebody who never made a mistake.

349
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,450
So it's an uphill battle for those 
Muslims who are seeking modernization to

350
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,160
agree on,
you know,

351
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,190
how to edit,
how to persuade Muslims to accept a 

352
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,620
truly peaceful right.
And a truly tolerant idea of religion 

353
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,601
that separates religion from politics,
respects the rights of women or people 

354
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:38,210
of other faiths and people within Islam 
who voted to leave their faith.

355
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,760
So how do you get the theological 
underpinnings for that?

356
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,290
Yeah,
that's within his lap.

357
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,900
The danger there too is that when that 
sort of thing is attempted,

358
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,570
often reformed from within a religious 
community,

359
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:57,010
one of the dangers there is that instead
of reforming it peacefully,

360
00:23:57,011 --> 00:23:59,830
all you do is add another sect to the 
court.

361
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,650
Yeah.
For us secular people,

362
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,730
it seems from from a distance it seems 
kind of easy to say,

363
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,030
well why don't they just separate 
religion from politics and to they just,

364
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,230
they can be religious to look at it that
way.

365
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,250
Simplistic.
Because then you get people who want to 

366
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:20,250
be religious.
These Medina subset,

367
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,400
what do you say for Medina was an 
expression of his muslimness is to 

368
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:31,791
convert to Islam to kill me as opposed 
to if it's to get women to cover up,

369
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,010
it's to keep warning us about life life 
today and all of that.

370
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,700
It.
It's the thing that made me,

371
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,930
I wouldn't say nervous to some degree 
from the perspective of someone who 

372
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,430
analyzes totalitarian ideology because 
the thing about totalitarian ideology is

373
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:50,530
it tends to be totalitarian,
right?

374
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:55,531
It's absolutely all consuming and that's
why also when I've been assessing,

375
00:24:56,381 --> 00:25:01,381
because I've done a fair bit of research
into comparative religion and done my 

376
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:05,251
best to expand my knowledge base and 
I've always had a hard time with Islam 

377
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:10,741
in that regard because it's difficult 
for me to extract out the purely 

378
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:14,761
religious elements and to compare them 
to let's say religious sentiments that 

379
00:25:14,761 --> 00:25:19,021
have emerged across across humankind and
all sorts of different times and arrows 

380
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:23,250
and to separate that from the political 
doctrine and sometimes I'm tempted to 

381
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,140
think more that Islam,
you know,

382
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,150
broadly and vaguely speaking,
is something much more like a political 

383
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:30,580
movement than it is in fact like a 
religious movement.

384
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,350
It is a political theory and it's a 
political movement.

385
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,380
It started out even in Mecca in the 
early days come to my board,

386
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,010
which was a political message.
It wasn't a religious message,

387
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:47,050
right?
Even in the early days in it was 

388
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,760
absolute is Islam by its nature is 
absolutely just because it a complete 

389
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:55,100
and total submission of the individual 
to God and in Medina.

390
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,250
Mohammed came around with a political,
a blueprint for how society ought to 

391
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:07,091
live,
the relationship between the individual 

392
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:07,850
and the relationship between men and 
women,

393
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:12,900
husband and wife,
the relationship between parent and 

394
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,761
child,
the relationship between the government 

395
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,060
and the subjects and their duties.
It has a court system.

396
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,090
It has a military system,
so from the very beginning it was more 

397
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,010
political theory.
As we understand the agent today,

398
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,370
Jesus Christ founded his religion within
an empire.

399
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:42,371
The Roman empire existed before and what
he was talking about was all religions.

400
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,530
Mohammed,
we forget.

401
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:46,710
Yeah,

402
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,550
yes,
right.

403
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,100
That's a very important distinction.
I mean really,

404
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:52,800
and it might be the crucial distinction,
so to speak,

405
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,740
and there was this empire,
empire bows and decline and fell and 

406
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,150
those who feel that they have inherited 
that legacy.

407
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,360
They want to go back to the days of 
employment for about 20 days when Islam 

408
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,650
was supremely and they want to do this 
in the 21st century.

409
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,690
All kinds.
It's not just.

410
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,790
You can't come on horseback and inmate 
and existing client like the Indian 

411
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:28,210
empire that they took over.
You could just take things also.

412
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,200
It's not like la,
but they're driven,

413
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,040
they're convinced they have this legacy 
and they're not afraid of it and is key 

414
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,220
because,
and here's why I keep going back to that

415
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,300
life on this temporal and that there is 
something in the after this.

416
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,530
There's no point in investing in this 
life accepting that nature,

417
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,240
so for the Medina Muslims,
it really becomes easy to recruit and 

418
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,250
inspire into their parents' Muslims who 
have already been taught that they've 

419
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:09,941
only got to work for the hereafter 
problems with Islam and I think it was 

420
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:14,850
would understand of course the basic lms
of Mohammed Straw with all of the Koran 

421
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,750
before all of the heat,
after all of these things and what 

422
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,210
Sharia law really means,
and then it gets to the past.

423
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,530
This is how they managed to teach young 
people.

424
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:32,531
How do they manage to teachable or these
thousands and millions of people who is 

425
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,040
subsidizing this countries like Saudi 
Arabia,

426
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,550
Qatar,
etc.

427
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:41,010
Understand that.
I think that makes oUr job as western 

428
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:42,700
whatever's easiest.

429
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,880
Let's talk about the saudis for a 
minute.

430
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,750
The elephant under the western carpet.
I mean,

431
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,930
I understand that in the aftermath of 
the oil crisis in the 19 seventies,

432
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:56,931
one of the things that that dictated 
american foreign policy was the desire 

433
00:28:56,931 --> 00:29:00,591
to maintain stable oil production and 
and I can understand that although I 

434
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:00,940
think it was short sighted,
I can.

435
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,050
I can see the logic in that,
but it's very difficult for me to see 

436
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,700
that in any possible way.
The saudis can be regarded as true 

437
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,271
allies of the west and so I don't 
understand why we have the relationship 

438
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:18,040
that we do have with the saudis given.
First of all,

439
00:29:18,041 --> 00:29:23,041
they were pumping literally trillions of
dollars every about every decade into 

440
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:27,681
the economy and then given that they 
practice a particularly pernicious form 

441
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,900
of,
I would say viciously militant islam and

442
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:34,350
second or third,
I guess that is that they're pumping out

443
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,650
propaganda that pushes this wahhabi 
viewpoint in massive doses everywhere in

444
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:40,650
the world.
I mean,

445
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,850
I don't understand,
and maybe this is also part of the 

446
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,450
complexity with regards to western 
attitudes towards,

447
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,810
towards the complex problem of islam.
I don't understand why the west doesn't 

448
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,761
do more to put a stop to that.
And so what are your thoughts about 

449
00:29:56,761 --> 00:29:57,370
that?
How does it look to you?

450
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:03,410
I'm perplexed.
I believe that the south would have 

451
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,100
booked the United States and other 
western business under this.

452
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,030
Someone has to come along and break 
that.

453
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,640
Uh,
I,

454
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,510
it,
I mean,

455
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:13,410
I agree with everything you said within 
Saudi Arabia,

456
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:19,420
I believe at least three forces,
the royal family who I believe now 

457
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,560
sexier and more modern,
they want to go down the larger,

458
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,480
incredibly powerful,
maybe even more powerful than the oil 

459
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,240
because the clergy in Saudi Arabia,
they have the power to put into people's

460
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,380
heads and hearts the wahhabi doctrine.
And so it's all about Saudi Arabia here.

461
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,770
People who decide what's right or what's
wrong,

462
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,840
moral other time,
right?

463
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,270
They have that powerful and then you 
have the trach,

464
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:04,310
the various stripes who obviously 
depending on their size of royal family 

465
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,850
or the clergy or both.
There's a dynamic there that is very 

466
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,430
interesting to watch,
but in that sense,

467
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Saudi Arabia has used and has indulged 
as larger established legacy Saudi 

468
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:25,890
Arabia.

469
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:32,390
People medina inside the borders of 
Saudi Arabia and tyler.

470
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,280
Yup,
and now I think we the United States and

471
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:43,281
other countries who need to be mad from 
the saudi royal family because they are 

472
00:31:43,281 --> 00:31:47,951
the ones who are political,
at least the political individuals that 

473
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:52,161
we did with tj and say we need a 
different between the house and the 

474
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,950
house of will happen because these 
people are really destroyed.

475
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,180
The planet vape.
You just said you have to think through 

476
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,870
what these people have done in south 
asia,

477
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,020
in africa,
all over the world.

478
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,480
It's the duty of a part of it swells to 
discredit this lab,

479
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,490
this lab that is through institutions 
and this is.

480
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:28,720
This is therefore policies.
we probably could refer that to a soft 

481
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,880
power.
That's where the cloud,

482
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,090
but that if you look at what is 
happening,

483
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,190
all these terrorist activities across 
the people wanting sheree about all of 

484
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,880
soda really is behind it and I think 
staying with that.

485
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,170
Yeah.

486
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,440
Okay,
so let me run a theory by you.

487
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,860
It's kind of a twofold theory.
So one is that there's a paternalistic 

488
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,120
attitude in the west towards the saudis 
that stems from perhaps events that were

489
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:01,450
as far back as 100 years ago,
and the paternalistic aspect is to 

490
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,430
underestimate them as enemies,
right?

491
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,270
Because you say,
well,

492
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:10,271
we could say,
well we need the oil and we're going to 

493
00:33:10,271 --> 00:33:11,090
stabilize it and maybe that we'd rather 
not have chaos in Saudi Arabia.

494
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:16,091
And so unknown dictator is better than 
unknown chaos and we saw some proof of 

495
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:18,290
that perhaps in what happened with 
Libya,

496
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,680
but so the idea would be there's nothing
sufficiently dangerous about the saudis 

497
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,090
to justify us destabilizing their 
regime,

498
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,640
especially when we're particularly 
dependent on their oil.

499
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,770
And then underneath that would be an 
underestimation of the danger of ideas.

500
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,920
And also,
especially when ideas are combined with 

501
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:38,920
money.
It's something like that.

502
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:43,060
So because the saudis in some sense I 
think are are fighting what you might 

503
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,931
regard as a stealth war against the weSt
and they're doing it by convincing 

504
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,930
upcoming generations of the rightness of
their particular viewpoint.

505
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,510
And so they're in it for the long haul 
in some sense.

506
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:56,210
And I think we're radically 
underestimating the danger of that and

507
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,870
it's quite logical law and we're not.
Yeah,

508
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,930
we're not.
I mean you have to think when the soviet

509
00:34:04,931 --> 00:34:09,931
union was around,
if we hadn't done anything interest was 

510
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:14,080
viewed that in economic terms for in 
military terms and that is not just 

511
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:19,611
telling rabia is even Iran,
these countries are waging an 

512
00:34:20,921 --> 00:34:25,890
ideological war and we're not because 
they believe,

513
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,040
well it's religion.
Religion is proTected and we don't talk 

514
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,281
about religion.
And that's one thing we believe we're 

515
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,760
under the spell of these incredibly 
charming.

516
00:34:36,761 --> 00:34:41,761
So that's come to attend our 
universities that have the emphasis and 

517
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,880
that reassure us that they're more 
westernized than we can tell them how 

518
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,170
they treat their women.
So in a way I think,

519
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:56,400
again,
I just keep going back and say we are 

520
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,501
under some sort of spell and at some 
point someone has to come and break that

521
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,780
spell globalization to,
you know,

522
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,830
a Saudi Arabia opens up to the world 
economy.

523
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:12,210
We really see what was on Inside their 
own country and inside all of these 

524
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,780
other countries.
It's the people,

525
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,040
the canadian people,
western people pushes.

526
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,420
And say no to and the amount from their 
documents that they engage with Saudi 

527
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,110
Arabia in a different way.
Yeah.

528
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:26,120
Yeah.

529
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:31,250
Well,
one of the thIngs I really can't figure 

530
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,931
out,
maybe you could shed some light on this 

531
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:32,931
too,
is that you know,

532
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,811
of all the things that women's political
movements should be doing in the west is

533
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,960
demanding as far as I can tell that the 
western countries,

534
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,020
let's say lead by their male rulers,
stop treating the saudis like are there 

535
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,101
are allies and I cannot understand why 
there hasn't been a concerted pressure 

536
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:52,620
put on western governments by women who 
are concerned,

537
00:35:52,621 --> 00:35:56,520
at least in principle with the equality 
and freedom of women around the world to

538
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,160
stop treating the saudis like they're 
our allies.

539
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:04,310
And so that,
that's another thing that perplexes me 

540
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,831
entirely in the cynical part of me 
thinks that the feminists who are more 

541
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:11,841
or less hell bent on the destruction of 
the western patriarchy adopt the 

542
00:36:11,841 --> 00:36:13,230
attitude that the enemy of my enemy is 
my friend.

543
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:15,360
And so they're willing to put up with 
what the saudis do.

544
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,820
But I don't think that's a sufficient 
explanation.

545
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:21,240
So I mean you can view our,
our culture,

546
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,390
so to speak a little bit from,
from the outside position because you 

547
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,701
haven't moved in as an immigrant and 
that gives you a viewpoint that it's 

548
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:30,420
much more difficult for someone within 
it to share.

549
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:35,421
And so like what do you see as as 
driving the absence of pressure,

550
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:39,210
let's say from women on governments in 
relationship to these,

551
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,690
I would say reprehensible dictatorships.
What's going on?

552
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:48,220
So the pre occupied with western country
after,

553
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,410
with what I see is that they have a 
festival that's focused only.

554
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,530
They do not talk about,
discuss the issue of a man of color and 

555
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:05,771
the patriarchy.
Men of color or immigrants of the 

556
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:06,680
nations and countries,
man,

557
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,540
nations and countries outside.

558
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:14,110
Oh the feminist to the identity politics
there was on multiculturalism and all 

559
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:26,710
these things are bad for women,
western women and bad.

560
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,600
So if you believe take multiculturalism 
is that so and the fasteners one since 

561
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:48,690
then they feel that they use to address

562
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,420
greAt belief that black women and muslim
women,

563
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,070
you know,
women of color,

564
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,850
if they wanted to get out of oppression,
then they should organize themselves.

565
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:10,851
That's what they believe.
What I find ironic is that sometimes we 

566
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:15,111
do organize ourselves.
I am organized another ex muslim woman 

567
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:19,370
to talk about the misogyny that's 
subjected to women in the white,

568
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,000
white feminist,
atheist.

569
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,020
And that's the biggest puzzle

570
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,570
I know.
Well,

571
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,571
I think that the treatment that you've 
received at the hands of western 

572
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:32,571
feminists,
to me that's,

573
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:36,890
that's something that's just absolutely 
it me absolutely speechless because

574
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,670
not only me,
it's all of us.

575
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,330
Again,
like I could fall to excellence,

576
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,880
but there are black women who are 
fighting for their rights and they all 

577
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:48,880
get shut down.

578
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,150
So we were talking about your treatment 
at the hands,

579
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:55,540
let's say a western feminists and,
and like I read infidel,

580
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,690
I don't know,
very shortly after you published it,

581
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,360
which I love that book man.
As soon as I read that,

582
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,500
I thought,
well,

583
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,510
I used which hell yeah,
you know,

584
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,810
I thought it was remarkable.
I thought your comment on your comments 

585
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,901
on viewing western culture from the 
perspective of an immigrant that was 

586
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,440
hungry for,
for genuine education and,

587
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,530
and your comments on your,
your experience with the efficiency of 

588
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,170
the dutch state say,
and you're sort of amazement at how well

589
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:27,130
it worked.
That was just.

590
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,220
I thought that was so remarkable and 
clearheaded and I thought when I read 

591
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,220
infidel,
I thought,

592
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,931
well this woman is immediately going to 
be a hero to feminists everywhere 

593
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:40,771
because she's removed yourself from this
oppressive state and moved out into the 

594
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:41,490
world and become a powerful figure when.

595
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,350
What was the probability of that?
It was like zero,

596
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,380
you know,
and that you suffered as a consequence 

597
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,021
of your beliefs and,
and you stood up forthrightly for them 

598
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,560
and I thought if you wanted to find a 
feminist hero that you are certainly,

599
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,430
you're certainly in the running man for 
exactly that.

600
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,910
And then to see how you've been treated.
It's just,

601
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:03,190
I just,
it just makes my jaw drop,

602
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,220
you know?
Especially what brandeis did was 

603
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,880
brandeis right where you were offered an
honorary phd and then they revoked it.

604
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,430
That just.
That was one of the.

605
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,500
I think that was almost as 
reprehensible,

606
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:19,501
inactive cowardice as the west's basic 
abandonment of solomon rushdie after the

607
00:40:20,591 --> 00:40:25,591
fat,
what was put on his head and about 

608
00:40:25,591 --> 00:40:26,400
equally dangerous,
so it was multicultural.

609
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,500
I mean what I,
you know,

610
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,570
my message,
my lifestyle and who I am,

611
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,380
it said they find off the prevalent 
today.

612
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,960
It's against the law

613
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,540
that western values as superior to 
islamic law and islamic values.

614
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,470
Not to say that is to blast being in the
temples of multiculturalism today.

615
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,230
I think

616
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:54,600
I,
I hope a lot of people because it wasn't

617
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:59,601
about what they think should happen for 
victims of misogyny.

618
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:04,430
I think it's all about the disciplines 
that my wife's and my,

619
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:08,420
my lIfe and my beliefs kind of 
dissonance.

620
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,170
They put these women in.
Because if you're going to say,

621
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,900
well,
it's horrible to be an american woman,

622
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,880
and the misogyny in America is worse 
than that.

623
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,310
They say,
no,

624
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:25,311
It's not.
I'm sort of interfering with their,

625
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,340
with their worldview.

626
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,760
The claim that you're making there is 
something like this and it's really,

627
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:35,790
it's a really vicious claim in a sense,
and it's something like the western 

628
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,911
feminists who are possessed by 
postmodernism and cultural relativism 

629
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:43,840
are willing to sacrifice the freedom and
equality of third world women in places 

630
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:49,721
like Saudi Arabia to maintain the 
sanctity of their multicultural notion 

631
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,860
because that justifies their attack on 
western patriarchy,

632
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,240
so they're willing to use.
Okay,

633
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,610
so that that's an absolutely

634
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,100
immigration.
There are so many men who are coming 

635
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,831
from these societies as men.
They are not used to the equality of 

636
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,810
women inside the west.
First of all,

637
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,230
they're all women,
child marriages,

638
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,630
female genital mutilation,
honor killings,

639
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,900
but now we have these crepes and sexual 
harassment of non muslim women and women

640
00:42:22,891 --> 00:42:27,891
keep on arguing for more integration and
they don't hear anything negative about 

641
00:42:29,371 --> 00:42:31,650
some of the negative impacts of 
immigration.

642
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,920
I don't consider them feminists anyhow.
I think that there are so much more 

643
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,660
committed to preserving their world view
their postmodern as well than they are 

644
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,830
to the rights of women and they're mean.

645
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,410
I think that that's how it looks to me 
is like this situation with Saudi Arabia

646
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,900
is the one is the test case is like,
so you might say,

647
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,810
are the postmodern feminists types are 
the ones who present themselves as.

648
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,880
Are they more concerned with the rights 
of women or are they more concerned with

649
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:07,030
bringing down the so called tyranny of 
the west and the answer is they're more 

650
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,541
concerned with the louder than they are 
with the farmer because when you put 

651
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:13,331
them head to head,
they dispense with the rights of women 

652
00:43:13,331 --> 00:43:16,930
across the world as long as they can 
maintain their moral justification for 

653
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,400
the radical beliefs and I do think that 
is why they go after you because you're.

654
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:24,670
You're exacTly the reprehenSible 
exemplar of what it is that they're 

655
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,980
attempting to deny.
I would say,

656
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,690
and I think that does show their true 
motivations

657
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,320
absolutely.
Out at the time.

658
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,450
I'm guessing a lot of signals here that 
I should.

659
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,140
I should hang up now,
but I really enjoyed talking to you and 

660
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,070
I hope that in some way I've contributed
to,

661
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,220
to the message that she wants to get out
there.

662
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:46,490
You know what,
I'll start with this,

663
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:48,860
I'll give you 30 seconds.
I'll just tell you what,

664
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,950
what are doing with this,
I mean I have arranged with a group of 

665
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,401
moderate muslims in Canada and some in 
the us as well to start a series of 

666
00:43:57,401 --> 00:44:01,361
dialogues like the one that we had today
because this isn't really viciously 

667
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:04,400
important problem and so I want to use 
this as the opener for that.

668
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,460
I would like to go after this issue of 
whether or not a real dialogue could be 

669
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:13,691
begun between the judeo Christian West 
and the islam world with some hope of 

670
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,290
not having all of this evolved into 
endless and continual warfare because as

671
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:19,970
far as I can tell,
that's where it's headed.

672
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,220
Yes.
That's where it's headed.

673
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:25,590
Yeah.
Well go get a chance to talk again.

674
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:30,290
Thank you so much.
Yep.

675
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,920
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
