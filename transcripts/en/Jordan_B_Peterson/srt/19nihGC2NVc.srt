1
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,780
Hi there.
So I released,

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,410
this is the third of three videos that 
I'm releasing this morning.

3
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,244
And the first one deep,
I just read the letter from the 

4
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:28,380
university administration requesting my 
silence.

5
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,214
And then in the second one I detailed 
out my response and said that I was 

6
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:36,360
going to meet with the dean of the 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,

7
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:37,194
David Cameron.
And I had gone to meet with David on 

8
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:44,610
Friday to discuss what had happened and 
to discuss the letter.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,253
And we had a good meeting,
we had a good meeting and he's a 

10
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,340
reasonable person.
And,

11
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,174
uh,
so I suggested because I thought before 

12
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:55,320
the meeting and I talked to my family,
I thought,

13
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,154
well,
what's the best possible way this could 

14
00:00:57,061 --> 00:01:00,170
move forward so that it would be in 
everyone's best interest,

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,870
mine and the universities and the 
broader public and the students and,

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,190
and everyone.
And so we thought that the best thing to

17
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:10,710
happen would be that the university 
could agree to host a,

18
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,300
um,
a debate,

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,163
a public debate about the issue about 
bill see 16 and about legislation like 

20
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:19,430
it and that,
that,

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,273
that would be officially hosted by the 
university and I could present my case 

22
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:27,360
and whoever wanted to present their case
contrary to what I've been stating would

23
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:28,320
be invited to.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,213
And so the Dean,
David Cameron said that he had to talk 

25
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,850
to some people and that he would get 
back to me as soon as possible.

26
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:39,480
And so over the weekend he talked to 
mark Gertler,

27
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,420
who's the president of the university 
and the provost,

28
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:46,080
sheryl red air and the vp of hr,
Kelly,

29
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,540
Hannah Moffitt.
And they agreed to go forward with it.

30
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,170
And so I was thrilled and I still am 
thrilled and,

31
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,080
and so good because that means,
you know,

32
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,080
one of the things we talked about was 
that we could talk about this,

33
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,260
like civilized human beings and we could
discuss the real issues here.

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,363
And maybe as well we could use the 
University of Toronto as a model to all 

35
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,220
universities who've been dealing with 
this sort of thing too,

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,350
about how to actually deal with it.
Like,

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,243
like people who are rational and 
intelligent and careful and thoughtful 

38
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:15,804
in all of that.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,040
And so they agreed to the public debate 
and we talked about two other issues.

40
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:20,874
One was they were concerned during the 
meeting about the possibility of 

41
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,970
security violations,
you know,

42
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:27,804
demonstrations and that sort of thing.
And so they thought for a while about 

43
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:32,610
only holding it online,
but they decided not to do that,

44
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,060
to do it as,
as a university function live,

45
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,943
which is exactly right.
And we talked about security concerns 

46
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:43,560
and,
and agreed at least tentatively that the

47
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,550
rule would be that unwarranted 
disruptions will be stopped.

48
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,180
So that because both sides are going to 
be represented in this debate and,

49
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,093
and I hope they can find someone 
articulate and intelligent to make a 

50
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,330
case for the other side because that's 
what we want.

51
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,230
So anyways,
look,

52
00:02:59,231 --> 00:03:00,064
this is unbelievably good news.
It's unbelievably good news because it 

53
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,334
means that the university has decided to
uphold its position as an investigator 

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,650
into complex intellectual matters.

55
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,250
And that we can discuss this like with 
like civilized human beings.

56
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:18,040
And so my Kudos to the University of 
Toronto,

57
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:18,874
and you know,
I've said from the beginning that this 

58
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,650
is an institute that I've respected and 
admired and I'm grateful to for,

59
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,050
for providing me with the position that 
I have.

60
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:30,520
And I am so absolutely thrilled that 
they decided to do the right thing.

61
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
And not only that,
and I got to tell you,

62
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,010
and this is God's honest truth,
David thanked me for bringing the issues

63
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:37,720
to their attention.
And he meant it.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,350
So hurray.
It's so good.

65
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,010
So strike one.
You know,

66
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,870
Mark went up on the wall for free speech
and for the University of Toronto.

67
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,393
So,
and I'd like to thank all the people 

68
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,794
that have been supporting me.
It's been very helpful and your letters 

69
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,000
were very useful.
And you know,

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,740
we can talk,
we can talk,

71
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,620
we can talk these things through.
So let's do it.

72
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,930
Excellent.
Bye.

73
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,293
Okay.
