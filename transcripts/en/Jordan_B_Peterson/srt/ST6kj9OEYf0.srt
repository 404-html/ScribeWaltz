1
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,520
Brilliant minds,
even mediocre minds operate better under

2
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,240
stimulus.

3
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,060
Canadian is a Canadian.
If you can't take away,

4
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,610
mama has systematically rebuild the 
trust of the world in our willingness to

5
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,810
work through the Security Council and 
other incidence rate.

6
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,400
You must not talk to anybody in the 
world,

7
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,950
any of our allies.
If whatever you want to call this system

8
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:53,660
a mafia state of feudal empire,
it's a disaster for ordinary Russians,

9
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,000
brilliant minds.
Even mediocre minds operate better under

10
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:09,780
stimulus.

11
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,440
Canadian is a Canadian.
If you can't take away

12
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,270
my has systematically rebuilt the trust 
of the world in our willingness to work 

13
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,060
through the Security Council and other 
institutions.

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,910
You must not talk to anybody in the 
world,

15
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,460
any of our allies,
if whatever you want to call this system

16
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,740
a mafia,
state of feudal empire,

17
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,130
it's a disaster for ordinary Russians.
I think that's the kind of hypocritical 

18
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,971
argument that if I were Chinese,
I find quite annoying for the Chinese 

19
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,520
leg can be described.
The in management,

20
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,480
science and religion are not 
incompatible.

21
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,440
We're indigenous forces,
nice people to do unkind things.

22
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,810
Amen.
Obsolete and my conclusion to this 

23
00:02:59,810 --> 00:02:59,810
question is,
no,

24
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,010
I won't let you be.
You show me your work pretext.

25
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,020
I quoted them saying,
show me how you can keep screaming and 

26
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,340
it doesn't change the point.
We do not want sympathy.

27
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,160
We do not want pity.
We want opportunities.

28
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,220
It's an appalling splenda to me,
to the Muslim religion.

29
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,730
I never said the word Muslim in my film 
nation.

30
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,570
It was a Muslim free foam in it.
Is that kind of restraint?

31
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,600
It is that kind of sober minded,
sensible,

32
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,180
intelligent,
foreign policy that Obama represents.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,110
So I guess what I'm telling you is he 
sort of a closet Canadian vote for him.

34
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,440
For God.

35
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,360
Ladies and gentlemen and welcome,
my name is right here,

36
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Griffis.
Since my privilege to have the 

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,400
opportunity to

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,650
moderates tonight's debate and to act as
your organizer,

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,360
I want to start by welcoming the North 
American wide television audience tuning

40
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:03,361
in right now across Canada on Seapak,
Canada's public affairs channel c span 

41
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:09,370
across the continental United States and
on CBC radio ideas,

42
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,810
a warm hello also to our online audience
watching this debate.

43
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,840
Over 6,000
streams active at this moment on 

44
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,160
facebook live on Bloomberg Dot Com and 
munk debates stock.

45
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:27,170
Com.
It's great to have you as virtual 

46
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,951
participants in tonight's proceedings 
and hello to you the over 3000 people 

47
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:34,360
who filled Roy Thompson Hall for yet 
another monk debate.

48
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,420
Thank you for your support for more and 
better debate on the big issues of the 

49
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,600
day.
This debate marks the start of our 10th 

50
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,541
season and we begin this season missing 
someone who was vital to this debate 

51
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:53,560
series in every aspect.
It was his passion for ideas,

52
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,420
his love for debate that inspired our 
creation in 2008,

53
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:02,830
and it was his energy,
his generosity and his drive that was so

54
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:07,831
important in allowing us to really win 
international acclaim as one of the 

55
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:11,950
world's great debating series,
his philanthropy.

56
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,570
It's legacy.
Wow.

57
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:15,130
It's incredible.
Last fall,

58
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:20,131
we all remember that $100,
million dollar donation to cardiac 

59
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:23,521
health here in Toronto,
transforming the lives of tens of 

60
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:23,521
thousands.

61
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:25,490
It's a million Canadians to come.

62
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,210
We're all big fans and supporters of a 
terrific school for global affairs on 

63
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,131
the UFT campus represented here tonight 
by many students are in a master's 

64
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:40,680
program.
Congratulations

65
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,190
you

66
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,430
also what a generous endowment last 
spring to this series that will allow us

67
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:54,050
to organize many evenings like this for 
many more years to come.

68
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,710
Now knowing our benefactor as we.
The last thing he'd want is for us to 

69
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,380
mark his absence with a moment of 
silence.

70
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,410
That wasn't his style,
so let's instead celebrate a great 

71
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,460
Canadian,
a great life,

72
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,950
and a great legacy of the late Peter 
Munk.

73
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,320
Bravo keytar.

74
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Thanks Peter.
Thanks.

75
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I know he would have enjoyed that and I 
want to just thank Melanie Anthony 

76
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Chainy for being here tonight to be part
of Peter's continuing positive impact on

77
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,940
public debate in Canada.
Thank you

78
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,080
for being here tonight.

79
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,060
Now,
knowing Peter as I did the first thing 

80
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,090
on his mind at this point in the debate 
would be right here.

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,520
Stop talking.
Get this debate underway.

82
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,920
Get our debaters out here.
Come on,

83
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,980
get the show on the road.
So we're going to do that right now 

84
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,120
because we have a terrific debate lined 
up for you this evening.

85
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,420
So let's introduce first our pro team 
arguing for tonight's motion.

86
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,170
Be it resolved what you call political 
correctness.

87
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
I call progress.
Please welcome to the stage.

88

Michael is debating.

94
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She's a columnist at the New York Times 
and someone who is going to bring a very

95
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,010
distinct and powerful perspective 
tonight.

96
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
Michelle Goldberg.
Michelle,

97
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,500
come on out.

98
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,900
Thank you.

99
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:39,590
So one great team of debaters deserves 
another and arguing against our 

100
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:45,411
resolution.
Be it resolved what you call political 

101
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,261
correctness.
I call progress is the Emmy Award

journalist,
poet,

105
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,850
and tonight debater.
Stephen Fry.

106
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,980
Thank you.

108
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:20,340
the big new international bestseller,
12 rules for life.

109
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,130
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Toronto's Jordan Peterson.

110
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,130
Thank you.
Okay,

111
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:36,420
we're

112
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,310
gonna.
Get our debate underway momentarily,

113
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,640
but first,
a quick checklist to go through.

114
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,470
We've got a hashtag tonight hash at munk
debates.

115
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:47,700
Those of you in the hall and those of 
you watching online,

116
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,210
please a win.
Let's get your opinions going.

117
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,570
Also,
for those of you watching online right 

118
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:56,570
now,
we have an ad running pole,

119
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,230
a ww munk debates.com.
Forward slash votes reflect,

120
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,260
input,
react to this debate as it unfolds over 

121
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,720
the next hour and a half.
Uh,

122
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:11,721
my favorite part aspect of this show 
that was Peter's brilliance and 

123
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:13,380
creation,
we have our countdown clock.

124
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,540
What this does is it keeps our debaters 
on their toes and our debate on time.

125
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,580
So when you see these clocks on the 
screen,

126
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:24,750
go down to zero,
wanted you to join me in a warm round of

127
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:29,751
applause and we'll have a debate that 
ends when it's supposed to end a.

128
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,380
now,
let's see,

129
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,870
we had our resolution tonight on the way
in.

130
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:41,871
We had this audience of roughly 3000 
people here in downtown Toronto vote on 

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
be it resolved or what you call it,
political correctness.

132
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,400
I call progress.
Let's see the agree,

133
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,260
disagree on that.
Number.

134
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,890
Thirty six percent agree.
Sixty four percent disagree.

135
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:57,891
So room and play.
Now we asked you how many of you are 

136
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,290
open to changing your vote over the 
course of debate?

137
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,820
Are you fixed,
agree,

138
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,270
disagree,
or could you potentially be convinced by

139
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:11,271
one or other of these two teams to move 
your vote over the next hour and a half?

140
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:14,700
Let's see those numbers now.
Wow.

141
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay.
A pretty open minded crowd.

142
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,801
This debate is very much in play and as 
per the agreed upon order of speakers.

143
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,110
I'm going to call and Michelle Goldberg 
first.

144
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,190
Michelle,
would you like I said,

145
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:26,640
well,
what are you gonna?

146
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:29,100
Have a sip of water before you start a 
column.

147
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:32,070
Michelle Goldberg first for her.
Six minutes of opening remarks.

148
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:34,800
Michelle,
thank you for having me.

149
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,140
And as I initially bumped a little bit 
at the resolution that we're debating 

150
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,190
because there are a lot of things that 
fall under the rubric of political 

151
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,800
correctness that I don't call a 
progress.

152
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,890
I don't like no platforming or twitter 
or trigger warnings.

153
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,070
Um,
you're like a lot of

154
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,070
middle aged liberals.
There are many aspects of students' 

155
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,010
social justice culture that I find off 
putting,

156
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,150
although I'm not sure that that 
particular generation gap is anything,

157
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
is anything new.
I'm on the record about the toxicity of 

158
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,240
social media,
call out culture,

159
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,910
and I think it's good to debate people 
whose ideas I don't like,

160
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,610
which is why I'm here.
Um,

161
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,010
so if there are social justice warriors 
in the audience,

162
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,530
I feel like I should apologize to you 
because I'm probably not.

163
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,760
You're probably gonna feel like I'm not 
adequately defending your ideas,

164
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,720
but the reason I'm on this side of the 
stage is that political correctness 

165
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,640
isn't just a term for left wing excesses
on college campuses or people being 

166
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,970
terrible on twitter,
especially as deployed by Mr Peterson.

167
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,010
I think it can be a way to diligence 
itemize any attempt for women and racial

168
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:50,011
and sexual minorities to overcome 
discrimination were even to argue that 

169
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,510
such discrimination is real in the New 
York Times today.

170
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,610
Mr Peterson says,
quote,

171
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,290
the people who hold that,
that our culture isn't an oppressive 

172
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,171
patriarchy.
They don't want to admit that the 

173
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:04,171
current hierarchy might be predicated on
competence.

174
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,330
That sounds particularly insane to me 
because I'm an American and our 

175
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:09,970
president is Donald Trump,
but um,

176
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:16,650
but it's an assumption that I think 
underlies a worldview in which any 

177
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,050
challenges to the current hierarchy are 
written off as political correctness.

178
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,860
I also think we should be clear that 
this isn't really a debate about free 

179
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:25,860
speech.
Um,

180
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,050
Mr Peterson once referred to what he 
called quote that evil trinity of 

181
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,170
equity,
diversity and inclusivity,

182
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,290
and said those three words,
if you hear people mouth those three 

183
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:37,290
words,
equity,

184
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,410
diversity,
and inclusivity,

185
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,440
you know who you're dealing with,
and you should step away from that 

186
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,931
because it is not acceptable.
He argues that the movie frozen is 

187
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:49,651
politically correct propaganda.
And at one point he floated the idea of 

188
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:54,421
creating a database of university course
content so students could avoid 

189
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:54,700
postmodern critical theory.

190
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,940
So in the criticism of political 
correctness,

191
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:02,941
I sometimes hear an urge or an attempt 
to purge our thought of certain 

192
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:08,281
analytical categories that mirrors,
I think the worst characatures of the 

193
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:13,501
social justice left,
that wants to get rid of anything that 

194
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:15,340
smacks of colonialism or patriarchy or 
white supremacy.

195
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,570
I also don't really think we're debating
the value of the enlightenment,

196
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,630
at least not in the way that somebody 
like Mr Frye.

197
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,190
Well,
I think as a champion of enlightenment,

198
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:29,191
values frames it,
the efforts to expand rights and 

199
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:32,341
privileges once granted just to land 
owning white heterosexual men is the 

200
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:36,640
enlightenment or is very much in keeping
with the enlightenment.

201
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,870
To quote a dead white man,
John Stuart Mill,

202
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,930
the despotism of custom is everywhere,
the standing hindrance to human 

203
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,190
advancement.
Um,

204
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,200
I think that some of our opponents by 
contrast frame challenges to the 

205
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,430
despotism of customs as politically 
correct attacks on a transcendent 

206
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,220
natural order.

207
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,240
To quote Mr Peterson again,
each gender,

208
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:04,640
each sector has its own unfairness to 
deal with.

209
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,360
But to think of it as a consequence of 
the shoulders of the social structure,

210
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:11,270
it's like,
come on really what about nature itself?

211
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,440
But there is an exception to this 
because he does believe in social 

212
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,860
interventions to remedy some kinds of 
unfairness,

213
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,280
which is why in the New York Times he 
calls for quote enforcement Origami to 

214
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,690
remedy the woes of men who don't get 
their equal distribution of sex.

215
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Um,
when it comes to the political 

216
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,631
correctness debate,
we've been exactly here before Alan 

217
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:39,340
Blum,
the author of the clothing of the 

218
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,691
American mind compared the tyranny of 
feminism in academia to the Khmer Rouge,

219
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,210
and he was writing at a time when women 
accounted for 10 percent of all college 

220
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,921
tenured faculty.
It's worth looking back at what was 

221
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:54,380
considered annoyingly outrageously 
politically correct in the 19 eighties.

222
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,450
The last time we had this debate,
you know,

223
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,020
having to call or not being able to call
indigenous people,

224
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,100
quote Indians are having to use 
hyphenated terms,

225
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,230
at least in the United States,
have terms like African Americans,

226
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,560
you know,
adding women or people of color to the 

227
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,331
western Civ curriculum.
Not Making gay jokes or using retard is 

228
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:16,190
an epithet.
And I kind of get it right.

229
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,220
New concepts,
new words sort of sticking your throat 

230
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,770
the way we're used to talking and 
thinking seem natural and normal,

231
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,660
you know,
by definition.

232
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,370
And then the new terms,
new concepts that have social utility 

233
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,110
stick and those that don't fall away.
So if you go back to the 19 seventies,

234
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,180
ms,
you know,

235
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,250
ms as an alternative to Mr Mrs stuck 
around and women with a y didn't.

236
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,140
Um,
and I think that some day I hope that 

237
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,531
someday we'll look back and marvel at 
the idea that gender neutral pronouns 

238
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,940
ever seen like an existential threat to 
anyone,

239
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,210
but I also don't think it's clear that,
you know,

240
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,170
that might not happen because if you 
look around the world right now,

241
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,770
there are plenty of places that have 
indeed dialed back cosmopolitanism and 

242
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:08,270
reinstated patriarchy in the name of 
staving off chaos.

243
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,840
And they seem like terrible places to 
live.

244
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,920
Um,
you know,

245
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:17,921
I come to you from the United States,
which is currently undergoing a 

246
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:22,511
monumental attempt to roll back social 
progress in the name of overcoming 

247
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,710
political correctness.
And as someone who lives there,

248
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,560
I assure you,
it feels nothing like progress.

249
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:27,980
Thank you.

250
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,430
Thank you.

251
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,280
Great.
Start to the debate,

252
00:17:39,281 --> 00:17:40,060
Michelle.
Thank you.

253
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,720
I'm now gonna.
Ask Jordan Peterson to speak for the con

254
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,270
team.

255
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,530
Hello.

256
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,470
So we should first decide what we're 
talking about.

257
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,840
We're not talking about my views of 
political correctness despite what you 

258
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,590
might have inferred from the last 
speaker's comments.

259
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,370
This is how it looks to me.
We essentially need something 

260
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,181
approximating a low resolution grant 
narrative to unitus and we did narrative

261
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,300
to united because otherwise we don't 
have peace.

262
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,040
What's playing out in the universities 
and in broader society right now is a 

263
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,940
debate between two fundamental low 
resolution narratives.

264
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,210
Neither of which can be completely 
accurate because they can't encompass 

265
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,241
all the details.
Obviously human beings have an 

266
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:35,241
individual element and a collect 
development.

267
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:40,190
A group element.
Let's say the question is what story 

268
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,491
should be paramount,
and this is how it looks to me in the 

269
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:46,680
West.
We have reasonably functional,

270
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:51,420
reasonably free,
remarkably productive stable hierarchies

271
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,750
that are open to consideration of the 
dispossessed that hierarchies generally 

272
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,620
create.

273
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Our societies are freer and functioning 
more effectively than any societies,

274
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,040
anywhere else in the world and that and 
then any societies ever have and as far 

275
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,061
as I'm concerned,
and I think there's good reason to 

276
00:19:14,061 --> 00:19:16,281
assume this,
it's because the fundamental low 

277
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,531
resolution,
a grant narrative that we've oriented 

278
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:22,401
ourselves around in the West is one of 
the sovereignty of the individual and 

279
00:19:22,401 --> 00:19:25,230
it's predicated on the idea that all 
things considered the best way for me to

280
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:30,231
interact with someone else's individual 
to individual and to react to that 

281
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:34,221
person as if they are both a part of the
process because that's the right way of 

282
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,651
thinking about it.
The psychological process by which 

283
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:40,320
things we don't understand can yet be 
explored and buy.

284
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:43,910
Things that aren't properly organized in
our society can be yet set.

285
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Right,
and the reason we're valuable as 

286
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,991
individuals,
both with regards to our rights and 

287
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:51,390
responsibilities,
is because that's our essential purpose.

288
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,060
Announce our nobility and that's our 
function.

289
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,840
What's happening as far as I'm concerned
in the universities in particular and 

290
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
spreading very rapidly out into the 
broader world,

291
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:02,850
including the corporate world,
much to.

292
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:07,851
It's a much to what should be its 
chagrin is a collectivist narrative and 

293
00:20:08,971 --> 00:20:12,840
of course there's some utility in a 
collectivist narrative because we're all

294
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:17,841
part of groups in different ways,
but the collectivist narrative that I 

295
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:21,980
regard as politically correct as a 
pastiche of a strange pastiche of 

296
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,680
postmodernism in neo Marxism in its 
fundamental claim is that no,

297
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,890
you're not essentially an individual.
You're essentially a member of a group 

298
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,980
and that group might be your ethnicity 
and it might be your sex and it might be

299
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:39,981
a race and it might be any of the 
endless numbers of other potential 

300
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:43,971
groups that you belong to because you 
belong to many of them and that you 

301
00:20:43,971 --> 00:20:47,961
should be essentially categorized along 
with those who are like you on that 

302
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:47,961
dimension in that group.

303
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:52,590
That's proposition number one.
Proposition number two is that the 

304
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,891
proper way to view the world is as a 
battle ground between groups of 

305
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:58,240
different power.
So you defined the groups first and then

306
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:03,241
you assume that you,
you view the individual from the group 

307
00:21:03,241 --> 00:21:04,810
context.
You viewed the battle between groups,

308
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:07,480
from the group context and you view 
history itself.

309
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,630
As a consequence of nothing but the 
power maneuvers between different 

310
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,020
groups,
that eliminates any consideration of the

311
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:19,021
individual and at a very fundamental 
level and also any idea,

312
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:24,031
for example,
of free speech because if you're 

313
00:21:24,031 --> 00:21:25,720
collectivist had heart in this manner,
there is no such thing as free speech.

314
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,320
It isn't that it's debated by those on 
the radical left and let's say the rest 

315
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,610
of us so to speak.
It's that in that formulation there's no

316
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,920
such thing as free speech because for an
individualist free speeches,

317
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,180
how you make sense of the world and 
reorganize society in a proper manner,

318
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,470
but for the radical left type 
collectivist that's associated with this

319
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:45,880
viewpoint of political correctness.

320
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,640
When you speak,
all you're doing is playing a power game

321
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:53,641
on behalf of your group and there's 
nothing else that you can do because 

322
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:56,850
that's all there is and not only is that
all there is in terms of who you are as 

323
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,990
an individual now and how society should
be viewed.

324
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,360
It's also the fundamental narrative of 
history.

325
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
For example,
it's.

326
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,240
It's widely assumed in our universities 
now that the best way to conceptualize 

327
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,870
Western civilization is as an oppressive
male dominated patriarchy and that the 

328
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,791
best way to construe relationships 
between men and women across the 

329
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,050
centuries is one of oppression of women 
by men as like,

330
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,340
well,
look,

331
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,560
no hierarchy is without it's tyranny.
That's a.

332
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,800
that's an axiomatic truth.
People have recognized that literally 

333
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,591
for thousands of years and hierarchies 
do tend towards tyranny and they tend 

334
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,450
towards the use of patient by people 
with power,

335
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,570
but that only happens when they become 
corrupt and we have mechanisms in our 

336
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,790
society to stop hierarchies from 
becoming intolerable.

337
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,790
He corrupted.
They actually work pretty well and so 

338
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:49,790
and so.
I would also.

339
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,550
I would also.
I would also point this out,

340
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,030
you know,
don't be thinking that this is a debate 

341
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,461
about whether empathy is useful or not 
or that the people on the con side of 

342
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:03,631
the argument are not empathetic.
I know perfectly well as I as an 

343
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:03,631
insured,
Mr Frye does that.

344
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:08,490
Hierarchies tend to produce situations 
where people stack up at the bottom and 

345
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,510
that the dispossessed and hierarchies 
need a political voice,

346
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:15,511
which is the proper voice of the left by
the way and the necessary voice of the 

347
00:23:15,511 --> 00:23:18,961
left,
but that is not the same as proclaiming 

348
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:21,661
that the right level of analysis for our
grand unifying narrative is that all of 

349
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:26,071
us are fundamentally to be identified by
the groups that we belong to and to 

350
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,961
construe the entire world has the 
battleground between different forms of 

351
00:23:30,961 --> 00:23:35,491
tyranny in consequence of that group 
affiliation and to the degree that we 

352
00:23:35,491 --> 00:23:38,110
play out that narrative that won't be 
progress.

353
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:43,111
Believe me,
and we certainly haven't seen that 

354
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,050
progress in the universities.
We've seen situations like what happened

355
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:46,220
at Wilfrid laurier.
Instead,

356
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
we won't see progress.
What will return to is exactly the same 

357
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,830
kind of tribalism to characterize the 
left.

358
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,960
Thank you,
Jordan.

359
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,680
Michael,
Eric Dyson.

360
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,270
Your six minutes starts now.
Thank you very kindly.

361
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,760
Wonderful opportunity to be here in 
Canada.

362
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,400
Thank you so much.
I'm going to stand here at the podium.

363
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:20,660
I'm a preacher and I will ask for an 
offering.

364
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:25,661
At the end of my presentation,
this is the swimsuit competition of the 

365
00:24:25,911 --> 00:24:30,911
intellectual beauty pageant,
so let me show you the curves of my 

366
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:32,720
fault.
Oh my God.

367
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,090
Was that a politically incorrect 
statement I just made?

368
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,950
How did we get to the point where the 
hijacking of the discourse on political 

369
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,671
correctness has become a kind of 
Mandakini distinction between us and 

370
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:50,620
them?
The abortive fantasy just presented is 

371
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,091
remarkable for both its clarity and yet 
the muddiness of the context from which 

372
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:58,850
it has emerged.
What's interesting to me is that when we

373
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:03,851
look at the radical left,
I'm saying where they I want to join 

374
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:03,950
them.
They didn't run enough,

375
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:08,951
and I'm from a country where a man 
stands up everyday to suite the moral 

376
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:11,840
mendacity of his viciousness into a 
nation.

377
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:13,630
He has turned into his psychic commode.

378
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,870
Y'All got Justin?
We got Donald.

379
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,210
So what's interesting then is that 
political correctness as transmogrified 

380
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,180
into a caricature of the left.
The left came up with the term political

381
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,070
correctness.
Shall I remind you,

382
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,390
we were tired of our excuses in our 
excesses and are exaggerations.

383
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,110
We were willing to be so critical in a 
way that I fear my confreres.

384
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,730
My compatriots are not.
Don't take yourself too seriously.

385
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:49,690
Smiles.
Take yourself seriously at all,

386
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:53,770
but what you do with deadly seriousness,
now it is transmogrified into an attempt

387
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:58,510
to characterize the radical left.
The radical left is a metaphor.

388
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:01,390
It's a symbol as an articulation.
They don't exist.

389
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:04,600
They're numbers are too small.
I'm on college campuses.

390
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,020
I don't see much of them coming.
When I hear about identity politics,

391
00:26:08,021 --> 00:26:12,010
that amazes me.
The collectivist identity politics,

392
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,960
uh,
last time I checked white folk have been

393
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:18,961
at race.
That was an invention from a dominant 

394
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:19,720
culture that wanted groups to at their 
behest,

395
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,080
the invention of race was driven by the 
demand of a dominant culture to 

396
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,380
subordinate others.
Patriarchy,

397
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,190
patriarchy.
Patriarchy was the demand of men to have

398
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:37,460
their exclusive vision presented.
The beauty of feminism is it's not going

399
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:39,700
to resolve differences between men and 
women.

400
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
It just sends me,
I don't automatically get the last word.

401
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,490
Of course they never did.
And so identity politics has been 

402
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,261
generated as a bet noir of the right and
yet the right doesn't understand the 

403
00:26:54,261 --> 00:26:58,791
degree to which identity has been 
foisted upon black people and Brown 

404
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,810
people and people of color from the very
beginning on women and Trans People.

405
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,960
You think that I want to be part of a 
group that is constantly at port by 

406
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,371
people at starbucks.
I'm minding my own business,

407
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,720
walking down the street.
I have group identity thrust upon me.

408
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,600
They don't say,
Oh,

409
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,940
there goes a negro.
Highly intelligent,

410
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,200
articulate,
verbose,

411
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,370
capable of rhetorical fury at the drop 
of a hat.

412
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,140
We should not interrogate him as to the 
bone of the days of his legal sentence.

413
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,140
No,
they treat me as part of a group.

414
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,650
And the problem is that our friends 
don't want to acknowledge is that the 

415
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,450
head Gemini,
that dominance of that group has been so

416
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:46,650
vicious that it is denied us the 
opportunity to exist as individuals.

417
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,250
Individualism is the characteristic 
moment in modernity.

418
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,850
Ms Dot Peterson is right.
The development of the individual.

419
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:58,851
However,
it's predicated upon notions of 

420
00:27:58,851 --> 00:27:58,851
intelligence in mind.
You a continent,

421
00:27:58,851 --> 00:27:58,851
David,
human,

422
00:27:58,851 --> 00:28:03,171
others philosophically cart descartes,
comes along introducing knowledge into 

423
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:08,151
the to the,
to the phrase saying that knowledge is 

424
00:28:08,151 --> 00:28:10,590
based upon the kind of reference to the 
golden intelligence,

425
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:15,591
the reflective glass at one possesses,
and yet they get rooted in the very 

426
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:18,330
ground of our existence,
so now it has fleshly basis and what I'm

427
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:23,331
saying to you,
the knowledge that I bring as a person 

428
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:25,851
of color makes a difference in my body 
because I know what people think of me 

429
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:30,350
and I know how they respond to me and 
that ain't no theory am I am I mad at 

430
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,410
trigger warnings?
Only trigger warning.

431
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:33,720
Got One is from a cop.
Are you about to shoot me?

432
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,930
Not Funny in America where young black 
people die repeatedly,

433
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,680
unarmed without provocation,
and so for me,

434
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,960
identity politics is something very 
serious.

435
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,000
And what's interesting about safe 
spaces,

436
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,180
I hear about the university,
I teach there.

437
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,450
Look,
if you in a safe space in your body,

438
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:57,510
you don't need a safe space.
Some of that is overblown.

439
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:59,190
Some of it is ridiculous.
I understand.

440
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:02,460
I believe that the classroom was a 
robust place for serious learning.

441
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,670
I believe in the interrogation of 
knowledge based upon our understanding 

442
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,290
mutually edifying proposition of 
enlightenment.

443
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,690
At the same time,
some people ain't as equal as others,

444
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,840
so we have to understand the conditions 
under which they have emerged and in 

445
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,070
which they have been benighted and 
attacked by their own culture,

446
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,970
and I ain't seen nobody be a bigger 
snowflake than white men who complain.

447
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Mommy,
Mommy won't let us play and have 

448
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,250
everything we used to have under the old
regime where we were right,

449
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,960
racist in some premises and dominant and
patriarchs and hated gays and lesbians.

450
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,670
Transsexuals that a,
yeah,

451
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:42,220
you gotta share this Angel World or 
about his world,

452
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,700
and let me hear it by saying this.
You remember that story from David 

453
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,690
Foster Wallace fish going down to fish 
or going into an older fish comes in the

454
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:51,250
opposite direction.
He said,

455
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:52,510
hello boys.
How's the water?

456
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,520
They swim on.
They turn each other.

457
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,100
What the Hell is water?
Because when you're in it,

458
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,960
you don't know it.
When you're dominant,

459
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:02,500
you don't know nothing.
Keyser soze he said is more interesting,

460
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,940
but the devil did then to make people 
believe he did

461
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,140
exist.

462
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,750
Thank you Michael.
Steven Europe.

463
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,730
So we're going to put six minutes on the
clock and please start again.

464
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,850
I'll try and be as quick as possible 
because if I miss that plane to London,

465
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:33,851
I went half here,
the end of it from the bridegroom's 

466
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:36,230
groom's mother.
In agreeing to participate in this 

467
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,810
debate and stand on this side of the 
argument,

468
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:46,811
I'm fully aware that many people who 
choose incorrectly in my view to to see 

469
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:51,010
this issue in terms of left and right,
devalued unexploded terms.

470
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,020
I think they will believe that I am 
portraying myself in such causes and 

471
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,490
values that I have espoused over the 
years.

472
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,170
I've been given a huge grief already 
simply because I'm standing here next to

473
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:08,410
Professor Peterson,
which is the very reason that I am 

474
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,741
standing here in the first place.
I'm standing next to someone with whom I

475
00:31:12,111 --> 00:31:17,111
have no differences,
shall we say in terms of politics and 

476
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:18,140
all kinds of other things.

477
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,210
Precisely because I think all this has 
got to stop this rage,

478
00:31:23,211 --> 00:31:24,530
resentment,
hostility,

479
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,870
hostility,
intolerance,

480
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,380
above all this,
um,

481
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:33,700
with us or against us.
Certainty at Grand Canyon has opened up 

482
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:35,710
in our world.
The fishier,

483
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,720
the crack grows wider every day.
Neither on each side can hear a word 

484
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,780
that the other shrieks and nor do they 
want to.

485
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:50,890
While these armies and propagandists in 
the culture wars clash down below in the

486
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:56,021
enormous space between the two sides,
the people of the world tried to get on 

487
00:31:56,021 --> 00:32:00,581
with their lives.
Alternative baffled board and betrayed 

488
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:03,350
by the horrible noises and explosions 
that echo all around.

489
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,710
I think it's time for this toxic binary,
zero some madness to stop before we 

490
00:32:10,041 --> 00:32:11,210
destroy ourselves.

491
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,900
The nail my colors to the mast before I 
get any further than this.

492
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,810
It's only polite to give you a sense of 
where I come from.

493
00:32:21,811 --> 00:32:25,210
I all my adult life,
I have been what you might call the left

494
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,220
ear,
a soft left liberal of the most hand 

495
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,220
wringing milk soap,
milk,

496
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,270
toast,
variety.

497
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,290
Not a burning man.
The barricades socialist,

498
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,690
not even really a progressive with the 
name.

499
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:43,050
I've been on marches,
but I've never quite dead wave placards 

500
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,160
or banners.
Um,

501
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,490
am I alluded member of that band,
the,

502
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,940
an Sjw,
a social justice warrior.

503
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:53,810
I don't think highly of social injustice
I have to say,

504
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:58,490
but I characterize myself mostly as a 
social justice warrior.

505
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,970
My intellectual heroes growing up were 
Bertrand Russell and Ge.

506
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,990
More liberal thinkers,
people like that.

507
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,030
Writers like am forced to.
I believed,

508
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:11,690
and I think I still do believe in the 
sanctity of human relations,

509
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,470
of the primacy,
of the heart and friendship and love and

510
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:16,520
common interest.

511
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:21,760
These are more personal interior beliefs
than they are political exterior 

512
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:27,731
convictions,
more humanistic version of a religious 

513
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:28,040
impulse.
I suppose.

514
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,530
I trust in humanity.
I believe in humanity.

515
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:35,531
I think I do,
despite all that has happened in the 40 

516
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:37,370
years of my adulthood,
I am soft and I can easily be swept away

517
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:42,371
by heart to hearts and harder intellect.
I'm sometimes surprised to be described 

518
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:47,171
as an activist,
but overtime I have energetically 

519
00:33:47,171 --> 00:33:47,750
involved myself with what you might call
causes.

520
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,610
I grew up knowing that I was gay.
Well,

521
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,590
in fact,
from the very first I knew I was gay.

522
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,110
I remember when I was born looking up 
and saying,

523
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,360
that's the last time I'm going up.
One of those.

524
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,420
I'm a,
I'm

525
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,110
Jewish.
I'm Jewish.

526
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,390
So I have a natural.
I was horror,

527
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,800
racism.
Um,

528
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,990
I naturally,
I want racism,

529
00:34:09,991 --> 00:34:11,340
misogyny,
homophobia,

530
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,410
transphobia,
xenophobia,

531
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:14,710
bullying,
bigotry,

532
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,090
intolerance of all humankind to end that
surely a given amongst all of us.

533
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,370
The question is how such a golden aim is
to be achieved.

534
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,640
My ultimate objection to political 
correctness is not that it combines so 

535
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:33,111
much of what I've spent a lifetime 
losing and opposing preachiness with 

536
00:34:33,111 --> 00:34:38,030
great respect,
piety a self righteousness heresy,

537
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,600
hunting,
denunciation,

538
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,800
shaming,
assertion without evidence,

539
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,850
accusation,
inquisition censoring.

540
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,370
That's not why I'm incurring the wrath 
of my fellow liberals by standing on 

541
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,301
this side of the house.
My real objection is that I don't think 

542
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:59,310
political correctness works.
I want to achieve,

543
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:04,311
I want to get to the Golden Hill,
but I don't think that's the way to get 

544
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,200
there.
Um,

545
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,700
I believe one of the greatest human 
failings is to prefer to be right,

546
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,840
than to be effective.

547
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,990
Political correctness

548
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:23,590
is always obsessed with how right it is 
without thinking of how effective it 

549
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:23,590
might,
it might be,

550
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,600
I wouldn't trust myself as a classical 
libertarian,

551
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,210
but I do relish transgression,
dive deeply and instinctively distrust 

552
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,600
conformity and orthodoxy.
Progress is not achieved by preachers 

553
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:41,370
and guardians of morality,
but to paraphrase,

554
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,880
you have Guinea Zim,
yachting by madmen hermits,

555
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,410
heretics,
dreamers,

556
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,480
rebels,
and skeptics.

557
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,100
I may be wrong.
I hope to learn this evening.

558
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,190
I really do think I may be wrong,
but I'm prepared to entertain the 

559
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:05,781
possibility that political correctness 
will bring us more tolerance and a 

560
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,180
better world,
but I'm not sure and I would like this 

561
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,141
quotation from my hair,
a Bertrand Russell to hover over the 

562
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,770
evening.
One of the painful things about our time

563
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,040
is that those who feel certainty are 
stupid and those within the imagination 

564
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:25,740
and understanding are filled with doubt 
and indecision.

565
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,060
Thank

566
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:41,330
great set of opening statements to set 
the scene.

567
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:46,331
We're now going to go into a round of 
rebuttals to allow each of our 

568
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:49,661
presenters three minutes to reflect on 
what they've heard and to make some 

569
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:52,130
additional points.
We're going to do that in the same order

570
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:53,390
that we had,
the opening statements.

571
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:55,100
So Michelle,
you're up first.

572
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,720
We'll put three minutes on the clock for
you.

573
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,230
So first I would say that I think that 
the attempt to draw a dichotomy between 

574
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:10,330
individual rights and group rights is a 
little bit misleading.

575
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,360
I'm traditionally,
there has been large groups of people 

576
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:20,701
who have not been able to exercise their
individual rights and I think that a lot

577
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,780
that the claims that are being made on 
behalf of what we politically correct 

578
00:37:27,251 --> 00:37:32,251
types call marginalized groups are 
claims that people who,

579
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,400
you know have identities that have not 
traditionally been at the center of our 

580
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:43,351
culture or been at the top of our 
hierarchies have as much right to 

581
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:47,821
exercise their individual talents and 
realize their individual ambitions.

582
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Right.
When we say that we want more women in 

583
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,311
power or more people of color's voices 
in the Canon or in the curriculum or you

584
00:37:57,891 --> 00:37:59,290
know,
pete directing movies.

585
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,470
All of these things or not,
because at least on my part,

586
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm interested in some sort of very 
crude equity,

587
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:10,561
but because there are a lot of people 
who have not traditionally been able to 

588
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,290
realize themselves as individuals,
that's what the women's movement was.

589
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:19,210
That's what the civil rights movement 
was.

590
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:24,211
That's what the gay rights movement was.
That's in some ways what the Trans 

591
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:24,211
Rights movement was.
I mean,

592
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:28,750
far from a collectivist movement.
This is kind of liberalism.

593
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,440
Classical liberalism pushed to its 
extreme right.

594
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,470
These are people saying,
I have the to define my identity against

595
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:40,900
the one that was collectively assigned 
to me.

596
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,700
Finally,
I would say,

597
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:47,701
you know,
a lot of the things that Stephen Fry 

598
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:47,701
said,
you know,

599
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,420
in particularly his temperament,
we're probably in agreement,

600
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,440
but this inquisition,
this censorious snus.

601
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,840
On the one hand,
I'm sort of,

602
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,790
I see where he's coming from,
but I think it's a little bit virtual,

603
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,730
right?
I mean,

604
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,990
no know who's,
who's really censoring you.

605
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Um,
I understand what it feels like to feel 

606
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,080
censored.
I understand what it feels like to be on

607
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,080
the wrong side of a twitter mob or get a
lot of nasty comments,

608
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,930
but,
and that's a bad feeling,

609
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,570
you know,
and it's a counterproductive tactic,

610
00:39:19,571 --> 00:39:21,720
but that's not censorship.
Um,

611
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,660
you know,
and again,

612
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,690
it's,
it's especially strange coming from a 

613
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,970
country where,
you know,

614
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,080
the president of the United States is 
trying to levy additional postal rates 

615
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:36,860
on the owner of the Washington Post,
you know,

616
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,880
in revenge for its reporting.
And people who have kneeled to protest 

617
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,741
police brutality at football games have 
seen their careers explode,

618
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,380
you know,
or people who have women who have 

619
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,811
challenged Mr Peterson has been hounded 
by threats and trolls and misogynists 

620
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,510
invective.
So

621
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,950
thank you Jordan.

622
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,440
We're going to have three minutes up on 
the screen there.

623
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,090
Please respond to what you've heard.
Well,

624
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:16,950
I guess I would like to set out a 
challenge in,

625
00:40:16,951 --> 00:40:21,520
in somewhat the same format as Mr Frye 
did to people on the moderate left.

626
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,600
I mean I've studied totalitarianism for 
a very long time,

627
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,930
both on the left and on the right in 
various forms.

628
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:33,931
And I think we've done a pretty decent 
job of determining when right wing 

629
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:39,931
beliefs become dangerous,
I think that they become dangerous when 

630
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:44,280
they,
in the people who stand on the right 

631
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,700
evoke notions of of racial superiority,
superiority or ethnic superiority,

632
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:50,701
something like that.
It's fairly easy to draw a box around 

633
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:51,190
them and place them to one side and 
necessary.

634
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,900
And I think we've done a pretty good job
of that.

635
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,300
What I failed to see happening on the 
left,

636
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:58,720
and this is with regards to the sensible
left because such a thing exists,

637
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,380
is for the same thing to happen with 
regards to the radical leftists.

638
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,880
Okay.
So here's an open question.

639
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,690
If it's not diversity,
inclusivity and equity as a triumvirate 

640
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:16,510
that mark out the to excessive left and 
with equity defined by the way,

641
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,750
not as equality of opportunity,
which is an absolutely laudable goal,

642
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,960
but as equality of outcome,
which is how it's defined then exactly 

643
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,160
how do we demarcate the two extreme 
left,

644
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,630
what do we do?
And we say,

645
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,090
well,
there's no such thing as the two extreme

646
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,290
left.
Well,

647
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,320
that's certainly something that 
characterizes much of intellectual 

648
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,330
thinking for the 20th century as our 
high order intellectuals,

649
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,030
especially in place like places like 
France did,

650
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:46,031
everything they could to bend over 
backwards to ignore absolutely 

651
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:48,881
everything that was happening in the 
catastrophic left world in the Soviet 

652
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,830
Union and China not least.
We've done a terrible job of determining

653
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,350
how to demarcate what's useful from the 
left,

654
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:59,351
from what's pathological and so it's 
perfectly okay for someone to criticize 

655
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,850
my attempts to identify something like a
boundary.

656
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,310
We could say diversity,
inclusivity and equity,

657
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:07,640
especially equity,
which is in fact equality of outcome,

658
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:11,450
which is an absolutely a boren notion.
If you know anything about history,

659
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:15,620
you know that and I'm perfectly willing 
to hear some reasonable alternatives,

660
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,380
but what I hear continually from people 
on the left,

661
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:20,270
first of all,
as my opponents did,

662
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:25,300
to construe every argument that is 
possibly able to be construed on the 

663
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,100
axis of group identification and it 
failed to defer to,

664
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,330
to fail to help the rest of us 
differentiate the reasonable left,

665
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:38,470
which stands for the oppressed 
necessarily from the pathological left 

666
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,980
that's capable of unbelievable 
destruction.

667
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,370
And what I see happening in the 
university campuses in particular where 

668
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,050
the left is absolutely predominate and 
that's certainly not my imagination.

669
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:53,051
That's that's well documented by 
perfectly reasonable people like 

670
00:42:53,051 --> 00:42:54,770
Jonathan Haidt is an absolute failure to
make precisely that distinction.

671
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,010
And I see the same thing tonight.
Thank you.

672
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Thank you.

673
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,820
Well,
give us your rebuttal.

674
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,490
Let me step out here.
And Peterson land.

675
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,070
Oh,
I feel free already.

676
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,550
I don't know what mythological 
collective Mr Peterson refers to.

677
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:31,211
I'm part of the left.
Their content garous when they have a 

678
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:33,080
firing squad,
is usually in a semicircle.

679
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,050
Part of the skepticism of rationality 
was predicated upon the enlightenment 

680
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:41,050
project,
which says,

681
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:45,080
we're no longer going to be subordinate 
to skepticism to superstition.

682
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:47,090
We're going to think and we're going to 
think,

683
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,150
well,
Thomas Jefferson was one of the great 

684
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,971
arbiters of rationality,
but he was also a man who was a slave 

685
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:55,850
owner.
How do you reconcile that?

686
00:43:55,851 --> 00:43:57,650
That's the complication I'm speaking 
about.

687
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:00,320
That's not either or.
That's not a collective identity.

688
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,930
Thomas Jefferson believed in the 
collective identity.

689
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:07,250
That is during the day at night,
he got some luther vandross songs,

690
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,050
went out to the slave quarter and 
engaged in sexual relations and had many

691
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:19,571
children with sally hemings his lines.
Trump is logic and when he hit talks 

692
00:44:20,811 --> 00:44:23,900
about postmodernism,
I don't know who he's talking about.

693
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:26,390
I teach.
Postmodernism is Kinda fun.

694
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,600
Jacques Derrida,
just to say his name is beautiful.

695
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,750
Michelle Michel.
Foucault talks about the insurrection of

696
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:36,060
subjugated knowledge is people who had 
been marginalized.

697
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,820
Now begin to speak.
The subaltern is gaietry.

698
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,860
Speeback talks about it in postcolonial 
theory.

699
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:46,130
The reason these people grew up and grew
into existence and had a voice is 

700
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:47,040
because they were denied.
As Ms Dot Goldberg said,

701
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,480
our group identity was foisted upon us.
We were not seen as individuals.

702
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,900
Babe Ruth,
when he broke the home run home run 

703
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,331
record.
He didn't bat against all basketball 

704
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:01,741
players.
He batted against the best white 

705
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:01,741
ballplayers.
When it's been rigged in your favor from

706
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,180
the very beginning,
it's hard for you to understand how much

707
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:03,630
you've been.
Rick,

708
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:04,920
you're born on third base.
Thank you.

709
00:45:04,921 --> 00:45:09,570
Hit a triple at the Toronto Blue Jays 
game,

710
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,640
and here we are deriving our sense of 
identity from the very culture that we 

711
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,451
ignore.
Look at the indigenous names and the 

712
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:20,451
first nation names,
Toronto,

713
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:21,810
Saskatchewan,
Winnipeg,

714
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,740
Tim Horton's,

715
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,930
but I'll tell you,
there's an envy of the kind of freedom 

716
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,251
and liberty that people of color and 
other minorities bring because we bring 

717
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:40,211
the depth of knowledge in our body.
There's a kind of jealousy event as the 

718
00:45:40,211 --> 00:45:42,830
greatest living Canadian philosopher 
Aubrey Drake Graham says,

719
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:46,040
jealousy is just love and hate at the 
same time,

720
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,550
and so for me,
I think it's necessary.

721
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:54,551
I agree with Mr Frye.
We shouldn't be nasty and combative and 

722
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,430
yet I don't see nastiness and 
combativeness from people.

723
00:45:55,431 --> 00:46:00,431
I see them making a desire to have their
individual identities respected.

724
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,800
When I get shot down,
for no other reason that I'm black,

725
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,680
when I get categorized for no other 
reason than my color,

726
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,370
I am living in a culture that refuses to
see me as a great individual.

727
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:22,120
Yeah,

728
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:31,660
no,
it's interesting to hear that there 

729
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:34,050
doesn't seem to be a problem,
but yet I think we all instinctively 

730
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,800
know that there is some kind of problem.
There isn't sentence censorship ship,

731
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:38,560
of course.
Not In the way that there is in Russia.

732
00:46:38,561 --> 00:46:41,390
I've been to Russia,
I've faced off with the,

733
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:46,730
uh,
deeply homophobic as unpleasant man and 

734
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,081
there's political correctness in Russia 
is just political correctness on the 

735
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:49,330
right.
And that's what I grew up with,

736
00:46:49,331 --> 00:46:54,331
political correctness,
which meant that you couldn't say 

737
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:54,430
certain things on television,
couldn't say fuck,

738
00:46:54,431 --> 00:46:59,431
for example,
on television because it was incorrect 

739
00:46:59,431 --> 00:47:02,790
to do so.
And there's always the same reason was 

740
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,550
that someone would appear and say,
I'm not shocked.

741
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,120
Oh,
of course.

742
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:04,980
No,
I'm not shocked.

743
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,230
I'm not offended.
I'm offended on behalf of others.

744
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:10,990
Young,
impressionable plastic minds,

745
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,630
the vulnerable.
And that's not good enough.

746
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:14,350
It's,
it's.

747
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,600
So often people are saying,
see,

748
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,000
I don't mind being called a faggot or a 
cake or whatever,

749
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,610
blue or mad person because they've got 
mental health issues.

750
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:23,620
I don't mind people insulting me and 
people say,

751
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,610
well,
that's all right for you,

752
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,620
Steven,
because you're new.

753
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:31,621
You're strong like I don't feel 
particularly strong and I don't know 

754
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:32,770
that I like being called a faggot and 
the kite particularly,

755
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,160
but I don't believe that the advances in
my culture that have allowed me to marry

756
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:42,130
as I have now been for three years to 
someone of my gender.

757
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:47,820
I don't believe they are a result of 
political correctness and maybe 

758
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,271
political correctness is actually just 
some sort of live trout that the harder 

759
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,530
we squeeze it,
the further it goes away and you will be

760
00:47:53,531 --> 00:47:55,330
saying,
I'm not talking about physical retinas.

761
00:47:55,331 --> 00:48:00,331
You're talking about social justice with
which I agree with where they want to 

762
00:48:00,331 --> 00:48:00,980
call it identity politics or the history
of your people.

763
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,430
In the history of my people,
my people were slaves as well.

764
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:08,550
Both the British were slaves of Romans 
and the Jews were slaves to the 

765
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,311
Egyptians.
All human beings have been slaves at 

766
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:13,840
some point and we all in that sense 
share that knowledge of how important it

767
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:18,841
is to speak up,
but Russell means who was a friend of 

768
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:19,060
mine,
who was the one who founded the American

769
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,320
Indian movement.
He said,

770
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,520
oh,
I forgot to call me an Indian or a 

771
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:25,520
Lakota Sioux or Russell,
I don't care what you call me.

772
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,890
It's how we're treated.
That matters,

773
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,190
and so I'm really addressing a more 
popular idea.

774
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,270
Also actually in Barrow,
Alaska and Inupiaq said,

775
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:41,271
call me an Eskimo.
It's obviously easier for you because 

776
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:44,271
you keep mispronouncing Inupiaq in a 
words do matter.

777
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:50,130
I'll just end with a quick story.
A gay rights came about in England 

778
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,340
because we slowly in persistently 
knocked on the door of people in power.

779
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,990
We didn't shout.
We didn't scream.

780
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:00,230
People like Ian mckellen eventually got 
to see the prime minister and when the 

781
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,561
Queen signed in the royal assent,
she has to for the bill allowing 

782
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:05,340
equality of marriage.
She said,

783
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:06,420
Lord,
you know,

784
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,650
I couldn't imagine this in 1953.
Really is extraordinary,

785
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:16,800
isn't it?
Just wonderful and handed it over.

786
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,200
Now that's a nice story and I hope it's 
true,

787
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,660
but it's nothing to do with political 
correctness.

788
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:24,180
It's to do with human decency.
It's that simple.

789
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Thank you.
Great

790
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,540
rebuttals.
They're strong opening statements.

791
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,000
Let's move now into the,
uh,

792
00:49:38,001 --> 00:49:43,001
the moderated,
a cross examination portion of this 

793
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:46,191
debate and get both sides engaging on 
some of the key issues here.

794
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,700
And I think what we've heard here is a 
bit of a attention.

795
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,620
Let's draw it out a bit more between,
uh,

796
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,530
the rights of groups to feel included,
to have,

797
00:49:55,531 --> 00:49:56,430
in your words,
Michelle,

798
00:49:56,431 --> 00:50:00,900
the opportunity for individuality and a 
belief on the other side that,

799
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,130
uh,
there's something,

800
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:07,131
a threat here when these groups are 
overly privileged through affirmative 

801
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:10,260
action or other outcome oriented 
processes.

802
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,300
So Michael,
to start with you,

803
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:17,670
why,
why isn't there just harm that's done to

804
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:21,300
groups by privileging their group 
identity,

805
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,990
whether it be a group identity of race 
or gender and not immediately treating 

806
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,070
them as,
and the way that

807
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,710
Jordan and Steven would like to see you 
see them.

808
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:32,630
First will,
a couple of things.

809
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:37,631
First of all,
there was no arbitrary and random 

810
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,580
distinction that people of color and 
other minority groups made when I talked

811
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,250
about the invention of race,
the invention of gender,

812
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:48,251
the invention of group think that was 
not done by those groups that have been 

813
00:50:48,251 --> 00:50:50,840
so named as Ms Dot Goldberg said,
so first of all,

814
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:55,841
you've got to acknowledge the historical
evolution of that reality and the 

815
00:50:55,841 --> 00:50:57,890
concept of group identity did not begin 
with them.

816
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,040
It began with a group that didn't have 
to announce its identity.

817
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,370
When you are in control,
you don't have to announce who you are 

818
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:09,550
so that many white brothers and sisters 
don't see themselves as one among many 

819
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,550
other ethnicities or groups.
What they see themselves as,

820
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,050
I'm just American,
I'm Canadian.

821
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:13,070
Can't you be like us?

822
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:18,310
Can't you transcend those narrow group 
identifications and yet those group 

823
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:22,511
identifications have been imprinted upon
them by the very people who now because 

824
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:25,040
they are their group power has been 
challenged.

825
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,170
Let's make no mistake about it.
There is a challenge.

826
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,270
I,
I agree with Mr.

827
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:34,270
Fry in a kind of neverland of how sweet 
it would be to have a kingly and cleanly

828
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,760
a metaphor about how it got resolved.
That ain't the real deal,

829
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:41,990
homie and in the real world and it and 
in the real world,

830
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:45,020
there's stuff at stake.
What's at stake or bodies?

831
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:46,960
What's at stake or people's lives?
What's a sake?

832
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:49,070
People are still being lynched,
killed what's at stake.

833
00:51:49,071 --> 00:51:54,071
People because of their sexuality and 
their racial identity are still being 

834
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:54,200
harmed,
so I'm suggesting to you,

835
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,830
it's not that we are against being 
treated as individuals.

836
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:02,831
That's what we're crying for.
Please don't see me as a member of a 

837
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:03,260
group that you think is a thug,
a nigger,

838
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,960
a nihilist,
a pathological person.

839
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,780
See me as an individual who embodies the
reality is if you are,

840
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,790
but I'll end by saying this.
What Michelle said is extremely 

841
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,591
important.
The people who have individual rights 

842
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:21,420
didn't have to fight for them in the 
same manner that people of color and 

843
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:24,800
others have had to.
When Mr Fried talked about enslavement,

844
00:52:24,801 --> 00:52:29,300
he named them read Orlando Patterson's 
comparative history of race and slavery.

845
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,260
Over 28 civilizations,
the Greeks did not have the same kind of

846
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:36,890
slavery that Americans said it was 
chattel slavery in Greece.

847
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:38,840
You could buy back your,
your your freedom.

848
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:44,110
You could teach the children of the 
people who enslaved you and because of 

849
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:47,060
your display of prodigious intellect,
you could secure your freedom.

850
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,120
That was not the case.
You were punished and killed for 

851
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,360
literacy in America,
so my point simply is this,

852
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:58,720
is that I am all for the celebration of 
broader identities and I think that 

853
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:03,200
often those who are minorities and 
others are not celebrated for the degree

854
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,220
that we are out in.

855
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,030
By saying this in America,
we have the confederate flag.

856
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,410
I don't know if y'all are familiar with 
that.

857
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,660
We have a confederate flag.
We have white guys mostly in the south,

858
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:19,690
but others as well,
flagging those confederate flags that 

859
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,110
are part of the south that refuse to 
seed.

860
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,800
It's legitimate.
A conquest at the hands of the.

861
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,560
There has been a politics of resentment.
Every you talking about politics of 

862
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,440
identity wearing that flag,
not the American flag.

863
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:34,620
They are not American.
They are celebrating a succession.

864
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:39,920
A move away from America and a man named
Colin Kaepernick who was a football 

865
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:44,811
player saying,
I want to bring beauty to that flag has 

866
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:49,011
been denied opportunity,
so we have to really set the terms of 

867
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:49,410
debate in order.
Before we.

868
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:50,920
We proceed.
Thank you.

869
00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:57,300
Jordan.
Let's have you jump in on this idea of,

870
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:57,850
of

871
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,880
what you see as the pernicious danger of
group think when it comes to ethnicity,

872
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,360
when it comes to gender.
Why do you think that that's one of the 

873
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,690
primal sins in your view of of political
correctness?

874
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:15,230
Well,
I think it's one of the primal sins of 

875
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:15,230
identity politics players on the left 
and the right.

876
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:19,260
Just to be clear about that personally,
since this has got personal at times,

877
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:23,860
I'm no fan of the identitarian right.
I think that anybody who plays a game of

878
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,990
conceptual game where group identity 
comes first and foremost,

879
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:32,991
risks and exacerbation of tribalism,
it doesn't matter whether it's on the 

880
00:54:32,991 --> 00:54:35,280
left or the right with regards to the 
idea of group.

881
00:54:35,281 --> 00:54:36,140
Right?
Well,

882
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,180
there's a fundamental,
and this is something we've fallen into 

883
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:41,880
terribly in Canada,
not least because we had to contend with

884
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:46,881
the threat of Quebec separatism,
but the idea of group writes is 

885
00:54:46,881 --> 00:54:50,631
extraordinarily problematic because the 
the verse of the coin of individual 

886
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:56,751
rights as individual responsibilities 
and you can hold an individual 

887
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,051
responsible and an individual can be 
responsible and so that's partly why 

888
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:02,940
individuals have rights,
but groups.

889
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,230
How do you hold a group responsible?
I mean the whole idea is not.

890
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:10,800
It's not a good idea to hold a group 
responsible if first of all,

891
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:15,801
it flies in the face of the idea of the 
sort of justice systems that we've laid 

892
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:19,581
out in the West that are essentially 
predicated first on the assumption of 

893
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:22,821
individual innocence,
but also on the possibility of 

894
00:55:22,821 --> 00:55:22,821
individual guilt,
not group guilt.

895
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,140
We saw what happened in the 20th century
many,

896
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:28,390
many times when the idea of group guilt 
was it was it.

897
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,960
It was enabled to get a foothold,
let's say,

898
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:34,650
in the policy and in the justice system 
was absolutely catastrophic and so,

899
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:36,480
okay,
fine group rights,

900
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,620
well,
what are you gonna?

901
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,570
How are you going to contend with the 
alternative to that,

902
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:44,571
the opposite of that,
or where's the group responsibility and 

903
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:48,810
how are you going to keep,
how are we going to hold your group's 

904
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:48,810
responsible?
Well,

905
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,041
we don't have to talk about that because
we're too concerned with rectifying 

906
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:54,450
hypothetical rep rectifying historical 
injustices,

907
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:59,451
hypothetical and otherwise,
and that's certainly not to say that 

908
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:02,010
there weren't any shortage of absolutely
catastrophic historical injustices.

909
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:07,220
That's not the point.
The point is how you view the situation 

910
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,331
at the most fundamental level and group 
rights are absolute catastrophe in my 

911
00:56:11,331 --> 00:56:11,580
opinion.
Come on,

912
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,290
Michelle

913
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,710
point.
Is this something you've written about?

914
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,950
The idea that in identity politics,
the identity of the group is absolutely 

915
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:29,281
a valid part of the discourse and and 
individuals could and should be seen and

916
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:32,500
participate in groups as they enter into
the civic space.

917
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,110
I'm not sure for

918
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:39,110
that.
We necessarily have to analogize from 

919
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:39,110
individual the,
you know,

920
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,970
the opposite of individual rights is 
individual responsibility.

921
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:45,840
I'm not sure that that analogy 
necessarily holds for the groups.

922
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:46,770
I mean,
in,

923
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:51,950
in the United States,
and one of the things that I think is 

924
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,691
complicated about this discussion is 
that we're talking about three very 

925
00:56:53,691 --> 00:56:54,630
different cultural context,
three different histories,

926
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:59,250
three different kinds of legal regimes.
But in the United States,

927
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:04,340
I'm a great,
a huge part of our politics has been 

928
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,860
groups struggling for rights for their 
individual members.

929
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:10,980
Right?
I mean,

930
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,460
so women in the United States,
you know,

931
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,790
seeking the right to reproductive 
control of their body,

932
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:19,020
um,
you know,

933
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,200
African Americans in the United States 
seeking redress from police brutality or

934
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:31,491
discrimination or simply the kind of 
tendency in America of white people to 

935
00:57:32,311 --> 00:57:37,311
call the police whenever they see an 
African American in a place where they 

936
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:37,311
don't think that they're supposed to be.

937
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,160
And you simply.
I don't see how you can contend with any

938
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:46,161
of those social problems if you see 
society as just an ocean of atomized 

939
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:47,630
individuals.
Um,

940
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:49,850
you know,
and again,

941
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,440
I,
I,

942
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,690
I don't,
I don't think there's anything 

943
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:58,521
pernicious about people banding together
on the basis of their common identity to

944
00:58:01,621 --> 00:58:05,760
seek redress for discrimination and 
exclusion.

945
00:58:05,761 --> 00:58:10,761
I mean,
I think that that is everything that's 

946
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:12,681
best about our democracy,
that is the definition of progress.

947
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:15,340
And so again,
I just,

948
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:20,390
I keep stumbling with the idea that this
is somehow tyrannical or that way lies 

949
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,050
stolen ism.
Um,

950
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:26,850
and you know,
a lot of times people who are opposed to

951
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:31,150
political correctness talk about the 
concept of category creep or is it,

952
00:58:31,151 --> 00:58:32,020
is it kept not?
No.

953
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:34,140
Yeah,
Category Creek,

954
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:39,060
which is a concept that was originated 
by a believer in Australian academic and

955
00:58:39,061 --> 00:58:42,180
it's basically kind of a failure to draw
distinctions,

956
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:42,660
right?

957
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:47,660
So that you kind of can't see the 
difference between say a KKK grand 

958
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:52,770
wizard and a conservative like say Ben 
Shapiro or you know,

959
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:57,070
that you kind of see everybody to your 
right as you know,

960
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,760
fascist,
sexist to Tala,

961
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:04,761
Terry and intolerable.
And I think that that is a real thing 

962
00:59:04,761 --> 00:59:05,760
that happens in part because,
you know,

963
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:10,761
undergraduates often thinking broad and 
slightly overwrought categories.

964
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:14,190
I know I did when I was,
when I was a kid.

965
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,180
Um,
yeah,

966
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:16,200
maybe they'll do,
but,

967
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,030
but I,
I hear a lot of category creep in,

968
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:26,080
again,
the argument against political 

969
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,791
correctness or against seeking group 
redress the idea that kind of that way 

970
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,500
lies dehumanization or you know,
that you're kind of one minute,

971
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:30,880
you're asking

972
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:31,620
what's up,
steven?

973
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:33,640
Come in on this part of your opening 
remarks.

974
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,050
Your,
you're a category creep.

975
00:59:35,051 --> 00:59:37,470
Steven didn't respond to that.
It's a nice.

976
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:42,590
I'm,
I'm still very lost about why we aren't 

977
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,230
talking about political correctness.
We're talking about politics and the.

978
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:44,520
That's fine.

979
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:53,780
Shared exactly what you think about it.
I'm not an enemy of identity politics 

980
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:58,191
per se.
I can obviously see where it goes wrong 

981
00:59:58,191 --> 00:59:58,500
and where it's annoying.
Let's be empirical about this.

982
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,320
How well is it working for you in 
America at the moment?

983
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:02,760
Not well at all.

984
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:06,230
Really isn't.
You can ask me in a moment.

985
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:12,080
The reason,
the reason that trump and brexit in 

986
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,321
Britain and all kinds of nativist all 
over Europe and succeeding is not the 

987
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:18,951
time for the right.
It's the catastrophic failure of the 

988
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:18,951
left.

989
01:00:18,951 --> 01:00:22,800
It's our fault.
My point is

990
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:30,250
that I turned to the right or anything 
like that or that I'm nice and fluffy 

991
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:30,830
and want everybody to be decent.
I'm saying,

992
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,420
fuck,
political correctness.

993
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,290
Resist fight.
If you have a point of view,

994
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,330
fight it in the proper manner.
Using democracy shouldn't be not channel

995
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:42,330
of education,
not language.

996
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,970
It's so silly.

997
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:51,110
There's a rule you know in chess,
the best move to playing chess is not 

998
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:55,500
the best chess move.
It's the move your opponent least wants 

999
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:57,970
you to play at the moment you're being 
recruiting sergeant for the right,

1000
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,880
annoying and upsetting,
and instead of fighting either fighting 

1001
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,080
or persuading,
but political correctness is a middle 

1002
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:08,440
course that simply doesn't work well.
First of all,

1003
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,430
be empirical,
empirical,

1004
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,520
as far as I know the word means that 
which can be verified and falsified 

1005
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,230
through the sense executive,
so if we look at it in an objective way,

1006
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:23,770
the reality is that people don't have 
equal access to the means to articulate 

1007
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,840
that very moment.
You're talking about,

1008
01:01:24,841 --> 01:01:28,130
I'm talking about the empirical results 
of this political attitudes.

1009
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,410
I understand that,
but my point is simply this,

1010
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,890
I'm suggesting to you that people use 
the weapons at hand.

1011
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,040
Now it was apprehend Joshua Heschel,
rabbi,

1012
01:01:37,041 --> 01:01:40,250
who said everybody's not guilty,
but everybody's responsible,

1013
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,050
right?
That's a distinction there.

1014
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,500
Everybody clearly is not guilty,
but what's interesting,

1015
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,520
look at the flip side.
If you have benefited from 300 years of 

1016
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,310
holding people in servitude thinking 
that you did it all on your own,

1017
01:01:52,311 --> 01:01:53,560
why can't these people work harder?

1018
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,060
Let me see.
For 300 years you ain't had no job.

1019
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,450
So the reality is for 300 years you old 
people in the bands,

1020
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,690
you hold them insubordination,
you refuse to give them rights.

1021
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:06,260
Then all of a sudden you free them and 
say you're now individuals.

1022
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:11,410
Not having the skills reflect,
literally not having skills receptive 

1023
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:13,160
about America.
First of all,

1024
01:02:13,161 --> 01:02:14,870
I'm talking about American society.
First of all,

1025
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:16,460
I'm talking about the northern 
hemisphere.

1026
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:19,500
I'm talking about every society where 
enslavement has existed,

1027
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:24,501
but I'm speaking specifically of the 
repudiation of individual rights among 

1028
01:02:24,501 --> 01:02:29,301
people of Color in America who were 
denied the opportunity to be 

1029
01:02:29,301 --> 01:02:30,000
individuals.
So I see.

1030
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:34,590
I obviously and ideally that Michelle 
Goldberg does to agree with the emphasis

1031
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:37,350
on individuals.
What we're saying to you is that we have

1032
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:42,351
not been permitted to be individuals.
We have not been permitted to exercise 

1033
01:02:42,351 --> 01:02:45,450
our individual autonomy and authority 
and the refusal to do so.

1034
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:49,170
To recognize me as an individual means 
when you roll up on me and I'm a 12 year

1035
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:54,171
old boy in a park and you shoot first in
ways you do the black kids that you 

1036
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:58,731
don't do the white kids.
You are not treating that person as an 

1037
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:00,060
individual.
If we're living in a society where women

1038
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:05,210
are subject to abberant forms of horrid 
to patriarchal,

1039
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:09,450
sexist and massaged his behavior.
You are not acknowledging the centrality

1040
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:13,850
of the individuality of women.
You are treating them according to eight

1041
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:18,851
group dynamic and if we.
If we get beyond the ability of people 

1042
01:03:18,851 --> 01:03:23,421
on the right to understand the degree to
which they have operated from the basis 

1043
01:03:23,421 --> 01:03:26,450
of benefit from group identity without 
having said it,

1044
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:28,590
by saying this,
the great American philosopher,

1045
01:03:28,591 --> 01:03:33,591
beyonce knowles say it,
that it has been said that racism is so 

1046
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:36,990
American.
That if you challenge racism,

1047
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,150
you look like you're challenging 
America.

1048
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:44,040
We are challenging inequality,
we are challenging the refusal to see me

1049
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,830
as an individual when we overcome that.
Have added.

1050
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,430
We're all on here.

1051
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,970
Just getting started here.
A couple of questions.

1052
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:57,971
So let's let her sites folks are going 
to go to Jordan then to us assume for a 

1053
01:03:57,971 --> 01:03:59,900
moment that I benefited from my white 
privilege.

1054
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,570
Okay.
So let's assume that that's fine.

1055
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,610
Yeah.
Well that's what you would say.

1056
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:05,970
So,
um,

1057
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:06,990
so let's

1058
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,750
here.
Let's get precise this.

1059
01:04:09,751 --> 01:04:14,751
Okay.
Was that into very individual you let's 

1060
01:04:14,751 --> 01:04:14,830
get precise about this.
Okay.

1061
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,470
He's good.
Precise

1062
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:20,740
degree.
Is My present present level of 

1063
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:22,190
attainment or achievement?
A consequence of my white privilege.

1064
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,640
And I don't mean sort of.
I mean do you mean five percent?

1065
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:28,940
Do you mean 15 percent?
Do you mean 25 percent?

1066
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,640
Do you mean 75 percent?
And what do you propose?

1067
01:04:31,641 --> 01:04:33,830
I do about it.
How about a tax?

1068
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,540
How about a tax that's like specialized 
for me so that I can account for my damn

1069
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,480
privilege.
You said that.

1070
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:40,910
I thought about it.

1071
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:44,380
Now let's get precise about one other 
thing.

1072
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,240
Okay.
We'll get precise.

1073
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,950
How about one other thing?
Their sites?

1074
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,220
Yeah.
Precise.

1075
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:50,930
Precise,
yes.

1076
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:55,370
So if,
if we can agree and we haven't,

1077
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:59,000
that the left can go too far,
which it clearly can't.

1078
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:04,340
Then how would my worthy opponents 
precisely defined when the left that 

1079
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:07,580
they stand for has gone too far.
You didn't like equity,

1080
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,830
equality of outcome.
I think that's a great marker.

1081
01:05:09,831 --> 01:05:13,520
But if you have a better suggestion and,
and won't sidestep the question.

1082
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:18,690
So let's figure out how I can dispense 
with my white privilege and so that you 

1083
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:18,690
can tell

1084
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:20,710
me when the left has gone too far since 
they clearly can.

1085
01:05:21,070 --> 01:05:23,530
And that's what this debate is about,
about political correctness.

1086
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,820
It's about the left going too far and I 
think it's gone too far in many ways and

1087
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:29,980
I'd like to figure out exactly how and 
when.

1088
01:05:29,981 --> 01:05:34,981
So the reasonable left could make it's a
sentence again and we could quit all 

1089
01:05:34,981 --> 01:05:34,981
this nonsense.

1090
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:35,760
Okay.

1091
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:47,470
I will answer you,
but I just want to answer first because 

1092
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:47,470
you talked about,
you know,

1093
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,990
this is how we got trump and this is the
failure of the left.

1094
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:53,991
And so I know I'm a journalist.
I went to a ton of trump rallies during 

1095
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:57,180
the campaign in different parts of the 
country and you're right,

1096
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:02,210
everywhere I went,
I heard complaints about political 

1097
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:02,210
correctness,
you know,

1098
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,810
far more than I heard complaints about 
say Nafta.

1099
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,840
But when you asked people what they 
meant by political correctness,

1100
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:14,990
you know,
they call it a woman that worked with 

1101
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:14,990
girl and she got mad at them and you 
know,

1102
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,650
they could,
you know,

1103
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:20,660
you couldn't in public wonder aloud 
whether the president of the United 

1104
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:20,980
States was really a Muslim.
Um,

1105
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,860
you know,
they didn't like that they couldn't make

1106
01:06:22,861 --> 01:06:25,230
gay jokes anymore.
And so on the one hand,

1107
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,550
you're right,
and I've written about this.

1108
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,530
I think that when you try to suppress 
that,

1109
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:35,540
when people have these prejudices and 
you try to suppress them,

1110
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,020
it can create a kind of dangerous 
counter reaction.

1111
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,370
But I also think that,
you know,

1112
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,580
what they were reacting to.
Again,

1113
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:46,260
to go to,
go back to the title of this debate,

1114
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:47,950
what they called political correctness,
you know,

1115
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:52,970
the fact that they had to have this 
urbain black president who they felt 

1116
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:54,750
talked down to that,
which is really what they meant.

1117
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,590
I don't see a way around that because 
that is,

1118
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,240
like I said,
that's progress.

1119
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,060
Um,
so to go to the,

1120
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,130
to the question of when the left goes 
too far,

1121
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:10,131
I mean,
to me it's pretty easy violence and 

1122
01:07:10,131 --> 01:07:10,131
censorship,
right?

1123
01:07:10,131 --> 01:07:14,641
I'm big against violence and I'm against
censorship the.

1124
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:19,820
But I also looking around the world 
right now when the idea that there is 

1125
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,330
this,
I understand again,

1126
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:28,860
there is like a problem of kind of left 
wing annoyance,

1127
01:07:28,890 --> 01:07:29,190
right?

1128
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:32,160
There's a lot of things that kind of 
people,

1129
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:37,220
random people on the internet in 
particular are able to swarm individuals

1130
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:43,320
and turn kind of stray remarks and just 
social media campaigns.

1131
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:48,410
And this is often conflated with 
political correctness and it's a bad 

1132
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:52,161
phenomenon.
I wish there was a way to put an end to 

1133
01:07:52,161 --> 01:07:54,591
it.
I don't think there is no way to put an 

1134
01:07:54,591 --> 01:07:55,740
end to it simply by having kind of 
reasonable liberals are reasonable.

1135
01:07:55,741 --> 01:08:00,741
Socialists denounce it because it's just
a kind of awful phenomenon of modern 

1136
01:08:01,141 --> 01:08:06,141
life and if you want to have a debate 
about whether social media is terrible 

1137
01:08:06,141 --> 01:08:07,740
for democracy,
I will be on the gay side.

1138
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:12,940
Um,
but right now what we're really 

1139
01:08:13,351 --> 01:08:14,120
disagree.
Well,

1140
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,900
a couple of,
there's a couple I really disagreed,

1141
01:08:15,901 --> 01:08:20,480
but I'm going to go to Michael,
but the idea that the radical left poses

1142
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,340
a greater threat than the radical right?
When you see fat,

1143
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:28,390
like actual fascism ascendant all over 
the world strikes me as something that 

1144
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:32,300
you can literally only believe if you 
spend your life on college campuses.

1145
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,330
Mike,
I want to come to you on those on 

1146
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,570
Jordan's point about how does he in a 
sense get an equal voice in this debate 

1147
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:47,331
back if it is implied that his 
participation brings with it this 

1148
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:52,101
baggage of white privilege that doesn't 
allow him to see clearly the issues that

1149
01:08:53,221 --> 01:08:56,300
are before us with veterans to be 
complicit in the problem itself.

1150
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,380
Terminal logically,
you're beginning at a point,

1151
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:01,530
this is already a productive and 
controversial.

1152
01:09:01,531 --> 01:09:03,780
You're saying,
how can he get his equality?

1153
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:05,160
Beck,
who you talking about?

1154
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,880
Jordan Peterson trending number one on 
twitter.

1155
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,410
Jordan Peterson internationals in an 
international best seller.

1156
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:16,140
I want them to tweet something out about
me and my book.

1157
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,200
Jordan Peterson,
right?

1158
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:21,690
This is what I'm saying to you.
Why the rage,

1159
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:25,780
Bruh you you're doing well,
but you're a mean man.

1160
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:30,830
White man and you're going to get us 
right and I have never seen so much wine

1161
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:35,220
and snow flaking.

1162
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:40,760
There's enough light in here to start a 
vineyard and what I'm saying to you 

1163
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,670
empirically and precisely when you ask 
the question about white privilege,

1164
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:46,860
the fact that you ask it in the way you 
did,

1165
01:09:46,861 --> 01:09:51,861
dismissive pseudoscientific,
non empirical and without justification 

1166
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:56,780
a day.
The truth is that white privilege 

1167
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,780
doesn't act according to a quantifiable 
segments.

1168
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:02,130
It's about the degree to which we are 
willing as a society to grapple with the

1169
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:05,130
ideals of freedom,
justice,

1170
01:10:05,131 --> 01:10:08,520
and equality upon which is based.
Number two was interesting to me.

1171
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:10,860
You're talking about not having a 
collective identity.

1172
01:10:10,861 --> 01:10:13,350
What do you call a nation?
Are you Canadian?

1173
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,430
Are you Canadian by yourself?
Are you an individual or are you part of

1174
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:21,270
a group?
When America have formed it's union,

1175
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:24,960
it did so in opposition to another 
group,

1176
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:30,260
so the reality is is that those who were
part of group identities and politics 

1177
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:33,960
denied the legitimacy and validity of 
those groups and the fact that they have

1178
01:10:33,961 --> 01:10:38,910
been created thusly and ben have 
resentment against others.

1179
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:44,060
All I'm asking for is the opportunity 
that this quotation you talk about the 

1180
01:10:44,251 --> 01:10:47,760
difference between quality of outcome 
and equality of opportunity.

1181
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:52,850
That's a state and retried argument.
Hackneyed phrase derive from the halcyon

1182
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:54,510
days of the debate over affirmative 
action.

1183
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,720
Are you looking for outcomes that can be
determined equally or are you looking 

1184
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,071
for opportunity?
If you free a person after a whole long 

1185
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:06,660
time of oppression and say,
now you are free to survive.

1186
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:11,780
If you have no skills,
if you have no quantifiable means of 

1187
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:14,901
existence,
what you have done is liberated them 

1188
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:16,680
into and all I'm suggesting to you,
Lyndon Baines Johnson,

1189
01:11:16,681 --> 01:11:19,920
one of our great presidents said,
if you start a man in a race,

1190
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:24,150
100 years behind,
it is awfully difficult to catch up,

1191
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:29,270
so I don't think Jordan Peterson is 
suffering from anything except an 

1192
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:32,961
exaggerated sense of entitlement and 
resentment and his own privilege is 

1193
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,860
invisible to him and it's manifest with 
lethal intensity and ferocity right here

1194
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,270
on stage.

1195
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,470
Let me respond to that.

1196
01:11:48,230 --> 01:11:53,230
Well,
what I derived from that series of 

1197
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:53,600
rebuttals,
let's say is twofold.

1198
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:58,930
The first is that saying that the 
radical left goes too far when they 

1199
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:03,521
engage in violence is not a sufficient 
response by any stretch of the 

1200
01:12:03,521 --> 01:12:07,991
imagination because there are sets of 
ideas and radical leftist thinking that 

1201
01:12:07,991 --> 01:12:12,191
led to the catastrophes of the 20th 
century and that was at the level of 

1202
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:13,520
idea,
not at the level of violent action.

1203
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,250
It's a very straightforward thing to say
you're against violence.

1204
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:18,020
It's like being against poverty.
It's like,

1205
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:19,220
you know,
gender,

1206
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:24,280
generically speaking,
decent people are against poverty and 

1207
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,541
violence.
It doesn't address the issue in the 

1208
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:29,770
least with regards to my privilege or 
lack thereof.

1209
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:34,771
I mean,
I'm not making the case that I haven't 

1210
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:36,050
had advantages in my life and 
disadvantages in my life.

1211
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:41,051
Like most people,
you don't know anything about my 

1212
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:41,051
background or where it came from.
It,

1213
01:12:41,051 --> 01:12:43,010
it doesn't matter to you because 
fundamentally I'm a mean white man.

1214
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:44,510
That's a hell of a thing to say.

1215
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,410
Thanks.

1216
01:12:56,300 --> 01:13:01,300
Let me just say very,
very brief because I want to move on to 

1217
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:04,211
men and women.
Mad White comment was not predicated 

1218
01:13:04,211 --> 01:13:08,651
upon my historical excavation of your 
pay as it's based upon the evidence 

1219
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:13,151
vitriol with which you speak and the 
denial of a sense of equanimity among 

1220
01:13:13,151 --> 01:13:15,950
the combatants in an argument.
So thing again,

1221
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:18,640
you're a mean man.
White man and the viciousness.

1222
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:19,780
Okay.

1223
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,930
It's recently changed the decks here.
Let's talk about,

1224
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:33,090
uh,
another big factor of the so called 

1225
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:33,090
politically correct movement right now,

1226
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:37,790
which is the me too movement and the 
extent to which we've seen this 

1227
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:41,690
resurgence,
this awakening around would have been a 

1228
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,210
horrible series of systemic abuses and 
injustices towards women.

1229
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:49,380
Some people though Michelle would say 
that we're in a cultural panic now,

1230
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:54,430
that the pendulum has swung too far and 
that there is a dangerous overreaction 

1231
01:13:55,141 --> 01:14:00,141
going on where people's rights 
reputations due process has been thrown 

1232
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:02,370
to the wind.
How do you respond to that?

1233
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:03,490
Well,
first,

1234
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:08,500
when people started seeing that within 
like two weeks of the Harvey Weinstein 

1235
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:09,840
story is breaking,
right?

1236
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,190
The Minute Harvey Weinstein's and

1237
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,420
people actually act started actually 
losing their jobs over this,

1238
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:21,421
right?
Which was something quite new that men 

1239
01:14:21,421 --> 01:14:22,870
with histories of really serious 
predatory behavior where suddenly losing

1240
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:27,871
their jobs,
everybody had known about it for a long 

1241
01:14:27,871 --> 01:14:30,781
time and there had been a sort of 
implicit impunity and suddenly that was 

1242
01:14:30,781 --> 01:14:32,290
taken away and it created this cultural 
earthquake.

1243
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:34,570
And as soon as it did,
it created a lot of anxiety.

1244
01:14:34,571 --> 01:14:37,540
Like,
what if this goes too far?

1245
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,540
Um,
you know,

1246
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:43,620
I mean the me too movement was only a 
couple months old when my newspaper 

1247
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:47,801
started running columns from people 
saying why can't I criticized me to 

1248
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,460
which they were doing in my newspaper?
Um,

1249
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:56,050
so on the one hand guest of course is 
due process important.

1250
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,200
Obviously.
I think that when you look at who has 

1251
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,370
actually lost their jobs,
who's actually lost their livelihoods,

1252
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,170
I mean look around.

1253
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:09,780
It's people.
It's not people in general on a mccarthy

1254
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:14,850
is rumor.
It's people who took their dicks out at 

1255
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:14,850
work.
It's people who,

1256
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:17,540
you know,
there was,

1257
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:23,120
you know,
tens of millions of dollars of 

1258
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,771
settlements and they lost their dog for 
four months and now they're staging 

1259
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:25,771
comebacks.
You know,

1260
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,060
Bill O'reilly is about to get a TV show 
on a new network.

1261
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:33,210
So the idea that again,
this idea that kind of like men 

1262
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:38,251
everywhere feel like they can't talk 
anymore and everybody's walking on 

1263
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:38,251
eggshells.
And I don't know,

1264
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:42,570
maybe that's true in your offices.
It's not true where,

1265
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,690
where I live,
you know,

1266
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:48,780
and the me too movement has been 
particularly active in,

1267
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:50,540
in media,
you know,

1268
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,480
there was this,
this thing,

1269
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:55,230
I don't know how many of you guys read 
about the shitty media mentalist,

1270
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,790
I'm a woman,
wrote about,

1271
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:03,060
she started this sort of open source 
document where women could list men in 

1272
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,580
media that everybody knew about but 
nobody had ever done anything about.

1273
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:11,940
And it very quickly went public and 
there was something sort of disturbing 

1274
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:11,940
in it,
right?

1275
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:14,590
You don't like these anonymous 
accusations floating around.

1276
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,350
Um,
most feminists I know including myself,

1277
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:22,351
were kind of freaked out by it and 
thought it was unfair to have people's 

1278
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:28,081
reputations held up like this.
But if you look at what happened to the 

1279
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:29,560
men on the list,
nothing,

1280
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:31,540
you know,
they still have their jobs.

1281
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:34,270
I know men on that list.
I work with men on that list.

1282
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:39,450
The people who actually,
people have only buying as far as I can 

1283
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:44,191
think in media.
The people who have lost their jobs and 

1284
01:16:44,191 --> 01:16:46,591
lost their careers.
It's been for extremely serious 

1285
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:50,551
misbehavior,
documented by multiple women who had 

1286
01:16:50,551 --> 01:16:53,110
corroborating witnesses.
And so again,

1287
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:57,190
I understand this anxiety that relations
between men and women are changing.

1288
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:59,470
Of course,
that causes a lot of cultural anxiety,

1289
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,280
but I don't know that it's rooted in 
anything real get his view on this.

1290
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:08,281
Are we intercultural panic is the 
response Michelle says commensurate with

1291
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,250
the moment.
I'm very confused

1292
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:10,980
by this.
I,

1293
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:16,770
of course,
I recognize the best attitude Weinstein 

1294
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,070
in the monstrosity of his behavior.
Uh,

1295
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:24,071
and it was shocking to me.
I actually worked for him the script 

1296
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:27,911
doctoring as it's called.
And I never had the bathroom pto for 

1297
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,350
pretty obvious reasons.
Um,

1298
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,580
but it's grotesque and I can't imagine 
how violent must be for such a powerful 

1299
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:37,310
man.
He was,

1300
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:42,110
I used to play a game at the Cannes film
festival where it is.

1301
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:45,020
Here's a power.
We're walking from one hotel,

1302
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:45,600
the,
uh,

1303
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,840
uh,
at the end of the,

1304
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:52,140
uh,
all the way up to the palliative 

1305
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,700
festival.
You will get 10 points every time you 

1306
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:53,980
heard the word harvey.
Um,

1307
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:58,990
I'm usually a 10 minute walk.
You'd have a 300 points because it was a

1308
01:17:59,080 --> 01:17:59,870
hobbies.
Got The script.

1309
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:00,570
Harvey's got it.
Yeah.

1310
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:05,630
Yeah.
I've got a meeting with Harvey at the 

1311
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,630
majestic,
uh,

1312
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:05,630
in the afternoon.

1313
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:08,830
He was immensely powerful and I think 
that's obvious that someone in that 

1314
01:18:08,830 --> 01:18:09,850
position,
uh,

1315
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,980
abusing him,
threatening and a hindering the 

1316
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,580
livelihood of women is grotesque and in 
the extreme,

1317
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,760
but I have to tell you,
there is genuine feeling amongst many 

1318
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,130
people.
I know that we can't speak our minds.

1319
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:28,570
We can't actually speak to the true New 
Orleans,

1320
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:33,650
the true depth of sexual romantic 
feeling between men and women.

1321
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:36,110
That's not a subject don't absolutely 
expert on,

1322
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,660
but it comes between men and men as 
well.

1323
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:40,970
Though I know when it's men and men,
you might say,

1324
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:45,971
well that's different because they are 
women who have had a different 

1325
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,510
experience in history and I don't want 
to enter that particular field,

1326
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:52,511
but I would say that that is real fear 
in my business,

1327
01:18:53,111 --> 01:18:55,790
which is where this all started.
Showbiz does acting and so on.

1328
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:01,420
Yeah.
People are rather afraid to speak about 

1329
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:05,060
a piece of very no publicity that's come
out or a statement that's been made.

1330
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,260
You just go,
Yup,

1331
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:11,350
absolutely.
And wait for the people to leave the 

1332
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,050
room before you can speak honestly with 
your friends.

1333
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,530
And that's,
I've never experienced that in my entire

1334
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:18,590
60 years on this planet.
There's this feeling that,

1335
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,920
uh,
and I'd not characterizing feminists as 

1336
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,300
an east German,
but it's like that the stars you're 

1337
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:27,350
listening,
you better be careful that listening.

1338
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,860
And that's genuine feeling.
I'm saying that my hand on my heart,

1339
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,100
I'm not saying it to make a point other 
than the fact that it's true and it's 

1340
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:40,150
worrying,
but the sexual misadventures in horror 

1341
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,470
experiences worrying too.
So the two words and they're not solved.

1342
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Let's bring Jordan in on this because 
you've written and commented about a 

1343
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:47,500
lot.

1344
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:47,500
Thank you.

1345
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:55,930
Well,
I think I'm going to point out two 

1346
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:56,900
things again.
The first is that my question about when

1347
01:19:56,901 --> 01:19:58,520
the,
when the left goes too far,

1348
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:03,521
still hasn't been answered.
And then the second thing I'm going to 

1349
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:03,521
point out is that,
you know,

1350
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:07,680
it's conceivable that I am a mean man.
You know,

1351
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,310
I mean

1352
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,130
maybe I'm meaner than some people are 
not as mean as others.

1353
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:16,131
I think that's probably more the case,
but I would say the fact that race got 

1354
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:20,391
dragged into that particular comment is 
a better exemplar of what the hell I 

1355
01:20:20,391 --> 01:20:24,551
think is wrong with the politically 
correct left than anything else that 

1356
01:20:24,551 --> 01:20:24,551
could have possibly happened.

1357
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:37,070
Imagine the hurt,
the anxiety,

1358
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,960
the insult that you might genuinely feel
according to what I felt was an 

1359
01:20:47,461 --> 01:20:51,750
appropriate comment of description at 
the moment of its expression.

1360
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:56,751
But imagine now those hurt feelings and 
wow,

1361
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,230
okay.
You feel great.

1362
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:05,020
You feel great about really different.
I'm not a victim.

1363
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,700
I'm not hurt.
You're hurt.

1364
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:07,900
Okay.
You wouldn't be a victim.

1365
01:21:07,901 --> 01:21:12,901
So what?
What's interesting is that whatever a 

1366
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:15,190
non traditional feelings of empathy you 
endure at this particular point,

1367
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:22,130
the point is imagined then the horrors 
that so many of the others have had to 

1368
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:30,460
put up with for so long when they are 
refused to acknowledge their humanity.

1369
01:21:30,461 --> 01:21:33,310
Now I take your point seriously,
so you're.

1370
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,300
Let me.
Let me finish.

1371
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:35,980
Let me finish.
Let me finish.

1372
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,770
Let me finish up figuring out my 
acquisition or.

1373
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,800
Okay.
What I'm saying to you is that when you 

1374
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,220
said you were upset that I added the 
element of race there,

1375
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,830
right when I said mean Matt White Man.

1376
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:53,340
Well,
what's interesting is that you may have 

1377
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:57,331
felt that you were being ascribed the 
group identity to which you do not 

1378
01:21:57,331 --> 01:22:00,780
subscribe.
You may have felt that you were being 

1379
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,090
unfairly judged according to your 
particular race.

1380
01:22:01,091 --> 01:22:06,091
You may have felt that your individual 
identity was being the smurfs by my 

1381
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:09,811
rather careless characterization of you,
all of which qualifies for a legitimate 

1382
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:16,710
response to me,
but also the point we've been trying to 

1383
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:19,540
make about the refusal to see our 
individual existence as women,

1384
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:21,760
as people of Color,
as first nation people in the light.

1385
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:27,210
My point simply has been the reason I 
talked about race and that particular 

1386
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:31,390
characterization because there's a 
particular way in which I have come to a

1387
01:22:31,391 --> 01:22:33,580
city.
I don't know if there are a lot of black

1388
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,920
people out here.
Not sure,

1389
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:41,160
but I constantly come to places and 
spaces that are not my natural habitat 

1390
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:46,510
other than intellectual engagement and 
the love in the fury of rhetorical 

1391
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:47,260
engagement.

1392
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:50,350
Yes,
but I often go into hostile spaces where

1393
01:22:50,351 --> 01:22:55,351
people will not vote in favor for my 
particular viewpoint because I'm 

1394
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:58,920
interested as an individual of breaking 
down barriers so that people can 

1395
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,781
understand just how complicated it is.
So what I'm saying to you is that I 

1396
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:07,300
would invite you in of the surrender of 
your privilege to give you a specific,

1397
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,750
a specific response.
Come with me to a black Baptist church,

1398
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,660
come with me to a historically black 
college.

1399
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,840
Come to me to an to an indigenous first 
nations community where we're able to 

1400
01:23:19,031 --> 01:23:24,031
engage in some of the lovely 
conversation but also to listen and hear

1401
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:31,680
and when I added race to that,
I was talking about the historical 

1402
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:32,530
events,
inability to acknowledge others,

1403
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,700
pains equally to the one that they are 
presently enduring.

1404
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,310
So

1405
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:41,340
human being being loved,
but I stand by my comments.

1406
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,530
Seeing the sorts of things that you're 
talking about.

1407
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,710
I happened to be an honorary member of 
an indigenous family,

1408
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:51,160
so don't tell me about what I should go 
see with regards to depression.

1409
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:54,040
You don't know anything about me.
You asked me a question,

1410
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:57,600
I gave you a response.
You gave me a generic response.

1411
01:23:57,601 --> 01:24:00,850
Is Generic race pace or sports Jordan 
Peterson?

1412
01:24:00,851 --> 01:24:02,530
I would like for you to come with me,
Michael,

1413
01:24:02,531 --> 01:24:04,890
Eric Dyson to a black Baptist church.
You've been.

1414
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,940
I would be happy to do that,
but.

1415
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:07,520
Okay.
Alright.

1416
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,200
I'm gonna Hook you up.

1417
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:13,210
You have one more question.

1418
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:18,300
Brandon.
We're going to go to closing statements 

1419
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,771
and Stephen for.
I want to get your response to why you 

1420
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:21,130
know a generation from now looking back 
on this debate,

1421
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:26,430
we're not going to see this quote,
so-called politically correct movement 

1422
01:24:26,430 --> 01:24:30,211
in the same way.
Let's say that we now understand the 

1423
01:24:30,211 --> 01:24:30,211
positive contributions of the civil 
rights movement,

1424
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:35,130
that that was a movement that advanced a
series of,

1425
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:38,860
of ideas about human dignity to people 
who previously didn't have that dignity.

1426
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:43,861
We're now having another debate and 
other social debate about different 

1427
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:47,710
groups and communities that are.
We're trying to convey a sense of,

1428
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,400
of new dignity to them.
Why?

1429
01:24:49,401 --> 01:24:54,401
Why won't this be be in a sense looked 
back upon as something positive a 

1430
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:55,090
generation from now.

1431
01:24:55,180 --> 01:25:00,180
I think people will look back on this 
debate and wonder why political 

1432
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:00,640
correctness wasn't discussed.

1433
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:07,110
Thanks.
Slippery.

1434
01:25:11,211 --> 01:25:11,800
I mean,
I

1435
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:17,020
interesting to hear talk about race and 
about gender and about to be quality and

1436
01:25:17,110 --> 01:25:22,040
it's something that I've thought about a
lot and I can learn a great deal about.

1437
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,480
But that's not why I came to this debate
I was interested in,

1438
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,750
um,
what I've always been interested in the 

1439
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:32,821
suppression of language and thought the 
closing down the rationalist idea that 

1440
01:25:32,821 --> 01:25:36,400
seems beguiling,
that if you limit people's language,

1441
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:39,280
it made somehow teach them a different 
way of thinking.

1442
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:44,880
Something that would have delighted the 
inventors of George Orwell's newspeak 

1443
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,960
for example.
And it seems to me it's just 

1444
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:48,960
implausible.
It doesn't,

1445
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,850
it doesn't work.
And that's what I mean by empirical.

1446
01:25:52,851 --> 01:25:57,851
He doesn't stand an empirical test.
Disney experientially validated as we 

1447
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:03,950
see from the political landscape now.
And I worry that we may in the future.

1448
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,980
So,
uh,

1449
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:09,990
I,
I'm so disappointed that the subject is 

1450
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,750
just revolved around academia,
which was predictable because that's the

1451
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:14,540
sort of crucible in which these elements
of mixed,

1452
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,520
but even more disappointed that really I
haven't heard from Michelle or from 

1453
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,480
professor docent as to what they think 
political greatness is because what 

1454
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:25,990
they've talked about is basically saying
progress in,

1455
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,620
in our view is progress.

1456
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,550
Well,
I agree.

1457
01:26:28,730 --> 01:26:29,630
That's,
you know.

1458
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,930
Yeah.
So it is true and good on progress,

1459
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,780
but how is it

1460
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:40,910
you're saying political that what we 
call the digital greatness you call 

1461
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:45,041
progress.
That's what you're supposed to be 

1462
01:26:45,041 --> 01:26:47,010
arguing.
I want to know what you mean by 

1463
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:47,010
political correctness.

1464
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:50,630
Well,
like I said though,

1465
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,120
the reason a few months ago,
right,

1466
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,020
you,
you contacted me,

1467
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:57,410
asked if I wanted to do a debate about 
identity politics and then you presented

1468
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:59,030
me with this resolution and I said,
well,

1469
01:26:59,031 --> 01:27:02,060
there's a lot of things that people call
political correctness that I'm not going

1470
01:27:02,061 --> 01:27:07,061
to defend.
But then I realized who I was debating 

1471
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,880
and saw that there was a lot of things 
that you,

1472
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:13,880
Jordan Peterson called political 
correctness that I call progress.

1473
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:14,600
Um,
and,

1474
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:17,420
and to some extent you to Stephen Fry,
you know,

1475
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:21,300
when you talk about it being outrageous 
to tear it out or not outrageous,

1476
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:26,301
so I won't put words in your mouth,
but that we shouldn't be tearing down 

1477
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:28,901
statues of kind of notorious racist that
we should just instead be throwing exit 

1478
01:27:28,901 --> 01:27:31,560
then,
you know,

1479
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:35,120
so those sorts of things,
if you call them political correctness,

1480
01:27:35,121 --> 01:27:38,270
like call them progress now,
this feeling of being silenced,

1481
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:41,360
which I understand,
although it seems very vague,

1482
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:46,361
right?
You kind of are not quite putting your 

1483
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:48,251
finger on who was silencing you except 
for a vague fear that if you say 

1484
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:50,930
something untoward,
you're going to be the subject of,

1485
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:55,610
I'm not sure shaming biker who but by,
by what?

1486
01:27:55,611 --> 01:27:56,300
By the Internet.

1487
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:02,200
No,
but I mean there's that element of it

1488
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:10,450
hear what I'm saying is that it's,
it's a feeling.

1489
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:15,660
It's a feeling that is this sort of 
intangible result of on nearly

1490
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:20,760
Goldstein the sort of show trial thing 
where the person that apologizes,

1491
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:23,280
I have so much to learn about sexual 
politics.

1492
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:25,640
I am really sorry.
Signed a lawyer,

1493
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,790
crossed out the name of the

1494
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:30,210
personally.
It's do you think

1495
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:35,390
the real mistake of our left is that we 
underestimate the right,

1496
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,060
the right season to stupid as we'd like 
them to be if only they were only there 

1497
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:43,290
went to coming to slide,
so smart,

1498
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:45,980
so aware of our shortcomings and,
and,

1499
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:51,120
and I just fear that political 
correctness is a weapon that they value.

1500
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,300
The more,
the more we tell the world how people 

1501
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,710
should be treated,
how language should be treated,

1502
01:28:58,890 --> 01:29:00,930
what words are acceptable,
what attitudes are,

1503
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:06,390
what hr meeting is going to tell you in 
a long bullet pointed list about how you

1504
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:11,391
look at people.
All of this is meat and drink too bad 

1505
01:29:11,391 --> 01:29:15,660
people to malefactors the bad actors are
not counting myself as one of those,

1506
01:29:15,660 --> 01:29:18,940
but does in that sense,
I mean bad actors in the other set.

1507
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:29,130
Thank you.

1508
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:30,600
So there are,
like I said,

1509
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:33,030
there are a lot of ways in which I agree
with you,

1510
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:34,370
although I kind of,
I,

1511
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:36,600
I would like to hear.
I need to turn it back on you.

1512
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:40,020
I'd like to hear you say,
you know,

1513
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:45,050
what are the words that have fallen into
disrepute that we think that you think 

1514
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:45,050
we should be resurrecting?
Right.

1515
01:29:45,050 --> 01:29:49,850
A new to me,
this is this area of like hotly 

1516
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:51,760
contested social change right now.
We're a lot of people feel

1517
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:55,150
but words that have gone into disuse.
It's very often phrases,

1518
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:59,300
jargonistic slogans,
Hetero normative cisgendered,

1519
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,210
those kinds of things that they're just 
an insult.

1520
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:07,390
You know,
imagine you're a young student arriving 

1521
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:09,430
university and someone's bombarding him 
with this preposterous hermeneutical 

1522
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:09,860
nonsense from,
from,

1523
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,300
from misread textbooks.
So Ms Dot red food code and they say 

1524
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:16,790
Derrida and,
and so on because.

1525
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:17,320
Yeah,
yeah,

1526
01:30:17,410 --> 01:30:19,900
I know I was in Cambridge,
England doing it.

1527
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,380
We had a French phase

1528
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:23,880
value in that.

1529
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,870
It's an interesting game and it is,
it's a place to,

1530
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,110
uh,
I,

1531
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:33,610
I think I just really say that the ghost
hovering over me is,

1532
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,380
it's a letter Oscar Wilde roads and uh,
he,

1533
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:41,450
he said [inaudible] love.
You said the fact that you didn't get 

1534
01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:43,821
the degrees is nothing but you never 
acquired what is sometimes called the 

1535
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,120
Oxford Manor.
And I'll say for that,

1536
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,880
the university manner,
he said,

1537
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:53,630
Oscar said,
I take that to mean the ability to play 

1538
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:56,841
gracefully with ideas.
I think that's disappearing from our 

1539
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:56,841
culture.
And I think it's an

1540
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:06,220
thank you.

1541
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:10,070
It's hard to beat a self deprecating 
English minutes.

1542
01:31:12,070 --> 01:31:15,630
No,
no,

1543
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,880
no.
I've got a pretty good idea here today.

1544
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:22,240
But what's interesting,
I don't recall in all of you,

1545
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:27,300
all of us have studied history.
I don't recall these debates about 

1546
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,321
political correctness happening when 
people who were in power in absolute 

1547
01:31:31,321 --> 01:31:32,530
power,
unquestioned power,

1548
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:38,010
political correctness,
political correctness becomes an issue.

1549
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,460
And what I mean by that is people who 
used to have power,

1550
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,560
who,
who still have power,

1551
01:31:44,561 --> 01:31:48,670
but they don't who gets challenged.
I'll just a little bit of what they have

1552
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:51,070
and don't want to share toys in the sand
lot of life.

1553
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:55,240
So all of a sudden it becomes a kind of 
exaggerated grievance.

1554
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:59,270
Now the things you named the bullet 
points and the CIS gender,

1555
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,050
the Hetero normativity and the Hetero 
patriarchy,

1556
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:07,320
and the capitalist resurgence and the 
insurrection of subjugated knowledge is 

1557
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,370
to give some more love or the iridium 
deconstruction.

1558
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:14,371
All that stuff,
the French phase is still going on with 

1559
01:32:14,371 --> 01:32:14,680
the French fries in America.

1560
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:20,040
What's interesting is that I didn't hear
many complaints of political 

1561
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:25,441
correctness.
I'm at the height of the dominance of 

1562
01:32:25,441 --> 01:32:28,570
one group or another,
but when Martin Luther King Jr,

1563
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:33,870
who argued for group identity as a black
person to provide an opportunity for 

1564
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:38,350
individual black people to come to the 
fore,

1565
01:32:38,950 --> 01:32:41,320
they began to make that claim.
Oh,

1566
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,030
that didn't call it political 
correctness.

1567
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:46,660
You're siding with those who are against
free speech.

1568
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:51,460
You're siding with those who don't want 
me as a white person to be recognized in

1569
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,550
my humanity,
and what I mean by political correctness

1570
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:59,790
is the kind of politics of resentment 
that are articulated by various holders 

1571
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:02,800
of power at certain levels,
at various levels.

1572
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:08,250
That one of the beautiful things about 
co that I take as opposed to Max Faber 

1573
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:10,780
is that full said power breaks out 
everywhere.

1574
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:15,870
I would think a person who's critical 
political correctness like you would 

1575
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:18,841
appreciate this as opposed to Max Faber 
who said power is over there in a 

1576
01:33:18,841 --> 01:33:21,370
hierarchical structure where 
subordination is the demand for coset.

1577
01:33:21,450 --> 01:33:26,450
No power brakes out,
even among people who are in 

1578
01:33:26,450 --> 01:33:27,190
disempowered so you can hurt somebody in
your own community.

1579
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,730
What's more politically incorrect than a
black baptist preacher?

1580
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:35,790
Identifying with a first century 
Palestinian Jew and still loving 

1581
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:39,511
atheist?
What's more politically incorrect in a 

1582
01:33:39,511 --> 01:33:41,701
black intellectual going on Bill Maher 
and offending his ability to continue to

1583
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:47,791
have this show despite using the inward.
I serve believe in a politically 

1584
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:53,431
incorrect version when I go into the 
Black Baptist preacher to chastise my 

1585
01:33:53,431 --> 01:33:56,680
fellow believers about their homophobia 
that goes over like a brick cloud.

1586
01:33:56,920 --> 01:34:01,920
When I come into arenas like this,
I understand that my back is up against 

1587
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:02,120
the wall,
but I think

1588
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:07,420
sit over here.
Let's say I want to sit on your lap,

1589
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:14,740
but what I say get excited,
but what I'm saying does that he goes 

1590
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:22,370
out and looking at me.
What's interesting

1591
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:31,120
is that when we look at the way in which
we have societies in a free,

1592
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:34,280
a Canadian society and the free American
society,

1593
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,980
when I look at what is seen as political
correctness,

1594
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:42,160
it to me has been a mass of jumble that 
has been carved together out of the 

1595
01:34:42,741 --> 01:34:45,740
politics of resentment that powers once 
held,

1596
01:34:45,770 --> 01:34:50,770
no longer are held.
Freedoms once exercise absolutely must 

1597
01:34:50,770 --> 01:34:51,960
now be shared.
So I,

1598
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:55,700
I am in agreeance with both of my,
my gentleman to my right,

1599
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,600
who believe that political correctness 
has been a scourge,

1600
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:04,630
but not necessarily the way you think,
so I think has been a scourge because 

1601
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,610
those who have been the deployers of 
power and the beneficiaries of privilege

1602
01:35:07,790 --> 01:35:12,790
have failed to recognize their 
particular way and at the end of the 

1603
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:16,630
day,
I think that those of us who are free 

1604
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:19,661
citizens of this country and of America 
should figure out ways to respect the 

1605
01:35:20,001 --> 01:35:25,001
humanity of the other,
to respect the individual existence of 

1606
01:35:25,001 --> 01:35:28,661
the other,
but also respect the fact that there 

1607
01:35:28,661 --> 01:35:31,241
have been barriers placed upon 
particular groups that have prevented 

1608
01:35:31,241 --> 01:35:32,180
them from flourishing.
That's all I mean by political,

1609
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:34,160
correct.
Well said.

1610
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:38,510
I got to give before we get to closing 
statements and final words on this topic

1611
01:35:38,511 --> 01:35:39,930
to Michelle and then,
uh,

1612
01:35:39,931 --> 01:35:40,550
you,
Jordan.

1613
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:45,870
So I think part of the frustration here 
is that I think that both of you have 

1614
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:49,890
radically different ideas of what we're 
talking about when we talk about 

1615
01:35:49,890 --> 01:35:50,530
political correctness.
It seems to me that you're talking about

1616
01:35:50,531 --> 01:35:53,830
politically correctness.
You mean this kind of feeling of anxiety

1617
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:58,831
that a lot of people feel because we all
live now in this terrible crowdsource 

1618
01:35:58,831 --> 01:36:03,040
panopticon when you worried that any 
straight phrase that you use will be any

1619
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:05,440
stray phrase you utter might be used to 
define you.

1620
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:10,650
Right?
And I think that a lot of people feel 

1621
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:10,650
that anxiety.
I,

1622
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:12,460
I disagree that that is something that 
is being solely,

1623
01:36:12,461 --> 01:36:15,160
kind of perpetrated against,
you know,

1624
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:20,900
institution to kind of Oscar Wilde and 
figures by a sensory and sensory is left

1625
01:36:21,491 --> 01:36:24,730
wing chord because it's coming from all 
directions,

1626
01:36:24,731 --> 01:36:26,140
right?
This phenomenon,

1627
01:36:26,141 --> 01:36:29,410
which sucks is all over the place.
I mean,

1628
01:36:29,411 --> 01:36:34,411
I get it when I write something critical
of the way that the IDF behaved in Gaza,

1629
01:36:37,030 --> 01:36:37,800
you know,
it,

1630
01:36:37,801 --> 01:36:40,600
it,
it's coming at everyone and I think that

1631
01:36:40,601 --> 01:36:45,601
there is,
there's a way in which when it comes at 

1632
01:36:45,641 --> 01:36:50,641
a certain sort of figure and there's a 
certain set of complaints and you feel 

1633
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:55,921
unjustly criticized and feel silenced,
which again I think is really different 

1634
01:36:55,921 --> 01:36:56,980
than being silenced.

1635
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:02,400
You call it political correctness and I 
would like the culture also to be more 

1636
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:06,070
freewheeling.
I think one solution,

1637
01:37:06,071 --> 01:37:08,350
you know,
you're not going to kind of get the left

1638
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:11,230
to um,
I don't know.

1639
01:37:11,231 --> 01:37:16,231
They can't kind of put an end to this 
because it is much more of a mob social 

1640
01:37:16,231 --> 01:37:19,120
media phenomenon than it is kind of some
diktat coming up from on high.

1641
01:37:19,450 --> 01:37:24,450
And so one really the only way to break 
through it is to say what you are,

1642
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:27,130
what you say that you're afraid to say,
right?

1643
01:37:27,131 --> 01:37:32,131
I mean that's the only way to sort of 
pop this bubble or kind of end this end,

1644
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:37,450
this anxiety or at least diffuse it a 
little bit.

1645
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:42,130
Whereas again,
what I hear Mr Peterson talking about as

1646
01:37:42,131 --> 01:37:47,131
political correctness is something much 
more broad and much more,

1647
01:37:48,311 --> 01:37:50,740
um,
kind of funded,

1648
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:56,640
much,
much more fundamental to social change 

1649
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:56,640
and you're talking about,
you know,

1650
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:56,640
you want

1651
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,420
me to define or one of us to talk about 
when the left goes too far and if I'm,

1652
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:05,480
you know,
I certainly don't want to be a woman 

1653
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:05,480
putting words in your mouth,
but if I'm,

1654
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,800
if I hear you correctly,
what you're saying is that you want me 

1655
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,570
to kind of renounce Marxist categories 
or to.

1656
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:18,660
Well,
I want you to define with the left goes 

1657
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:18,660
too far.
You can do it any way you want.

1658
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,260
I,
like I said,

1659
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:24,261
I think that the left goes too far into 
when it is violent or censorious when it

1660
01:38:25,441 --> 01:38:30,441
tries to shut people down or no platform
them or when it asked violently I,

1661
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:34,830
I'm not sure what you expect.
Something beyond that.

1662
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:40,070
Something deeper.
How like you to contend with the set of 

1663
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:44,661
left wing ideas that produced all the 
lift wing pathologies of the 20th 

1664
01:38:44,661 --> 01:38:48,450
century and to define how you think 
standard left wing thinking,

1665
01:38:48,451 --> 01:38:53,451
which has a place where it goes too far 
since it obviously does gone too far.

1666
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:57,960
Of course the right.
Tell us how well.

1667
01:38:57,961 --> 01:39:02,961
How about Auschwitz,
about justice center?

1668
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,540
What else?
More recently,

1669
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:07,710
what has gone wrong with the right?

1670
01:39:09,740 --> 01:39:13,980
Don't like identity politics players at 
all.

1671
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:15,810
I don't care whether they're on the left
or the right.

1672
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,930
I'd be lecturing about right wing 
extremism for 30 years.

1673
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:24,020
I'm no fan of the right.
Despite the fact that the left would 

1674
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:26,901
like to paint me that way because it's 
more convenient for reasonably well 

1675
01:39:26,901 --> 01:39:30,720
where it's threatening to go to foreign 
identitarian Europe,

1676
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:34,080
that's for sure.
It's gone too far in Charlottesville.

1677
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:39,170
It went too far in Norway.
Like how long the list do you want and 

1678
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,390
why am I required to produce that to 
show you that I don't like the terrios

1679
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:46,870
thought I'd ask you.
I was actually asking you what your 

1680
01:39:47,011 --> 01:39:47,760
assumption is.

1681
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:50,720
How that I must be on the site.
If the right,

1682
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,920
it's like,
look,

1683
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:56,180
the right has an occupied the humanities
and the social sciences.

1684
01:39:56,690 --> 01:39:58,520
It's as simple as that.
For me,

1685
01:39:58,730 --> 01:40:00,800
if they had,
I'd be objecting to them.

1686
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:03,290
Say that again.
I didn't have the right.

1687
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:08,530
Has not occupied the social sciences and
the humanities and the left clearly has 

1688
01:40:08,781 --> 01:40:10,940
the statistical evidence for that is 
overwhelming.

1689
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,600
So what about Iq testing in terms of 
genetic inheritance.

1690
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:19,190
We're here to talk about political,
correct?

1691
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:21,000
Yes.
And we've done a damn thing.

1692
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:26,210
I gave you an example.
Can Redeem ourselves with our closing 

1693
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,770
statements are going to put three 
minutes on the clock.

1694
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:29,720
We're going to go in the reverse order 
of the opening.

1695
01:40:29,721 --> 01:40:31,640
So Steven,
Europe first.

1696
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:32,680
Oh Lordy,
Lordy,

1697
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:36,800
hide behind the legs.
And in that case,

1698
01:40:37,140 --> 01:40:42,140
well,
I've been fascinated by this 

1699
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,991
conversation.
There's been an enormous clash of 

1700
01:40:43,991 --> 01:40:43,991
cultures in,
in the conversation we've had,

1701
01:40:43,991 --> 01:40:44,240
you know,
classic,

1702
01:40:44,241 --> 01:40:47,660
if I can call it huckstering snake oil 
pulpit talk.

1703
01:40:53,380 --> 01:40:53,990
It's a motive

1704
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:59,010
discourse.
It's a rhetorical style that I find 

1705
01:40:59,010 --> 01:40:59,010
endlessly refreshing vivifying.
Um,

1706
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:04,080
but I'm,
I'm not sure that we actually focused 

1707
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:04,080
on,
on the point in question.

1708
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:06,710
And my objection has always been towards
orthodoxy.

1709
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:11,760
I'm a,
I'm a heterodox and a contrarian and I 

1710
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:15,001
can't help myself.
And I think there's been an 

1711
01:41:15,001 --> 01:41:16,921
underestimation of the fact that 
language does affect people.

1712
01:41:17,111 --> 01:41:22,111
It does make the young in particular,
is this starting out on their 

1713
01:41:22,111 --> 01:41:23,770
educational or their work careers.
It makes them,

1714
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,960
it makes them very anxious.
It makes them very angry,

1715
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:30,961
very upset,
very alienated to feel that they don't 

1716
01:41:30,961 --> 01:41:34,090
know anymore how to operate in the 
world,

1717
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,840
how to engage in relationships,
how to think honestly.

1718
01:41:37,841 --> 01:41:42,841
So they they create more and more to 
their own mini groups and I think that's

1719
01:41:43,451 --> 01:41:48,451
dangerous and unhappy for society.
I think it's reflected in the paucity of

1720
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
cinema and literature and art and the 
culture generally is that there's a fear

1721
01:41:54,431 --> 01:41:59,431
that's pervading it and while people can
talk to academia and so you should come 

1722
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:01,870
see our lessons.
Our lectures are open and free and ideas

1723
01:42:01,871 --> 01:42:03,640
are exchanged.
I'm sure that's true.

1724
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:08,820
I'm sure it's true,
but I don't think we should 

1725
01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:11,251
underestimate how much this feeling is 
prevalent in the culture of this strange

1726
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:21,031
paradox that the liberals are liberal in
the demand for liberality.

1727
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:25,420
They are exclusive in that demand for 
inclusivity.

1728
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,840
They are homogenous in their demand for 
heterogeneity.

1729
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:36,360
They are somehow and diverse in the call
for diversity.

1730
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:42,300
You can be diverse but not diverse in 
your opinions and in your language and 

1731
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,370
then your behavior and that's okay.

1732
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:44,170
Terrible pity.

1733
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:49,720
I,
I,

1734
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:52,810
I would say that I'm,
I'm sorry that it got a bit heated,

1735
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:57,860
uh,
in places because I was hoping it 

1736
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:00,571
wouldn't.
I was hoping would be a shining example 

1737
01:43:00,571 --> 01:43:02,821
of how people of all different kinds of 
political outlooks can speak with humor 

1738
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:07,810
and wit and a lightness of touch.
As gk Chesterton said,

1739
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:11,020
angels can fly because they take 
themselves lightly.

1740
01:43:11,320 --> 01:43:14,470
And I think it's very important for us 
who are privileged.

1741
01:43:14,471 --> 01:43:16,240
All four of us are privileged to be 
here,

1742
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:21,241
to be asked to be here,
to take ourselves a little bit more 

1743
01:43:21,241 --> 01:43:23,701
likely not to be too earnest,
too pompous to serious a and not to be 

1744
01:43:23,701 --> 01:43:25,630
too certain.
Uh,

1745
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:27,580
it's,
it's a time,

1746
01:43:27,581 --> 01:43:31,480
I think for really engaging,
emotionally fulfilling,

1747
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,290
passionate and positive doubt.
That's what I would.

1748
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:43,030
Thank you.
We're going to put minutes on the clock 

1749
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:52,040
for

1750
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,920
you please.
Uh,

1751
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,670
your closing.
Thank you so much for that compliment.

1752
01:43:57,590 --> 01:44:02,590
I'm used to not exclusively white men 
who see black intelligence articulated 

1753
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:07,390
at a certain level of feeling a kind of 
condescension if I came up here,

1754
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:10,250
ms.dot.
I was saying the other day,

1755
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:15,910
but,
but a kind of verbal facility 

1756
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:17,150
automatically assumed to be a kind of 
hucksterism and snake oil salesmen.

1757
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:18,170
I've seen that.
I get it.

1758
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:21,740
I get hate letters every day from white 
brothers and sisters who were mad.

1759
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:26,741
I'm teaching their children.
You're just trying to coopt our 

1760
01:44:26,741 --> 01:44:26,810
children.
You're trying to corrupt them.

1761
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:31,811
Yes.
I'm trying to corrupt them so they will 

1762
01:44:31,811 --> 01:44:34,031
be uncorrupted by the corruptibility 
that they've inherited from a society 

1763
01:44:34,031 --> 01:44:36,890
that refuses to see all people as human 
beings.

1764
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:41,150
The death threats I've received 
constantly for simply trying to speak my

1765
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:46,151
mind.
It's not about a politically correct 

1766
01:44:46,151 --> 01:44:46,151
society that is open minded.

1767
01:44:46,240 --> 01:44:48,830
Uh,
and that has some consternation about my

1768
01:44:48,831 --> 01:44:51,500
ability to speak.
I'm getting real live.

1769
01:44:51,501 --> 01:44:55,220
You want empirical death threats that 
talk about killing me,

1770
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:00,140
setting up to hurt me and harm me simply
because I choose to speak my mind.

1771
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:04,310
I agree with my confreres in my 
compatriots that we should argue against

1772
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,280
the vicious limitation and recursions 
against speech.

1773
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:12,610
I believe that everybody has the right 
to be able to articulate themselves and 

1774
01:45:12,610 --> 01:45:16,271
the enormous privilege we have to come 
to a spot in a space like this means 

1775
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:18,980
that we have that privilege and we 
should be responsible for it.

1776
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:24,280
No matter where we go from here,
me and brother Peterson will go to a 

1777
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:24,380
black Baptist church.
I'm gonna.

1778
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:26,600
Hold him to that.
He said it on national TV.

1779
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:31,601
We're going to go to a black Baptist 
church and have an enlightening 

1780
01:45:31,601 --> 01:45:35,771
conversation about the need for us to 
engage in not only reciprocal and mutual

1781
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:38,180
edification,
but criticism,

1782
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:43,270
even hard and tough criticism,
but in a way that speaks to the needs 

1783
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:46,910
and interests of those who don't usually
get on TV,

1784
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:52,060
who's voices are not usually amplified,
whose ideas are not usually taken 

1785
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:56,501
seriously and when they get to the upper
echelons of the ability of a society to 

1786
01:45:56,781 --> 01:46:01,781
express themselves,
they are equally subject too vicious 

1787
01:46:01,781 --> 01:46:03,530
recrimination and hurtful resistance.

1788
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:08,920
There's old story about the pig and the 
pig and the chicken going down the 

1789
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:09,200
street and said,
let's have breakfast.

1790
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:19,060
The chicken just has to give up an egg.
The pig has to give up his ass in order 

1791
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:24,461
to make breakfast.
We have often been the pigs giving up 

1792
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:25,400
our assets to make breakfast.
Let's start sharing them.

1793
01:46:25,401 --> 01:46:27,240
Asses what everybody else.
Thank you.

1794
01:46:31,900 --> 01:46:35,700
Thanks.

1795
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:43,190
So I'm not here to claim that there's no
such thing as oppression,

1796
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:49,530
unfairness brutality,
discrimination,

1797
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:50,400
unfair

1798
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,410
use of power.
All of those.

1799
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:57,411
Anyone with any sense knows that 
hierarchical structures tilt towards 

1800
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:02,271
tyranny and that we have to be 
constantly wakeful to ensure that all 

1801
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:08,740
they are isn't power in tyranny.
It's interesting to see here food foodco

1802
01:47:08,741 --> 01:47:10,560
referred to.
It's unfortunate,

1803
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:15,561
but it's interesting because coal like 
is French intellectual confreres 

1804
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:22,010
essentially believed that the only basis
upon which hierarchies were established 

1805
01:47:22,010 --> 01:47:25,821
his power,
and that's part of this pernicious 

1806
01:47:25,821 --> 01:47:26,640
politically correct doctrine that I've 
been speaking about.

1807
01:47:27,170 --> 01:47:32,170
When a hierarchy becomes corrupt,
then the only way to ascend it is to 

1808
01:47:32,170 --> 01:47:36,051
exercise power.
That's essentially the definition of a 

1809
01:47:36,051 --> 01:47:36,330
tyranny,
but that doesn't mean that the imperfect

1810
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,900
hierarchies that we have constructed in 
our relatively free countries,

1811
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:45,170
which at least tilt somewhat towards 
competence and ability as evidenced by 

1812
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:50,691
the staggering achievements of 
civilization that we've managed to 

1813
01:47:50,691 --> 01:47:51,840
produce.
It doesn't mean that the appropriate way

1814
01:47:51,841 --> 01:47:56,841
of diagnosing them as to assume without 
reservation unit dimensionally that 

1815
01:47:56,841 --> 01:47:58,200
they're all about power and as a 
consequence,

1816
01:47:58,201 --> 01:48:03,000
everyone who occupies any position 
within them is a tyrant or tyrant in the

1817
01:48:03,001 --> 01:48:03,540
making.

1818
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,720
And that is certainly the fundamental 
claim of someone like food co and it's 

1819
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,500
part and parcel of this.
What would you call it?

1820
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:14,640
This ideological catastrophe.
That's political correctness.

1821
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:19,820
I'm not here to argue against progress.
I'm not here to argue against equality 

1822
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:24,261
of opportunity.
Anyone with any sense understands that 

1823
01:48:24,261 --> 01:48:27,500
even if you're selfish,
you're best served by allowing yourself 

1824
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:31,881
access to the multiplicitous talents of 
everyone and to discriminate against 

1825
01:48:31,881 --> 01:48:34,200
them for arbitrary reasons unrelated to 
their competencies.

1826
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:37,710
It's a board that has nothing to do with
the issue at hand.

1827
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,140
It's it.
It isn't that good.

1828
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:43,620
Things haven't happened in the past and 
should continue to happen.

1829
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:48,800
That's not the point.
The point is the point my compatriot 

1830
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,921
fried made,
which is what we can agree on the 

1831
01:48:51,921 --> 01:48:53,790
catastrophe and we can agree on the 
historical inequity,

1832
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:59,060
but there's no way I'm going to agree 
that political correctness is the way to

1833
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:02,670
address any of that and there's plenty 
of evidence to the contrary.

1834
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:05,670
Some of which I would say was displayed 
quite clearly tonight.

1835
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:13,210
Thank you.

1836
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:22,790
So I think one of the irresolvable 
issues that we're all coming up against 

1837
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,400
is the role of feelings,
right?

1838
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:31,401
Stephen Fry is kind of asked us to 
recognize and empathize with this 

1839
01:49:32,070 --> 01:49:37,070
feeling of being silenced.
Of being threatened and I do and I get 

1840
01:49:37,291 --> 01:49:37,980
it.
Um,

1841
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,650
you know,
I feel it sometimes too in my columns.

1842
01:49:40,980 --> 01:49:45,980
I hate it when I write something that 
then gets that kind of irate twitter mob

1843
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:51,710
after me.
But if say I stood up here and said,

1844
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:58,050
you know,
recognize how threatened so many women 

1845
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:59,530
feel when,
for example,

1846
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:00,370
the,
the kind of,

1847
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:05,610
you know,
one of the best selling and most 

1848
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:07,531
prominent intellectuals in the world 
right now says in an interview that 

1849
01:50:07,531 --> 01:50:12,031
maybe the me too movement has shown that
this whole experiment of men and women 

1850
01:50:12,031 --> 01:50:13,630
working together,
it's just not working.

1851
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:16,870
Or you know,
maybe if women don't want to be.

1852
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:19,060
I don't want the workplace to be 
sexualized.

1853
01:50:19,090 --> 01:50:20,950
They shouldn't be allowed to wear 
makeup.

1854
01:50:21,070 --> 01:50:21,660
Right?
Sorry,

1855
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,630
the,
well,

1856
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,670
google it,
Google it.

1857
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:25,810
Um,
so,

1858
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:27,550
so,
right.

1859
01:50:27,551 --> 01:50:29,380
If I say like,
you know,

1860
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,990
I feel threatened,
right?

1861
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:35,080
Then I'm being kind of politically 
correct and hysterical.

1862
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:38,470
So much of the debate about political.
Correct.

1863
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:44,770
But there's one group that really does 
think it's feeling should be 

1864
01:50:44,770 --> 01:50:49,061
accommodated.
And that is what we keep coming up 

1865
01:50:49,061 --> 01:50:49,220
against is that,
you know,

1866
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:53,330
there's a group of people and to some 
extent I'm part of it,

1867
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:58,570
that feels uniquely that our feelings of
being silenced or marginalized,

1868
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:05,200
censored.
That those feelings need to take 

1869
01:51:05,200 --> 01:51:05,870
primacy,
that we can kind of,

1870
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:07,300
um,
you know,

1871
01:51:07,310 --> 01:51:12,310
sneer when these other groups for us to 
take seriously their feelings of being 

1872
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:18,980
threatened or their feelings of being 
marginalized.

1873
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:24,010
Then we call it,
we call that we call those demands 

1874
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:24,020
political correctness.

1875
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:29,500
And I would finally say that I think 
there is a fair amount of research that 

1876
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:33,911
people become more closed minded,
more tribal when they feel threatened,

1877
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:38,750
when they feel that their group identity
is at stake.

1878
01:51:38,810 --> 01:51:43,810
And so as much as you know,
you want to blame the left for the rise 

1879
01:51:44,601 --> 01:51:49,601
of the right.
I think that when you kind of bet the 

1880
01:51:49,601 --> 01:51:53,411
rise of the right,
the rise of people who are questioning 

1881
01:51:53,411 --> 01:51:56,780
the fundamental ideals of pluralistic 
liberal democracy,

1882
01:51:57,080 --> 01:51:59,600
the more of those views are 
mainstreamed.

1883
01:51:59,750 --> 01:52:04,010
The more people I think are going to 
shut down in response because people are

1884
01:52:04,310 --> 01:52:05,270
really scared.

1885
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:11,220
Thank you.
First of all,

1886
01:52:14,591 --> 01:52:14,860
I think

1887
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:19,790
all the debaters I think we want to 
thank the audience you were engaged were

1888
01:52:19,791 --> 01:52:24,080
mostly civil and lots of civil in ways.
I think that we enjoy it,

1889
01:52:24,081 --> 01:52:26,030
so I think on behalf of the debaters 
everybody.

1890
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:28,490
Thank you audience.
This was a challenging topic.

1891
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:34,200
Great job.
You

1892
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,930
too.
Our debaters know it's one thing.

1893
01:52:36,990 --> 01:52:41,990
All of these four give regular speeches,
but it's a very different thing to come 

1894
01:52:41,990 --> 01:52:44,040
on and into stage in front of a live 
audience,

1895
01:52:44,041 --> 01:52:49,041
a large television,
and have your ideas a contested in real 

1896
01:52:49,341 --> 01:52:50,480
time.
And,

1897
01:52:50,481 --> 01:52:52,760
uh,
again to all four of you.

1898
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:54,930
Thank you for accepting our invitation 
to

1899
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:59,960
come here to thank a few final notes.

1900
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,020
First,
thank you to the foundation and the monk

1901
01:53:10,030 --> 01:53:14,000
family for once again convening us here 
at Roy Thompson Hall.

1902
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:16,280
We're going to do it all again this 
coming autumn.

1903
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:19,190
All of you have a ballot here in the 
hall.

1904
01:53:19,191 --> 01:53:24,191
You can vote on your way out.
We'll have those results for you just 

1905
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:27,200
probably after nine,
15.

1906
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:32,440
And let's just quickly review where your
opinions stood at the beginning of 

1907
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:37,120
tonight's contest on the motion.
Be it resolved what I call political 

1908
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:38,740
correctness,
what you call it,

1909
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:40,580
political correctness.
I call progress.

1910
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:43,610
Thirty six percent agrees.
Sixty four percent disagree.

1911
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,980
And again,
we saw a large percentage of you willing

1912
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:50,981
to change your mind 87 percent.
So let's see how tonight's cut and 

1913
01:53:50,981 --> 01:53:55,931
thrust affected your voting here you've 
got your ballots.

1914
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:59,990
And again,

So go there,

1926
01:55:35,461 --> 01:55:40,461
check it out,
see how each of these debaters did in 

1927
01:55:40,461 --> 01:55:40,461
terms of their opening statements that 
are rebuttals.

1928
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:42,960
The moderated section in the closing 
statements,

1929
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,130
we see any changes

1930
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:45,810
there.

01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:52,620
Jordan Peterson,
get their thoughts on how the evening 

1933
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:55,580
played out.
Gentlemen,

1934
01:55:56,941 --> 01:55:59,040
thank you.
Thank you both.

1935
01:55:59,100 --> 01:56:04,100
We're just gonna do a quick discussion 
with the online audience who's watching 

1936
01:56:04,100 --> 01:56:06,540
right now just to get your reactions to 
the debate and maybe to start with you.

1937
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:07,170
Uh,
Jordan.

1938
01:56:07,171 --> 01:56:08,760
There were some heated moments here.
Did that,

1939
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:14,150
that surprise you,
that a exchanges that you had with 

1940
01:56:14,150 --> 01:56:14,980
Michael Eric Dyson?
Well,

1941
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,710
I wouldn't say it surprised me.
Well,

1942
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:21,711
I suppose it probably did.
It just seem didn't seem like a very 

1943
01:56:21,711 --> 01:56:23,430
good tactical move and I stand by what I
said.

1944
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:28,431
I don't see any reason at all that my 
racial identity needed to be dragged 

1945
01:56:28,431 --> 01:56:32,451
into the discussion,
the independent of my personality 

1946
01:56:32,451 --> 01:56:35,180
proclivity.
I would say what I just said to Mr Frye 

1947
01:56:35,180 --> 01:56:35,370
here is that it was a pleasure sharing 
the stage with him.

1948
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:40,370
I've rarely heard anyone ever deliver 
their convictions with such a remarkable

1949
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:46,581
sense of passion.
And we have 10 forbearance and 

1950
01:56:46,581 --> 01:56:46,581
erudition.
It was,

1951
01:56:46,750 --> 01:56:48,870
it was really something.
And Steven,

1952
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,990
the challenging debate because in a 
sense we're trying to mesh two different

1953
01:56:51,991 --> 01:56:53,610
views here,
two different worldviews,

1954
01:56:53,611 --> 01:56:55,920
one very focused more on identity 
politics,

1955
01:56:55,921 --> 01:56:58,830
group identity.
You in a sense having an argument really

1956
01:56:58,831 --> 01:57:03,831
more about the larger culture itself and
the tenor and tone of the conversation 

1957
01:57:03,831 --> 01:57:06,720
with the DM is being a little kind of 
scuffled gum really in the.

1958
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:12,270
It's got the gun and two specific that I
just taken very literally the popular 

1959
01:57:12,270 --> 01:57:16,581
idea that greatness as being a kind of 
control of language and the shutting 

1960
01:57:16,711 --> 01:57:21,711
down and phrases or an introduction of 
others and the kind of day to day as 

1961
01:57:23,270 --> 01:57:28,270
they say,
human resource departments of 

1962
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:28,270
corporations and that sort of thing.

1963
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:32,300
And so I was slightly disappointed that 
it just became a debate about race and 

1964
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:36,240
about gender and so on.
But that was,

1965
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,080
I guess not true and I still didn't 
know.

1966
01:57:38,081 --> 01:57:39,960
The fact is I,
I,

1967
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:45,260
I'm still a lefty but a software.
I'm just don't have to soft squishy in 

1968
01:57:47,701 --> 01:57:52,701
every sentence.
And I realized that that's not a 

1969
01:57:52,701 --> 01:57:55,941
political point of view.
It is a personal and the gap between the

1970
01:57:56,461 --> 01:58:01,461
personal and the political,
which is space you obviously very 

1971
01:58:01,461 --> 01:58:04,041
interested in is as a psychologist is 
one that is rarely explored a few people

1972
01:58:05,401 --> 01:58:10,401
that are either so personal that it has 
no application in the outside world and 

1973
01:58:10,401 --> 01:58:13,650
the Organization of Human Affairs or the
soap or the decal and so much to do with

1974
01:58:13,651 --> 01:58:18,651
structure and distinction between 
hierarchies and networks and so on that 

1975
01:58:18,651 --> 01:58:22,730
they forget the individual and that's 
the space in which the impassionate 

1976
01:58:22,911 --> 01:58:27,911
liberal lives and it's not easy to do it
because you often do sound rather wet 

1977
01:58:27,911 --> 01:58:29,850
and I'm aware that I,
I enjoyed it.

1978
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,470
Thank you for coming.
You just finally,

1979
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:36,471
before I,
for you to both to a well earned drank 

1980
01:58:36,471 --> 01:58:36,471
a,
anything left unsaid.

1981
01:58:36,471 --> 01:58:36,890
Jordan,
any,

1982
01:58:36,891 --> 01:58:39,420
um,
any point that you wanted to make that,

1983
01:58:39,421 --> 01:58:44,421
uh,
you didn't feel you had the time or the 

1984
01:58:44,421 --> 01:58:44,421
opportunity?

1985
01:58:44,421 --> 01:58:44,421
No,
I think so.

1986
01:58:44,421 --> 01:58:44,480
I said my piece.
Yeah.

1987
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:46,380
Great.
Same question to you is do you know,

1988
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:51,390
I think I heard got across,
I mean there's so much you can talk 

1989
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:51,390
about in,
in,

1990
01:58:51,390 --> 01:58:54,930
in that field,
and I just wanted to leave with the 

1991
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:54,930
point that I do want,
like everybody,

1992
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:54,930
it's,
it's,

1993
01:58:54,930 --> 01:58:56,860
it's a no brainer.
We want the world to be fairer,

1994
01:58:57,110 --> 01:58:58,570
Justa,
sweeter kinder.

1995
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:02,290
Um,
but it's how you get the a and m.

1996
01:59:02,650 --> 01:59:04,660
I felt like I wasn't really addressed.
Okay.

1997
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:07,390
Well gentlemen,
thank you both very much from our online

1998
01:59:07,391 --> 01:59:08,830
audience.
A big thank you.

1999
01:59:08,831 --> 01:59:13,831
Also,
I know Jordan Peterson and Stephen Fry 

2000
01:59:13,831 --> 01:59:13,831
for participating in A.
Yeah,

2001
01:59:13,831 --> 01:59:15,070
in a debate with some steaks on the 
table for sure.

2002
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,230
Thank you gentlemen.
See seeing the reception you,

2003
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:20,710
but again,
online viewers.

2004
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:25,770
We've now have Michael Eric dyson coming
into the camera range here with Michelle

2005
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:28,840
Goldberg to get their reactions to the 
debate.

2006
01:59:28,841 --> 01:59:31,510
So guys,
thank you for being part of this.

2007
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,170
You know,
it's a,

2008
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:37,860
it's a complicated subjects.
It's got a lot of different moving 

2009
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:40,921
pieces and elements.
I think we addressed some of the 

2010
01:59:40,921 --> 01:59:40,921
constituent parts.
Maybe start with you,

2011
01:59:40,921 --> 01:59:45,541
Michelle.
Was there something on stage that you 

2012
01:59:45,541 --> 01:59:49,020
wanted to say that maybe we didn't have 
the time or you didn't have the 

2013
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:49,020
opportunity?
Uh,

2014
01:59:49,020 --> 01:59:49,930
you know,
now's your chance.

2015
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:50,970
Well,
you know,

2016
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:56,100
I guess I,
the only thing I can think of is that 

2017
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,291
maybe I wished that we could have 
drilled down a little bit more into the 

2018
01:59:58,291 --> 02:00:00,120
gender piece of this and again too,
you know,

2019
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:02,580
what we're really arguing about,
um,

2020
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:07,590
particularly with Mr Peterson and the 
kind of range of progress,

2021
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:12,740
the range of feminist progress that he 
considers political correctness.

2022
02:00:13,301 --> 02:00:18,280
I think part of the frustration is that 
him and Steven Fry are talking about and

2023
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:23,281
defending,
I think a fairly discrete set of ideas 

2024
02:00:23,281 --> 02:00:23,281
with some overlap.
Um,

2025
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:23,710
you know,
in,

2026
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:27,520
one of the difficult things about 
political correctness is it's a slippery

2027
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:32,490
term that's deployed to talk about a 
whole range of phenomenon and

2028
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:35,150
closed down conversation and open up 
conversation.

2029
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:38,330
How did you feel a Michael?
There were some points.

2030
02:00:38,331 --> 02:00:42,080
There are some points of sharp exchange.
We appreciate that at the munk debates.

2031
02:00:42,081 --> 02:00:43,310
I mean,
this is not a place for,

2032
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:46,880
for a shrinking wallflowers,
but,

2033
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:48,980
uh,
any unsaid thoughts,

2034
02:00:48,981 --> 02:00:52,460
any,
anything that you want to put a point on

2035
02:00:52,461 --> 02:00:53,710
now,
I think you have to hold people

2036
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:58,950
intellectually accountable and to deny 
some of the things to Michelle that he 

2037
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:03,961
said and to present himself Mr Peterson 
in a certain way without seeing some of 

2038
02:01:03,961 --> 02:01:08,731
the important things he said about women
and other minorities I think demands an 

2039
02:01:09,911 --> 02:01:14,560
engaged response to him.
And I think that the idea itself,

2040
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:19,860
as Michelle stated repeatedly and,
and Mr Fried talked about his 

2041
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:19,860
frustration.
He said,

2042
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:21,100
we've talked about everything but 
political correctness.

2043
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:26,580
Well,
the reality is political correctness 

2044
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:27,280
resides.
I mean rests upon some serious political

2045
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:29,830
work in this culture in the UK,
Canada,

2046
02:01:29,831 --> 02:01:32,560
and in America that needs to be done.
And what I tried to,

2047
02:01:32,620 --> 02:01:37,620
in terms of giving a brief genealogy,
we didn't have political correctness as 

2048
02:01:37,620 --> 02:01:37,930
long as white,
straight men were in charge.

2049
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:41,360
There was no argument about let's get 
this right.

2050
02:01:41,990 --> 02:01:46,100
But when people who exercise power,
no longer exercise,

2051
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,440
absolute power,
still predominant power,

2052
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:53,060
then there's an argument and I think 
Michelle's point about gender,

2053
02:01:53,390 --> 02:01:55,490
about the workplace,
about race,

2054
02:01:55,491 --> 02:02:00,491
about sexuality and the lake.
I just think that it was a necessarily 

2055
02:02:00,491 --> 02:02:03,300
vigorous and sometimes sharply worded a 
debate between the.

2056
02:02:03,301 --> 02:02:04,520
So Michelle,
final word to you.

2057
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:11,260
Well,
if you are curious about the quote that 

2058
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:13,730
I mentioned about,
you know,

2059
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:16,400
maybe this experiment with women and men
working together.

2060
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:18,380
Maybe it's not working.
I mean please do Google it.

2061
02:02:18,381 --> 02:02:21,980
It's an interview with vice columns for 
doing one of your colleagues.

2062
02:02:22,570 --> 02:02:26,930
But again,
I didn't know me and Steven,

2063
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:31,960
me and Stephen Fry probably could have 
sat on the same side of another debate.

2064
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:37,390
But again,
I feel like the phrase political 

2065
02:02:37,390 --> 02:02:40,061
correctness has expanded to cover a 
whole range of challenges too.

2066
02:02:41,810 --> 02:02:46,810
I thought it was really interesting how 
much people were talking about their 

2067
02:02:46,810 --> 02:02:48,710
feelings because when,
when women talk about their feelings,

2068
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:51,020
right?
That is politically correct.

2069
02:02:51,050 --> 02:02:53,630
Excess.
And when,

2070
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:59,170
when men talk about this feeling that 
they can't empirically define,

2071
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:00,650
we should all,
I guess,

2072
02:03:00,651 --> 02:03:02,210
I don't know,
change,

2073
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,530
change in deference to that.

2074
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:05,340
Okay guys,
great thoughts.

2075
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,940
Let's go get a drink and the reception 
that.

2076
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:08,340
Thank you.
I'm buying.

2077
02:03:08,341 --> 02:03:09,390
Okay.
Thanks.

2078
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:10,770
Thanks again.
Hey,

2079

2080

Thank you for being part of this monk 
debates.

2081

Uh,

2082
02:03:19,701 --> 02:03:19,701
semiannual,

again for free.
So share it with friends and family.

2093
02:03:54,750 --> 02:03:59,750
I'm your Griffis from downtown Toronto,
Canada at the monk debate on political 

2094
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:00,960
correctness.
See again in the autumn,

2095
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:01,650
take care.
Good

2096
02:04:01,740 --> 02:04:02,000
night.
