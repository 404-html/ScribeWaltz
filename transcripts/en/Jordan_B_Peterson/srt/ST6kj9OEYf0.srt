1
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,430
Put me into minds.
Even mediocre minds operate better under

2
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,354
stimulus.

3
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,740
Cod Canadian is a Canadian and you can't
take away

4
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,390
someone got into.

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,473
Barack Obama has systematically rebuild 
the trust of the world in our 

6
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:43,550
willingness to work through the Security
Council and other institutions.

7
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,400
You must not talk to anybody in the 
world,

8
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,263
any of our allies,
if whatever you want to call this 

9
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:49,490
system,
a mafia,

10
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:53,660
state of feudal empire,
it's a disaster for ordinary Russians.

11
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,140
Brilliant minds getting mediocre minds 
operate better under stimulus.

12
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Cod Canadian is a Canadian and you can't
take away away,

13
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,223
has systematically rebuild the trust of 
the world in our willingness to work 

14
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,060
through the Security Council and other 
institution.

15
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,880
You must not talk to anybody in the 
world,

16
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,460
any of our allies,
whatever you want to call this system,

17
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,770
a mafia,
state of feudal empire.

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,993
It's a disaster for ordinary Russians.
I think that's the kind of hypocritical 

19
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,580
argument that if I were tiny,
I find quite annoying.

20
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
I need,
but in Belize you can beat it.

21
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,880
Described it's been bad.
Again,

22
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,723
management,
science and religion are not 

23
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:53,960
incompatible.
Religion Forces Nice people to do unkind

24
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,100
things.
Amen.

25
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,010
Obsolete.
Uh,

26
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,770
Mike conclusion to this question is,
no,

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,970
I won't let you be.
You

28
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,250
show me yours pretext.
I quoted them saying,

29
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:06,010
show me the free program.
You can keep screaming,

30
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,600
man,
and it doesn't change the points.

31
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,630
We do not want sympathy.
We did not want pity.

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,220
We want opportunities.
It's an appalling slander to me,

33
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,250
to the Muslim religion.
I never said the word Muslim in my film,

34
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,750
the nation.
It was a Muslim free form in nature.

35
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,940
It is that kind of restraint.
It is that kind of sober minded,

36
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:28,774
sensible,
intelligent foreign policy that Obama 

37
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,354
represents.
So I guess what I'm telling you is he 

38
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,400
sort of a closet Canadian vote for him 
for God.

39
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,793
Sorry

40
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,360
Ladies and gentlemen and welcome.
My name is right here.

41
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,560
Griffis since my privilege that I have 
the opportunity to

42
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,590
moderate tonight's debates and to act as
your organizer,

43
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,260
I want to start by welcoming the North 
American.

44
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:01,261
Why television audience tuning in right 
now across Canada on Seapak,

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Canada's public affairs channel c span

46
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:12,031

active@thismomentonfacebookliveatbloomberg.com

and munk debates stock calm.
It's great to have you as virtual 

49
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:24,784
participants in tonight's proceedings 
and hello to you the over 3000 people 

50
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:34,360
who filled Roy Thomson Hall for yet 
another monk debate.

51
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,194
Thank you for your support for more and 
better debate on the big issues of the 

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,433
day.
This debate marks the start of our 10th 

53
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:44,374
season and we begin this season missing 
someone who was vital to this debate 

54
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:53,560
series in every aspect.
It was his passion for ideas,

55
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,561
his love for debate that inspired our 
creation in 2008 and it was his energy,

56
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,203
his generosity,
and his drive that was so important in 

57
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:05,044
allowing us to really win international 
acclaim as one of the world's great 

58
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,980
debating series,
his philanthropy,

59
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,570
it's legacy.
Wow.

60
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:15,160
It's incredible.
Last fall,

61
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:19,030
we all remember that hundred million 
dollar donation to cardiac health.

62
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,660
Here in Toronto transforming the lives 
of tens of thousands.

63
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,260
It's a million Canadians to come.
Rob,

64
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,043
we're all big fans and supporters of a 
terrific school for global affairs on 

65
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:39,270
the uft campus represented here tonight 
by many students who are in its master's

66
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,710
program.
Congratulations

67
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,643
you

68
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,703
also in a generous endowment last spring
to this series that will allow us to 

69
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:50,354
organize many evenings like this for 
many more years to come now knowing our 

70
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:58,080
benefactor as we,
uh,

71
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,914
the last thing he'd want is for us to 
mark his absence with a moment of 

72
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,970
silence.
That wasn't his style.

73
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,050
So let's instead celebrate a great 
Canadian,

74
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,913
a great life,
and a great legacy of the late Peter 

75
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,133
Munk Bravo Keytar

76
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,940
[inaudible].

77
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,473
I know he would have enjoyed that and I 
want to just thank a Melanie Anthony 

78
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Chainy for being here tonight to be part
of Peter's continuing positive impact on

79
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,500
public debate in Canada.
Thank you guys

80
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,960
for being here tonight.

81
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,260
Now,
knowing Peter is,

82
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,153
I did the first thing on his mind at 
this point in the debate would be right 

83
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,140
here.
Stop talking.

84
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,140
Get this debate underway.
Get our debaters out here.

85
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on,
you got to show on the road.

86
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:23,834
So we're going to do that right now 
because we have a terrific debate lined 

87
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,394
up for you this evening.
So let's introduce first our pro team 

88
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,284
arguing for tonight's motion.
Be it resolved what you call political 

89
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:41,810
correctness.
I call progress.

Please welcome to the stage.

Michael's debating partner is also a 
award winning author.

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She's a columnist at the New York Times 
and someone who is going to bring a very

97
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,010
distinct and powerful perspective 
tonight.

98
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,960
Michelle Goldberg.
Michelle,

99
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:23,600

100
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,600
[inaudible]

101
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,423
so one great team of debaters deserves 
another and arguing against our 

102
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,274
resolution,
be it resolved what you call political 

103
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,094
correctness.
I call progress is the Emmy Award

and tonight and debater,
Stephen Fry.

108
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
[inaudible].

109

Ladies and Gentlemen,

112
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,100
Toronto's Jordan Peterson.

113
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,550
[inaudible].
Okay,

114
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,370
we're

115
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,310
going to get our debate underway 
momentarily,

116
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,650
but first,
a quick checklist to go through it.

117
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:43,470
We've got a hashtag tonight hash at munk
debates.

118
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,670
Those of you in the hall and those of 
you watching online,

119
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,080
please,
uh,

120
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:51,210
we in,
let's get your opinions going.

121
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,403
Also,
for those of you watching online right 

122
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,990
now,
we haven't running pole a ww munk,

123
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,770
debates.com,
forward slash votes reflect input,

124
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:05,790
react to this debate as it unfolds over 
the next hour and a half.

125
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,510
Uh,
my favorite part aspect of the show that

126
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,410
was Peter's a brilliance and creation.
We have our countdown clock.

127
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,540
What this does is it keeps our debaters 
on their toes and our debate on time.

128
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,580
So when you see these clocks on the 
screen,

129
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,414
go down to zero.
I wanted you to join me in a warm round 

130
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:27,150
of applause and,
uh,

131
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,980
we'll have a debate that ends when it's 
supposed to end.

132
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,420
Uh,
now,

133
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,690
let's see.
We had our resolution tonight on the way

134
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:37,524
in.
We have this audience of roughly 3000 

135
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:39,654
people here in downtown Toronto vote on 
be it resolved what you call political 

136
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:45,690
correctness.
I call progress.

137
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,170
Let's see the agreed disagree on that 
number.

138
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,890
36% agree.
64% disagree.

139
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:53,724
So a room and play.
Now we asked you how many of you are 

140
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,290
open to changing your vote over the 
course of the debate?

141
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,820
Are you fixed,
agree,

142
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,270
disagree,
or could you potentially be convinced by

143
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:11,271
one or other of these two teams to move 
your vote over the next hour and a half?

144
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:14,700
Let's see those numbers now.
Wow.

145
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay.
A pretty open minded crowd.

146
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:21,801
This debate is very much in play and as 
per the agreed upon order of speakers,

147
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,140
I'm going to call him Michelle Goldberg 
first.

148
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,410
Michelle,
would you like a sip of water?

149
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,280
Are you gonna have a sip of water?
Okay,

150
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,510
we're ready to start a column.
Michelle Goldberg first for her.

151
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,770
Six minutes of opening remarks.
Michelle,

152
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,780
thank you for having me.
And as regular notice,

153
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,673
I initially balked a little bit at the 
resolution that we're debating because 

154
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,324
there are a lot of things that fall 
under the rubric of political 

155
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:45,024
correctness that I don't call progress.
I don't like no platforming or twitter 

156
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,360
or,
um,

157
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,010
trigger warnings.
Um,

158
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,070
you know,
like a lot of

159
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
middle age liberals,
there are many aspects of students' 

160
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,010
social justice culture that I find off 
putting,

161
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,150
although I'm not sure that that 
particular generation gap is anything,

162
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,073
is anything new.
I'm on the record about the toxicity of 

163
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,100
social media,
call out culture.

164
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,910
And I think it's good to debate people 
whose ideas I don't like,

165
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,680
which is why I'm here.
Um,

166
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,010
so if there are social justice warriors 
and the audience,

167
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,530
I feel like I should apologize to you 
because I'm probably not,

168
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,790
you're probably gonna feel like I'm not 
adequately defending your ideas.

169
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,673
Um,
but the reason I'm on this side of the 

170
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:33,451
stage is that political correctness 
isn't just a term for left wing excesses

171
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,323
on college campuses or people being 
terrible on twitter especially is 

172
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,920
deployed by Mr. Peterson.
I think it can be a way to deal,

173
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:46,840
legitimize any attempt for women and 
racial and sexual minorities to overcome

174
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,740
discrimination or even to argue that 
such discrimination is real.

175
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,540
Um,
in the New York Times today,

176
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,630
Mr. Peterson says,
quote,

177
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,070
the people who hold that aisle that our 
culture isn't an oppressive patriarchy.

178
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,010
They don't want to admit that the 
current hierarchy might be predicated on

179
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:03,844
competence.
That sounds particularly in scene to me 

180
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:09,400
because I'm an American and our 
president is Donald Trump.

181
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,263
But,
um,

182
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,483
but it's an assumption that I think 
underlies a worldview in which any 

183
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:20,050
challenges to the current hierarchy are 
written off as political correctness.

184
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,693
I also think we should be clear that 
this isn't really a debate about free 

185
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,780
speech.
Um,

186
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,883
Mr. Peterson once referred to what he 
called quote that evil trinity of 

187
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,130
equity,
diversity and inclusivity and said those

188
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:33,964
three words,
if you hear people mouth those three 

189
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:36,880
words,
equity,

190
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:38,410
diversity,
and inclusivity,

191
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,350
you know who you're dealing with and you
should step away from that because it is

192
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:43,070
not acceptable.
Um,

193
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,390
he argues that the movie frozen is 
politically correct propaganda.

194
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:51,450
And at one point he floated the idea of 
creating a database of university course

195
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,730
content so students could avoid 
postmodern critical theory.

196
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,940
So in the criticism of political 
correctness,

197
00:13:57,941 --> 00:13:58,774
I sometimes hear an urge or an attempt 
to purge our thought of certain 

198
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:04,114
analytical categories that viewers,
I think the worst characatures of the 

199
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,334
social justice left that want to get rid
of anything that smacks of colonialism 

200
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,040
or patriarchy or white supremacy.
I also don't really think we're debating

201
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,990
the value of the enlightenment.
Um,

202
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,630
at least not in the way that somebody 
like Mr. Frye.

203
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,000
I think as a champion of enlightenment 
values springs,

204
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,834
it,
that Fritz to expand rights and 

205
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,204
privileges once granted just to land 
owning white heterosexual men is the 

206
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,084
enlightenment or it's very much in 
keeping with the enlightenment to quote 

207
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,870
a dead white man,
John Stuart Mill,

208
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,793
the despotism of custom is everywhere,
the standing hindrance to human 

209
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:46,360
advancement.

210
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,703
Um,
I think that some of our opponents by 

211
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:55,591
contrast challenges to the despotism of 
custom as politically correct attacks on

212
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:59,250
a transcendent natural order.
Um,

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,210
to quote Mr. Peterson again,
each gender,

214
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,670
each sex has its own and fairness to 
deal with.

215
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,330
But to think of it as a consequence of 
the shoulders of the social structure.

216
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,200
It's like,
come on,

217
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,270
really.
What about nature itself?

218
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,330
Um,
but there's an exception to this because

219
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:18,830
he does believe in social interventions 
to remedy some kinds of unfairness,

220
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,143
which is why in the New York Times he 
calls for quote enforced monogamy to 

221
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:26,660
remedy the woes of men who don't get 
their equal distribution of sex.

222
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,303
Um,
when it comes to the political 

223
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,464
correctness debate,
we've been exactly here before the Alan 

224
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,233
Blum,
the author of the closing of the 

225
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:40,691
American mind compared the tyranny of 
feminism in academia to the Khmer Rouge.

226
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,210
And he was writing at a time when women 
accounted for 10% of all college tenured

227
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,084
faculty.

228
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,020
It's worth looking back at what was 
considered annoyingly,

229
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:51,854
outrageously,
politically correct in the 1980s the 

230
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:56,450
last time we had this debate,
you know,

231
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,020
having to call or not being able to call
indigenous people,

232
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:03,080
quote Indians are having to use 
hyphenated terms,

233
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:06,200
at least in the United States of terms 
like African Americans,

234
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,393
you know,
adding women or people of color to the 

235
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:09,164
western Civ curriculum,
not making gay jokes or using retard is 

236
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,710
an epithet.
And I kind of get it,

237
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,330
right,
new concepts,

238
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,193
new words,
sort of sticking your throat the way 

239
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:24,770
we're used to talking and thinking seem 
natural and normal,

240
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,690
you know,
by definition.

241
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,380
And then the new terms and new concepts 
that have social utility stick and those

242
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,110
that don't fall away.
So if you go back to the 1970s,

243
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,251
ms,
you know,

244
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:42,251
ms as an alternative to miss or Mrs 
stuck around and women with a y didn't.

245
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,993
Um,
and I think that some day I hope that 

246
00:16:45,551 --> 00:16:46,384
someday we'll look back and marvel at 
the idea that gender neutral pronouns 

247
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:52,940
ever seen like an existential threat to 
anyone.

248
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,850
Um,
but I also don't think it's clear that,

249
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:56,743
you know,
that might not happen because if you 

250
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,624
look around the world right now,
there are plenty of places that have 

251
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,314
indeed dialed back cosmopolitanism and 
reinstated patriarchy in the name of 

252
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:11,840
staving off chaos and they seem like 
terrible places to live.

253
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,920
Um,
you know,

254
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:13,754
I come to you from the United States,
which is currently undergoing a 

255
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,344
monumental attempt to roll back social 
progress in the name of overcoming 

256
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:24,710
political correctness.
And as someone who lives there,

257
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,560
I assure you,
it feels nothing like progress.

258
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,453
Thank you.

259
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,910
[inaudible]

260
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,670
great.
Start to the debate Michelle.

261
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:40,504
Thank you.
I'm now going to ask Jordan Peterson to 

262
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,260
speak for the con team.

263
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,943
Hello.

264
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,470
So we should first decide what we're 
talking about.

265
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,683
We're not talking about my views of 
political correctness despite what you 

266
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,650
might have inferred from the last 
speaker's comments.

267
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:06,203
This is how it looks to me.
We essentially need something 

268
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:14,151
approximating a low resolution grant 
narrative to unitus and,

269
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,300
and we did a narrative to is because 
otherwise we don't have peace.

270
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,873
What's playing out in the universities 
and in broader society right now is a 

271
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:26,940
debate between two fundamental low 
resolution narratives.

272
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,043
Neither of which can be completely 
accurate because they can't encompass 

273
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,074
all the details.
Obviously human beings have an 

274
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,800
individual element and a collective 
element,

275
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,023
a group element.
Let's say the question is what story 

276
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,324
should be paramount?
And this is how it looks to me in the 

277
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:46,680
west,
we have reasonably functional,

278
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:49,500
reasonably free,
remarkably productive,

279
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,334
stable hierarchies that are open to 
consideration of the dispossessed that 

280
00:18:56,521 --> 00:18:58,860
hierarchies generally create.

281
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,490
Our societies are freer and functioning 
more effectively than any societies,

282
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,660
anywhere else in the world.
And that,

283
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,870
and then any societies ever have.
And as far as I'm concerned,

284
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,820
and I think there's good reason to 
assume this,

285
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:14,400
it's because the fundamental low 
resolution,

286
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,513
uh,
grant narrative that we've oriented 

287
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:20,370
ourselves around in the West is one of 
the sovereignty of the individual.

288
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:25,230
And it's predicated on the idea that all
things considered the best way for me to

289
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,064
interact with someone else's individual 
to individual and to react to that 

290
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:33,630
person as if they're both part of the 
process.

291
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,220
Because that's the right way of thinking
about it.

292
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:36,054
The psychological process by which 
things we don't understand can yet be 

293
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:43,410
explored and buy things that aren't 
properly organized in our society can be

294
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:44,244
yet set.
Right.

295
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,770
And the reason we're valuable as 
individuals,

296
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,813
both with regards to our rights and 
responsibilities is because that's our 

297
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,390
essential purpose.

298
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,060
And that's our nobility and that's our 
function.

299
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,590
What's happening as far as I'm concerned
in the universities in particular,

300
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,840
and spreading very rapidly out into the 
broader world,

301
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:05,460
including the corporate world,
much to it's much to what should be,

302
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,294
its chagrin is a collectivist narrative.
And of course there's some utility in a 

303
00:20:11,581 --> 00:20:14,520
collectivist narrative cause we're all a
part of groups in different ways.

304
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:15,623
But the collectivist narrative that I 
regard as politically correct as a 

305
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:19,524
pastiche of a strange pastiche of 
postmodernism and neo Marxism and its 

306
00:20:23,491 --> 00:20:27,660
fundamental claim is that no,
you're not essentially an individual.

307
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,613
You're essentially a member of a group.
And that group might be your ethnicity 

308
00:20:33,271 --> 00:20:35,490
and it might be your sex and it might be
a race.

309
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:36,324
And it might be any of the endless 
numbers of other potential groups that 

310
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:40,314
you belong to because you belong to many
of them and that you should be 

311
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:44,184
essentially categorized along with those
who are light cue on that dimension in 

312
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,590
that group.

313
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,423
That's proposition number one.
Proposition number two is that the 

314
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:51,724
proper way to view the world is as a 
battle ground between groups of 

315
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:59,650
different power so you define the groups
first and then you assume that you,

316
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,890
you you view the individual from the 
group context.

317
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:03,724
You viewed the battle between groups 
from the group context and you view 

318
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:07,294
history itself as a consequence of 
nothing but the power maneuvers between 

319
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:14,020
different groups.
That eliminates any consideration of the

320
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:14,854
individual and at a very fundamental 
level and also any idea for example of 

321
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:23,650
free speech because if you're 
collectivist at heart in this manner,

322
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,633
there is no such thing as free speech.
It isn't that it's debated by those on 

323
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:31,690
the radical left and let's say the rest 
of us so to speak.

324
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,680
It's that in that formulation there's no
such thing as free speech because for an

325
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,870
individualist,
free speech is how you make sense of the

326
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,180
world and reorganize society in a proper
manner.

327
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,300
But for the radical left type 
collectivist,

328
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,910
it's associated with this viewpoint of 
political correctness.

329
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,640
When you speak,
all you're doing is playing a power game

330
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,474
on behalf of your group and there's 
nothing else that you can do because 

331
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,653
that's all there is.
And not only is that all there is in 

332
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:58,990
terms of who you are as an individual 
now and how society should be viewed.

333
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,360
It's also the fundamental narrative of 
history.

334
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,310
For example,
it's,

335
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,153
it's widely assumed in our universities 
now that the best way to conceptualize 

336
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,703
Western civilization is as an oppressive
male dominated patriarchy and that the 

337
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,624
best way to construe relationships 
between men and women across the 

338
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,080
centuries is one of oppression of women 
by men as like,

339
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,370
well,
look,

340
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,550
no hierarchy is without its tyranny.
That's a,

341
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,633
that's an axiomatic truth.
People have recognized that literally 

342
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:30,424
for thousands of years and hierarchies 
do tend towards tyranny and they tend 

343
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:37,450
towards the usurpation by people with 
power,

344
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,403
but that only happens when they become 
corrupt and we have mechanisms in our 

345
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,650
society to stop hierarchies from 
becoming intolerable,

346
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:45,484
be corrupt,
and they actually work pretty well and 

347
00:22:47,171 --> 00:22:48,430
so and so.

348
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,170
I would also,
I would also,

349
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,390
I would also point this out,
you know,

350
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,703
don't be thinking that this is a debate 
about whether empathy is useful or not 

351
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,130
or that the people on the con side of 
the argument are not empathetic.

352
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,070
I know perfectly well as I'm as an sure 
Mr. Fry does that.

353
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,293
Hierarchies tend to produce situations 
where people stack up at the bottom and 

354
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:10,510
that the dispossessed and hierarchies 
need a political voice,

355
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:12,390
which is the proper voice of the left by
the way,

356
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,224
and the necessary voice of the left.
But that is not the same as proclaiming 

357
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,494
that the right level of analysis for our
grand unifying narrative is that all of 

358
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:21,904
us are fundamentally to be identified by
the groups that we belong to and to 

359
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:26,794
construe the entire world as the 
battleground between different forms of 

360
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,550
tyranny in consequence of that group 
affiliation.

361
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,940
And to the degree that we play out that 
narrative,

362
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,800
that won't be progress.
Believe me.

363
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,770
And we certainly haven't seen that 
progress in the universities.

364
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,210
We've seen situations like what happened
at Wilfrid laurier university had stead,

365
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,083
we won't see progress.
What will return to is exactly the same 

366
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:51,840
kind of tribalism to characterize the 
lab.

367
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Thank you Jordan.

368
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,991
Uh,
Michael,

369
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:05,720
Eric Dyson.
Your six minutes starts now.

370
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,993
Thank you very kindly.
Wonderful opportunity to be here in 

371
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,920
Canada.
Um,

372
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
well thank you so much.
I'm going to stand here at the podium.

373
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,234
I'm a preacher
and I will ask for an offering at the 

374
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:21,794
end of my presentation.
This is the swimsuit competition of the 

375
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:26,774
intellectual beauty pageant.
So let me show you the curves of my 

376
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:32,720
thought.
Oh my God.

377
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,090
Was that a politically incorrect 
statement I just made?

378
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,793
How did we get to the point where the 
hijacking of the discourse on political 

379
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:45,641
correctness has become a kind of magnet 
keen distinction between us and them?

380
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,353
The abortive fantasy just presented is 
remarkable for both its clarity and yet 

381
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,250
the muddiness of the context from which 
it has emerged.

382
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,500
What's interesting to me is that when we
look at the radical left,

383
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,910
I'm saying where he had,
I want to join them,

384
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,973
they ain't run enough,
and I'm from a country where a man 

385
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:06,134
stands up everyday to tweet the moral 
mendacity of his viciousness into a 

386
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,670
nation.
He has turned into his psychic commode.

387
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,870
Y'All got justin,
we got Donald.

388
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,610
So what's interesting then is that 
political correctness has transmogrified

389
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,180
into a caricature of the left.
The left came up with the term political

390
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,070
correctness.
Shell out reminds you,

391
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,390
we were tired of our excuses.
In our excesses in are exaggerations.

392
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,110
We were willing to be self critical in a
way that I fear my call friends.

393
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:45,730
My compatriots are not.
Don't take yourself too seriously.

394
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:49,690
Smile.
Take yourself not seriously at all,

395
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:53,770
but what you do with deadly seriousness.
Now it is transmogrified into an attempt

396
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:54,604
to characterize the radical left.
The radical left is a metaphor as a 

397
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:00,310
symbol,
as an articulation.

398
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,010
They don't exist.
They're numbers are too small.

399
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,040
I'm on college campuses.
I don't see much of them coming.

400
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,980
When I hear about identity politics,
that amazes me.

401
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:12,610
The collectivist identity politics.
Uh,

402
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,560
last time I checked,
white folk invented race.

403
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,030
That was an invention from a dominant 
culture that won't it groups to at their

404
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:19,864
behest,
the invention of race was driven by the 

405
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:26,380
demand of a dominant culture to 
subordinate others.

406
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,060
Patriot,
right?

407
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,220
Patriarchy.
Patriarchy was the demand of men to have

408
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:37,450
their exclusive vision presented.
The beauty of feminism is it's not going

409
00:26:37,451 --> 00:26:39,670
to resolve differences between men and 
women.

410
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,833
It just says me,
I don't automatically get the last word 

411
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,260
of course,
of my career,

412
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:46,094
but he never did.
And so identity politics has been 

413
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,810
generated as a bit in the war of the 
right,

414
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,644
and yet the right doesn't understand the
degree to which identity has been 

415
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:59,160
foisted upon black people and Brown 
people and people of color from the very

416
00:26:59,161 --> 00:26:59,994
beginning on women and Trans People.
You think that I want to be part of a 

417
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,660
group that is constantly at poured by 
people at starbucks.

418
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,680
I'm minding my own black business
walking down the street.

419
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,140
I have group identity thrust upon me.
They don't say,

420
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,870
ah,
there goes a Negro,

421
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,480
highly intelligent,
articulate,

422
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,314
verbose,
capable of rhetorical fury at the drop 

423
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:26,514
of a hat.
We should not interrogate him as to the 

424
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:32,250
bone of the days of his legal status.
No,

425
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:33,084
they treat me as part of a group and the
problem is that our friends don't want 

426
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:42,441
to acknowledge is that the had Gemini,
that dominance of that group has been so

427
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:46,650
vicious that it is denied us the 
opportunity to exist as individuals.

428
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:50,250
Individualism is the characteristic 
moment in modernity.

429
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,880
Mr. Peterson is right,
the development of the individual.

430
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:54,714
However,
it's predicated upon notions of 

431
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:57,750
intelligence in mind.
You will content David,

432
00:27:57,751 --> 00:27:58,584
human,
others philosophically cart descartes 

433
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:03,480
comes along introducing knowledge into 
the,

434
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,620
to the,
to the,

435
00:28:04,621 --> 00:28:05,454
to the phrase saying that knowledge is 
based upon a kind of reference to the 

436
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:12,660
golden intelligence,
the reflective glass at one possesses.

437
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,900
And yet he got rooted in the very ground
of our existence.

438
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,080
So now it's has fleshly basis.
And what I'm saying to you,

439
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,280
the knowledge that I bring as a person 
of color makes a difference in my body.

440
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,850
Because I know what people think of me 
and I know how they respond to me.

441
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,660
And that ain't no theory am I.
Am I mad at trigger warnings?

442
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:32,520
Only trigger warning.
Got One is from a cop.

443
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,240
Are you about to shoot me?
Not Funny.

444
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,930
In America where young black people die 
repeatedly,

445
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,680
unarmed without provocation.
And so for me,

446
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,960
identity politics is something very 
serious.

447
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,030
And what's interesting about safe 
spaces,

448
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,180
I hear about the university,
I teach there.

449
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,420
Look,
if you in a safe space in your body,

450
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:57,480
you don't need a safe space.
Some of that is overblown,

451
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,190
some of it is ridiculous.
I understand.

452
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:02,430
I believe that the classroom was a 
robust place for serious learning.

453
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:04,650
I believe in the interrogation of 
knowledge,

454
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:09,000
based upon our understanding of mutually
of the edifying proposition of enlighten

455
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,920
met.
At the same time,

456
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:11,754
some people ain't as equal as others.
So we have to understand the conditions 

457
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:17,070
under which they have emerged and in 
which they have been benighted.

458
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:22,310
And attacked by their own culture and I 
ain't seen nobody be a biggest snowflake

459
00:29:22,821 --> 00:29:26,100
in and white man who complained,
mommy,

460
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:26,934
mommy,
they won't let us play and have 

461
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,220
everything we used to have under the old
regime where we were right.

462
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,203
Racist and some premises and dominate 
and patriarchs and hated gays and 

463
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:38,670
lesbians and transsexuals that,
yeah,

464
00:29:38,671 --> 00:29:41,000
you got to share.
This ain't Joe World.

465
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,030
There's everybody's world.
And let me end by saying this.

466
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,270
You remember that story from David 
Foster Wallace?

467
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,303
Fish are going down to fish are gone and
the older fish comes in the opposite 

468
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,250
direction.
He said,

469
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:53,780
hello boys.
How's the water they swim on?

470
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,420
They turn each other.
What the Hell is water?

471
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,850
Because when you entered,
you don't know it.

472
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,650
When you're dominant,
you don't know it.

473
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:00,963
Nothing.
Keyser soze he said it's more 

474
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,460
interesting,
but the devil did.

475
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,940
And to make people believe he did

476
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,020
exist.
That's what you [inaudible].

477
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,710
Thank you Michael.
Steven Europe.

478
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,603
Oh,
we're going to put six minutes on the 

479
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:22,964
clock and please start out trying to be 
as quick as possible because if I miss 

480
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:29,710
that plane to London,
I went half here,

481
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,840
the end of it from the bridegroom's 
mother.

482
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,830
Um,
now in,

483
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,440
in agreeing to,
uh,

484
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,810
participate in this debate and stand on 
this side of the argument,

485
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:46,010
I'm fairly aware that many people who 
choose incorrectly in my view to,

486
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,280
to see this issue in terms of left and 
right,

487
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,670
devalued and exploded terms as I think 
they are,

488
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,813
will believe that I am betraying myself 
in such causes and values that I have 

489
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:00,600
espoused over the years.
I've been given a huge grief or red.

490
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:04,310
It seemed to because I'm standing here 
next to Professor Peterson,

491
00:31:04,311 --> 00:31:08,300
which is the very reason that I am 
standing here in the first place.

492
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,660
I'm standing next to someone with whom I
have no differences,

493
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,110
shall we say in terms of politics and 
all kinds of other things.

494
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,123
Um,
precisely because I think all this has 

495
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,900
got to stop this rage,
resentment,

496
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:24,734
hostility,
hostility in tolerance above all this 

497
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,520
with us or against us.
Certainty.

498
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,150
A Grand Canyon has opened up in our 
world.

499
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:37,610
The fist year,
the crack grows wider.

500
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,493
Every day.
Neither on each side can hear a word 

501
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,780
that the other shrieks and nor do they 
want to.

502
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,880
One of these arm isn't propagandist in 
the culture wars clash down below in the

503
00:31:51,021 --> 00:31:51,854
enormous space between the two sides.
The people of the world tried to get on 

504
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,414
with their lives.
Alternative baffled board and betrayed 

505
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:03,350
by the horrible noises and explosions 
that echo all around.

506
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:07,040
I think it's time for this toxic binary.
Zero.

507
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:11,210
Some madness to stop before we destroy 
ourselves.

508
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,063
Okay.

509
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,550
The nail my colors to the mast,
uh,

510
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,623
before I go any further than this,
it's only polite to give you a sense of 

511
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:23,200
where I come from.
I all my adult life,

512
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:25,420
I have been what you might call the left
here,

513
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,680
a soft lefty liberal of the most 
handwringing milk shop,

514
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:30,640
milk,
toast,

515
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:33,640
variety,
not to burning man.

516
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,474
The barricades socialist,
not even really a progressive with the 

517
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:39,160
name.
I've been on marches,

518
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,140
I've never quite dead.
We've clicked cards or banners.

519
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,220
Um,
am I alluded member of that band,

520
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,940
an Sjw,
a social justice warrior.

521
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,970
I don't think highly of social 
injustice,

522
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,893
I have to say,
but I character myself mostly as a 

523
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:57,914
social justice warrior.
My intellectual heroes growing up were 

524
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,360
Bertrand Russell and g more liberal 
thinkers,

525
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:07,490
people like that.
Writers like m forced to,

526
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:08,324
I believed in,
I think I still do believe in the 

527
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:10,814
sanctity of human relations,
of the primacy of the heart and 

528
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:16,520
friendship and love and common interest.

529
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,563
These are more personal interior beliefs
than they are political exterior 

530
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:23,564
convictions,
more humanistic version of a religious 

531
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,040
implants.
I suppose.

532
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,530
I trust in humanity.
I believe in humanity.

533
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:31,364
I think I do.
Despite all that has happened in the 40 

534
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:37,370
years of my adulthood,
I am soft and I can easily be swept away

535
00:33:37,371 --> 00:33:38,204
by harder hearts and harder intellect.
I'm sometimes surprised to be described 

536
00:33:42,171 --> 00:33:43,004
as an activist,
but overtime I have energetically 

537
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,780
involved myself with what you might call
causes.

538
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,610
I grew up knowing that I was gay.
Well,

539
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,590
in fact,
from the very first I knew I was gay.

540
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:54,140
I remember when I was born looking up 
and saying,

541
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,360
that's the last time I'm going up.
One of those.

542
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,430
I'm,
I'm

543
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,080
Jewish,
I'm Jewish,

544
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:06,150
so I have a natural,
I was horror of racism.

545
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,880
Um,
I naturally,

546
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,650
I want racism,
misogyny,

547
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:12,300
homophobia,
transphobia,

548
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,980
xenophobia,
bullying,

549
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:14,814
bigotry,
intolerance of all humankind's to end 

550
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,530
that surely a given amongst all of us.
The question is how such a golden aim is

551
00:34:22,531 --> 00:34:23,364
to be achieved.
My ultimate objection to political 

552
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,244
correctness is not that it combines so 
much of what I've spent a lifetime 

553
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:33,750
losing and opposing preachiness with 
great respect.

554
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,470
Um,
piety,

555
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:38,843
self-righteousness Harris,
he hunting denunciation shaming session 

556
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:44,760
without evidence,
accusation,

557
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:45,623
inquisition censoring.
That's not why I'm incurring the wrath 

558
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:52,350
of my fellow liberals by standing on 
this side of the house.

559
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,990
My real objection is that I don't think 
political correctness works.

560
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,960
I want to achieve,
I want to get to the Golden Hill,

561
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,660
but I don't think that's the way to get 
there.

562
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,353
Um,
I believe one of the greatest human 

563
00:35:07,951 --> 00:35:12,860
failings is to prefer to be right,
than to be effective.

564
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,563
Um,

565
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,990
political correctness.

566
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,433
He's always obsessed with how right it 
is without thinking of how effective it 

567
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:23,774
might be.
I wouldn't trust myself as a classical 

568
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:27,170
libertarian,
uh,

569
00:35:27,171 --> 00:35:28,004
but I do relish transgression and I 
deeply and instinctively distrust 

570
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,433
conformity and orthodoxy.
Progress is not by preachers and 

571
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:41,370
guardians of morality bumped to 
paraphrase,

572
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:45,690
you have [inaudible] by madmen hermits,
heretics,

573
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,450
dreamers,
rebels and skeptics.

574
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,113
I,
uh,

575
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,130
I may be wrong.
I hope to learn this evening.

576
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,023
I really do think I may be wrong,
but I am prepared to entertain the 

577
00:36:00,781 --> 00:36:01,614
possibility that political correctness 
will bring us more tolerance and a 

578
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:07,670
better world.
Um,

579
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,250
but I'm not sure and I would like this 
quotation from my hair,

580
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,560
a Bertrand Russell to hover over the 
evening.

581
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,113
One of the painful things about our time
is that those who feel certainty are 

582
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,244
stupid and those with any imagination 
and understanding are filled with doubt 

583
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,680
and indecision.

584
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,440
Doc [inaudible],

585
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,460
great set of,
uh,

586
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,303
opening statements to set the scene.
We're now going to go into a round of 

587
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:43,514
rebuttals to allow each of our 
presenters three minutes to reflect on 

588
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:50,600
what they've heard and to make some 
additional points.

589
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,520
And we're going to do that in the same 
order that we had.

590
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:54,080
The opening statement.
So Michelle,

591
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,510
you're up first.
We'll put three minutes on the clock for

592
00:36:56,511 --> 00:36:57,344
you.

593
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,063
So first I would say that I think that 
the attempt to draw a dichotomy between 

594
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,330
individual rights and group rights is a 
little bit misleading.

595
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,193
Um,
traditionally there has been large 

596
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:19,441
groups of people who have not been able 
to exercise their individual rights.

597
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:25,080
And I think that a lot of the claims 
that are being made on behalf of what we

598
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:27,154
politically correct types call 
marginalized groups are claims that 

599
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,074
people who have identities that have not
traditionally been at the center of our 

600
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:39,184
culture or been at the top of our 
hierarchies have as much right to 

601
00:37:42,821 --> 00:37:47,821
exercise their individual talents and 
realize their individual ambitions.

602
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,533
Right.
When we say that we want more women in 

603
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:56,311
power or more people of color's voices 
in the Canon or in the curriculum,

604
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,290
or you know,
pete directing movies,

605
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:02,470
all of these things or not,
because at least on my part,

606
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:05,530
I'm interested in some sort of very 
crude equity,

607
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,364
but because there are a lot of people 
who have not traditionally been able to 

608
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:15,220
realize themselves as individuals.

609
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,083
That's what the women's movement was.
That's what the civil rights movement 

610
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:20,890
was.
That's what the gay rights movement was.

611
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,590
That's in some ways what the Trans 
Rights movement was.

612
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:25,930
I mean,
far from a collectivist movement.

613
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,793
This is kind of liberalism,
classical liberalism pushed to its 

614
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:32,410
extreme,
right?

615
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,273
These are people saying,
I have the right to define my identity 

616
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,900
against the one that was collectively 
assigned to me.

617
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,700
Um,
finally I would say,

618
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:43,534
you know,
a lot of the things that Stephen Fry 

619
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:45,311
said,
you know,

620
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,420
in particularly his temperament,
we're probably in agreement,

621
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:53,440
but this inquisition,
this censorious snus.

622
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,810
On the one hand,
I'm sort of,

623
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,790
I see where he's coming from,
but I think it's a little bit virtual,

624
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,750
right?
I mean,

625
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,890
no,
but who's,

626
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:05,450
who's really censoring you?
Um,

627
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,750
I understand what it feels like to feel 
censored.

628
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,520
I understand what it feels like to be on
the wrong side of a twitter mob or get a

629
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,950
lot of nasty comments,
but,

630
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,620
and that's a bad feeling,
you know,

631
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:21,220
and it's a counterproductive tactic,
but that's not censorship.

632
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,061
Um,
you know,

633
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:23,440
and again,
it's a little,

634
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,450
it's especially strange coming from a 
country where,

635
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,603
you know,
the president of the United States is 

636
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:36,211
trying to levy additional postal rates 
on the owner of the Washington Post,

637
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,440
you know,
in revenge for its reporting.

638
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,603
And people who have kneeled to protest 
police brutality at football games have 

639
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,710
seen their careers explode.
You know,

640
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,210
or people who have,
you know,

641
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,044
women who have challenged Mr. Peterson 
has been hounded by threats and trolls 

642
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:57,110
and misogynist.
Um,

643
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,570
invective so

644
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,410
[inaudible] Jordan,

645
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,810
three minutes up on the screen there.
Please respond to what you've heard.

646
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:13,623
Well,
I guess I would like to set out a 

647
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,044
challenge in,
in somewhat the same format as Mr. Fry 

648
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:22,000
did two people on the moderate left.
I mean,

649
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,600
I've studied totalitarianism for a very 
long time.

650
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,090
Both on the left and on the right.
They have various forms and

651
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,343
I think we've done a pretty decent job 
of determining when right wing beliefs 

652
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,124
become dangerous.
I think that they become dangerous when 

653
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,083
they,
the people who stand on the right evoke 

654
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:45,700
notions of racial superior superiority 
or ethnic superiority,

655
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:46,534
something like that.
It's fairly easy to draw a box around 

656
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,190
them and place them to one side and 
necessary.

657
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:52,900
And I think we've done a pretty good job
of that.

658
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,300
What I failed to see happening on the 
left,

659
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:58,750
and this is with regards to the sensible
left because such a thing exists,

660
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,380
is for the same thing to happen with 
regards to the radical leftists.

661
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,880
Okay,
so here's an open question.

662
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,513
If it's not diversity,
inclusivity and equity as a triumvirate 

663
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:16,510
that mark out the two excessive left and
with equity defined by the way,

664
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:19,780
not as equality of opportunity,
which is an absolutely laudable goal,

665
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,793
but as equality of outcome,
which is how it's defined then exactly 

666
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:27,130
how do we demarcate the two extreme 
left?

667
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,630
What did we do?
And we say,

668
00:41:28,631 --> 00:41:31,090
well,
there's no such thing as the two extreme

669
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:32,290
left.
Well,

670
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,153
that's certainly that characterize much 
of intellectual thinking for the 20th 

671
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:36,854
century as our high order intellectuals,
especially in place like places like 

672
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,114
France did,
everything they could to bend over 

673
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:43,214
backwards to ignore absolutely 
everything that was happening in the 

674
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:49,790
catastrophic left world in the Soviet 
Union and in Maoist China not least.

675
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,833
We've done a terrible job of determining
how to demarcate what's useful from the 

676
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,730
left,
from what's pathological.

677
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,013
And so it's perfectly okay for someone 
to criticize my attempts to identify 

678
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,850
something like a boundary.

679
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,310
We could say diversity,
inclusivity and equity,

680
00:42:04,311 --> 00:42:07,640
especially equity,
which is in fact equality of outcome,

681
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:11,420
which is an absolutely a boring notion.
If you know anything about history,

682
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:15,620
you know that and I'm perfectly willing 
to hear some reasonable alternatives.

683
00:42:15,621 --> 00:42:18,380
But what I hear continually from people 
on the left,

684
00:42:18,381 --> 00:42:19,214
first of all,
as my opponent's did to construe every 

685
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:22,064
argument that is possibly able to be 
construed on the axis of group 

686
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,660
identification and to fail,
to defer,

687
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,730
to,
to fail,

688
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:32,330
to help the rest of us differentiate the
reasonable left,

689
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,080
which stands for the oppressed 
necessarily from the pathological left.

690
00:42:38,081 --> 00:42:39,980
It's capable of unbelievable 
destruction.

691
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,233
And what I see happening in the 
university campuses in particular where 

692
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,050
the left is absolutely predominate and 
that's certainly not my imagination.

693
00:42:48,051 --> 00:42:48,884
That's that's well documented by 
perfectly reasonable people like 

694
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,064
Jonathan.
Height is an absolute failure to make 

695
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,600
precisely that distinction and I see the
same thing tonight.

696
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,363
Thank you.

697
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:04,050
[inaudible]

698
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,823
oh,
give us a,

699
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,410
your rebuttal.
Let me step out here and Peterson land.

700
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,411
Oh,
I feel free.

701
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:16,244
You're already,
I don't know what mythological 

702
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,740
collective Mr. Peterson refers to.
I'm part of the left there.

703
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:32,741
Can tankers when they have a firing 
squad is usually in a semi circle.

704
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,913
Part of the skepticism of rationality 
was predicated upon the enlightenment 

705
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:40,844
project,
which says we're no longer going to be 

706
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:45,080
subordinate to skepticism to 
superstition.

707
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,090
We're going to think and we're going to 
think,

708
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,983
well,
Thomas Jefferson was one of the great 

709
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:50,804
arbiters of rationality,
but he was also a man who was a slave 

710
00:43:53,781 --> 00:43:55,880
owner.
How do you reconcile that?

711
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,680
That's the complication I'm speaking 
about.

712
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:00,320
That's not either or.
That's not a collective identity.

713
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,930
Thomas Jefferson believed in a 
collective identity.

714
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,220
That is during the day at night,
he got some luther vandross songs,

715
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,050
went out to the slave quarter and 
engaged in sexual relations and had many

716
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,404
children with sally hemings.
His loins trumped his logic and when he 

717
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:23,900
hit talks about postmodernism,
I don't know who he's talking about.

718
00:44:23,901 --> 00:44:26,360
I teach postmodernism.
It's kind of fun.

719
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,600
Jacques Derrida,
just to say his name is beautiful.

720
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:31,363
Michelle Michel Foucault talks about the
insurrection of subjugated knowledge as 

721
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,060
people who had been marginalized.

722
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,820
Now begin to speak.
The subaltern has gaietry.

723
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:40,860
Speeback talks about it and post 
postcolonial theory.

724
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,963
The reason these people grew up and grew
into existence and had a voice is 

725
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:47,040
because they were denied.
As Ms Goldberg said,

726
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,480
our group identity was foisted upon us.
We were not seen as individuals.

727
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:52,733
Babe Ruth,
when he broke the home row home run 

728
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:55,164
record,
he didn't bat against all best 

729
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,384
ballplayers.
He batted against the best white 

730
00:44:58,351 --> 00:45:01,230
ballplayers.
When it's been rigged in your favor from

731
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,180
the very beginning,
it's hard for you to understand how much

732
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:04,680
you've been rick.
You're born on third base.

733
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:09,590
Think you hit a triple
at the Toronto Blue Jays game.

734
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:12,463
And here we are deriving our sense of 
identity from the very culture that we 

735
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:16,274
ignore.
Look at the indigenous names and the 

736
00:45:17,811 --> 00:45:19,430
first nation names,
Toronto,

737
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,730
Saskatchewan,
when a peg Tim Horton's.

738
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,023
Okay.

739
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:27,783
But I'll tell you,
there's an envy of the kind of freedom 

740
00:45:31,241 --> 00:45:32,074
and liberty that people of color and 
other minorities bring because we bring 

741
00:45:35,231 --> 00:45:36,064
the depth of knowledge in our body.
There's a kind of jealousy event as the 

742
00:45:39,401 --> 00:45:42,820
greatest living Canadian philosopher 
Aubrey Drake Graham says,

743
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,030
jealousy is just love and hate at the 
same time.

744
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,540
And so for me,
I think it's necessary.

745
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,374
I agree with Mr. Fry.
We shouldn't be nasty and combative and 

746
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:55,420
yet I don't see nastiness and 
combativeness from people.

747
00:45:55,421 --> 00:45:56,254
I see them making a desire to have their
individual identities respected when I 

748
00:46:01,421 --> 00:46:03,760
get shot down for no other reason that 
I'm black,

749
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:06,670
when I get categorized for no other 
reason than my color,

750
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:10,360
I am living in a culture that refuses to
see me as a great individual.

751
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:22,923
Yeah.

752
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:30,190
It's interesting to hear that there 
doesn't seem to be a problem,

753
00:46:30,191 --> 00:46:34,510
but yet I think we all instinctively 
know that there is some kind of problem.

754
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:36,520
There isn't censorship,
of course.

755
00:46:36,521 --> 00:46:39,720
Not In the way that there is in Russia.
I've been to Russia,

756
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:42,060
faced off with the,
uh,

757
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,940
a deeply homophobic,
done pleasant man.

758
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,670
And there's political correctness in 
Russia.

759
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,160
It's just political correctness on the 
right.

760
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,350
And that's what I grew up with.
Political correctness,

761
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,380
which meant that you couldn't say 
certain things on television.

762
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:54,403
You couldn't say fuck for example,
on television because it was incorrect 

763
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,623
to do so.
And there's always the same reason was 

764
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,550
that someone would appear and say,
I'm not shocked.

765
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:04,151
Oh,
of course.

766
00:47:04,151 --> 00:47:04,990
No,
I'm not shocked.

767
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,230
I'm not offended.
I'm offended on behalf of others.

768
00:47:08,231 --> 00:47:10,960
Young,
impressionable plastic mines,

769
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,660
the vulnerable.
And that's not good enough.

770
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:14,523
It's,
it's,

771
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:16,570
so often people are saying,
see,

772
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,020
I don't mind being called a faggot or a 
cake or whatever,

773
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,610
or a mad person cause I've got mental 
health issues.

774
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,630
I don't mind people insulting me and 
people say,

775
00:47:23,631 --> 00:47:24,640
what's that?
So right for you,

776
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,620
Steven,
because you're new,

777
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:27,454
you're strong.
I don't feel particularly strong and I 

778
00:47:29,621 --> 00:47:32,770
don't know that I like being called a 
faggot and a cake particularly,

779
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,130
but I don't believe that the advances in
my culture that have allowed me to marry

780
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:42,160
as I have now been for three years to 
someone of my gender,

781
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,653
I don't believe they are a result of 
political correctness and maybe 

782
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,104
political correctness is actually does 
some sort of live trout that the harder 

783
00:47:50,051 --> 00:47:52,520
we squeeze it,
the further it goes away and,

784
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,330
and you will be saying,
I'm not talking about the redness,

785
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,164
you're talking about social justice with
which I agree with where they want to 

786
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,970
call it identity politics or the history
of your people.

787
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:03,430
In the history of my people,
my people were slaves as well.

788
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,383
Both the British were slaves and Romans 
and the Jews were slaves to the 

789
00:48:06,311 --> 00:48:07,144
Egyptians.
All human beings have been slaves at 

790
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:13,870
some point and we all in that sense 
share that knowledge of how important it

791
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:16,930
is to speak up.
But Russell means,

792
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:19,060
who was a friend of mine,
who was the end who founded the American

793
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,320
Indian movement.
He said,

794
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,393
oh,
I forgot to call me an Indian or a 

795
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:25,180
Lakota Sioux or Russell,
I don't care what you call me.

796
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,133
It's how we treated that matters.
And so I'm really addressing a more 

797
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,190
popular idea.

798
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,663
MMM.

799
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:36,270
Also actually in Barrow,
Alaska and the new Piet said,

800
00:48:36,271 --> 00:48:37,104
call me an Eskimo.
It's obviously easier for you cause you 

801
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:41,670
keep mispronouncing Inupiaq.
Um,

802
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,680
in a words do matter.
I'll just end with a quick story.

803
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,813
Uh,
gay rights came back to the England 

804
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:53,340
because we just slowly in persistently 
knocked on the door of people in power.

805
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,020
We didn't shout,
we didn't scream.

806
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:57,960
People like Ian mckellen eventually got 
to see the prime minister.

807
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,033
And when the Queen signed in the royal 
assent to she has to foot the bill 

808
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:05,370
allowing equality of marriage.
She said,

809
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:06,420
Lord,
you know,

810
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,620
I couldn't imagine this in 1953 really 
is extraordinary.

811
00:49:13,411 --> 00:49:16,830
Isn't it?
Just wonderful and handed it over.

812
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,200
Now it's a nice story and I hope it's 
true,

813
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,660
but it's nothing to do with political 
correctness.

814
00:49:21,661 --> 00:49:24,180
It's to do with human decency.
It's that simple.

815
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:29,540
[inaudible] great rebuttals.

816
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:37,770
They're strong opening statements.
Let's move now into the,

817
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:38,604
uh,
the moderated a cross examination 

818
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:44,280
portion of this debate and get both 
sides engaging on,

819
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:47,040
uh,
some of the key issues here.

820
00:49:47,041 --> 00:49:49,740
And I think what we've heard here is a 
bit of a attention.

821
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:54,741
Let's draw it out a bit more between uh,
the rights of groups to feel included,

822
00:49:55,111 --> 00:49:56,430
to have in your words,
Michelle,

823
00:49:56,431 --> 00:50:01,431
the opportunity for individuality and a 
belief on the other side that uh,

824
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,453
there's something that's threat here 
when these groups are overly privileged 

825
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,260
through affirmative action or other 
outcome oriented processes.

826
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,300
So Michael,
to start with you,

827
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:17,670
why,
why isn't there just harm that's done to

828
00:50:17,671 --> 00:50:21,300
groups by privileging their group 
identity,

829
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,823
whether it be a group identity of race 
or of gender and not immediately 

830
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:28,070
treating them as and the way that

831
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,430
Jordan and Steven would like to see you 
see them first?

832
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,630
Well,
a couple of things.

833
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:33,464
First of all,
there was no arbitrary and random 

834
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:39,260
distinction that people of color and 
other minority groups made.

835
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,870
When I talked about the invention of 
race,

836
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:42,704
the invention of gender,
the invention of group think that was 

837
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,124
not done at the by.
Those groups that have been so named as 

838
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:50,840
Miss Goldberg said.
So first of all,

839
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:51,674
you've got to acknowledge the historical
evolution of that reality and the 

840
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:57,890
concept of group identity did not begin 
with them.

841
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,040
It began with a group that didn't have 
to announce its identity.

842
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,203
When you are in control,
you don't have to announce who you are 

843
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,413
so that many white brothers and sisters 
don't see themselves as one among many 

844
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,550
other ethnicities or groups.
What they see themselves as,

845
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:12,050
I'm just American,
I'm Canadian,

846
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:13,070
can't you be like us?

847
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,173
Can't you transcend those narrow group 
identifications and yet those group 

848
00:51:17,511 --> 00:51:18,344
identifications have been imprinted upon
them by the very people who now because 

849
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,010
their,
their group power has been challenged.

850
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,140
Let's make no mistake about it.
There is a challenge.

851
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,333
I agree with Mr. Fry in a kind of 
Netherland of how sweet it would be to 

852
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:36,860
have a kingly and queen cleanly a 
metaphor about how it got resolved.

853
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:38,120
That ain't the real deal,
homie.

854
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,960
And in the real world and in the real 
world,

855
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,380
there's stuff at stake.
What's at stake?

856
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,490
Our bodies,
what's at stake or people's lives,

857
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:48,020
what's at stake?
People are still being lynched,

858
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:48,854
killed what's at stake.
People because of their sexuality and 

859
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:52,780
their racial identity are still being 
harmed.

860
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:53,614
So I'm suggesting to you,
it's not that we are against being 

861
00:51:56,181 --> 00:51:59,060
treated as individuals.
That's what we're crying for.

862
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,690
Please don't see me as a member of a 
group that you think is a thug,

863
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:03,590
a nigger,
uh,

864
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,990
a nihilist,
a pathological person.

865
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,800
See me as an individual who embodies the
realities were on.

866
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:10,653
But I'll end by saying this.
What Michelle said is extremely 

867
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:16,370
important.
The people who have individual rights,

868
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,223
it didn't have to fight for them in the 
same manner that people of color and 

869
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,610
others have had to.
When Mr Fried talked about getting slave

870
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:25,444
man,
he named them read Orlando Patterson's 

871
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:31,400
comparative history of Race and slavery 
over 28 civilizations.

872
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:33,830
The Greeks did not have the same kind of
slavery,

873
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,890
not American said it was chattel slavery
in Greece.

874
00:52:36,891 --> 00:52:38,840
You could buy back your,
your your freedom.

875
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,913
You could teach the children of the 
people who are enslaved you and because 

876
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:47,060
of your display of prodigious intellect,
you could secure your freedom.

877
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:47,953
That was not the case.
You were punished and killed for 

878
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:53,360
literacy in America.
So my point simply is this,

879
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:54,523
is that I am all for the celebration of 
broader identities and I think that 

880
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:03,200
often those who are minorities and 
others are not celebrated for the degree

881
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:03,860
that we are.

882
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,030
I'll end by saying this.
In America we have the confederate flag.

883
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,410
I don't know if y'all are familiar with 
that.

884
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,690
We have a confederate flag.
We have white guys mostly in the south,

885
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,524
but others as well flying those 
confederate flags that are part of the 

886
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,400
south that refuse to seed.
It's legitimate.

887
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:27,240
A conquest at the hands of the,
there has been a politics of resentment.

888
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:30,390
Every you talking about politics of 
identity wearing that flag,

889
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,640
not the American flag.
They are not American.

890
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,900
They are celebrating us.
The session a move away from America and

891
00:53:36,901 --> 00:53:37,734
a man named Colin Kaepernick who was a 
football player saying I want to bring 

892
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,140
beauty to that flag has been denied 
opportunities.

893
00:53:45,141 --> 00:53:49,490
So we have to really set the terms of 
debate in order before we,

894
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,920
we proceed.
Thank you man.

895
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,350
Jordan,
let's have you jumped in on this idea of

896
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,880
what you see as the pernicious danger of
group think when it comes to ethnicity,

897
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,560
uh,
when it comes to gender.

898
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,950
Why do you think that that's one of the 
primal sins in your view of,

899
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,380
of quote political correctness?
Well,

900
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,214
I think it's one of the primal sense of 
identity politics players on the left 

901
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:17,520
and the right.
Just to be clear about that personally,

902
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:21,330
since this has got personal at times,
I'm no fan of the identitarian right.

903
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,150
I think that anybody who plays a game,
uh,

904
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,073
conceptual game where group identity 
comes first and foremost risks and 

905
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:29,664
exacerbation of tribalism,
it doesn't matter whether it's on the 

906
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:32,800
left to the right.
Um,

907
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,820
with regards to the idea of group 
rights?

908
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:37,410
Well,
there's a fundamental,

909
00:54:37,411 --> 00:54:39,630
and this is something we fall into 
terribly in Canada,

910
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,290
not least because we had to contend with
the threat of Quebec separatism,

911
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,513
but the,
the idea of group writes is 

912
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:48,860
extraordinarily problematic because the,
the,

913
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:49,933
the,
the OBC verse of the coin of individual 

914
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:54,020
rights is individual responsibilities 
can,

915
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:58,440
you can hold an individual responsible 
and an individual can be responsible.

916
00:54:59,010 --> 00:55:01,260
And so that's partly why individuals 
have rights,

917
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,010
but groups,
how do you hold a group responsible?

918
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,260
I mean,
the whole idea is not,

919
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:10,380
it's not a good idea to hold a group 
responsible if,

920
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:11,214
first of all,
it flies in the face of the idea of the 

921
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:13,674
sort of justice systems that we've laid 
out in the West that are essentially 

922
00:55:15,901 --> 00:55:18,780
predicated first on the assumption of 
individual innocence,

923
00:55:18,781 --> 00:55:21,240
but also on the possibility of 
individual guilt,

924
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,810
not group guilt.
We saw what happened in the 20th century

925
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:25,644
many,
many times when the idea of group guilt 

926
00:55:27,661 --> 00:55:30,540
was he was,
it was enabled to get a foothold,

927
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,610
let's say in the polity and in the 
justice system.

928
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:34,680
It was absolutely catastrophic.
And so,

929
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:36,480
okay,
fine group rights.

930
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:37,523
Well what are you going,
how are you going to contend with the 

931
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:39,564
alternative to that?
The opposite of that or where's the 

932
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:44,520
group responsibility?
How are we going to keep,

933
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,710
how are we going to hold your group's 
responsible?

934
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,570
Well,
we don't have to talk about that because

935
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,553
we're too concerned with rectifying 
hypothetical rec rectifying historical 

936
00:55:53,671 --> 00:55:55,830
injustices,
hypothetical and otherwise.

937
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,460
And that's certainly not to say that 
there weren't any shortage of absolutely

938
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:03,150
catastrophic historical injustices.
That's not the point.

939
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:04,583
The point is how you view the situation 
at the most fundamental level and group 

940
00:56:08,701 --> 00:56:11,220
rights are absolute catastrophe in my 
opinion.

941
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,750
Come on,
let's let Michelle come in on that.

942
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:15,710
Is this something you've written about?

943
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,890
The idea that you know,
in identity politics,

944
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,910
uh,
the,

945
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,860
the identity of the group is absolutely 
a valid part of the discourse and,

946
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:27,694
and individuals could and should be seen
and participate in groups as they enter 

947
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,110
into the civic space.
I'm not sure sure

948
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:38,540
that we necessarily have to analogize 
from individual.

949
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:38,971
The,
you know,

950
00:56:38,971 --> 00:56:41,970
the opposite of individual rights is 
individual responsibility.

951
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:45,810
I'm not sure that that analogy 
necessarily holds for the groups,

952
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,770
I mean,
in,

953
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:47,753
in the United States.
And one of the things that I think is 

954
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:49,524
complicated about this discussion is 
that we're talking about three very 

955
00:56:51,601 --> 00:56:54,630
different cultural context,
three different histories,

956
00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:59,280
three different kind of legal regimes.
But in the United States,

957
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,380
um,
a great,

958
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:02,843
a huge part of our politics has been 
groups struggling for rights for their 

959
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:10,650
individual members.
Right?

960
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,290
I mean,
so women in the United States,

961
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,153
you know,
seeking the right to reproductive 

962
00:57:16,651 --> 00:57:18,660
control of their body.
Um,

963
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,553
you know,
African Americans in the United States 

964
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:22,703
seeking redress from police brutality or
discrimination or simply the kind of 

965
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:29,574
tendency in America of white people to 
call the police whenever they see an 

966
00:57:34,081 --> 00:57:37,230
African American in a place where they 
don't think that they're supposed to be.

967
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,160
And you simply,
I don't see how you can contend with any

968
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:41,994
of those social problems if you see 
society as just an ocean of atomized 

969
00:57:46,561 --> 00:57:47,830
individuals.
Um,

970
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,300
you know,
and I just,

971
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,170
I again,
I,

972
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:52,410
I,
I don't,

973
00:57:52,411 --> 00:57:57,411
I don't think there's anything 
pernicious about people banding together

974
00:57:58,530 --> 00:57:59,363
on the basis of their common identity to
seek redress for discrimination and 

975
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:05,971
exclusion.
I mean,

976
00:58:05,971 --> 00:58:10,440
I think that that is everything that's 
best about our democracy.

977
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:15,060
That is the definition of progress.
And so again,

978
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:17,640
I just,
I keep stumbling with the idea that this

979
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:22,500
is somehow tyrannical or that way lies 
stolen ism.

980
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:24,870
Um,
and you know,

981
00:58:24,871 --> 00:58:25,704
a lot of times people who are opposed to
political correctness talk about the 

982
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,770
concept of category creep or is it,
no,

983
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:32,604
no.
Um,

984
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:34,140
yeah,
category creek,

985
00:58:34,141 --> 00:58:37,480
which is a concept that was originated 
by,

986
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:38,314
I believe in Australian academic,
and it's basically kind of a failure to 

987
00:58:41,041 --> 00:58:42,660
draw distinctions,
right?

988
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,493
So that you kind of can't see the 
difference between say a KKK grand 

989
00:58:48,601 --> 00:58:52,770
wizard and a conservative like say Ben 
Shapiro or you know,

990
00:58:52,771 --> 00:58:55,410
that you kind of see everybody to your 
right,

991
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,230
as you know,
fascist,

992
00:58:58,231 --> 00:58:59,064
sexist to tall rotarian and tolerable.
And I think that that is a real thing 

993
00:59:03,781 --> 00:59:05,760
that happens in part because,
you know,

994
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:10,761
undergraduates often thinking broad and 
slightly overwrought categories.

995
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:14,190
I know I did when I was,
when I was a kid.

996
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,180
Um,
yeah,

997
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:16,200
maybe still do,
but,

998
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,380
but I,
I hear a lot of category creep in again,

999
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,214
the argument against political 
correctness or against seeking group 

1000
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:28,940
readdress the idea that kind of that way
lies to humanization or you know,

1001
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:30,480
that you're kind of one minute

1002
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,773
what's up steven,
come in on this part of your opening 

1003
00:59:33,191 --> 00:59:33,841
remarks.
Your,

1004
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:36,850
you're a category creeps.
Steven didn't respond to that.

1005
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:37,803
It's a nice,
I'm,

1006
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:41,410
I'm still very lost about why we aren't 
talking about political correctness.

1007
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,230
We're talking about politics and uh,

1008
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,490
ah,
that's fine.

1009
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,320
Uh,
you know,

1010
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,613
share exactly what you think about it.
I'm not an enemy of identity politics 

1011
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:54,024
per se.
I can obviously see where it goes wrong 

1012
00:59:55,621 --> 00:59:58,500
and where it's annoying.
Let's be empirical about this.

1013
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:01,320
How well is it working for you in 
America at the moment?

1014
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,760
Well,
not well at all.

1015
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,170
Really isn't,
you can ask me in a moment.

1016
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,830
Um,
the reason,

1017
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,263
the reason that trump and brexit in 
Britain and all kinds of nativist all 

1018
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:14,910
over Europe and succeeding is not the 
time for the right.

1019
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,610
It's the catastrophic failure of the 
left.

1020
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:22,800
It's our fault.
My point is not

1021
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,380
did I've turned to the right or anything
like that.

1022
01:00:27,381 --> 01:00:29,900
All that I'm nice and fluffy and want 
everybody to be decent.

1023
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,420
I'm saying,
fuck political correctness,

1024
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:36,200
resist fight.
If you have a point of view,

1025
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,460
fight it in the proper manner using 
democracy as it should be.

1026
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:40,380
Not Channel

1027
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,213
Love,
education,

1028
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,750
not language.
You know,

1029
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:45,760
it's so silly,
but

1030
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,650
you think that there's a chess rule.
You know,

1031
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:48,513
in chess,
the best move to playing chess is not 

1032
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:51,303
the best chess move.
It's the move your opponent least wants 

1033
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:54,724
you to play.
At the moment you're being recruiting 

1034
01:00:56,711 --> 01:00:58,010
sergeants for the right,

1035
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:02,180
knowing an upsetting,
and instead of fighting,

1036
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:03,103
either fighting or persuading.
But political correctness is a middle 

1037
01:01:05,661 --> 01:01:08,410
course that simply doesn't work well.
First of all,

1038
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,710
please,
you said be empirical.

1039
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,360
Empirical,
as far as I know,

1040
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,373
the word means that which can be 
verified if falsify through the 

1041
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:14,774
sentence.
Exactly.

1042
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:18,190
So if we look at it in an objective a 
way,

1043
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:18,880
uh,
the,

1044
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,713
the reality is that people don't have 
equal access to the means to articulate 

1045
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:24,553
the very moment you're talking about,
I'm talking about the empirical results 

1046
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:28,850
of this political attitudes.
I understand that,

1047
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:29,684
but my point is simply this,
I'm suggesting to you that people use 

1048
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:36,560
the weapons at hand.
Now it was Abraham Joshua Heschel,

1049
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,540
rabbi who said,
everybody's not guilty,

1050
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,060
but everybody's responsible,
right?

1051
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:43,760
That's a distinction there.
Everybody clearly is not guilty.

1052
01:01:43,761 --> 01:01:45,410
But what's interesting,
and look at the flip side,

1053
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:46,423
if you have benefited from 300 years of 
holding people in servitude thinking 

1054
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,550
that you did it all on your own,
why can't these people work harder?

1055
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,060
And let me see you for 300 years you 
ain't had no job.

1056
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,420
So the reality is for 300 years,
you old people in the bands,

1057
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,690
you hold them in subordination,
you refuse to give them rights.

1058
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:03,583
Then all of a sudden you free them and 
say you're now individuals not having 

1059
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:12,011
the skills,
the skills optimized America.

1060
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,360
First of all,
I'm talking of the American society.

1061
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:15,194
First of all,
I'm talking about the northern 

1062
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:16,694
hemisphere.
I'm talking about every society where 

1063
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:19,163
enslavement has existed,
but I'm speaking specifically of the 

1064
01:02:21,601 --> 01:02:22,434
repudiation of individual rights among 
people of Color in America who were 

1065
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,920
denied the opportunity to be 
individuals.

1066
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,440
So I see,
I obviously an ideal we'd,

1067
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:35,370
I think Michelle Goldberg does to agree 
with the emphasis on individuals.

1068
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:39,450
What we're saying to you is that we have
not been permitted to be individuals.

1069
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:40,284
We have not been permitted to exercise 
our individual autonomy and authority 

1070
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,450
and the refusal to do so.

1071
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:49,170
To recognize me as an individual means 
when you roll up on me and I'm a 12 year

1072
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:50,004
old boy in a park and you shoot first in
ways you do the black kids that you 

1073
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:54,564
don't do the white kids,
you are not treating that person as an 

1074
01:02:57,151 --> 01:03:00,030
individual.
If we're living in a society where women

1075
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:05,180
are subject to aberrant forms of horrid 
to patriarchal,

1076
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:09,480
sexist and misogynist behavior,
you are not acknowledging the centrality

1077
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:13,850
of the individuality of women.
You are treating them according to eight

1078
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:15,510
group dynamic.
And if we,

1079
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:20,570
if we get beyond the ability of people 
on the right to understand the degree to

1080
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:25,580
which they have operated from the basis 
of benefit from group identity,

1081
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:27,030
without having to say like by saying 
this,

1082
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:29,550
the great American philosopher beyond 
say nose

1083
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:31,943
say it,
that it has been said that racism is so 

1084
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:34,854
American that if you challenge racism,
you look like you're challenging 

1085
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:41,610
America.
We are challenging inequality.

1086
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:42,713
We are challenging the refusal to see me
as an individual when we overcome that 

1087
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:47,420
have added,
we're all on here.

1088
01:03:49,610 --> 01:03:52,970
Three items getting stirred here.
A couple of questions.

1089
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:56,120
So let's let your sites folks are going 
to go to Jordan then to you.

1090
01:03:56,121 --> 01:03:59,870
Let's just assume for a moment that I've
benefited from my white privilege.

1091
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,600
Okay.
So let's assume that that's fine.

1092
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:04,610
Yeah,
well that's what you would say.

1093
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:05,863
So,
um,

1094
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:06,950
uh,
so let

1095
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,600
here,
let's get precise this,

1096
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:11,990
okay.
Was that in the very individual of you?

1097
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,810
Let's get precise about this.
Okay.

1098
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:15,683
He's good.
Precise

1099
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:16,573
degree.
Is My preference present level of 

1100
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,190
attainment or achievement?
A consequence of my white privilege.

1101
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:27,191
And I don't mean sort of,
I mean do you mean 5% do you mean 15% do

1102
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:32,270
you mean 25% do you mean 75% and what do
you propose I do about it?

1103
01:04:32,540 --> 01:04:33,373
How about a tax?
How about a tax that's like specialized 

1104
01:04:36,651 --> 01:04:39,050
for me so that I can account for my damn
privilege.

1105
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:40,810
You,
you read about it?

1106
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:44,350
No,
let's get precise about one other thing.

1107
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:46,240
Okay.
We'll get precise

1108
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:49,010
about one other thing.
There's sites.

1109
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:50,310
Yeah,
precise.

1110
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,960
Yes.
And so if,

1111
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:57,830
if we can agree and we haven't,
that the left can go too far,

1112
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:58,693
which it clearly camp,
then how would my worthy opponents 

1113
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:06,080
precisely defined when the left that 
they stand for has gone too far?

1114
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:08,570
You didn't like equity,
equality of outcome.

1115
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,404
I think that's a great marker.
But if you have a better suggestion and 

1116
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:12,883
won't sidestep the question.
So let's figure out how I can dispense 

1117
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:18,100
with my white privilege.
And so that you can tell me

1118
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,680
when the left has gone too far since 
they clearly can.

1119
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:23,530
And that's what this debate is about,
about political correctness.

1120
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,753
It's about the left going too far.
And I think it's gone too far in many 

1121
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:28,234
ways.
And I'd like to figure out exactly how 

1122
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,990
and when.
So the reasonable left could make it's a

1123
01:05:31,991 --> 01:05:34,390
sentence again and we could quit all 
this nonsense.

1124
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:36,373
Okay.

1125
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:42,953
I will answer you,
but I just want to answer Steven Fry 

1126
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:45,660
first because you talked about,
you know,

1127
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:48,990
this is how we got trump and this is the
failure of the left.

1128
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,530
And so I,
you know,

1129
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,383
I'm a journalist.
I went to a ton of trump rallies during 

1130
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:56,040
the campaign in different parts of the 
country.

1131
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,050
And you're right,
everywhere I went,

1132
01:05:58,051 --> 01:06:00,630
I heard complaints about political 
correctness,

1133
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:01,464
you know,
far more than I heard complaints about 

1134
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:04,630
say Nafta.
Um,

1135
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,840
but when you asked people what they 
meant by political correctness,

1136
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:11,400
you know,
they call it a woman.

1137
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:14,850
They worked with girl and she got mad at
them and you know,

1138
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:15,661
they could,
you know,

1139
01:06:15,661 --> 01:06:16,494
you couldn't in public wonder aloud 
whether the president of the United 

1140
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:21,240
States was really a Muslim.
Um,

1141
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,860
you know,
they didn't like that they couldn't make

1142
01:06:22,861 --> 01:06:25,230
gay jokes anymore.
And so on the one hand,

1143
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,550
you're right and I've written about 
this,

1144
01:06:26,551 --> 01:06:29,460
I think that when you try to,
um,

1145
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:30,413
support,
you know that when people have these 

1146
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:33,384
prejudices and you try to suppress them,
it can create a kind of dangerous 

1147
01:06:39,001 --> 01:06:40,020
counter reaction.

1148
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:42,400
But I also think that,
you know,

1149
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,970
what they were reacting to,
again to go,

1150
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:47,760
to go back to the title of this debate,
what they called political correctness.

1151
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:48,594
You know,
the fact that they had to have this 

1152
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,240
urbain black president who they felt 
talked down to that which is really what

1153
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:55,150
they meant.
Um,

1154
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,590
I don't see a way around that because 
that is,

1155
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:00,240
like I said,
that's progress.

1156
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:03,060
Um,
so to go to the,

1157
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,130
to the question of when the left goes 
too far,

1158
01:07:05,131 --> 01:07:05,964
I mean to me it's pretty easy violence 
and censorship against violence and I'm 

1159
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:13,613
against censorship.
But I also looking around the world 

1160
01:07:18,211 --> 01:07:22,350
right now when the idea that there is 
this,

1161
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,233
I understand again,
there is like a problem of kind of left 

1162
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:29,190
wing annoyance,
right?

1163
01:07:29,191 --> 01:07:32,190
There's a lot of things that kind of 
people,

1164
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:37,220
random people on the internet in 
particular are able to swarm individuals

1165
01:07:39,421 --> 01:07:43,350
and turn kind of stray remarks and just 
social media campaigns.

1166
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,243
And this is often conflated with 
political correctness and it's a bad 

1167
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:47,994
phenomenon.
I wish there was a way to put an end to 

1168
01:07:49,591 --> 01:07:50,430
it.
I don't think there,

1169
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,293
there is no way to put an end to it 
simply by having kind of reasonable 

1170
01:07:54,631 --> 01:07:58,290
liberals are reasonable.
Socialists denounce it because it's just

1171
01:07:58,291 --> 01:08:01,470
a kind of awful phenomenon of modern 
life.

1172
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:02,304
And if you want to have a debate about 
whether social media is terrible for 

1173
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:07,740
democracy,
I will be on the gay side.

1174
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Um,
but right now where I really disagree.

1175
01:08:13,891 --> 01:08:14,990
Well a couple of,
there's a couple of,

1176
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:17,060
I really disagree but I'm going to go to
Michael,

1177
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:22,270
but the idea that the radical left poses
a greater threat than the radical right.

1178
01:08:22,611 --> 01:08:23,444
When you see fat,
like actual fascism ascendant all over 

1179
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,374
the world strikes me as something that 
you can literally only believe if you 

1180
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:32,300
spend your life on college campuses.

1181
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,340
Mike,
I want to come to you on those.

1182
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,503
Pregnant Shaw on Jordan's point about 
how does he in a sense get an equal 

1183
01:08:41,161 --> 01:08:41,994
voice in this debate back if it is 
implied that his participation brings 

1184
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:47,334
with it this baggage of white privilege 
that doesn't allow him to see clearly 

1185
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,213
the issues that are before us.
But that is to be complicit in the very 

1186
01:08:55,651 --> 01:08:56,484
problem that self terminal.
Logically you're beginning at a point 

1187
01:08:58,381 --> 01:08:59,214
this,
there's already a productive and 

1188
01:09:00,931 --> 01:09:01,764
controversial.
You're saying how can he get his 

1189
01:09:03,331 --> 01:09:05,310
equality?
Beck who you talking about?

1190
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,640
Jordan Peterson trending number one on 
twitter.

1191
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,330
Jordan Peterson international 
bestseller.

1192
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:18,060
I want him to tweet something out about 
me and my book Jordan Peterson,

1193
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:20,670
right?
This is what I'm saying to you,

1194
01:09:20,671 --> 01:09:22,380
why the rage,
Bruh?

1195
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:23,553
You you,
you're doing well but your amine mad 

1196
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:30,230
white man and you're going to get us 
right and

1197
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:35,220
I have never seen so much line and snow 
flaking.

1198
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,830
There's enough light in here to start a 
vineyard.

1199
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:39,803
And what I'm saying to you empirically 
and precisely when you asked the 

1200
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:46,530
question about white privilege,
the fact that you ask it and the way you

1201
01:09:46,531 --> 01:09:47,364
did dismissive pseudoscientific,
non empirical and without justification 

1202
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,613
a,
the truth is that white privilege 

1203
01:09:54,511 --> 01:09:57,810
doesn't act according to a quantifiable 
segments.

1204
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:02,130
It's about the degree to which we are 
willing as a society to grapple with the

1205
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:02,964
ideals of treat them justice and 
equality upon which is base number two 

1206
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:08,303
was interesting to me.
You're talking about not having a 

1207
01:10:10,021 --> 01:10:11,700
collective identity.
What do you call a nation?

1208
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,970
Are you Canadian?
Are you Canadian by yourself?

1209
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:17,910
Are you an individual or are you part of
a group?

1210
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:18,983
When America have formed it's union,
it did so in opposition to another 

1211
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:25,194
group,
so the reality is is that those who are 

1212
01:10:27,151 --> 01:10:27,984
part of group identities and politics 
denied the legitimacy and validity of 

1213
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:32,754
those groups and the fact that they have
been created thusly and ben have 

1214
01:10:36,961 --> 01:10:38,910
resentment against others.

1215
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:39,893
All I'm asking for is the opportunity 
that this the quotation you talk about 

1216
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:47,760
the difference between quality of 
outcome and equality of opportunity.

1217
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,683
That's a state and retried argument.
Hackneyed phrase derived from the 

1218
01:10:52,321 --> 01:10:54,510
halcyon days of the debate over 
affirmative action.

1219
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,583
Are you looking for outcomes that can be
determined equally or are you looking 

1220
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,904
for opportunity?
If you free a person after a whole long 

1221
01:11:03,121 --> 01:11:03,954
time of oppression and say,
now you are free to survive if you have 

1222
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:08,094
no skills,
if you have no quantifiable means of 

1223
01:11:09,901 --> 01:11:10,734
existence,
what you have done is liberated them 

1224
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:15,120
into,
and all I'm suggesting to you,

1225
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,970
Lyndon Baines Johnson,
one of our great presidents said,

1226
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:21,870
if you start a man in a race a hundred 
years behind,

1227
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:22,883
it is awfully difficult to catch up.
So I don't think Jordan Peterson is 

1228
01:11:26,071 --> 01:11:26,904
suffering from anything except an 
exaggerated sense of entitlement and 

1229
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:31,674
resentment and his own privilege is 
invisible to him and it's manifest with 

1230
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:37,860
lethal intensity and ferocity right 
here.

1231
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,694
All state

1232
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,390
Jordan,
you respond to that?

1233
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,033
Well,
what I derived from that series of 

1234
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:53,630
rebuttals,
let's say is two fold.

1235
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:54,793
The first is that saying that the 
radical left goes too far when they 

1236
01:11:58,551 --> 01:11:59,384
engage in violence is not a sufficient 
response by any stretch of the 

1237
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:03,824
imagination because there are sets of 
ideas in radical leftist thinking that 

1238
01:12:07,191 --> 01:12:09,860
led to the catastrophes of the 20th 
century,

1239
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:13,520
and that was at the level of idea,
not at the level of violent action.

1240
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,250
It's a very straightforward thing to say
you're against the violence.

1241
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:18,080
It's like being against poverty.
It's like,

1242
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,220
you know,
gender,

1243
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:20,083
generically speaking,
decent people are against poverty and 

1244
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:24,344
violence.
It doesn't address the issue in the 

1245
01:12:25,521 --> 01:12:26,480
least.
Um,

1246
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:29,720
and with regards to my privilege or lack
thereof,

1247
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,083
I mean,
I'm not making the case that I haven't 

1248
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:36,080
had advantages in my life and 
disadvantages in my life.

1249
01:12:36,081 --> 01:12:36,914
Like most people,
you don't know anything about my 

1250
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,360
background and where it came from.
It,

1251
01:12:39,361 --> 01:12:42,980
it doesn't matter to you because 
fundamentally I'm a mean white man.

1252
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,480
That's a hell of a thing to say

1253
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,840
eight [inaudible].

1254
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:57,133
Let me just say very,
very brief because I want to move on to 

1255
01:12:59,181 --> 01:13:00,014
men and women.
The main man white comment was not 

1256
01:13:03,171 --> 01:13:08,120
predicated upon my historical excavation
of your pants is based upon the evidence

1257
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,983
Vitreo with which you speak and the 
denial of a sense of equanimity among 

1258
01:13:12,771 --> 01:13:15,950
the combatants in an argument.
So I'm saying again,

1259
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,620
you're a mean man,
white man and the viciousness,

1260
01:13:18,621 --> 01:13:19,454
is that right?

1261
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:20,543
Okay.

1262
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,020
We recently changed the decks here.
Let's talk about that.

1263
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:28,973
Uh,
another big factor of the so called 

1264
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:32,520
politically correct movement right now,

1265
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:33,623
which is the me too movement and the 
extent to which we've seen this a 

1266
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,000
resurgence,
this awakening around,

1267
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:40,223
uh,
what have been a horrible series of 

1268
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:45,210
systemic abuses and injustices towards 
women.

1269
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,553
Some people though Michelle would say 
that we're in a cultural panic now that 

1270
01:13:49,581 --> 01:13:50,414
the pendulum has swung too far and that 
there isn't a dangerous overreaction 

1271
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:55,973
going on where people's rights 
reputations due process has been thrown 

1272
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:02,340
to the wind.
How do you respond to that?

1273
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:03,573
Well,
first people started seeing that within 

1274
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:05,964
like two weeks of the first Harvey 
Weinstein stories breaking right at the 

1275
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,040
minute.
Harvey Weinsteins and,

1276
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,420
and people actually men act started 
actually losing their jobs over this.

1277
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:17,254
Right.
Which was something quite new that men 

1278
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:22,870
with histories of really serious 
predatory behavior where suddenly losing

1279
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:23,860
their jobs.
You know,

1280
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:24,783
everybody had known about it for a long 
time and there had been a sort of 

1281
01:14:27,161 --> 01:14:27,994
implicit impunity and suddenly that was 
taken away and it created this cultural 

1282
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:33,130
earthquake.
And as soon as it did,

1283
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:37,540
it created a lot of anxiety.
Like what if this goes too far?

1284
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,620
Um,
you know,

1285
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:39,454
I mean the me too movement was only a 
couple of months old when my newspaper 

1286
01:14:42,781 --> 01:14:45,550
started running columns from people 
saying,

1287
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:50,800
why can't I criticize me to which they 
were doing in my newspaper?

1288
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,470
Um,
so on the one hand,

1289
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:56,050
guests of course,
is due process important.

1290
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,033
Obviously.
I think that when you look at who has 

1291
01:14:59,861 --> 01:15:03,400
actually lost their jobs,
who's actually lost their livelihoods,

1292
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:05,200
I mean,
look round,

1293
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:05,890
it's people.

1294
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:09,400
It's not people in general on a,
you know,

1295
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,493
mccarthyism rumor,
it's people who took their dicks out at 

1296
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,050
work.
It's people who,

1297
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:15,183
you know,
there,

1298
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:18,480
it's people who there was,
you know,

1299
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:19,713
10,
tens of millions of dollars of 

1300
01:15:20,771 --> 01:15:21,604
settlements and they lost their job for 
four months and now they're staging 

1301
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:24,880
comebacks.
You know,

1302
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:28,090
Bill O'reilly is about to get a TV show 
on a new network.

1303
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:29,043
So the idea that again,
this idea that kind of like men 

1304
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:34,084
everywhere feel like they can't talk 
anymore and everybody's walking on 

1305
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:37,840
eggshells.
And I don't know,

1306
01:15:37,841 --> 01:15:40,540
maybe that's true in,
in your offices.

1307
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:41,420
Um,
it's,

1308
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:43,330
it's not true where,
where I live,

1309
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,193
you know,
and the me too movement has been 

1310
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:50,290
particularly active in,
in media.

1311
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,440
You know,
there was this,

1312
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,473
this thing,
I don't know how many do you guys read 

1313
01:15:53,621 --> 01:15:55,710
about the shitty media medalist?
Um,

1314
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:56,973
a woman wrote about,
she started this sort of open source 

1315
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:04,570
document where women could list men and 
media that everybody knew about,

1316
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,610
but nobody had ever done anything about.

1317
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,773
And it very quickly went public and 
there was something sort of disturbing 

1318
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:11,321
in it.
Right?

1319
01:16:11,321 --> 01:16:14,620
You don't like these anonymous 
accusations floating around.

1320
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,600
Um,
most feminists I know,

1321
01:16:16,601 --> 01:16:20,350
including myself,
were kind of freaked out by it.

1322
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:25,351
And thought it was unfair to have 
people's reputations held up like this.

1323
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:28,900
But if you look at what happened to the 
men on the list,

1324
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,460
nothing,
you know,

1325
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,740
they still have their jobs.
I know men on that list.

1326
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:37,420
I work with men on that list.
The people who actually people have only

1327
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:38,423
buy in as far as I can think in media,
the people who have lost their jobs and 

1328
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:42,424
lost their careers.
It's been four extremely serious 

1329
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:50,551
misbehavior documented by multiple women
who had corroborating witnesses.

1330
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:55,660
And so again,
I understand this anxiety that relations

1331
01:16:55,661 --> 01:16:56,494
between men and women are changing.
Of course that causes a lot of cultural 

1332
01:16:58,871 --> 01:16:59,704
anxiety.
But I don't know that it's rooted in 

1333
01:17:01,601 --> 01:17:04,720
anything real in his view on this.
Are we in a cultural panic?

1334
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:09,721
Is the response to Michelle says 
commensurate with the very confused

1335
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,083
by this?
I,

1336
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,620
uh,
of course I,

1337
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:14,640
you know,
I recognize the best,

1338
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:18,740
the attitude Weinstein and the 
monstrosity of his behavior.

1339
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,360
Uh,
and it was shocking to me.

1340
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:22,040
I actually worked for him,
um,

1341
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:26,320
script doctoring cause it's called,
I never had the bathroom toe.

1342
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:28,010
Um,
uh,

1343
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,020
but I'm pretty obvious reasons,
but it's,

1344
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,213
you know,
grotesque and I can't imagine how vile 

1345
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,280
it must be for such a powerful now then 
he was,

1346
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,690
I used to play a game at the Cannes film
festival where,

1347
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,160
um,
years of power,

1348
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:46,040
we're walking from one hotel,
the uh,

1349
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:47,390
at the end that,
uh,

1350
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,430
all the way up to the palliative 
festival.

1351
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:50,543
Um,
you would get 10 points every time you 

1352
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:53,900
heard the word harvey.
Um,

1353
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:54,813
um,
usually a 10 minute walk you'd have a 

1354
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:59,870
300 points because it was Yo homies got 
the script.

1355
01:17:59,871 --> 01:18:00,770
Harvey's got it.
Yeah,

1356
01:18:01,100 --> 01:18:03,710
I've got a meeting with harvey at the 
majestic in the afternoon.

1357
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:04,663
He was immensely powerful and I think 
that's obvious that someone in that 

1358
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:09,770
position,
uh,

1359
01:18:09,771 --> 01:18:12,640
abusing him threatening and,
uh,

1360
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,580
hindering the livelihood of women is,
is good test skin in the extreme.

1361
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:21,470
But I have to tell you that there is 
genuine feeling amongst many people.

1362
01:18:21,471 --> 01:18:25,130
I know
that we come speak our minds.

1363
01:18:25,131 --> 01:18:28,490
We can't actually speak to the true 
nuance,

1364
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:33,650
the true depth of sexual romantic 
feeling between men and women.

1365
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:36,110
It's not a subject don't absolutely 
expert on,

1366
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:38,660
but it comes between men and men as 
well.

1367
01:18:38,661 --> 01:18:40,130
Though I know when it's men,
a men,

1368
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:41,203
you might say,
well that's different because they're 

1369
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,393
women have had a different experience in
history and I don't want to enter that 

1370
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:47,443
particular field.
But I would say that there is real fear 

1371
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,410
in my business,
which is where this all started.

1372
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,540
Showbiz does acting and so on.
Um,

1373
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:57,493
yeah,
people are rather afraid to speak about 

1374
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,333
a piece of Vino,
a publicity that's come out or a 

1375
01:19:03,801 --> 01:19:05,060
statement that's been made.

1376
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,230
You just go,
Yup,

1377
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:07,223
absolutely.
And wait for the people to leave the 

1378
01:19:08,631 --> 01:19:12,050
room before you can speak honestly with 
your friends.

1379
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:13,400
Um,
and that's,

1380
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,760
I've never experienced that in my entire
60 years on this planet.

1381
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:19,640
There's this feeling that,
uh,

1382
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,210
and I'd not characterizing feminists as 
an east German,

1383
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:24,650
but it's like that.
The stars,

1384
01:19:24,651 --> 01:19:27,350
you're listening,
you better be careful that listening.

1385
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,240
Uh,
and that's a genuine feeling.

1386
01:19:29,241 --> 01:19:30,074
I'm saying that my hand on my heart,
I'm not saying it to make a point other 

1387
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:35,600
than the fact that it's true and it's 
worrying,

1388
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:40,430
but the sexual misadventures and horror 
experiences worrying too.

1389
01:19:40,431 --> 01:19:41,264
So the two words they're not solved.
Let's bring Jordan in on this because 

1390
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:45,620
you've written and commented about a 
lot.

1391
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:46,843
Thank you.

1392
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:51,793
Well,
I think I'm going to point out two 

1393
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:56,930
things again.
The first is that my question about when

1394
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:58,520
the,
when the left goes too far,

1395
01:19:58,521 --> 01:19:59,354
still hasn't been answered.
And then the second thing I'm going to 

1396
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:03,410
point out is that,
you know,

1397
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,680
it's conceivable that I am a mean man.
You know,

1398
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:08,550
I mean

1399
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:11,130
maybe I'm meaner than some people are 
not as mean as others.

1400
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:11,964
I think that's probably more the case.
But I would say the fact that race got 

1401
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:16,254
dragged into that particular comment is 
a better example of what the hell I 

1402
01:20:19,561 --> 01:20:20,394
think is wrong with the politically 
correct left and anything else that 

1403
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:23,250
could have possibly happened.

1404
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:34,730
Um,
imagine the hurt,

1405
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,300
the anxiety,
um,

1406
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,250
the insult that you might genuinely 
feel,

1407
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:45,503
um,
according to what I felt was an 

1408
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:51,750
appropriate comment of description at 
the moment of its expression.

1409
01:20:51,751 --> 01:20:56,751
But imagine now those hurt feelings and 
got her w w w okay.

1410
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:02,253
You feel great.
You feel great about it is really 

1411
01:21:03,911 --> 01:21:04,990
different.
I'm not a victim.

1412
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,650
I'm not hurt.
You're hurt.

1413
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,900
Okay.
You wouldn't be a victim.

1414
01:21:07,901 --> 01:21:08,734
So what,
What's interesting is that whatever a 

1415
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:15,160
non traditional feelings of empathy you 
endure at this particular point,

1416
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,270
um,
the,

1417
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:18,104
the,
the point is imagine then the horrors 

1418
01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:23,403
that so many other others I've had to 
put up with for so long when they are 

1419
01:21:28,271 --> 01:21:32,860
refused to acknowledge their humanity.
Now I take your point seriously.

1420
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:33,880
So you're,
let me,

1421
01:21:33,881 --> 01:21:34,800
let me finish.
Let me finish.

1422
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:36,400
Let me just,
let me put it to me.

1423
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:38,740
Let me finish my acquisition there.

1424
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,633
Okay.
What I'm saying to you is that when you 

1425
01:21:42,191 --> 01:21:45,220
said you were upset that I added the 
element of race there,

1426
01:21:45,250 --> 01:21:47,800
right.
When I said mean Matt White Man.

1427
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,173
Well,
what's interesting is that you may have 

1428
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:53,134
felt that you were being ascribed the 
group identity to which you do not 

1429
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:56,613
subscribe.
You may have felt that you were being 

1430
01:21:57,851 --> 01:21:58,840
unfairly,
uh,

1431
01:21:59,030 --> 01:22:01,090
judged according to your particular 
raise.

1432
01:22:01,091 --> 01:22:05,110
You may have felt that your individual 
identity was being a smirch by my rather

1433
01:22:05,111 --> 01:22:09,220
careless characterization of you,
all of which qualifies for,

1434
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,660
uh,
a legitimate,

1435
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:11,740
uh,
you know,

1436
01:22:11,741 --> 01:22:12,574
response to me.
But also the point we've been trying to 

1437
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:19,540
make about the refusal to see our 
individual existence as women,

1438
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:21,760
as people of Color,
as first nation people in the light.

1439
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:23,073
My point simply has been the reason I 
talked about race and that particular 

1440
01:22:26,981 --> 01:22:31,360
characterization because there's a 
particular way in which I have come to a

1441
01:22:31,361 --> 01:22:32,194
city.

1442
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,510
I don't know if there are a lot of black
people out here,

1443
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:35,893
not sure,
but I constantly come to places and 

1444
01:22:38,861 --> 01:22:41,740
spaces that are not my natural habitat.
Uh,

1445
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:42,574
other than intellectual engagement and 
the love and the fury of rhetorical 

1446
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:47,710
engagement.
Yes.

1447
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:48,903
But I often go into hostile spaces where
people will not vote in favor for my 

1448
01:22:52,511 --> 01:22:53,344
particular viewpoint because I'm 
interested as an individual of breaking 

1449
01:22:56,891 --> 01:23:01,120
down barriers so that people can 
understand just how complicated it is.

1450
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:02,163
So what I'm saying to you is that I 
would invite you in of the surrender of 

1451
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:08,740
your privilege to give you a specific,
a specific response.

1452
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,783
Come with me to a black Baptist church.
Come with me to a historically black 

1453
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:14,880
college,
come to me to an,

1454
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:15,903
to an indigenous or first nations 
community where we're able to engage in 

1455
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:24,811
some of the lovely conversation but also
to listen and hear.

1456
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:27,513
And when I added race to that,
I was talking about the historically 

1457
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:30,844
events,
inability to acknowledge others pains 

1458
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,720
equally to the one that they are 
presently enduring.

1459
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:36,603
So

1460
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:41,230
the human being,
I stand by my comment,

1461
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,530
seeing the sorts of things that you're 
talking about.

1462
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,680
I happened to be an honorary member of 
an indigenous family.

1463
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:51,140
So don't tell me about what I should go 
see with regards to oppression.

1464
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:52,870
You and you don't know anything about 
me.

1465
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,670
You have to make words.
I gave you a response,

1466
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:00,010
you gave me a generic response and 
generic race pace or scones,

1467
01:24:00,011 --> 01:24:02,200
Jordan Peterson.
I would like for you to come with me,

1468
01:24:02,230 --> 01:24:04,660
Michael,
Eric Dyson to a black Baptist church.

1469
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:06,920
You've been one of those.
I would be happy to do that by.

1470
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,571
Okay.
All right.

1471
01:24:07,571 --> 01:24:08,404
I'm gonna Hook you up.

1472
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,220
It makes sure that
one more quick,

1473
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,133
brandon,
we're going to go to closing statements 

1474
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:18,130
and for,
I want to get your response to why,

1475
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,053
you know,
a generation from now looking back on 

1476
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:21,124
this debate,
we're not going to see this quote 

1477
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:25,840
so-called politically correct movement 
in the same way.

1478
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:26,674
Let's say that we now understand the 
positive contributions of the civil 

1479
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:32,170
rights movement.
That that was a movement that advanced,

1480
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:35,170
uh,
a series of,

1481
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:38,860
of ideas about human dignity to people 
who previously didn't have that dignity.

1482
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:43,090
We're now having another debate and 
other social data about different groups

1483
01:24:43,091 --> 01:24:44,750
and communities,
uh,

1484
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,740
that are,
we're trying to convey a sense of,

1485
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:49,420
of new dignity to them.
Why,

1486
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:53,740
why won't this be in a sense looked back
upon as something positive,

1487
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,090
a generation from now.

1488
01:24:55,180 --> 01:24:57,460
I think people will look back on this 
debate and,

1489
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:00,610
and wonder why political correctness 
wasn't discussed.

1490
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:06,070
[inaudible] I said,
if it's slippery,

1491
01:25:11,301 --> 01:25:12,134
I mean,
I

1492
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,390
interesting to hear talk about race and 
about gender and about to be quality.

1493
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:21,450
And it's something that I've thought 
about a lot and I can learn a great deal

1494
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:22,624
about,
but that's not why I came to this 

1495
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,510
debate.
I was interested in.

1496
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:26,703
Um,
what I've always been interested in the 

1497
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:28,624
suppression of language and thought the 
closing down the rationalist idea that 

1498
01:25:32,531 --> 01:25:34,480
seems beguiling that if you,
uh,

1499
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,400
uh,
limit people's language,

1500
01:25:36,401 --> 01:25:39,310
it may somehow teach them a different 
way of thinking.

1501
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:40,403
Uh,
something that would have delighted the 

1502
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:44,710
inventors of George Orwell's newspeak 
for example.

1503
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:45,713
Um,
and it seems to me it's just 

1504
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,760
implausible.
It doesn't,

1505
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,330
it doesn't work.
Uh,

1506
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:55,300
and that's what I mean by empirical.
It doesn't stand an empirical test,

1507
01:25:55,510 --> 01:25:58,330
doesn't experientially validated.
Um,

1508
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:01,270
as we see from the political landscape 
now,

1509
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,950
um,
and I worry that we may in the future.

1510
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,023
So I,
I'm so disappointed that the subject is 

1511
01:26:08,621 --> 01:26:11,750
just revolved around academia,
which was predictable because that's the

1512
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:14,540
sort of crucible in which these elements
are mixed.

1513
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:17,780
Um,
but even more disappointed that really I

1514
01:26:17,781 --> 01:26:18,614
haven't heard from Michelle or from 
Professor Dawson as to what they think 

1515
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:23,054
political correctness is.
Because what they've talked about is 

1516
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:26,660
basically second progress in,
in our view,

1517
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,950
is progress.
Well,

1518
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:29,270
I agree.
That's,

1519
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,170
you know,
yeah.

1520
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,930
So it is too good on progress,

1521
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,800
but
how is it

1522
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,500
you saying political,
the,

1523
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,510
what we call buddies is the greatness 
you called progress.

1524
01:26:40,511 --> 01:26:42,520
That's what you're supposed to be 
arguing.

1525
01:26:42,521 --> 01:26:45,220
I want to know what you mean by 
political correctness.

1526
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:46,380
Well,
like I,

1527
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,213
okay,

1528
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,090
the reason a few months ago,
right,

1529
01:26:53,091 --> 01:26:54,020
you,
you contacted me,

1530
01:26:54,021 --> 01:26:57,410
asked if I wanted to do a debate about 
identity politics and then you presented

1531
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:58,910
me with this resolution and I,
and I said,

1532
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:00,350
well,
there's a lot of things that people call

1533
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:02,720
political correctness that I'm not going
to defend.

1534
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:07,040
But then I realized who I was debating 
and,

1535
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:08,763
and,
and saw that there was a lot of things 

1536
01:27:09,921 --> 01:27:10,754
that you,
Jordan Peterson called political 

1537
01:27:12,321 --> 01:27:14,300
correctness that I call progress.
Um,

1538
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:17,180
and,
and to some extent you to Stephen Fry.

1539
01:27:17,181 --> 01:27:18,014
You know,
when you talk about it being outrageous 

1540
01:27:19,821 --> 01:27:21,320
to tear it out,
we're not outrageous.

1541
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:22,154
I won't put words in your mouth,
but that we shouldn't be tearing down 

1542
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:24,734
statues of kind of notorious racist that
we should just instead be throwing exit 

1543
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,790
them.
Um,

1544
01:27:31,340 --> 01:27:33,140
you know,
so those sorts of things,

1545
01:27:33,141 --> 01:27:36,200
if you call them political correctness,
like call them progress.

1546
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:40,010
Now this feeling of being silenced,
which I understand,

1547
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:41,630
although it seems very vague,
right?

1548
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:45,140
You kind of are not quite putting your 
finger on who is silencing you,

1549
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:49,190
except for a vague fear that if you say 
something on toward,

1550
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,640
you're going to be the subject of,
I'm not sure shaming the pipe.

1551
01:27:54,430 --> 01:27:55,161
Yeah,
but by,

1552
01:27:55,161 --> 01:27:56,300
by what?
By the Internet.

1553
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,040
No,
but I mean

1554
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:06,220
there's that element of it

1555
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:08,950
here.
What I'm seeing is that it's,

1556
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:09,903
it's a feeling,
it's a feeling that is this sort of 

1557
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:17,080
intangible result of on right.
Narrowly Goldstein,

1558
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:20,760
the sort of show trial thing where the 
person then apologizes.

1559
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:23,250
I have so much to learn about sexual 
politics.

1560
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,750
I am really sorry that signed a lawyer 
crossed out the name of the,

1561
01:28:26,751 --> 01:28:26,870
yeah.

1562
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:30,240
Personally it's,
do you think

1563
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:35,320
the real mistake of our left is that we 
underestimate the right,

1564
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:36,893
the right isn't as stupid as we'd like 
them to be if only they were only there 

1565
01:28:40,801 --> 01:28:41,634
once.
A cunning,

1566
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:43,320
so sly,
so smart,

1567
01:28:43,321 --> 01:28:44,154
so aware of our shortcomings and I just 
fear that political correctness is a 

1568
01:28:50,401 --> 01:28:53,190
weapon that they value.
The more,

1569
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,360
the more we tell the world how people 
should be treated,

1570
01:28:57,361 --> 01:29:00,030
how language should be treated,
what words are acceptable,

1571
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:00,864
what attitudes are,
what hr meeting is going to tell you in 

1572
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:07,170
a long bullet pointed list about how you
look at people.

1573
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,273
All of this is,
is me to drink too bad people jump 

1574
01:29:11,701 --> 01:29:12,534
malefactors.
The bad actors are not counting myself 

1575
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:15,690
as well.

1576
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:18,920
Bad actors in that sense.
I mean bad actors in the other centers.

1577
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:30,600
So there are,
like I said,

1578
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:33,030
there were a lot of ways in which I 
agree with you,

1579
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:34,380
although I kind of,
I,

1580
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:36,630
I would like to hear,
I need to turn it back on you.

1581
01:29:36,631 --> 01:29:40,020
I'd like to hear you say,
you know,

1582
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,883
what are the words that have fallen into
disrepute that we think that you think 

1583
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,820
we should be resurrecting?
Right.

1584
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:45,654
I mean,
to me this is this area of like hotly 

1585
01:29:48,511 --> 01:29:51,760
contested social change right now where 
a lot of people feel

1586
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:55,160
wounds that have gone into disuse.
It's very often freezes,

1587
01:29:55,161 --> 01:29:56,730
jargonistic,
slew goodness,

1588
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:59,280
heteronormative,
CIS gendered,

1589
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:00,453
um,
those kinds of things that they're just 

1590
01:30:01,551 --> 01:30:02,690
an insult.
You know,

1591
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,673
imagine you're a young student arriving 
university and someone's bombarding it 

1592
01:30:05,871 --> 01:30:09,290
with this preposterous hermeneutical 
nonsense from,

1593
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:10,310
from,
uh,

1594
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:13,890
from misread textbooks.
So misread food cove and they say,

1595
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:16,790
daddy died and so on.
Because,

1596
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:20,000
you know,
I was at Cambridge in them doing it.

1597
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:23,020
We had a French phase and,
and does

1598
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,043
[inaudible] with that.

1599
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:26,930
It's an interesting game.
And it is,

1600
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:28,900
it's a place to,
uh,

1601
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:33,630
I think I would just really say that the
ghost hovering over me is,

1602
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:36,090
it's a lesser Oscar Wilde Rosen.
Uh,

1603
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:36,943
he,
he said to buzzies love you said the 

1604
01:30:38,041 --> 01:30:40,350
fact that you didn't get the degree is,
is nothing,

1605
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:44,100
but you never acquired what is sometimes
called the Oxford Manor.

1606
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:46,320
And I'll say for that,
the university manner.

1607
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:47,880
Um,
you said,

1608
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:49,463
Oscar said,
I take that to mean the ability to play 

1609
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:52,674
gracefully with ideas.
I think that's disappearing from our 

1610
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:56,710
culture.
And I think it's

1611
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:02,160
Gerald [inaudible].

1612
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,100
It's hard to beat a self deprecating 
Englishman is,

1613
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:15,390
no,
no,

1614
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:17,880
no.
I got a pretty good idea here today.

1615
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,160
Okay.

1616
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:22,240
But what's interesting,
I don't recall in all of you,

1617
01:31:22,300 --> 01:31:23,133
all of us have studied history.
I don't recall these debates about 

1618
01:31:26,321 --> 01:31:27,154
political correctness happening when 
people who were in power in absolute 

1619
01:31:30,731 --> 01:31:32,530
power,
unquestioned power,

1620
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:38,010
political correctness,
political correctness becomes an issue.

1621
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:42,250
And what I mean by that is people who 
used to have power,

1622
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:43,563
who,
who still have power but think they 

1623
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:45,874
don't,
who get challenged on just a little bit 

1624
01:31:47,891 --> 01:31:51,070
of what they have and don't want to 
share toys in the sand lot of life.

1625
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:55,270
So all of a sudden it becomes a kind of 
exaggerated grievance.

1626
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:59,260
Now the things you named the bullet 
points and the CIS gender,

1627
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:04,030
the Hetero normativity and the Hetero 
Patriarchy and the capitalist resurgence

1628
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:07,810
and the insurrection of subjugated 
knowledge as to give Fuko some more love

1629
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:10,660
or the Derridean deconstruction,
all that stuff.

1630
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:14,650
The French phase is still going on with 
the French fries in America.

1631
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:20,070
What's interesting is that I didn't hear
many complaints of political correctness

1632
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:26,320
at the height of the dominance of one 
group or another,

1633
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:27,154
but when Martin Luther King Jr who 
argued for group identity as a black 

1634
01:32:32,711 --> 01:32:33,544
person to provide an opportunity for 
individual black people to come to the 

1635
01:32:37,901 --> 01:32:40,330
fore,
they began to make that claim.

1636
01:32:40,810 --> 01:32:41,643
Oh No,
they didn't call it political 

1637
01:32:42,341 --> 01:32:43,510
correctness.
Uh,

1638
01:32:43,570 --> 01:32:46,660
you're siding with those who are against
free speech.

1639
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:51,490
You're siding with those who don't want 
me as a white person to be recognized in

1640
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:52,324
my humanity and what I mean by political
correctness is the kind of politics of 

1641
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,053
resentment that are articulated by 
various holders of power at certain 

1642
01:33:01,211 --> 01:33:02,800
levels,
at various levels.

1643
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:04,083
That one of the beautiful things about 
Fulco that I take as opposed to Max 

1644
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:10,780
Faber is that for Co said,
power breaks out everywhere.

1645
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,703
I would think a person who's critical 
political correctness like you would 

1646
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:14,704
appreciate this as opposed to Max Vapor 
who said power is over there in a 

1647
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:20,620
hierarchical structure where 
subordination is the demand.

1648
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:21,573
Full coast had no power brakes out,
even among people who are in 

1649
01:33:23,820 --> 01:33:27,160
disempowered so you can hurt somebody in
your own community.

1650
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:28,203
What's more politically incorrect than a
black baptist preacher identifying with 

1651
01:33:31,641 --> 01:33:34,990
the first century Palestinian Jew and 
this still loving atheists?

1652
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,943
What's more politically incorrect and a 
black intellectual going on Bill Maher 

1653
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:44,310
and defending his ability to continue to
have this show despite using the n word.

1654
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:49,330
I serve believe in a politically 
incorrect version.

1655
01:33:49,331 --> 01:33:50,164
When I go as a black man to his preacher
to chastise my fellow believers about 

1656
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:56,680
their homophobia that goes over like a 
brick cloud.

1657
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,753
When I come into arenas like this,
I understand that my back is up against 

1658
01:34:01,271 --> 01:34:02,140
the wall,
but I think

1659
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:07,450
sit over here,
let's say I want to sit on your lap.

1660
01:34:09,740 --> 01:34:12,860
But what I say,
I don't get excited.

1661
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:18,040
But what I'm saying is that he goes out,
[inaudible] been looking at me.

1662
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:25,520
So what was it?
This

1663
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:30,520
thing is that when we look at the way in
which we have societies in a free,

1664
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,533
uh,
Canadian society and the Free American 

1665
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:36,350
society,
when I look at what is seen as political

1666
01:34:36,351 --> 01:34:37,184
correctness,
it to me has been a mass of jumble that 

1667
01:34:40,851 --> 01:34:41,684
has been carved together out of the 
politics of resentment that powers once 

1668
01:34:45,321 --> 01:34:47,000
held,
no longer are held.

1669
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:51,050
Freedom's once exercise,
absolutely must now be shared.

1670
01:34:51,170 --> 01:34:52,003
So I,
I am an agreements with both of my 

1671
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:54,843
gentlemen to my right who believe Vat,
a political correctness has been a 

1672
01:34:59,061 --> 01:35:01,340
scourge,
but not necessarily the way you think.

1673
01:35:01,341 --> 01:35:02,174
So I think it's been a scourge because 
those who have been the deployers of 

1674
01:35:04,791 --> 01:35:05,624
power and the beneficiaries of privilege
have failed to recognize their 

1675
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,630
particular weight.
And at the end of the day,

1676
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:12,673
I think that those of us who are free 
citizens of this country and of America 

1677
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:21,320
should figure out ways to respect the 
humanity of the other,

1678
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,110
to respect the individual existence of 
the other,

1679
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,033
but also respect the fact that there 
have been barriers placed upon 

1680
01:35:27,651 --> 01:35:30,590
particular groups that have prevented 
them from flourishing.

1681
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,450
That's all I mean by political.
Correct.

1682
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:34,623
Well said.
I got to give before we get to closing 

1683
01:35:36,771 --> 01:35:39,710
statements and final words on this topic
to Michelle and then,

1684
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:40,161
uh,
you,

1685
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:40,870
Jordan.

1686
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:41,703
So I think part of the frustration here 
is that I think that both of you have 

1687
01:35:44,890 --> 01:35:45,723
radically different ideas of what we're 
talking about when we talk about 

1688
01:35:47,621 --> 01:35:50,530
political correctness.
It seems to me that you're talking about

1689
01:35:50,531 --> 01:35:53,830
politically correctness.
You mean this kind of feeling of anxiety

1690
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:54,664
that a lot of people feel because we all
live now in this terrible crowdsource 

1691
01:35:58,271 --> 01:36:03,271
panopticon when you worry that any stray
freeze that you use will be any straight

1692
01:36:03,301 --> 01:36:05,440
phrase you utter might be used to defame
you.

1693
01:36:05,650 --> 01:36:06,483
Right.
And I think that a lot of people feel 

1694
01:36:07,841 --> 01:36:09,070
that anxiety.
I,

1695
01:36:09,130 --> 01:36:09,963
I disagree that that is something that 
is being solely kind of perpetrated 

1696
01:36:13,990 --> 01:36:15,160
against,
you know,

1697
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:20,710
institution to kind of Oscar Wilde and 
figures by a since story and you know,

1698
01:36:20,711 --> 01:36:24,700
since stories left wing chord because 
it's coming from all directions,

1699
01:36:24,701 --> 01:36:25,534
right?
This phenomenon which sucks is all over 

1700
01:36:28,631 --> 01:36:29,110
the place.

1701
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:32,410
I mean,
I get it when I write something critical

1702
01:36:32,411 --> 01:36:37,411
of the way that the IDF behaved in Gaza,
you know,

1703
01:36:37,460 --> 01:36:41,440
it's coming at everyone.
And I think that there is,

1704
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:43,353
there's a way in which when it comes at 
a certain sort of figure and there's a 

1705
01:36:47,381 --> 01:36:52,381
certain set of complaints and you feel 
unjustly criticized and feel silenced,

1706
01:36:54,191 --> 01:36:56,980
which again I think is really different 
than being silenced.

1707
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,233
You call it political correctness.
And I would like the culture also to be 

1708
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,550
more,
you know,

1709
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:06,100
free freewheeling.
I think one solution,

1710
01:37:06,101 --> 01:37:08,350
you know,
you're not going to kind of get the left

1711
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:09,820
too.
Um,

1712
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:11,763
I don't know,
they can't kind of put an end to this 

1713
01:37:12,851 --> 01:37:17,620
because it is much more of a mob social 
media phenomenon then it is kind of some

1714
01:37:17,621 --> 01:37:18,454
diktat coming up from on high.
And so one really the only way to break 

1715
01:37:22,181 --> 01:37:26,800
through it is to say what you are,
what you say that you're afraid to say.

1716
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:27,663
Right?
I mean that's the only way to sort of 

1717
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:34,170
um,
pop this bubble or kind of end this end,

1718
01:37:34,871 --> 01:37:37,450
this anxiety or at least diffuse it a 
little bit.

1719
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:38,313
Whereas again,
what I hear Mr. Peterson talking about 

1720
01:37:41,921 --> 01:37:46,921
as political correctness is something 
much more broad and much more,

1721
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:50,620
um,
kind of funded,

1722
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,890
much,
much more fundamental to social change.

1723
01:37:53,891 --> 01:37:55,500
And you're talking about,
you know,

1724
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:56,280
you want

1725
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:00,450
me to define or one of us to talk about 
when the left goes too far and if I'm,

1726
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,313
you know,
I certainly don't want to be a woman 

1727
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:03,720
putting words in your mouth,
but if,

1728
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,210
um,
if I hear you correctly,

1729
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:07,463
what you're saying is that you want me 
to kind of renounce Marxist categories 

1730
01:38:11,610 --> 01:38:13,920
or to,
well,

1731
01:38:15,030 --> 01:38:17,010
I want you to define with the left goes 
too far.

1732
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:18,630
You can do it any way you want.
I,

1733
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,523
like I said,
I think that the left goes too far into 

1734
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:26,721
when it is violent or censorious when it
tries to shut people down or no platform

1735
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:31,020
then or when it acts violently,
I,

1736
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:34,860
I'm not sure what you expect.
So beyond that,

1737
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:35,903
something deeper,
how hard like you to contend with the 

1738
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:39,923
set of left wing ideas that produced all
the left wing pathologies of the 20th 

1739
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:48,420
century and to define how you think 
standard left wing thinking,

1740
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:53,421
which has as bell goes too far since it 
obviously does on too far.

1741
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:59,220
Of course the right,
well how about Auschwitz?

1742
01:39:01,490 --> 01:39:06,490
While I was talking about 20th century 
Poland more recently,

1743
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:10,100
what has gone wrong with the right
shots?

1744
01:39:10,510 --> 01:39:13,980
I don't like identity politics players 
at all.

1745
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:15,810
I don't care whether they're on the left
of the right.

1746
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,930
I'd be lecturing about right wing 
extremism for 30 years.

1747
01:39:19,050 --> 01:39:19,883
I'm no fan of the right,
despite the fact that the left would 

1748
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:25,740
like to paint me that way because it's 
more convenient for it to far reasonably

1749
01:39:26,520 --> 01:39:30,720
well where it's threatening to go to far
identitarian Europe,

1750
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:34,080
that's for sure.
It's gone too far in Charlottesville.

1751
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:35,003
It went too far in Norway.
Like how long the list do you want and 

1752
01:39:37,231 --> 01:39:41,060
why am I required to produce that to 
show you that I don't like I to Terry,

1753
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,860
so your assumption,
your assumption is something

1754
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:50,720
how that I must be on the side of the 
right.

1755
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:51,583
It's like look,
the right has occupied the humanities 

1756
01:39:54,891 --> 01:39:57,650
and the social sciences.
It's as simple as that.

1757
01:39:57,651 --> 01:39:59,390
For me,
if they had,

1758
01:39:59,391 --> 01:40:01,460
I'd be objecting to them.
Say that again.

1759
01:40:01,461 --> 01:40:02,294
That I didn't have the right has not 
occupied the social sciences and the 

1760
01:40:06,771 --> 01:40:09,440
humanities.
And the left clearly has the statistical

1761
01:40:09,441 --> 01:40:11,270
evidence for that is overwhelming.
Sir.

1762
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:14,600
What about Iq testing in terms of 
genetic inheritance?

1763
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:18,950
[inaudible] here to talk about 
political,

1764
01:40:18,951 --> 01:40:19,220
correct?

1765
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,270
Yes.
And we've done a damn,

1766
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:22,840
I gave you an example,
Carolyn,

1767
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:26,060
redeem ourselves with our closing 
statements.

1768
01:40:26,061 --> 01:40:27,770
I'm going to put three minutes on the 
clock,

1769
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:29,720
ready to go in the reverse order of the 
opening.

1770
01:40:29,721 --> 01:40:32,690
So Steven Europe First,
oh Lordy,

1771
01:40:32,690 --> 01:40:36,800
Lordy
hide behind the lectured in that case.

1772
01:40:37,190 --> 01:40:38,023
Well,
I've been fascinated by this 

1773
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:39,824
conversation.
There's been an enormous clash of 

1774
01:40:40,701 --> 01:40:43,250
cultures in,
in the conversation we've had,

1775
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,240
you know,
classic,

1776
01:40:44,241 --> 01:40:47,660
if I can call it huckstering snake coil 
pulpit talk.

1777
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,980
It's up.
It's a motive

1778
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,843
discourse.
It's a rhetorical style that I'd find 

1779
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,880
industry refreshing.
Vivifying um,

1780
01:40:59,050 --> 01:40:59,883
but I'm,
I'm not sure that we actually focused 

1781
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:01,960
on,
on,

1782
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,610
on the,
the point in question then.

1783
01:41:04,240 --> 01:41:06,740
My objection has always been towards 
orthodoxies.

1784
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:08,190
I'm a,
I'm a heterodox and,

1785
01:41:08,240 --> 01:41:09,790
uh,
an a contrarian,

1786
01:41:09,791 --> 01:41:10,624
then I can't help myself.
And I think there's been an 

1787
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:16,921
underestimation of the fact that 
language does affect people.

1788
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:17,974
It does make the young in particular is 
they're starting out on their 

1789
01:41:20,861 --> 01:41:23,770
educational or their work careers.
It makes them,

1790
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:25,960
it makes them very anxious.
It makes them very angry,

1791
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:27,790
very upset,
very alienated,

1792
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:32,440
uh,
to feel that they don't know anymore how

1793
01:41:32,441 --> 01:41:36,220
to operate in the world,
how to engage in relationships,

1794
01:41:36,221 --> 01:41:38,230
how to think honestly.
So they,

1795
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:41,680
they accrete more and more to their own 
mini groups.

1796
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:42,860
Um,
and,

1797
01:41:42,861 --> 01:41:45,550
and I think that's dangerous and unhappy
for society.

1798
01:41:45,551 --> 01:41:46,384
I think it's reflected in,
in the paucity of cinema and literature 

1799
01:41:50,891 --> 01:41:55,360
and arts and the culture generally is 
that there's a fear that's pervading it.

1800
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:59,440
And while people can talk to academia,
and so you should come see our lessons.

1801
01:41:59,441 --> 01:42:02,410
Our lectures are open and free and ideas
are exchanged.

1802
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:04,630
I'm sure that's true.
I'm sure it's true.

1803
01:42:04,631 --> 01:42:05,464
But I don't think we should 
underestimate how much this feeling is 

1804
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:12,274
prevalent in the culture of
this strange paradox that the liberals 

1805
01:42:18,251 --> 01:42:21,700
are in liberal in the demand for 
liberality.

1806
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:25,390
They are exclusive in their demand for 
inclusivity.

1807
01:42:25,810 --> 01:42:26,643
They are
homogenous in their demand for 

1808
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,951
heterogeneity.
They are somehow and diverse in the call

1809
01:42:35,981 --> 01:42:36,814
for diversity.
You can be diverse but not diverse in 

1810
01:42:39,671 --> 01:42:43,390
your opinions and in your language and 
then your behavior and that's it.

1811
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:44,263
Terrible pitching.

1812
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:49,980
I,
I would,

1813
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:52,780
I would say that I'm,
I'm sorry that it got a bit heated,

1814
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,770
uh,
in,

1815
01:42:53,771 --> 01:42:56,090
in places because I was hoping it 
wouldn't die.

1816
01:42:56,091 --> 01:42:56,924
I was hoping would be a shining example 
of people of all different kinds of 

1817
01:42:59,980 --> 01:43:02,450
political outlooks can,
uh,

1818
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:06,430
speak with humor and wit and a lightness
of touch.

1819
01:43:06,431 --> 01:43:07,264
As gk Chesterton said,
angels can fly because they take 

1820
01:43:09,971 --> 01:43:10,804
themselves lightly.
And I think it's very important for us 

1821
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:16,240
who are privileged.
All four of us previous to be here,

1822
01:43:16,241 --> 01:43:17,074
to be asked to be here,
to take ourselves a little bit more 

1823
01:43:18,701 --> 01:43:19,534
likely not to be too earnest,
too pompous to serious a and not to be 

1824
01:43:23,681 --> 01:43:25,660
too certain.
Uh,

1825
01:43:25,890 --> 01:43:26,723
it's a,
it's a,

1826
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:29,800
uh,
a time I think for really engaging,

1827
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:34,210
emotionally fulfilling,
passionate and positive doubt.

1828
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:35,373
That's what I would

1829
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:41,230
[inaudible] we're going to put minutes 
on the clock for

1830
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,950
you please.
Uh,

1831
01:43:52,970 --> 01:43:53,803
your closing.
Thank you so much for that compliment 

1832
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:56,673
fry.
I'm used to not exclusively white men 

1833
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:01,933
who see black intelligence articulated 
at a certain level of feeling a kind of 

1834
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:07,770
condescension.
If I came up here at Miss,

1835
01:44:07,771 --> 01:44:10,250
uh,
I was saying the other day,

1836
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:11,743
but but a kind of verbal facility 
automatically assumed to be a kind of 

1837
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:17,750
hucksterism and snake oil salesmen.
I've seen that.

1838
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:18,584
I get it.
I get hate letters every day from white 

1839
01:44:20,571 --> 01:44:22,670
brothers and sisters who were mad.
I'm teaching their children.

1840
01:44:22,671 --> 01:44:24,950
You're just trying to coopt our 
children.

1841
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:27,140
You're trying to corrupt them.
Yes,

1842
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:27,974
I'm trying to corrupt them so they will 
be uncorrupted by the corruptibility 

1843
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:31,964
that they've inherited from a society 
that refuses to see all people as human 

1844
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:37,124
beings.
The death threats I've received 

1845
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:41,600
constantly for simply trying to speak my
mind.

1846
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:42,613
It's not about a politically correct 
society that is open minded and bet has 

1847
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:49,760
some consternation about my ability to 
speak.

1848
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,893
I'm getting real live.
You want empirical death threats that 

1849
01:44:53,841 --> 01:44:58,280
talk about killing me,
setting up to hurt me and harm me simply

1850
01:44:58,281 --> 01:44:59,114
because I choose to speak my mind.
I agree with my [inaudible] and my 

1851
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:03,044
compatriots that we should argue against
the vicious limitation and recursions 

1852
01:45:06,471 --> 01:45:07,304
against speech.
I believe that everybody has the right 

1853
01:45:09,561 --> 01:45:10,394
to be able to articulate themselves and 
the enormous privilege we have to come 

1854
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:14,204
to a spot in the space like this means 
that we have that privilege and we 

1855
01:45:17,361 --> 01:45:18,194
should be responsible for it.
No matter where we go from here and me 

1856
01:45:20,781 --> 01:45:23,090
and brother Peterson would go to a black
Baptist church.

1857
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:26,600
I'm a hold him to that.
He said it on national TV.

1858
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:27,434
We're going to go to a black Baptist 
church and have an enlightening 

1859
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:35,771
conversation about the need for us to 
engage in not only reciprocal and mutual

1860
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:38,210
edification,
but criticism.

1861
01:45:38,300 --> 01:45:39,133
Even hard and tough criticism,
but in a way that speaks to the needs 

1862
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:46,940
and interests of those who don't usually
get on TV,

1863
01:45:47,060 --> 01:45:47,893
who's voices are not usually amplified,
whose ideas are not usually taken 

1864
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:52,334
seriously and when they get to the upper
echelons of the ability of a society to 

1865
01:45:56,811 --> 01:45:57,644
express themselves,
they are equally subject too vicious 

1866
01:46:00,981 --> 01:46:01,814
recrimination and hurtful resistance.
There's an old story about the pig and 

1867
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:08,240
the pig and the chicken going down the 
street and said,

1868
01:46:08,241 --> 01:46:09,200
let's have breakfast.

1869
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:12,253
Yeah,

1870
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:14,893
the chicken just has to give up an egg.
The pig has to give up his ass in order 

1871
01:46:19,461 --> 01:46:20,294
to make breakfast.
We have often been the pigs giving up 

1872
01:46:22,101 --> 01:46:25,400
our asses to make breakfast.
Let's start sharing them.

1873
01:46:25,401 --> 01:46:27,230
Asses what everybody else.
Thank you.

1874
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:32,480
[inaudible]

1875
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:43,190
so I'm not here to claim that there's no
such thing as oppression,

1876
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,120
unfairness,
brutality,

1877
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:50,370
discrimination,
unfair

1878
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:52,410
use of power.
All of those,

1879
01:46:52,411 --> 01:46:53,244
anyone with any sense knows that 
hierarchical structures tilt towards 

1880
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:02,271
tyranny and that we have to be 
constantly for to ensure that

1881
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,213
all they are isn't powering tyranny.
It's interesting to hear Fuko referred 

1882
01:47:09,211 --> 01:47:10,560
to.
It's unfortunate,

1883
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:12,630
but it's interesting,
you know,

1884
01:47:13,050 --> 01:47:13,883
because of coal,
like his French intellectual conference 

1885
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,790
essentially believed that the only basis
upon which hierarchies were established,

1886
01:47:20,791 --> 01:47:21,624
his power,
and that's part of this pernicious 

1887
01:47:23,281 --> 01:47:26,670
politically correct doctrine that I've 
been speaking about.

1888
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:27,993
When a hierarchy becomes corrupt,
then the only way to ascend it is to 

1889
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:31,884
exercise power.
That's essentially the definition of a 

1890
01:47:33,511 --> 01:47:36,330
tyranny,
but that doesn't mean that the imperfect

1891
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:39,900
hierarchies that we have constructed in 
our relatively free countries,

1892
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:41,003
which at least tilt somewhat towards 
competence and ability as evidenced by 

1893
01:47:45,691 --> 01:47:46,524
the staggering achievements of 
civilization that we've managed to 

1894
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:51,720
produce.
It doesn't mean that the hip appropriate

1895
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:52,554
way of diagnosing them is to assume 
without reservation unit dimensionally 

1896
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,200
that they're all about power and as a 
consequence,

1897
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,034
everyone who occupies any position 
within them is a tyrant or a tyrant in 

1898
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,720
the making.

1899
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,100
And that is certainly the fundamental 
claim of someone like Fuko and it's part

1900
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:10,500
and parcel of this,
what would you call it?

1901
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:14,640
This ideological catastrophe.
That's political correctness.

1902
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:15,653
I'm not here to argue against progress.
I'm not here to argue against equality 

1903
01:48:19,261 --> 01:48:20,094
of opportunity.
Anyone with any sense understands that 

1904
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:23,333
even if you're selfish,
you're best served by allowing yourself 

1905
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:27,714
access to the multiplicitous talents of 
everyone and to discriminate against 

1906
01:48:31,261 --> 01:48:32,094
them for arbitrary reasons,
unrelated to their competence is it's a 

1907
01:48:34,771 --> 01:48:37,650
Borat that has nothing to do with the 
issue at hand.

1908
01:48:38,010 --> 01:48:40,140
It's,
it isn't that good.

1909
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:43,590
Things haven't happened in the past and 
should continue to happen.

1910
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:44,633
That's not the point.
The point is the point my compatriot 

1911
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:47,754
fried made,
which is what we can agree on the 

1912
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:53,790
catastrophe and we can agree on the 
historic inequity,

1913
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:59,060
but there's no way I'm going to agree 
that political correctness is the way to

1914
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:00,234
address any of that.
And there's plenty of evidence to the 

1915
01:49:02,191 --> 01:49:03,024
contrary.
Some of which I would say was displayed 

1916
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:05,640
quite clearly tonight.

1917
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:11,410
[inaudible]

1918
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:18,623
so I think one of the irresolvable 
issues that we're all coming up against 

1919
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,400
is the role of feelings,
right?

1920
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:27,234
Stephen Fry has kind of asked us to 
recognize and empathize with this 

1921
01:49:31,951 --> 01:49:35,190
feeling of being silenced if being 
threatened.

1922
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:36,760
And I do,
and I,

1923
01:49:36,761 --> 01:49:38,090
I get it.
Um,

1924
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:39,750
you know,
I feel it sometimes too,

1925
01:49:39,751 --> 01:49:40,584
and my columns,
I hate it when I write something that 

1926
01:49:43,711 --> 01:49:44,550
then,
you know,

1927
01:49:44,551 --> 01:49:47,500
gets a kind of irate twitter mob after 
me.

1928
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,990
But if,
say I stood up here and said,

1929
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:53,853
you know,
recognize how threatened so many women 

1930
01:49:57,881 --> 01:49:59,530
feel when,
for example,

1931
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:00,364
the,
the kindness,

1932
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:01,513
you know,
one of the best selling and most 

1933
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:03,334
prominent intellectuals in the world 
right now it's t says in an interview 

1934
01:50:06,791 --> 01:50:07,624
that maybe the me too movement has shown
that this whole experiment of men and 

1935
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:13,630
women working together,
it's just not working.

1936
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:14,703
Or you know,
maybe if women don't want to be s don't 

1937
01:50:17,351 --> 01:50:18,184
want the workplace to be sexualized,
they shouldn't be allowed to wear 

1938
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:21,060
makeup.

1939
01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:21,893
Right?
Right.

1940
01:50:22,150 --> 01:50:23,230
Well,
Google it.

1941
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:24,670
See if it's vice interview,
Google it.

1942
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,660
Yeah.
Well,

1943
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,250
so,
so,

1944
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,720
right.
If I say like,

1945
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:31,990
you know,
I feel threatened right,

1946
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:35,080
then I'm being kind of politically 
correct and hysterical.

1947
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:38,440
So much of the debate about political 
correct,

1948
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,583
but there's one group that really does 
think it's feeling should be 

1949
01:50:44,071 --> 01:50:44,904
accommodated.
And that is what we keep coming up 

1950
01:50:46,921 --> 01:50:49,290
against is that,
you know,

1951
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,153
there's a group of people and that to 
some extent on part of it that feels 

1952
01:50:54,211 --> 01:50:58,890
uniquely that our feelings of being 
silenced,

1953
01:50:58,891 --> 01:51:01,020
marginalized,
censored,

1954
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:04,680
that those feelings need to take 
primacy,

1955
01:51:04,681 --> 01:51:06,360
that we can kind of,
um,

1956
01:51:07,010 --> 01:51:08,220
you know,
sneer,

1957
01:51:08,221 --> 01:51:09,054
when these other groups ask for us to 
take seriously their feelings of being 

1958
01:51:15,181 --> 01:51:18,960
threatened or their feelings of being 
marginalized,

1959
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:19,823
then we call it,
we call that we call those demands 

1960
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,513
political correctness.
And I would finally say that I think 

1961
01:51:26,491 --> 01:51:31,200
there is a fair amount of research that 
people become more closed minded,

1962
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:36,560
more tribal when they feel threatened,
when they feel that their group identity

1963
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:41,340
is at stake.
And so as much as you know,

1964
01:51:41,610 --> 01:51:45,330
you want to blame the left for the rise 
of the right.

1965
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:49,500
I think that when you kind of vet the 
rise of the right,

1966
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:50,363
the rise of people who are questioning 
the fundamental ideals of pluralistic 

1967
01:51:55,591 --> 01:51:59,580
liberal democracy,
the more those views are mainstreamed,

1968
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:03,990
the more people I think are going to 
shut down in response because people are

1969
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,220
really scared.

1970
01:52:13,070 --> 01:52:14,570
Well,
first of all,

1971
01:52:14,571 --> 01:52:15,350
I think on behalf

1972
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:17,690
all the debaters,
I think we want to thank the audience.

1973
01:52:17,691 --> 01:52:21,940
You were engaged a,
you were mostly civil and uh,

1974
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:24,080
lots of civil in ways.
I think that we enjoy it.

1975
01:52:24,081 --> 01:52:26,030
So I think on behalf of the debaters,
everybody,

1976
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:28,970
thank you audience.
This was a challenging topic and you did

1977
01:52:28,971 --> 01:52:29,200
it.

1978
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,360
Great job.
Big.

1979
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:35,430
Thank you.
You too.

1980
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:36,300
Our debaters,
you know,

1981
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:37,650
it's one thing,
all of these,

1982
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:39,930
uh,
four give regular speeches,

1983
01:52:39,931 --> 01:52:41,970
but it's a very different thing to come 
on in front,

1984
01:52:42,030 --> 01:52:44,940
in a stage in front of a live audience,
a large television,

1985
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,910
and have your ideas a contested in real 
time.

1986
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:52,730
And uh,
again to all four of you.

1987
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,870
Thank you for accepting our invitation 
to

1988
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:59,990
come here.
[inaudible] so a few final notes.

1989
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:09,830
First,
thank you to the Oreo Foundation and the

monk family.
For once again convening us here at Roy 

1991
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,833
Thomson Hall.
We're going to do it all again this 

1992
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:17,113
coming autumn.
All of you have a ballot here in the 

1993
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:20,780
hall.
You can vote on your way out.

1994
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:21,614
We'll have those results for you just 
probably after nine 15 and let's just 

1995
01:53:28,311 --> 01:53:33,311
quickly review where your opinions stood
at the beginning of tonight's contest on

1996
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:35,660
the motion,
be it resolved,

1997
01:53:35,661 --> 01:53:38,750
what I call political correctness,
what you call it,

1998
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:40,580
political correctness.
I call progress.

1999
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:43,610
36% agrees,
64% disagree.

2000
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,980
And again,
we saw a large percentage of you willing

2001
01:53:45,981 --> 01:53:46,814
to change your mind 87%.
So let's see how tonight's cut and 

2002
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:51,764
thrust affected your voting.
Here you've got your ballots and again

2010
01:55:15,420 --> 01:55:18,330

2011
01:55:18,331 --> 01:55:19,164
So what would be curious to see what 
happens with the audience vote over the 

2012
01:55:22,351 --> 01:55:23,184
course of the next few minutes.
And also for those of you watching

2014
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:33,420
That poll again was ww munk debates.com 
forward slash.

2015
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,430
Boat.
So go there,

2016
01:55:35,431 --> 01:55:36,264
check out,
see how each of these debaters did in 

2017
01:55:38,281 --> 01:55:40,440
terms of their opening statements that 
are rebuttals,

2018
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,960
the moderated section and the closing 
statements.

2019
01:55:43,080 --> 01:55:44,100
We see any changes

2020
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,810
there.
So again,

2021
01:55:45,811 --> 01:55:46,644
we're going to go right now to Stephen 
Fry and Jordan Peterson get their 

2022
01:55:48,811 --> 01:55:53,811
thoughts on how the evening played out.
Gentlemen,

2023
01:55:56,941 --> 01:55:59,100
thank you.
Thank you both.

2024
01:55:59,101 --> 01:55:59,934
We're just going to do a quick 
discussion with the online audience is 

2025
01:56:02,101 --> 01:56:02,934
watching right now just to get your 
reactions to the debate and maybe just 

2026
01:56:05,971 --> 01:56:06,840
start with you.
Uh,

2027
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:08,340
Jordan.
There were some heated moments here.

2028
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:11,310
Did that,
did that surprise you that uh,

2029
01:56:11,350 --> 01:56:14,130
the exchanges that you had with Michael 
Eric Dyson?

2030
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:16,470
Well,
I wouldn't say it surprised me.

2031
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:17,333
Well I suppose it probably did.
It just team didn't seem like a very 

2032
01:56:19,651 --> 01:56:21,630
good tactical move,
you know,

2033
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:23,430
and,
and I stand by what I said.

2034
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:26,470
I don't see any reason at all that my 
racial identity,

2035
01:56:26,471 --> 01:56:29,970
he needed to be dragged into the 
discussion independent of my personality

2036
01:56:30,180 --> 01:56:31,013
proclivity.
I would say what I just said to Mr. Fry 

2037
01:56:33,151 --> 01:56:35,370
here is that it was a pleasure sharing 
the stage with him.

2038
01:56:35,370 --> 01:56:40,370
I've rarely heard anyone ever deliver 
their convictions with such a remarkable

2039
01:56:41,581 --> 01:56:42,414
sense of passion.
And we have 10 forbearance and 

2040
01:56:45,421 --> 01:56:46,440
erudition.
It was,

2041
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:48,060
it was really something.
Yeah,

2042
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:49,253
and Stephen challenging debate because 
in a sense we're trying to mesh two 

2043
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:53,600
different views here,
two different worldviews.

2044
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:55,920
One very focused more on identity 
politics,

2045
01:56:55,921 --> 01:56:58,830
group identity.
You in a sense having an argument really

2046
01:56:58,831 --> 01:56:59,664
more about the larger culture itself and
the tenor and tone of the conversation 

2047
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:05,720
with them.
I was being a little kind of scatter gun

2048
01:57:05,730 --> 01:57:06,563
really,
but it's got the gun and two specific 

2049
01:57:08,941 --> 01:57:09,774
that I had just taken.
Very literally the popular idea that 

2050
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:16,260
correctness is being a kind of control 
of language and the uh,

2051
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:20,040
shutting done certain phrases or an 
introduction of others and,

2052
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:21,650
and,
and the,

2053
01:57:21,850 --> 01:57:22,683
the kind of day to day as I say,
human resource departments of 

2054
01:57:24,721 --> 01:57:27,280
corporations and that sort of thing.

2055
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,113
And,
and uh,

2056
01:57:28,440 --> 01:57:29,273
um,
so I was slightly disappointed that it 

2057
01:57:31,141 --> 01:57:34,580
just became a debate about race and 
about gender and so on.

2058
01:57:34,581 --> 01:57:35,250
And,
uh,

2059
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:39,000
but that was I guess not true.
And I still think know the fact is I,

2060
01:57:39,570 --> 01:57:41,460
I,
I'm still a lefty,

2061
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:44,720
but a software I'm just don't have,
I'm not too soft

2062
01:57:46,730 --> 01:57:49,070
squishy in every sentence.
Um,

2063
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,213
and,
and I realized that that's not a 

2064
01:57:50,941 --> 01:57:53,230
political point of view.
It is a personal way.

2065
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,690
Um,
and the,

2066
01:57:55,170 --> 01:57:57,780
the gap between the personal and the 
political,

2067
01:57:57,781 --> 01:57:58,614
which is a space you want,
obviously very interested in is this 

2068
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:01,090
like psychologist,
um,

2069
01:58:01,680 --> 01:58:04,380
is one that is rarely explored.
Um,

2070
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:05,273
uh,
people that are either so personal that 

2071
01:58:06,991 --> 01:58:07,824
it has no application in the outside 
world and the Organization of Human 

2072
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:11,663
Affairs or the soap and the article and 
so much to do with structure and 

2073
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:16,920
distinction between hierarchies and 
networks and so on,

2074
01:58:17,160 --> 01:58:17,993
that they forget the individual.
And that's the space in which the 

2075
01:58:22,351 --> 01:58:23,184
impassioned liberal lives.
And it's not easy to do it because you 

2076
01:58:26,371 --> 01:58:28,700
often do son rather wet.
And I'm aware that I,

2077
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:30,143
I enjoyed it.
Well,

2078
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:31,470
thank you for coming.
He just finally,

2079
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:34,460
before I free you to both to a well 
earned drank,

2080
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:36,480
anything left unsaid,
Jordan,

2081
01:58:36,481 --> 01:58:37,410
any,
um,

2082
01:58:37,470 --> 01:58:39,840
any point that you wanted to make that,
uh,

2083
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,830
you didn't feel you had the time or the 
opportunity?

2084
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:43,480
No,
I don't think so.

2085
01:58:43,481 --> 01:58:44,500
I said my piece.
Yeah.

2086
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:46,000
Great.
Same question to you is you,

2087
01:58:46,020 --> 01:58:47,730
I know,
I think I goes across her,

2088
01:58:47,731 --> 01:58:48,564
I mean,
there's so much you can talk about it 

2089
01:58:49,621 --> 01:58:49,970
in,
in,

2090
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:53,170
in that field and I just wanted to leave
with the point that I do want,

2091
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:54,580
like everybody,
it's,

2092
01:58:54,581 --> 01:58:55,630
it's,
it's a no brainer.

2093
01:58:55,680 --> 01:58:58,560
We want the world to be fair,
just a Sweden kind of,

2094
01:58:58,770 --> 01:59:00,790
um,
but it's how you get there.

2095
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,320
Uh,
and um,

2096
01:59:02,590 --> 01:59:04,710
and I felt that wasn't really addressed.
Okay.

2097
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:06,550
Well gentlemen,
thank you both very much.

2098
01:59:06,551 --> 01:59:08,970
A from our online audience.
A big thank you all.

2099
01:59:08,971 --> 01:59:12,450
So I know to Jordan Peterson and Stephen
Fry for participating in a,

2100
01:59:12,451 --> 01:59:13,284
yeah,
I had a debate with some steaks on the 

2101
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:16,060
table for sure.
Thank you gentlemen.

2102
01:59:16,061 --> 01:59:17,070
I'll see you in the reception.
Yep,

2103
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:17,890
Yep.
Uh,

2104
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:18,760
again,
online,

2105
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:20,770
uh,
viewers,

2106
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:24,970
we've now have a Michael Eric dyson 
coming into the camera range here with,

2107
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:27,730
uh,
Michelle Goldberg to get their reactions

2108
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:29,380
to the debate.
So guys,

2109
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:31,810
thank you for being part of this.
You know,

2110
01:59:31,811 --> 01:59:34,270
it's a,
it's a complicated subject.

2111
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,700
It's got a lot of different moving 
pieces and elements.

2112
01:59:36,701 --> 01:59:39,430
I think we addressed some of the 
constituent parts.

2113
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:41,140
Maybe start with you,
Michelle.

2114
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,333
Um,
was there something on stage that you 

2115
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:44,823
wanted to say that maybe we didn't have 
the time or he didn't have the 

2116
01:59:47,351 --> 01:59:48,790
opportunity?
Uh,

2117
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:49,930
you know,
now's your chance.

2118
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:51,090
Well,
you know,

2119
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:51,933
I guess I w if,
the only thing I can think of is that 

2120
01:59:53,291 --> 01:59:54,124
maybe I wish that we could have drilled 
down a little bit more into the gender 

2121
01:59:57,071 --> 02:00:00,130
piece of this again to,
you know,

2122
02:00:00,131 --> 02:00:02,490
what we're really arguing about,
um,

2123
02:00:02,590 --> 02:00:07,590
particularly with Mr. Peterson and the 
kind of range of progress,

2124
02:00:07,730 --> 02:00:11,230
the range of feminist progress that he 
considers,

2125
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:13,300
um,
political correctness.

2126
02:00:13,301 --> 02:00:18,280
I think part of the frustration is that 
him and Steven Fry are talking about and

2127
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:19,114
defending,
I think a fairly discrete set of ideas 

2128
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:23,100
with some overlap.
Um,

2129
02:00:23,380 --> 02:00:24,213
you know,
and one of the difficult things about 

2130
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:25,984
political correctness is it's a slippery
term that's deployed to talk about a 

2131
02:00:30,461 --> 02:00:31,910
whole range of phenomenon.
Yeah.

2132
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,900
And

2133
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:35,150
closed down conversation and open up 
conversation.

2134
02:00:35,151 --> 02:00:36,590
Don't ha ha.
How did you feel?

2135
02:00:36,591 --> 02:00:37,640
Uh,
Michael?

2136
02:00:37,641 --> 02:00:38,900
There were some points there,
a,

2137
02:00:38,901 --> 02:00:39,420
some,
you know,

2138
02:00:39,420 --> 02:00:42,080
points of sharp exchange.
We appreciate that at the munk debates.

2139
02:00:42,081 --> 02:00:43,310
I mean,
this is not a place for,

2140
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:44,790
for a,
you know,

2141
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:46,420
shrinking wallflowers.
Uh,

2142
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:47,383
but,
uh,

2143
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:49,370
any unsaid thoughts,
any,

2144
02:00:49,550 --> 02:00:52,670
anything that you want to put a point on
now?

2145
02:00:52,730 --> 02:00:53,720
I think you have to hold people

2146
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:54,813
intellectually accountable and to deny 
some of the things to Michelle that he 

2147
02:00:58,961 --> 02:00:59,794
said and to present himself Mr. Peterson
in a certain way without seeing some of 

2148
02:01:03,731 --> 02:01:07,870
the important things he said about women
and other minorities.

2149
02:01:07,871 --> 02:01:11,830
I think demands and engaged response to 
him.

2150
02:01:12,220 --> 02:01:13,053
And I think that the idea itself,
as Michelle stated repeatedly and Mr. 

2151
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:19,030
Fry talking about his frustration,
he said,

2152
02:01:19,031 --> 02:01:21,130
we've talked about everything but 
political correctness.

2153
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:22,413
Well,
the reality is political correctness 

2154
02:01:23,651 --> 02:01:27,310
resides,
I mean rests upon some serious political

2155
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:31,420
work in this culture in Canada and in 
America that needs to be done.

2156
02:01:31,780 --> 02:01:34,510
And what I tried to,
in terms of giving a brief genealogy,

2157
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:35,493
we didn't have political correctness as 
long as white straight men were in 

2158
02:01:37,451 --> 02:01:38,284
charge.
There was no argument about let's get 

2159
02:01:40,791 --> 02:01:44,540
this right.
But when people who exercise power,

2160
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:47,150
no longer exercise,
absolute power,

2161
02:01:47,151 --> 02:01:49,910
still predominant power,
then there's an argument.

2162
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:53,060
And I think Michelle's point about 
gender,

2163
02:01:53,420 --> 02:01:55,520
about the workplace,
about race,

2164
02:01:55,521 --> 02:01:57,200
about sexuality,
and the link.

2165
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,363
I just think that it was a necessarily 
vigorous and sometimes sharply worded a 

2166
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:04,310
debate between us shall final word to 
you.

2167
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,093
Well,
if you are curious about the quote that 

2168
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:13,730
I mentioned about,
you know,

2169
02:02:13,731 --> 02:02:16,430
maybe this experiment with women and men
working together,

2170
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:17,390
maybe it's not working.
I mean,

2171
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:19,500
please do Google it.
It's an interview with Vice.

2172
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:21,910
Did you know your columns for north one 
of your columns?

2173
02:02:23,690 --> 02:02:26,100
Again?
No.

2174
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,013
Me and Steven,
me and Stephen Fry probably could have 

2175
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:33,650
sat on the same side of another debate.
But again,

2176
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:34,513
I feel like the phrase political 
correctness has expanded to cover a 

2177
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,613
whole range of challenges too.
I thought it was really interesting how 

2178
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:46,160
much people are talking about their 
feelings because when,

2179
02:02:46,260 --> 02:02:49,070
when women talk about their feelings,
right,

2180
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:53,630
that is politically correct excess.
And when,

2181
02:02:54,160 --> 02:02:59,160
when men talk about this feeling that 
they can't empirically define,

2182
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:00,620
we should all,
I guess,

2183
02:03:00,621 --> 02:03:02,180
I dunno,
change,

2184
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,530
change in deference to that.

2185
02:03:04,140 --> 02:03:05,340
Okay guys,
great thoughts.

2186
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:07,380
Let's go get a drink in the reception.
Thank you.

2187
02:03:07,770 --> 02:03:08,820
I'm buying.
Okay.

2188
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:10,770
Thanks again.

So share it with friends and family.
I'm ready.

2205
02:03:55,201 --> 02:03:56,034
You're griffiths from downtown Toronto,
Canada at the monk debate on political 

2206
02:03:58,831 --> 02:04:00,960
correctness.
See again in the autumn.

2207
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:02,010
Take care.
Good night.

2208
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,683
Yeah.
