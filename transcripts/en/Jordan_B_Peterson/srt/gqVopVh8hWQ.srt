1
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,480
I guess it starts right away.
I can check here.

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,763
Yeah,
it's life.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,520
And that's that.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,600
All right.
It looks like we're ready to go.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,360
So welcome everybody.
Um,

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,260
let's see how the q and a and goes.
I've got a number of,

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,123
of uh,
the questions that people have already 

8
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:42,520
submitted,
so I'll probably start with those.

9
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,310
And for those of you who are on the live
chat,

10
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,173
you can submit questions too and I'll,
I'll probably just move back and forth 

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,620
between the ones that are pre submitted 
in the ones that you guys are asking.

12
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,850
So,
and yes,

13
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:56,690
it will be uploaded later.
And uh,

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,070
I think youtube does that automatically.
Really good to see all of you,

15
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,490
um,
are people from all over the world here?

16
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,170
London and Vancouver.
And let's see,

17
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,460
where else are you guys from?

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,443
Okay,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,313
well Toronto,
that's not quite as exciting since I 

20
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,140
live here.
Quebec,

21
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,980
Calgary,
Edmonton,

22
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,623
Vienna.

23
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:22,960
Okay.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,130
Boston,
Auckland,

25
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:25,540
New Zealand,
Montreal,

26
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:27,940
Texas.
Here we go.

27
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,070
Morocco,
Netherlands.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,050
Yeah,
it's amazing that this can,

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,620
this can happen like that as far as I'm 
concerned.

30
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:41,550
So it's going to take me just a bit to 
get adapted to what I'm doing.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,190
Okay.
First question,

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,473
what is your advice for finding a sane 
sound therapist and do you think a 

33
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:51,394
fruitful psychotherapeutic relationship 
requires a therapist to have specific 

34
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,234
temperamental compatibility or even 
literacy and interests that align with 

35
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,880
the patient?
Well,

36
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,773
I would say with regards to finding a 
sane and sound therapists there some 

37
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:06,880
practical things you can do.
Um,

38
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,283
I guess this is more relevant if you 
live in North America and I'm not sure 

39
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,630
exactly what the training requirements 
are and other places in the world,

40
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:18,631
but your best bet I would say is to find
someone who's appropriately trained.

41
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:19,774
And I would regard someone who's 
appropriately trained as a 

42
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,863
psychotherapist to be someone who's,
I think you're safer if you go with 

43
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:28,144
someone who's trained at one of the big 
research schools and you have a 

44
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,144
therapist who's well versed in 
psychotherapeutic practice but who's 

45
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:35,914
also sufficiently educated 
scientifically to be able to understand 

46
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,030
the scientific literature.

47
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,863
And you can be pretty certain of that if
you find a therapist who's got their 

48
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,290
phd,
um,

49
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,213
rather than a psy d now,
not that there's anything necessarily 

50
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,390
wrong with Saudis.
If they go,

51
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,243
Hey,
go received their phd from an American 

52
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,460
Psychological Association approved,
um,

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,433
um,
school of clinical and those schools 

54
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,460
operate under what's called the bolder 
model.

55
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:06,790
And the boulder model is promotes,
um,

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,010
what now what,
what's it called,

57
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,040
science,
science practitioner as,

58
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:16,660
as the optimal ideal combination for a 
psychotherapist.

59
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,580
So someone who's trained 
psychotherapeutic,

60
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,653
but also has research experience and can
understand the relevant scientific 

61
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,650
literature as it pertains to,
to mental health.

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,850
So that would be the first thing.
The second thing I would say is,

63
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,170
um,
well I go to see yours,

64
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,103
a psychotherapist once and maybe go to 
see a couple of them and find someone 

65
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:42,310
that listens to you because the 
psychotherapist shouldn't be someone who

66
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,810
solves your problems for you or offers 
even really offers you advice.

67
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,643
Although sometimes that can be helpful.
Really what the psychotherapists should 

68
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,814
do is be someone who can help you 
understand what problem it is that 

69
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,774
you're facing so that that can be 
delineated properly to help you 

70
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:00,004
articulate what it is that you want.
So what your vision of mental health 

71
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:05,590
might be and what you'd like to attain 
in psychotherapy,

72
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,860
and then who helps you strategize 
towards that end.

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,113
And so you want someone who will really 
listen to you that you feel comfortable 

74
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,584
telling the truth too,
because that's also incredibly 

75
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,640
important.
You have to,

76
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,970
you have to,
uh,

77
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,820
if you can't tell your psychotherapist 
the truth,

78
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:25,654
then you're not going to get anywhere in
therapy because you won't be able to 

79
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,970
actually outline the nature of your 
fundamental problems.

80
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,373
So that's vital and go see someone and 
see if you're happy with the way that 

81
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,600
you're interacting with them.
That's the most relevant issue.

82
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,980
So
that's the first question.

83
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,983
Now the next one was,
do I think s fruitful psychotherapeutic 

84
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,344
relationship requires the therapist to 
have specific temperamental 

85
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:56,290
compatibility or even literacy and 
interests that align with the patient?

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,400
I think that
it's,

87
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,234
I think it's difficult to work with a 
therapist who is less intelligent than 

88
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:06,864
you are.
That's kind of a rough way of 

89
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:10,254
conceptualizing it.
But a lot of what a therapist does is 

90
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:13,224
help you strategize and the person has 
to be able to think analytically and 

91
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:16,554
probably at least to some degree to the 
same with the same degree of complexity 

92
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,550
that you're capable of.
Um,

93
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,440
it's not necessarily a good idea to be 
able to out think your,

94
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,750
your therapist.
So

95
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,710
Dr. Peterson,
I heard you recently say that if a woman

96
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:44,700
doesn't want a baby by age 30 that 
something is unhealthy.

97
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,260
I take no offense to that assertion.
Rather I am taking it very seriously.

98
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,690
I'm 34 years old in a longterm 
relationship,

99
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,590
but don't feel desire to have children.
I always thought that I would one day,

100
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,543
but I'm getting older and that I'm 
getting older and that day still hasn't 

101
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:01,130
come.
I'm terrified of reasoning,

102
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,380
realizing too late that I should have 
had a family.

103
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,340
But I'm also terrified of having them 
and regretting it because it never truly

104
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:08,174
want it to be a mother.
I don't think I have any ideology at 

105
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:11,174
play.
I'm not a feminist or anything like 

106
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,720
that.
When you say something might be wrong or

107
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,220
unhealthy,
where might I look?

108
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,910
Any advice on how to make this change 
but won't make this choice?

109
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,920
P S my boyfriend and I both had he 
depaul mothers perhaps that is relevant.

110
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,130
Well it might be relevant given that you
saw fit to um,

111
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,343
included as a potential detail.
And one of the rules that I would 

112
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,814
operate by as a psychotherapist is that 
if a client is inclined to add a detail 

113
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,483
to the

114
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:41,920
okay

115
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,753
to the formulation of a problem,
that the details are likely to be 

116
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,970
relevant.
Um,

117
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,360
but I can't tell,
right?

118
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:53,260
Because of course I can't use it a rule 
of thumb.

119
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:54,650
And so you might object,
well,

120
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,484
I shouldn't have used a rule of thumb to
say something like if a woman doesn't 

121
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,800
want a baby by the age of 30,
that something is unhealthy.

122
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,963
Well,
are going to be exceptions to every 

123
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,423
general rule.
But my attitude to this essentially is 

124
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,104
that we have all come from an unbroken 
string of 3.5 million years of 

125
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:17,780
successful mothers.
And so the probability that that's going

126
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,781
to be part and parcel of the healthy 
woman's desire and not only a woman,

127
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,304
no,
obviously men desire to have a family 

128
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,280
too,
and often very intensely.

129
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,383
It's just that men have a much longer 
time span over which to consider such 

130
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,644
things.
So perhaps the chips aren't down so 

131
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,150
rapidly and to the same degree for men.
Um,

132
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,550
I wouldn't be so bold as to say that 
there's anything wrong with you,

133
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,110
the questionnaire specifically.

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,473
Um,
maybe you have the sort of temperament 

135
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,480
that isn't particularly inclined towards
maternal behavior.

136
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,453
Uh,
that might be someone who's low in 

137
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:59,000
agreeableness and well,
that would be the primary issue.

138
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,230
Um,
and so I wouldn't take my word for it,

139
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:04,064
that if you don't want to have a child 
in your 30 that there is necessarily 

140
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:10,310
something specifically wrong with you.
But I would say as a rule of thumb,

141
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,560
it's,
it's part of the normal panoply of human

142
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,590
desires and values.
And so if,

143
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,860
if,
if there's violent objection to having a

144
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,694
family or something like that,
then generally that seems to me to be 

145
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,000
indicative of something that might be at
least worth looking into.

146
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,170
I'll try a live one here,
a live question.

147
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,700
Okay.

148
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,533
What do I think of Paul Joseph Watson 
position that populism is the new punk 

149
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,120
slash counterculture?
Oh,

150
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:49,954
that's a good question.
I actually happened to watch that video 

151
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,030
a couple of days ago.
That's a good question.

152
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,350
I mean,
you see that,

153
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
you see,
I would say some indication of that on 

154
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,254
Youtube,
although it's not easy to get an 

155
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:03,744
unbiased sample of what's going on on 
Youtube because of course youtube tends 

156
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:08,784
to present you with things that are akin
to the things that you're already 

157
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:12,714
watching.
It does appear to me that the 

158
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,133
conservative commentators on youtube are
playing somewhat of the same role that 

159
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,920
the counter culture played,
let's call it more traditionally.

160
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,350
Even though that's a funny thing to say 
about the counterculture.

161
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,010
What I'm wondering more is whether or 
not,

162
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,830
not so much whether it's a 
counterculture,

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,673
but if it's something that's more 
specifically associated with a place 

164
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,034
that men,
young men are finding their new 

165
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,400
political voice online.

166
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,913
Uh,
part of the reason that I'm wondering 

167
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,384
about that,
although there are a number of female 

168
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:51,180
conservative commentators who also 
become popular online is because many of

169
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,014
the commentators appear to be man and 
many of the people who are following 

170
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,600
them also appear to be men.
And so,

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,680
and it's not obvious to me that men,
it's easy now for men,

172
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,630
especially young men to have a political
voice on campus for example,

173
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,040
or perhaps even in public.
Um,

174
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,910
and so maybe they're turning to youtube 
to,

175
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,450
to find these viewpoints that aren't 
being district disseminated is widely in

176
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:21,540
the,
in the popular media.

177
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,183
So

178
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,270
was there ever a time when you saw a 
therapist of some kind?

179
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,260
Well,
no,

180
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,410
actually I haven't ever seen a therapist
and,

181
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,080
and uh,
that might seem strange.

182
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:38,270
I suppose given that I am a 
psychologist,

183
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:39,663
um,
I don't really like talking about my 

184
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,950
problems with other people.
As it turns out,

185
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:46,100
I'd rather keep them to myself and,
um,

186
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,030
but,
but I would say having said that is that

187
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,163
I've read an awful lot of the writings 
of the great clinical psychologists and 

188
00:10:55,251 --> 00:11:00,251
psychiatrists and I would say that I've 
used them as psychotherapeutic aids.

189
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,820
And I think that that plays,
uh,

190
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,020
uh,
a very similar role that can play a very

191
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:08,030
similar role.
So,

192
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,090
okay.
We just had to update the link.

193
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,123
Um,
so,

194
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,960
okay.
So let's try another question here from,

195
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,853
from the prepared questions.
I tried to rank order these by the 

196
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:44,750
number of people that

197
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,773
mmm.

198
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,020
Indicated an interest in them.

199
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,583
So

200
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,383
you emphasize the spoken truth and 
negotiation as the alternative to war 

201
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,323
and site Solzhenitsyn as a brilliant 
documenter of the potential or 

202
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,403
inevitable fallout of deceit.
But in soldiers nip since diagnosis of 

203
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:30,300
the factors leading to the Gulag 
archipelago,

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,673
he also included the failure of people 
to take a violent stand to disrupt 

205
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,480
tyranny.
And here's a quote

206
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,760
and how will we burned in the camps 
later thinking,

207
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,523
what would things would be like if every
security operative when he went out at 

208
00:12:46,561 --> 00:12:47,394
night to make an arrest?
Had been uncertain whether he would 

209
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:50,094
return alive and had to say goodbye to 
his family or if during periods of mass 

210
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,370
arrests,
as for example,

211
00:12:56,371 --> 00:12:59,910
in Leningrad when they arrested a 
quarter of the entire city,

212
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,613
people had not simply sat there in their
layers paling with terror at every bang 

213
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,440
of the downstairs door and every step on
the staircase,

214
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,453
but at understood they had nothing left 
to lose and then boldly set up in the 

215
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:14,120
downstairs hall and ambush of half a 
dozen people with axes,

216
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,240
hammers,
pokers,

217
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,313
or whatever else was at hand.
The organs would very quickly have 

218
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:19,974
suffered a shortage of officers and 
transport and notwithstanding all of 

219
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,350
Stalins thirst,
the cursive machine would have ground to

220
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,184
a halt if if we didn't love freedom 
enough and even the more we had no real 

221
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,880
awareness of the situation,
we purely and simply deserved everything

222
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:37,080
that happened afterwards.

223
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,013
End of quote,
there appears to be a point where the 

224
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:42,084
price of our sovereignty and liberty 
must be paid with blood in addition to 

225
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,980
the vulnerability required by the spoken
truth.

226
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,293
Here are my questions.
Do you agree that there is such a point 

227
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,220
or to the weapons in power we possess 
today make violence in,

228
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,430
in viable course of action?
Okay,

229
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,293
well I would say first of all,
part of what soldier nicheness talking 

230
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:01,674
about actually is the right to self 
defense and you have the right to self 

231
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:05,214
defense and you have the right to use 
whatever force is necessary and 

232
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:11,040
reasonable when you're defending 
yourself and you know,

233
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,920
in under the American constitution for 
example,

234
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,040
it's predicated on the idea,
at least in part,

235
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,353
that you have not only the right,
but perhaps the moral obligation to 

236
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:25,410
resist tyranny.
And so obviously,

237
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,090
so that that's a difference.

238
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:27,953
That's very different from using 
violence for specifically political 

239
00:14:30,991 --> 00:14:32,820
ends.
It's art.

240
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:36,330
Do you have the right to defend yourself
against incursions into your own home or

241
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:39,960
into your own family?
And I think the answer to that is you do

242
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,430
part of the reason that it has 
manifested itself,

243
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:47,160
so that being dangerous is the 
appropriate response.

244
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,593
Now then you might say,
well how do you know how to calibrate 

245
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:54,020
your,
your defensive response?

246
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:54,801
And I would say,
well,

247
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:57,800
we have some legal guidelines for that.
Uh,

248
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,820
that would be the guidelines governing,
governing self defense in general.

249
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I guess maybe it's time for a more 
aggressive response when you're prepared

250
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:10,550
to pay the price for that or aggressive 
response.

251
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,403
Do you have to think it through?
But you certainly have the right to 

252
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,324
protect yourself and your family and,
and your property from inappropriate 

253
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:22,040
incursion by other individuals or by the
state.

254
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,030
Uh,
and without knowing the specifics of any

255
00:15:26,031 --> 00:15:28,790
given circumstance that might call for 
such a response.

256
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,030
It's difficult to be any more straight 
forward about that.

257
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,864
But I don't,
I'm certainly wouldn't regard myself 

258
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,210
precisely as a pacifist.
I don't,

259
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,580
I,
because I believe that there are,

260
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,760
there are,
it's reasonable to meet

261
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,173
well,
how would I say you have the right to 

262
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:53,550
self defense.
That's as clearly as I can formulate it.

263
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,240
Can I ask your thoughts on Brexit?
Uh,

264
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,153
that's a,
that's a question coming from the live 

265
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:58,921
chat.
Yes.

266
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,570
You can have my thoughts on brexit.
Tom.

267
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,480
The other day I was doing a lecture on 
the,

268
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,260
on the stories in genesis and one of the
stories that I analyze briefly,

269
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:11,580
and this will be posted very soon,
is the story of the Tower of Babel.

270
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,100
And I've been very curious about that 
story.

271
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,760
It comes after Noah's flood myth in 
genesis and

272
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,503
it's very interesting story in what 
happens is that human beings get 

273
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,214
together and they decide to build a 
massive building and the human beings 

274
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,154
that are building that building all 
speak in one voice and they have this 

275
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,683
grand vision,
which you might regard as a utopian 

276
00:16:37,551 --> 00:16:39,380
vision,
which is what I think it is,

277
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,543
that they can build a building so high 
that within it everyone will speak the 

278
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,820
same language and it will reach all the 
way to have it.

279
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,800
And so you could see it in some sense as
an attempt to usurp the transcendent.

280
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,110
Um,
I kind of read it as an EA,

281
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,960
an early precursor of the story that 
Milton told him,

282
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:58,580
paradise lost,
where Satan,

283
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,250
who's God's highest avidly angel and 
perhaps,

284
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,383
and who's Lucifer?
That the brightest light in the psychic 

285
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:07,990
hierarchy you might say.
And,

286
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:12,530
and the spirit of untrammeled 
rationality decides that he can wage war

287
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,364
in heaven and overcome God,
overcome the ultimate in the 

288
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:17,330
transcendent value.

289
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,163
When I read that as a cautionary tale 
about the pride that goes along with 

290
00:17:22,851 --> 00:17:23,684
intellectual presupposition in the same 
pride that produced the totalitarian 

291
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:27,284
states of the 20th century,
what happens with the Tower of Babel is 

292
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:30,794
that human beings start to build this a 
unitary homogenous structure who's 

293
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:37,364
pentacle will reach into God's heaven.
He domain perhaps thereby taking the 

294
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:42,944
place of the transcendent God gets wind 
of that and goes to earth and takes the 

295
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,790
people or,
or transforms the people who are,

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,410
who are building the building and who in
principle it would house into a polyglot

297
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,273
of people speaking different languages 
and then scatters them all over the 

298
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,420
world.
Well,

299
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,254
what I think that means is that if you 
try to build a homogenous totalitarian 

300
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,570
structure that you searched the 
transcendent,

301
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,660
it will begin to badly fragment from 
within.

302
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,540
And I think it's a warning against 
gigantism.

303
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,380
And I think one of the things that's 
happening in Europe is that we're seeing

304
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,410
the folly of the idea of too big to 
fail.

305
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,603
What we're seeing instead is the 
manifestation of so big it will 

306
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,104
certainly fail and I think the reason 
for that is that there has to be a 

307
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:32,604
certain degree of homogeneity within 
anything that can be categorized as an 

308
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:36,834
organization.
If the degree of heterogeneity within 

309
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:44,721
the organization becomes too extreme and
if the organization becomes too large,

310
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:48,030
then it's very difficult for people to 
feel any affinity with it.

311
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,223
They're going to fragment back into 
their subsidiary identity groups and 

312
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,360
those might be national groups for 
example,

313
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,194
which seems to be what happened,
what's happening in Europe and then the 

314
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:58,164
whole thing is going to fall apart.
And I have some sympathy for that 

315
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:01,374
because I think that it's necessary for 
human beings at an individual level to 

316
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:08,700
feel some sort of affinity for the power
structures that they find themselves in.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,833
And maybe being one 300 Mil,
one 300000000th of an entity is to be 

318
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:19,410
too much of a non entity to feel any 
real affinity for that structure.

319
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,280
So that's part of what I think's 
happening with regards to brexit.

320
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,010
So,
okay,

321
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,860
so let's see what happens here.
A little another.

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,780
Let's take another live question here

323
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,860
is remove the toxic people in your life.
Wholly.

324
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,630
Good advice.
Well,

325
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,523
no,
I wouldn't say it's wholly good advice 

326
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:46,090
because no single piece of advice could 
be considered as holy good,

327
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,073
except perhaps for tell the truth.
I think that one might be outside that 

328
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,980
that rule of thumb,
it depends very much on what you mean by

329
00:19:56,411 --> 00:20:01,390
toxic and also who's doing the judgment 
with regards to toxicity.

330
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,793
My sense is that you should surround 
yourself with people who genuinely want 

331
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:12,610
the best for you or perhaps more 
specifically,

332
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,240
genuinely want the best for the best 
part of you.

333
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,853
And if you're,
if the people around you are not 

334
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:20,824
supporting you in your endeavors and 
they put you down and they punish you 

335
00:20:23,321 --> 00:20:24,154
for your virtues or even punish you too 
intensely for your faults and failed to 

336
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:28,894
reward you when you're doing what you 
should be doing and fail to engage in 

337
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,800
reciprocal interactions,
that there comes a point where you would

338
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,890
be better off finding someone who is 
actually on your side.

339
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,440
And that can even be the case with 
family members.

340
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,990
Although of course that's a very 
difficult decision to make.

341
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,183
But sometimes people do have the 
misfortune of being up with family 

342
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:48,844
members who are so who are operating in 
a manner that's so counterproductive to 

343
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:53,494
their health that it's better for them 
despite the pain to cease communication 

344
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,640
with them.
And,

345
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,523
and sometimes paradoxically enough that 
can also facilitate communication 

346
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,174
because sometimes you have to draw a 
line in the sand before people are 

347
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:07,024
willing to undergo the serious self 
consideration that print would proceed 

348
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,140
any real transformation.
So,

349
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,393
but I would say even if even if you 
don't like the idea of removing the 

350
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,644
toxic people in your life,
you should certainly endeavor to 

351
00:21:23,261 --> 00:21:24,094
surround yourself with the sorts of 
people that you would want to surround 

352
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,800
someone that you regarded as your friend
or loved one.

353
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,113
So you need to,
you need to extend the same courtesy to 

354
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:35,944
yourself,
especially to the part of yourself that 

355
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,850
striving upward that you would to 
someone that you cared for.

356
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,163
So,

357
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,283
okay,
what do I think of the phrase diversity 

358
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:54,980
is our strength?
Well,

359
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:55,814
I think it's a slogan and the word 
slogan is derived from the Welsh two 

360
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:02,600
words slew ag,
s,

361
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:03,340
l,
U,

362
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:03,501
H,
g,

363
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:04,910
H and Gerome,
g,

364
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:05,571
H,
a,

365
00:22:05,571 --> 00:22:06,141
I,
r,

366
00:22:06,141 --> 00:22:06,974
m,
and slew a Garam is the battle cry of 

367
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:10,184
the dead.
So the problem with that sort of slogan 

368
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:14,024
is that it replaces independent thought 
and it's certainly possible that quote 

369
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:20,360
diversity is a strength,
an end quote.

370
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,180
But the question is,
what the hell do you mean by diversity?

371
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,040
And if the idea is that diverse modes of
approaching situations,

372
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:28,874
nestle necessarily emerge because you've
gathered people together who were of 

373
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,433
some,
who are different in their whatever 

374
00:22:36,081 --> 00:22:39,530
group identity marker happens to be the 
privileged one at the moment,

375
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,364
to use the postmodernists language.
There's no indication whatsoever that 

376
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:47,390
that's going to produce diversity of,
of strategic plan for example.

377
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,853
So it's,
it's an empty phrase and it's a 

378
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:55,220
dangerous phrase because diversity can 
be a weakness.

379
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:56,890
It's just as much as it can be,
uh,

380
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,790
can be a strength.
So,

381
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,400
you know,
I think it's all right.

382
00:23:01,401 --> 00:23:03,830
It's a slogan and I don't like slogans 
very much.

383
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,903
So

384
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,520
do you have any practical advice?

385
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,063
Okay.

386
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,630
It's still on.
It's just the cameras.

387
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,120
The camera turned off for some reason.
Do you have any practical advice?

388
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:27,350
It's still an audio.
Yeah.

389
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,193
Well we,
I have all this new technology here 

390
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,420
guys.
And sorry about that.

391
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:32,640
It's still,
we're still working out the bugs.

392
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:36,130
I bought new cameras and new lighting 
and all of that and um,

393
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,930
it does strange things that we don't 
understand yet.

394
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,840
And so it looks like I'm back on.

395
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,703
So do you have any practical advice on 
how I can improve my ability to 

396
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,000
concentrate and pay attention to the 
world around me?

397
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,130
Um,
well,

398
00:23:55,131 --> 00:24:00,131
I have some practical advice without the
first piece of practical advice.

399
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,890
Often the devil's in the details,
you know,

400
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,370
but often some practical advice as well.
Regulate your,

401
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,360
regulate your habits.
Um,

402
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,760
try to get up at approximately the same 
time each morning.

403
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,760
I would recommend that you get up 
approximately when other people get up.

404
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:22,610
So that would be something in the 
neighborhood of seven 30 or eight in the

405
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:25,190
morning or perhaps earlier,
perhaps a little bit later.

406
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:28,070
But you want to stabilize that because 
your,

407
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,900
your circadian rhythms operate more,
uh,

408
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,373
what would you call it to fluidly and 
your mood is likely to be regulated 

409
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:41,840
better if there's islands of stability 
in your daily routines.

410
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,480
Human beings like daily routines,
just like dogs,

411
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:47,690
like daily routines and so regulate your
sleep.

412
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,143
Um,
I would say when you get up in the 

413
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,230
morning,
eat breakfast,

414
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,093
that's a really important thing to do.
I can't tell you how many people I've 

415
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:59,840
treated in my clinical practice who's 
proclivity for emotional instability and

416
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:01,220
depression,
anxiety,

417
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,530
general hopelessness,
um,

418
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:08,531
emotional pain and gloom and doom as 
well as capacity to concentrate.

419
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,123
We're property regulated or inhibited or
produced by merely ensuring that they 

420
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,514
ate a,
I would say a protein and fat rich 

421
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:21,290
breakfast relatively soon after they 
wake up.

422
00:25:21,291 --> 00:25:23,030
And that's especially too if they're 
stressed.

423
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:27,410
And as it turns out that if you stress 
yourself after a fast,

424
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:29,360
which is of course what you've 
undertaken,

425
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,330
if you haven't eaten since the night 
before,

426
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,230
that your body produces enough insulin 
to deplete your,

427
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,530
your,
your to deplete the sugar in your blood.

428
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,783
And then it's very difficult for you to 
become regulated properly with regards 

429
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:46,910
to your metabolism,
metabolism until you sleep again.

430
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,860
And so it can be regulating your sleep 
and your breakfast.

431
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:52,694
Eating habits in particular can be a 
very effective way of regulating your 

432
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:57,710
mood and increasing your capacity to 
concentrate.

433
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,443
The other thing I would say is that 
spending some time scheduling your time 

434
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,300
is also extraordinarily useful.
And so I can tell you a little bit about

435
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,260
about how to use schedule as 
effectively.

436
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,513
So the first thing I would do is,
the first thing I would say is that you 

437
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,554
should,
um,

438
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,030
you should,
you should develop a longterm plan.

439
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,330
You can use something like the future 
authoring program,

440
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,164
which most of you are familiar with 
because of course you would have got a 

441
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:26,834
key to it.
Almost everyone as a consequence of 

442
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,194
being a patron is you have to,
you have to set up your vision like 

443
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,770
Japan,
no,

444
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,400
when he's looking at the Star before 
Pinocchio's transformation takes place,

445
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:38,234
you have to set up your longterm vision 
to have some vision of the good towards 

446
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:42,884
which you're working and some vision 
perhaps of the hell that you're 

447
00:26:45,901 --> 00:26:46,734
avoiding.

448
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,813
And then I would say once you set up 
that vision so that you know how to 

449
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,874
Orient Yourself,
then you should start designing your 

450
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:53,814
days.
And you can do that very effectively 

451
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,710
with a calendar like Google calendar.
And instead of many people say,

452
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,100
well I hate using a schedule and,
or I hate using a calendar.

453
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,593
And what I would say about that is,
is that if you hate using a schedule or 

454
00:27:06,781 --> 00:27:08,850
a calendar,
then you're probably using it wrong.

455
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:14,330
What you're doing is using the calendar 
as an external tyrant that's telling you

456
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:16,704
what you should do if you were going to 
be a conventionally good person each 

457
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,070
day.
So you load yourself up with,

458
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,850
with arbitrary,
we'll say arbitrary responsibilities,

459
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,370
but that's not really how you should use
a schedule.

460
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,923
What you should use a schedule to do is 
to design the day that you would most 

461
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:36,294
like to have.
And obviously that's going to include 

462
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,223
accepting some responsibility and 
undertaking to make progress on those 

463
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,690
things that you have to make progress 
on,

464
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,940
to keep your life from collapsing into 
chaos.

465
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,073
But it should also mean that you 
schedule in activities that make you 

466
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,154
actually want to have that day.
And so if you're using a schedule 

467
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,114
properly that it can be your friend and 
that can also be something that can 

468
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:03,810
increase your capacity to concentrate.
And then I would say,

469
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,100
well,
if you're,

470
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,750
if you're very scattered,

471
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,910
then you can start to train yourself.
You might say,

472
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:11,744
well,
um,

473
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,300
I need to learn to read without 
distraction.

474
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,850
So maybe what you do,
you say,

475
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:19,010
okay,
well for the next week I'm going to read

476
00:28:19,011 --> 00:28:22,640
10 minutes a day and I'm going to try to
limit the distractions.

477
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,180
And if you're successful at that,
then you could try 12 minutes a day.

478
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:29,150
And if you're successful at that,
you could try 15 minutes a day.

479
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,433
And the trick is to set a goal for 
yourself that is slightly beyond your 

480
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:34,964
current level of performance,
enough to be challenging enough to be 

481
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:41,960
worthwhile if you accomplished but not 
so difficult that you're likely to fail.

482
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,213
And then practice incrementally day by 
day trying to inculcate the habits that 

483
00:28:46,611 --> 00:28:47,444
you want to inculcate and assume that 
it'll take you a number of months or 

484
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:53,780
even a number of years in order to 
become very fluent at the habit.

485
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,133
The important thing is to start 
improving incrementally because 

486
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,230
incremental improvement pays off like a 
compound interest.

487
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,543
And so I would also say that the 
trajectory that you're on is more 

488
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:07,574
important than your starting point.
And that's also an extraordinarily 

489
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,664
optimistic observation because it means 
that direction is more important than 

490
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,990
current position and enemy current 
position matters obviously,

491
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:18,824
but it,
I don't think it does matter as much as 

492
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:21,074
direction.
So if you want to learn to concentrate 

493
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:26,690
more,
define what constitutes concentration,

494
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,733
break it into micro habits and then 
start practicing instantiation of those 

495
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:33,380
micro habits.
So

496
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,750
very good advice here.
Robbie Kelly says,

497
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,070
how do you eat an elephant?
You bite one chunk at a time.

498
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,730
Well that's exactly right.
And that's also the hallmark of behavior

499
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,020
therapy,
the issue.

500
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,830
So what a behavior therapist does and,
and I'm an admirer of behavior therapy,

501
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:55,831
although there's other psychotherapeutic
approaches that I also appreciate too to

502
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,094
a great degree for,
for more that are in some sense more 

503
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,330
conceptually sophisticated.
But one of the things you do if you're a

504
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,173
behavior therapist is take the problem 
at hand and decompose it into its micro 

505
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:11,470
elements and then practice 
implementation of the micro elements.

506
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:15,070
And that can be the integration of new 
habits is already mentioned,

507
00:30:15,071 --> 00:30:18,850
but that's also a great way of learning 
to face the things that you're avoiding.

508
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,180
Learning to confront the things you're 
avoiding that frightened you were,

509
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,570
it stopped you in your trucks.
So you know,

510
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:26,404
if you,
if you're scared of going to parties or 

511
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,564
maybe scared of going out in public,
you can also always go to the nearest 

512
00:30:30,971 --> 00:30:34,570
bar for 10 minutes and sit there and,
and have a drink and then leave,

513
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,433
you know,
and then maybe expand that up to 12 

514
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,804
minutes and then maybe dare at one of 
the dare at one point when you grow up 

515
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:42,850
to say hi to someone.

516
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,253
But again,
don't ever underestimate the utility of 

517
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,660
incremental improvement.
You can get a tremendous distance by,

518
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,640
by engaging in incremental improvement.
So,

519
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,950
okay,
so let's see here.

520
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,740
Why did I know how to upload my talk at 
Western?

521
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,200
University of that will be being 
uploaded.

522
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,063
There's a couple of talks I did that 
just aren't the people that were 

523
00:31:13,381 --> 00:31:15,360
preparing them just haven't got back to 
me yet.

524
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,310
I have a podcast that went quite nicely 
with a German interviewer that I'm going

525
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,170
to upload this weekend.
I thought it was,

526
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,180
I thought it was good.
So,

527
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,703
but the,
the western university talk will be 

528
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:29,460
uploaded.
I also did a talk in Calgary recently,

529
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,640
which I talked about something new.
I talked about equity,

530
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,503
which,
which I believe is absolutely 

531
00:31:34,381 --> 00:31:36,060
catastrophic,
uh,

532
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,400
goal.
Let's say that's equality of outcome.

533
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,503
I think the reason that it's 
catastrophic is because you can't have 

534
00:31:42,931 --> 00:31:43,764
equality of outcome because you can 
fractionate the group differences 

535
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:49,320
between people and an infinite number of
ways.

536
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,160
So even if you did manage to produce 
equality of outcome by you know,

537
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:56,700
the two top contenders for,
for prime group identity right now,

538
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:59,550
which are race and gender being pushed 
very hard by the left,

539
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,850
which I would say is something that's 
very racist and very sexist.

540
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,493
Um,
you might be able to reach equality of 

541
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:07,404
outcome across race and gender,
although you couldn't practically 

542
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:11,760
speaking,
but let's say hypothetically you could,

543
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,640
well then you'd still have to start to 
fragment race.

544
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,030
So what do you mean by race exactly?
Are you going to stick with the three?

545
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,063
Well you might describe them as 
canonical racial differences negroid 

546
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:23,544
caucasoid in Asian or are you going to 
start to fragment Asians into their 

547
00:32:27,091 --> 00:32:30,080
various subtypes and exactly how are you
going to do that or no,

548
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:30,914
are you going to do the same thing with 
black people or are you going to just 

549
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,330
assume that they're all the same?
And how do you know when someone's black

550
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,460
and not just dark brown,
so to speak,

551
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:39,294
or medium or light brown.
And I'd also like to point out just in 

552
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,350
case anyone hasn't noticed that people 
aren't black and white,

553
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,660
they're actually Tan and Brown.

554
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,480
And so,
and I'm saying that because there aren't

555
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:52,700
clear distinctions between the racial 
divides.

556
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:53,534
And so you have to fragment race and 
then obviously you have to fragment 

557
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,330
gender at least according to the gender 
theorists.

558
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:03,050
And then you have other problems of 
group identity.

559
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,903
Um,
do you ensure that people are equally 

560
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,030
represented across levels of 
attractiveness or height or extroversion

561
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,953
or introversion or emotional stability 
or mental health or physical health or 

562
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,730
age or?
Well,

563
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,593
as you get the picture,
I don't have to continue to repeat 

564
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:24,170
myself.
There is a,

565
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,480
there is,
there are as many,

566
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,443
there are an infinite number of 
canonical group identities and there's 

567
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,414
no way of making a,
an objective hierarchy out of them in 

568
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:36,554
terms of value.
And so you can't equate for equality of 

569
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:41,690
outcome up across all potential category
schemes.

570
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,360
And so equality of outcome is a futile 
endeavor.

571
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,020
All that it does is transfer the power 
that the free market should.

572
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,343
Um,
essentially the free market as an 

573
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:54,980
externalized computational machine 
should be calculating for us,

574
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:56,900
even though it's an imperfect 
calculation,

575
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:58,163
all it does is transfer the power of 
that collective and impersonal decision 

576
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:04,940
making into the hands of a coterie of 
people who will abs.

577
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,150
Even if the initial people who have that
power don't misuse it,

578
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,850
the people who take their place will 
certainly misuse it.

579
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,530
So anyways,
have Calgary,

580
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:15,590
I did a talk on equity and tried to 
outline some of these things.

581
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:16,424
Trying to understand exactly what is 
wrong with the idea of equality of 

582
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:20,594
outcome.
Mean the historical data obviously 

583
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:24,170
indicates that it's a catastrophic 
doctrine,

584
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,860
but I think there are technical,
psychological,

585
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:28,694
computational and complexity related 
reasons why the doctrine of equality of 

586
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:34,460
outcome is,
is uh,

587
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,340
is,
is it's an impossible goal.

588
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,850
It cannot be achieved even in principle.
So.

589
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,910
All right,

590
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,500
let's see.
The thinking skeptic says,

591
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:03,740
I love you,
Dr [inaudible].

592
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,990
Well,
thank you very much.

593
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,460
Uh,
thinking skeptic.

594
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,030
Um,
it's conceivable that I love youtube,

595
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:09,903
but I don't know because I don't know,
but we'll assume that we can start from 

596
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:13,084
that perspective anyways.
Thoughts on the use of amphetamine to 

597
00:35:15,851 --> 00:35:17,760
improve conscientiousness?
Um,

598
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,873
the longterm data on use of amphetamine 
as a treatment for attention deficit 

599
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,900
disorders suggest that there are no 
positive medium to longterm benefits.

600
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,063
So I would say that if you're going to 
take a data driven approach to that 

601
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,083
issue,
that you would draw the conclusion that 

602
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:35,070
it's not a,
a useful long term,

603
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,250
uh,
solution.

604
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,073
Um,

605
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,103
yeah,

606
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,760
I experienced tremendous abuse as a 
child and it's led to me being a doormat

607
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,633
for abuse.
I seek out people who reject me and 

608
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:52,980
reject people who seek me out.
How do I break this cycle?

609
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,540
Wow.
Well that's a really,

610
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:55,374
really hard question and the reason that
it's hard apart from the fact that your 

611
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,670
situation is very complex is that the 
devil's always in the details.

612
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,210
What I would recommend though is that if
you want to break that cycle,

613
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:11,490
the first thing you need to do is to 
figure out what it is that you want.

614
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,320
You need to understand where it is that 
you want to go in your life and you need

615
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:17,154
to understand what people would look 
like if they were the kind of people 

616
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,970
that you could surround yourself with to
facilitate that goal.

617
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:24,804
And so I would again recommend that you 
do the future authoring program so that 

618
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:28,614
you can get your goals in order and then
you need to start thinking through how 

619
00:36:32,611 --> 00:36:36,480
it is that you would like to be treated 
and what your strategies would be.

620
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,553
Even in principle if you find yourself 
not being treated that way and then you 

621
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:44,430
have to start practicing that at the 
level of micro routine.

622
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,220
So,
and I think one of the ways that you can

623
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:48,054
do that,
and this is something I often recommend 

624
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:50,214
to agreeable people,
is that he will see that there are 

625
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,444
people who treat you in a manner that 
leads to the development of your 

626
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:59,340
resentment,
feelings of resentment.

627
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,770
And now there's roughly two reasons why 
you might feel resentful and one is that

628
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:05,993
your just windy and someone is calling 
you on your misbehavior or you're 

629
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:12,300
failing because you should be failing 
and you're not.

630
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:17,220
Your character isn't well developed 
enough to merely adjust to the error and

631
00:37:17,221 --> 00:37:18,054
to fix yourself up.
And the other is that you're being 

632
00:37:20,521 --> 00:37:23,880
genuinely taken advantage of and that 
you need to put a stop to it.

633
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,343
And the only way that you can really 
figure that out is by thinking it 

634
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:30,110
through or writing it down or perhaps by
talking to someone that,

635
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,003
that you,
that that cares for you in a positive 

636
00:37:32,971 --> 00:37:33,804
way.

637
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,473
Once you've done that and once you 
realize that you're resentful because 

638
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,794
you are being interfered with,
then it's incumbent on you to say 

639
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:48,334
something so that it,
it comes to a stop and you'll have to 

640
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:53,650
practice that it and you'll be bad at it
to begin with.

641
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,263
Now,
it might be that your interact with 

642
00:37:56,261 --> 00:37:57,094
someone and you don't realize until 
hours later that you don't like the 

643
00:38:00,101 --> 00:38:01,990
interaction that you had something to 
say.

644
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,093
You might have to sit at home and then 
figure out what it is that you should 

645
00:38:05,531 --> 00:38:06,364
say should have said and then go back 
and tell the person you're going to be 

646
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,810
awkward and bad at it.
But it's a good start.

647
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,530
And maybe you need to write out why it 
is that you shouldn't be allowing people

648
00:38:14,531 --> 00:38:15,364
to mistreat you so that you replace your
habitual proclivity that was may be 

649
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,763
instilled in you when you were a child 
with a thought through and mature 

650
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:25,630
philosophy of interpersonal 
relationship.

651
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,060
That's it.
That's a reasonable start.

652
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,880
So is it safe to go into psychology in 
university?

653
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,120
Definitely not.
It's not safe to study psychology.

654
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,790
Uh,
but that's not really the issue.

655
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:40,624
I think what you mean has is has 
psychology been so corrupted by let's 

656
00:38:44,441 --> 00:38:45,274
say,
political correctness so that it's no 

657
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,020
longer a reasonable pathway.
It's no,

658
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:49,903
no longer a reasonable discipline.
And I would say I don't think it's 

659
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:53,854
corrupted to that degree.
And I would also say that one of the 

660
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,260
things you need to understand if you are
going to university,

661
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:04,261
that is that fundamentally university is
a place where you educate yourself.

662
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,493
Now you can seek out people who have 
knowledge and confer with them about 

663
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:10,144
your own education,
but the primary responsibility has to 

664
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:13,024
fall to you,
the libraries and [inaudible] full of 

665
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:15,814
great books.
And you can find out what the great 

666
00:39:17,531 --> 00:39:18,364
books are in a relative,
in a relatively short order manner by 

667
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,080
just by even just looking online.

668
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,633
And you can do a tremendous amount of 
reading and a tremendous amount of 

669
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,544
writing on your own.
And you can do that very effectively if 

670
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:34,921
you also treat your university 
experience with the same degree of,

671
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,040
uh,
well,

672
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,010
what would you call diligence that you 
might,

673
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,680
that you might put towards a full time 
job.

674
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,473
So you want to find the professors that 
have something to say and select them 

675
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,243
and you want to do the readings of the 
great books and you want to learn to 

676
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:51,700
write.
And if you do that,

677
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:52,534
then you'll receive an education.
And you can do that pretty much at any 

678
00:39:54,641 --> 00:39:59,350
university I would say.
So what music do I like?

679
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,860
I like a lot of different music.
I like a lot of different genres.

680
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,100
I listen to rock.
I'm a dinosaur.

681
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:10,220
So I listened to classic rock all often 
from the 70s I'm,

682
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,103
you know,
I was wired up and imprinted on that 

683
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:12,850
stuff.

684
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,850
But I listened to rock music from the 
fifties through today.

685
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:21,190
I really liked the band arcade fire for 
example,

686
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,810
a beach houses,
a new band.

687
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:23,644
I kind of liked them.
There's a band called Devotchka that I 

688
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:27,490
think,
I think they're out of Seattle.

689
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,500
I think they're really good.
I love Tom Waits.

690
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,663
I like old country music,
the Western stuff from the forties 

691
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,710
thirties forties and 50s.
I listened to jazz.

692
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,410
I like blues.
I listen to classical music.

693
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,360
Um,
so,

694
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,640
uh,
I think I mentioned Tom White's already,

695
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:47,641
who I think is an absolute genius,
so I don't remember who said it once,

696
00:40:47,861 --> 00:40:49,960
but someone said there was only two 
kinds of music,

697
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:53,080
good music and bad music.
And I really believe that's true.

698
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:53,914
And so I,
I've found what I regard as great music 

699
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,080
in all sorts of genres.
Um,

700
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,680
I wouldn't say I'm a hip hop officio,
but there's some of it that I've learned

701
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:03,460
to like,
uh,

702
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,230
I really like m and m's rap.
God,

703
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,750
I think that's an absolutely remarkable 
song.

704
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:08,584
He's unbelievably skilled in this 
ability to annunciate and I think 

705
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:15,100
there's high quality music being 
produced across a wide range of genres.

706
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,290
I don't like pop,
generally speaking.

707
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,410
Um,
it all sounds like bad.

708
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:24,190
1970s disco to me and I didn't like bad,
1970s disco,

709
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:28,960
so,
so that's what I liked for music.

710
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,280
Um,
let's see,

711
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:31,420
what else have we got here?

712
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:34,060
What

713
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,893
do I think of the comments?
The role favorable to me on that recent 

714
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:39,520
Hamilton article.
Hamilton's a city,

715
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,580
the city where mcmaster university is 
being disappeared.

716
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,410
Um,
I don't know what to think of that.

717
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,730
You know,
my,

718
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,980
my,
my gut instinct,

719
00:41:47,981 --> 00:41:50,590
and I would use this as a good rule of 
thumb,

720
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:55,591
is to assume ignorance or error or 
stupidity before you assume malevolence.

721
00:41:57,011 --> 00:42:00,490
And so you have to go through those 
alternative explanations first.

722
00:42:00,491 --> 00:42:01,324
I mean,
I don't know why the comments were 

723
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,840
shutdown.
Um,

724
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,550
I,
it would be easy to assume the worst,

725
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,730
but there's no reason to do that.
You don't want to jump to the assumption

726
00:42:09,731 --> 00:42:10,564
of the worst to begin with.
So I thought it was curious and so I 

727
00:42:13,751 --> 00:42:16,750
tweeted it and I do think it's curious 
and I do think that the,

728
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,943
the,
the threat of invisible Internet 

729
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:21,664
censorship is a real one because w we 
are conversing increasingly in this 

730
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,213
public artificial intelligence,
giant invisible corporation mediated 

731
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:32,740
way.

732
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,590
And we don't know what the rules are and
we don't know who can make them.

733
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,513
And I think that that's something we're 
really going to have to watch out for 

734
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,103
you.
I think you can see that happening with 

735
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:44,710
facebook and twitter and perhaps with 
youtube,

736
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,570
although I think youtube still pretty 
clean,

737
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,433
although you know,
I've seen people complaining that 

738
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,720
they're losing subscribers and that and 
that their content is being restricted.

739
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:55,803
You know,
the thing is the company is going gonna 

740
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,274
make some mistakes there.
They're trying to do multiple things at 

741
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:01,990
the same time.
And so like I said,

742
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:04,240
I would assume,
um,

743
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:05,223
error and ignorance and stupidity and 
then malevolence in that order and you 

744
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:09,694
know,
give,

745
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,150
give people who are trying to mediate 
these new technologies a bit of a break,

746
00:43:13,151 --> 00:43:13,984
but that's still,
you should be awake because there is 

747
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:17,883
always the potential for new and 
unforeseen threats to emerge to freedom 

748
00:43:21,491 --> 00:43:23,410
of speech when it's electronically 
mediated.

749
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,783
So
how will rescuing my father from the 

750
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:38,601
belly of the whale helped me with 
regards to leftist ideology?

751
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,720
Well I hope it would help you with 
regards to ideologies in general.

752
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,420
I mean,
it's a serious,

753
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:50,040
that's a very,
very serious question

754
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,013
to believe that rescuing your father 
from the belly of the whale would 

755
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,113
inoculate you against ideology is to 
accept it particular interpretation of 

756
00:44:03,051 --> 00:44:04,520
what that story means.
Now,

757
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:07,280
my interpretation of that story is that 
the whale,

758
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,850
the whale dragon is a symbol of the 
predatory unknown.

759
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,430
So it's a symbol of the dangers that 
lurk in the unknown.

760
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,713
And the idea that the father,
the dying father or the or the ghost 

761
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:22,623
father or the deceased father is lying.
Somehow inert in that landscape means 

762
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:29,204
that encountering chaos can help you 
understand more clearly what the value 

763
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:34,944
was in traditional order.
But it's not only traditional order 

764
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,620
that,
that,

765
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,060
that,
that that is the domain say of the,

766
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,103
of the resurrecting farther.
It's partly the farther represents 

767
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:51,900
partly the spirit of the social order 
and partly the,

768
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,590
the,
the implicit logos that's characteristic

769
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:59,070
of the individual that acts to create 
society across time.

770
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:04,020
Um,
if you identify with tradition as,

771
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,973
as,
as the foundation of being and you 

772
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:12,330
understand what identifying with the 
spirit that creates tradition means,

773
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,420
then that gives you a means of orienting
yourself.

774
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:19,200
That's far preferable to any pure 
ideology,

775
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:23,340
whether it's hiding in the nationals 
structures that the right promotes,

776
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,920
um,
which tend towards rigidity,

777
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,250
rigidity,
and hyper order or drowning in the chaos

778
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:30,084
that the left producers in their 
attempts both to demolish order sort of 

779
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:37,100
on the negative end and,
uh,

780
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:41,550
transmuted say on the positive end.
It's better to,

781
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:45,750
I think it's better to act your life out
as an individual,

782
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,280
to incorporate the traditions that your 
society has have brought forward to you,

783
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,680
into your life.
So to,

784
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,000
to do what other people do and to do it 
well,

785
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,650
to,
to grow up,

786
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,753
to move out of your house,
to adopt the responsibilities of a 

787
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,860
family,
to learn how to be honest,

788
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,723
to take on the heavy load of helping to 
reduce unnecessary suffering in the 

789
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:09,540
world and to try to make something 
productive and useful of yourself.

790
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:12,480
And that's a lot more interesting and 
meaningful than trying to,

791
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:13,783
um,
manifest yourself as the incarnation of 

792
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:19,740
a pathological ideology.

793
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:46,203
Oh,
okay.

794
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,210
What the hell is it doing?
Dying?

795
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,630
No,
I turned it back on.

796
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,833
You don't game,

797
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:07,570
you stopped recording too,

798
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,280
so,
so I'm,

799
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm,
I looks like I'm back.

800
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:33,140
There's a lag on the q and a,
so it's,

801
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:33,974
it's somewhat difficult to d Sherman.
So the Shaman to what did the Sherman 

802
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:39,760
and D Sherman?
Yeah.

803
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,650
Hi.
I'm

804
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:53,203
okay.
Somebody says that this is the fault of 

805
00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:00,080
postmodernist.
It's probably is,

806
00:48:00,081 --> 00:48:01,200
it probably is.
I,

807
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,073
that would be my guest.
They're probably putting like some kind 

808
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:07,010
of electronic bug in my camera.
I don't know why it's shutting off.

809
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:09,730
I'll sort that out later.
So Julian,

810
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,620
we need you,
I guess you heard that a,

811
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,420
yeah.
Yeah.

812
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,470
Well,
okay.

813
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,680
So,
oh,

814
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:25,600
I agree.
How,

815
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,240
don't yell at Julian.
I get you now.

816
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:28,240
I can't,
I have to yell at him.

817
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:29,690
He's my son.
I can yell at him.

818
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,050
He's my technical support actually.
He's really good at it then.

819
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:34,660
I hardly ever yell at them to rough life
for me though.

820
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,770
Okay.
Let's say here,

821
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:49,950
take another question from,
from,

822
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,650
so someone says,
what's up with the socks?

823
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:54,180
Yeah,
well I have,

824
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,163
I guess I need to dim.
I guess I need to indicate to the rest 

825
00:48:58,171 --> 00:48:59,004
of you just exactly what that means.
You see these are the socks that we're 

826
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:02,960
talking about here.
Um,

827
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,340
my wife bought me some fancy socks.
My,

828
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,383
my wife bought me some fancy socks for 
Christmas and so I guess she thought my 

829
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:12,144
style needed upgrading.
I guess it was partly because I got 

830
00:49:14,461 --> 00:49:19,140
completely reward robe to here.
I guess that might be a word in the last

831
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:19,973
few months I lost,
I've lost a tremendous amount of weight 

832
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:24,510
in the last year about 40 pounds.
And you know,

833
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:26,820
some of that might be due to social 
justice warriors.

834
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:29,880
So although it's really not,
it's because I've transformed my diet.

835
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:30,714
I seem to have a variety of dietary 
sensitivities that seem to be 

836
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,570
contributing to,
uh,

837
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:37,763
to,
I've had a history of depression and 

838
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:42,180
that looks like it might be associated 
with diet.

839
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,800
And my daughter who's been very ill with
a variety of health problems,

840
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:49,440
including extraordinarily serious 
arthritis.

841
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,940
She lost her ankle and her hip to 
arthritis when she was 17.

842
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:58,470
She's figured out that a lot of her 
autoimmune problems were associated with

843
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:00,040
severe dietary,
uh,

844
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,410
sensitivity.
And we share some symptom overlap.

845
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:05,970
So I've had some autoimmune illness 
problems.

846
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:09,480
And so she went on a very restrictive 
diet,

847
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,450
which was basically only chicken and 
vegetables and it,

848
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,800
it stopped the vast majority of her 
symptoms,

849
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:20,880
including extreme fatigue and depression
and the arthritis itself.

850
00:50:20,881 --> 00:50:25,290
And it had quite a market impact on her 
to the point where she could stop taking

851
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:27,560
antidepressants.
And so about a year and half ago,

852
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:29,620
she convinced me to,
um,

853
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:34,550
try the diet for a month.
And that meant well,

854
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:35,443
it meant eating nothing but meat and 
vegetables and that would beef chicken 

855
00:50:38,691 --> 00:50:39,710
and vegetables.
That's it.

856
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:41,330
No carbohydrates,
no nuts,

857
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,010
no nightshades,
no beans,

858
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,800
no dairy,
no chocolate,

859
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,480
no fruit,
no sugar.

860
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,343
Like unbelievably restrictive.
It's been a real pain because it's 

861
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:53,300
really compromised my social life 
because they're like,

862
00:50:53,301 --> 00:50:56,360
who's going to invite you out?
Because so many people,

863
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,470
you know,
are,

864
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,080
um,
so much of what people do socially,

865
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:02,720
it revolves around eating.
And if you're really a royal pain in the

866
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:06,470
neck with when it comes to your dietary 
proclivities,

867
00:51:06,471 --> 00:51:09,530
then people are just not going to be 
very happy about you.

868
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,353
Anyways.
I tried the Diet for a month and I lost 

869
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:14,760
about seven pounds,
which I've,

870
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,340
and I quit snoring,
which,

871
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,860
which had been plaguing me to some 
degree.

872
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,630
And so I thought that was pretty 
interesting.

873
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:21,890
And,
um,

874
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,840
so I just stayed on it.
Then I lost,

875
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:26,990
I kept losing them about that much 
weight per month.

876
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:30,350
So I went down from about 212 pounds to 
my current weight,

877
00:51:30,351 --> 00:51:31,184
which is about one 70,
which is about where it was when I was 

878
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:37,010
in graduate school.
And so anyways,

879
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,080
this is a long answer to this question.

880
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,643
MMM.

881
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,480
Because of that,
all my clothing became tent like,

882
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,493
and I had to throw all of it away.
And so I got some new clothes in more 

883
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:53,550
recently and including some very 
colorful socks.

884
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:56,140
So I guess that's my,
uh,

885
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,670
what would you say?
I don't know what else to say about it,

886
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:00,504
that,
that I have these colorful socks and 

887
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:04,740
they're,
they're kind of interesting and stylish.

888
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:09,290
And so that's what's with the socks.
So it's a complicated answer.

889
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,470
Hey.
So,

890
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,153
mmm.

891
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,750
Can you please take some questions 
submitted via patron advance?

892
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,890
I did do that.
I did take questions.

893
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:27,770
I guess you might mean.
Do I answer that?

894
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,750
Will I answer some more of the questions
and I,

895
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:30,680
yeah,
I can do that.

896
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,723
I think what I would recommend everyone,
I mean we'll get better at this and I'm 

897
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:35,930
going to keep doing it.

898
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:39,810
Um,
where'd it go here?

899
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:44,773
There are a lot.
Many of the questions that were 

900
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:47,064
submitted on Patrion were very long and 
I don't think that's going to work 

901
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:52,030
because,
um,

902
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,260
it takes a long time to read the long 
questions and

903
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,670
that means I can't answer very many of 
them.

904
00:52:58,671 --> 00:52:59,504
So one of the things I would say,
if you're going to submit a question on 

905
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:03,650
Patrion,
at least for the time being,

906
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,693
you might,
might want to make them not more than 

907
00:53:05,841 --> 00:53:08,570
about maybe for la,
four or five lines long.

908
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,183
Cause I also have to scan through a lot 
of questions to find out which ones not 

909
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:16,670
only are worth answering because I think
many of them are worth answering.

910
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:20,360
But which ones I've got an answer at 
hand for because I can't

911
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,783
sit here and think and produce dead air 
for periods of time for this to work 

912
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:31,290
properly.
So we'll figure this out as we go along.

913
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,530
So,
um,

914
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,730
Dr. Peterson,
in your lectures,

915
00:53:37,731 --> 00:53:40,970
you speak a lot about toughening people 
up as someone who went through college,

916
00:53:40,971 --> 00:53:41,804
got a humanities degree,
bought completely into postmodern 

917
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:46,820
ideology.
And until hearing your lectures couldn't

918
00:53:46,821 --> 00:53:48,830
pawn pinpoint that feeling of 
aimlessness,

919
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:51,230
hopelessness and the aversion to 
responsibility,

920
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,070
where do you recommend they start?
I've particularly seen this inability to

921
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,904
be tough,
to negotiate and to bring up my inner 

922
00:53:58,221 --> 00:54:01,640
tyrant who is really just afraid.
Or You said it does bring out your inner

923
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:04,970
tyrant who is really just afraid it's 
not going to get what it wants.

924
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,850
How do you begin to work with that?
Well,

925
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,140
that,
that's a good question.

926
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:12,800
And the next question is how can men 
become more dangerous?

927
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:13,663
Well,
I can answer both of those at the same 

928
00:54:14,601 --> 00:54:15,434
time.
I would say for people who are too 

929
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,214
agreeable,
the first thing that you need to know 

930
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:25,230
what the first thing you need to figure 
out is what is it that you want?

931
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,073
And

932
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:29,343
because if you don't want anything and 
if you don't know what you want and you 

933
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:32,524
don't know what your strategy is,
how are you ever going to be able to 

934
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:37,750
conjure up the courage to stand for what
you believe in?

935
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:41,110
You don't believe in anything and you 
don't have any arguments at hand.

936
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:42,243
And I mean,
that's part of the reason that we 

937
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:47,180
developed the future authoring program 
was so that people could not only figure

938
00:54:47,181 --> 00:54:49,990
out what they wanted.
So to identify the goals in life,

939
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:53,320
which is identifying those goals as an 
integrating force,

940
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,573
but also to articulate the arguments 
that make them capable of defending 

941
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:58,421
yourself.
You know,

942
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:01,090
like if I'm going to challenge you,
let's say you come to me and you say,

943
00:55:01,091 --> 00:55:02,540
uh,
um,

944
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:06,610
I wanted to raise,
maybe it's taken you a lot of courage to

945
00:55:06,611 --> 00:55:07,760
conjure to,
to,

946
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:10,930
to be able to step into the office of 
your boss and say,

947
00:55:10,931 --> 00:55:12,250
well I want to raise.

948
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:13,630
And he says,
well no,

949
00:55:13,631 --> 00:55:15,160
we don't have any extra money at the 
time.

950
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:16,630
And you say,
well okay.

951
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,440
And then you leave.
Well that's not a good negotiation.

952
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,430
If you want something,
the first thing you have to do is set up

953
00:55:24,431 --> 00:55:27,400
options for yourself.
So if you really want to negotiate for a

954
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:28,750
raise,
let's say,

955
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,430
cause it,
we'll use this as an example.

956
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,893
The first thing you have to do is decide
whether or not you deserve to have a 

957
00:55:34,061 --> 00:55:36,250
race.
Because you can't just ask for one.

958
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:37,084
You have to make a case for it.
And so how do you know if you're in a 

959
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,490
position to ask for a raise?
Well,

960
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:43,324
part of it is that you have options.
So I would say put your cv or your 

961
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:52,831
resume in order and make it tight and 
then look around to see what other other

962
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:54,933
employment options you have that you 
would in fact take and see what your 

963
00:55:58,541 --> 00:55:59,650
market value is.

964
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,663
And because you have to have options,
you have to be able to say no one in 

965
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,904
negotiation and then decide how much of 
a raise you want and why it would be in 

966
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:12,550
the person's best interest to offer you 
the race,

967
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,560
make a case for it.
And one,

968
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,760
one of the reasons is,
look,

969
00:56:15,761 --> 00:56:19,750
I've got this other job opportunity that
I'm pursuing and I like working here,

970
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,510
but I'm going to take this other 
opportunity because it pays me more.

971
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,330
And you can't just say that if it's not 
the case,

972
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:26,164
if it's not true,
because that's an absolutely foolish 

973
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,430
negotiating strategy.
You have to have options,

974
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:32,710
you have to negotiate from a position of
strength.

975
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:36,640
And so you have to know what you want 
and you have to have options.

976
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:37,474
And then you have to develop strategies 
for communicating what it is that 

977
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:42,590
you're,
that you're asking for and you,

978
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,950
you have to be forthright about that 
and,

979
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,440
but you have to think through the 
reasons because otherwise you won't have

980
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:50,740
enough courage to tolerate the conflict 
that it might entail to,

981
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,380
to withstand the negotiation.

982
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,310
And I think if you're an agreeable type,
one way of,

983
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:58,390
of,
of,

984
00:56:58,780 --> 00:56:59,613
of fortifying yourself is to understand 
how much misery and conflict you may be 

985
00:57:03,431 --> 00:57:08,431
storing up for yourself in the future if
you refuse or if you refuse to engage in

986
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:11,530
reasonable negotiation on your own 
behalf in the present.

987
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:15,460
It's like,
so one of the ways I get myself to do,

988
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,640
to engage in conflict that I might not 
have wanted to engage in.

989
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,503
And despite what you might think because
of what's happened to me over the next 

990
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:24,670
six months,
I'm not a person who particularly enjoys

991
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:25,504
conflict.
I'm a person who knows that unless you 

992
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:31,660
engage in a certain amount of conflict 
to stand up for what you want,

993
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,470
that your life turns into hell.
And maybe the lives of people around you

994
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:38,350
turns into hell too.
And I'd rather have the damn conflict,

995
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:39,700
which I find quite stressful.

996
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:43,420
I'd rather have the conflict and allow 
everything to degenerate around me.

997
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,310
And so,
okay,

998
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,173
so,
and then you say you bring out your 

999
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:51,910
inner tyrant who is really just afraid.
It's not going to get what it wants.

1000
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,013
Well,
you get what you negotiate for and if 

1001
00:57:55,481 --> 00:57:58,600
you put yourself in a position of power 
and you give yourself options,

1002
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:01,390
then you will get what you most more 
frequently than not,

1003
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:03,400
you'll get what it is that you want,
but,

1004
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:04,503
but not because you want it,
but because you have a variety of 

1005
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:08,644
options available to you that would 
enable you to move forward more 

1006
00:58:11,261 --> 00:58:13,780
effectively in life.
So,

1007
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,800
okay,
let's see.

1008
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:28,940
Note for Juliet.
Will this live stream be archived?

1009
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:30,090
Yes,
it will be archived.

1010
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,070
Our Youtube seems to do that 
automatically.

1011
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:33,683
So

1012
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:37,910
is this chat really just patrons?
Yes.

1013
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:39,170
It's just patrons.
I mean,

1014
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,353
uh,
it's reasonable for the people who are 

1015
00:58:41,961 --> 00:58:44,410
supporting the channel to have,
uh,

1016
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,313
to,
to what it's reasonable for me to thank 

1017
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:51,080
the people that are supporting the 
channel in a specific way.

1018
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,200
I know that you guys,
because I,

1019
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,980
I talked to a number of,
you are happy that your efforts are also

1020
00:58:58,190 --> 00:59:01,010
contributing to the fact that very many 
people,

1021
00:59:01,011 --> 00:59:01,844
and it's about 8 million now by the way,
I'm very many people are able to watch 

1022
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:06,224
these lectures online and many people 
are translating them and doing all of 

1023
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:09,710
that too.
So,

1024
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:10,543
so the information that's available in 
the lectures is spreading very rapidly 

1025
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:13,814
and the support that you've uh,
provided me with has not only 

1026
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:21,050
facilitated that and improve the 
quality,

1027
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,453
these offerings substantially,
but has also enabled me to start 

1028
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:28,910
thinking about what I might do in the 
future that's more extensive.

1029
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,493
And uh,
and so one of the things I thought I 

1030
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:37,910
would do is to thank the Patriot people 
specifically for,

1031
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,580
for devoting their resources to this 
project.

1032
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,360
And I doing the q and a's,
I'm going to do them once a month.

1033
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:45,860
And um,

1034
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:47,000
okay.

1035
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:47,833
Yes,
it's just Patriot on people who are 

1036
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,830
going to be able to submit the cue the 
questions.

1037
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:55,040
Although everybody will be able to watch
them on Youtube because why not?

1038
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,780
It's no,
no harm done there.

1039
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:58,820
And it's nothing but benefit as far as I
can tell.

1040
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,150
So I'm Benjamin.
Rude says Jordan,

1041
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:04,640
why don't you use a dedicated microphone
and headphones?

1042
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:08,360
There is a painful reverb slash echo 
when you interview host people.

1043
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,980
Yes,
I think I've taken care of that.

1044
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:14,000
I've got a very good set of earbuds.
I've got new lighting.

1045
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,073
Um,
I've got to though I have a very good 

1046
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,890
microphone even though I wasn't using it
very well.

1047
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:19,724
And so I think I probably got that 
solved and certainly the camera is much 

1048
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,680
better than the one before.
So,

1049
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,320
um,
so let's see,

1050
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:28,790
what else have we got to say here?

1051
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,203
Okay.

1052
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,413
One of the things also that I might 
comment on it that's quite interesting 

1053
01:00:52,001 --> 01:00:56,830
is that I've read a lot of the youtube 
comments that accompany my video isn't,

1054
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,700
you know,
I'm,

1055
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,533
most of the time my experience is on 
youtube that if you read the youtube 

1056
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:04,840
comments gives you a seeking feeling 
about the potential future of humanity.

1057
01:01:05,230 --> 01:01:06,063
You know,
um,

1058
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:07,203
people seem to use the opportunity 
provided by anonymity to be some 

1059
01:01:11,201 --> 01:01:12,034
strange,
frequently some strange combination of 

1060
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:16,600
arrogant and obnoxious,
but you know,

1061
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,310
on,
on balance.

1062
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,260
And I would say it's more than on 
balance.

1063
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:21,094
It's in the vast majority of cases the 
comments that have been appended to my 

1064
01:01:24,611 --> 01:01:27,430
youtube videos apart from the odd troll 
and,

1065
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:30,910
and the odd person making the sorts of 
comments that no one should make,

1066
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:32,920
the quality of the comments has been 
very,

1067
01:01:32,921 --> 01:01:35,080
very high.
And so I'm very happy about that.

1068
01:01:35,081 --> 01:01:38,140
And maybe that's an accurate reflection 
of the people that are,

1069
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,320
are watching the information that is 
provided by the videos.

1070
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:45,070
It's rather difficult information and I 
don't think it's particularly welcome to

1071
01:01:45,071 --> 01:01:48,340
those who only want to cause trouble.
So.

1072
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:54,240
Okay.
Dr. Peterson,

1073
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:55,084
I'm a psychology student.
What do you think is the role of 

1074
01:01:57,281 --> 01:02:00,310
psychology in the selective 
reconstruction of ethics?

1075
01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,863
Well,

1076
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:03,923
I think that that's part of the reason 
that I'm a great admirer of both Freud 

1077
01:02:06,781 --> 01:02:10,470
and young and Rogers to that degree to 
to some degree,

1078
01:02:10,471 --> 01:02:11,304
I know you don't and not,
I shouldn't only limit it to them 

1079
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:17,250
because I've learned a lot from reading 
the great clinicians,

1080
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,563
the great clinicians are attempting to 
determine what the appropriate ethic is 

1081
01:02:23,731 --> 01:02:24,564
that promotes both healthy lives and 
healthy societies and they've made a 

1082
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:28,950
fair bit of progress.
You know,

1083
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:29,784
and maybe this gives some credence to 
Sam Harris's claim that you can derive 

1084
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:34,940
an ought from.
An is a,

1085
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,510
certainly an is can inform an art,
although it certainly doesn't,

1086
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:41,310
there's too many is,
is to,

1087
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,520
to,
to derive arts with in,

1088
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,100
in various,
I think that's the fundamental problem,

1089
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,520
but it's certainly the case that one of 
the things,

1090
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,383
the pieces of wisdom that you can see 
emerge across psychotherapists is that 

1091
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:55,523
um,
people are strengthened by voluntary 

1092
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:58,860
exposure to the things that they're 
avoiding.

1093
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,263
And that's a big deal because I think 
that that's not much different than a 

1094
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:04,344
practical application of the lessons 
that are embodied in Orthodox 

1095
01:03:07,530 --> 01:03:12,530
represented rep that are represented in 
an image and drama in hero mythology.

1096
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:13,644
Because the hero is the person who goes 
forth to voluntarily confront the 

1097
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,274
unknown and gained something as a 
consequence and benefits the community 

1098
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:22,140
as a consequences.
Well,

1099
01:03:22,141 --> 01:03:22,974
and that is very little different than 
the idea of exposure therapy and 

1100
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:29,250
psychotherapy.
And so that seems to me to be the base,

1101
01:03:29,251 --> 01:03:30,084
the core basis of a certain kind of 
ethic is that human development is 

1102
01:03:33,001 --> 01:03:33,834
facilitated by voluntary exploration,
confrontation and exploration of the 

1103
01:03:37,561 --> 01:03:38,394
unknown.
And that looks something like it's all 

1104
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:41,603
right.
I don't know if she can precisely say 

1105
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:43,404
that that's an ought from an is,
but it's certainly 10 it's certainly 

1106
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:47,213
trending in that direction.
So psychologists can help us understand 

1107
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,823
the nature of human beings and by 
understanding the nature of human 

1108
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:56,004
beings,
we may be able to better understand how 

1109
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:00,390
it is that human beings might optimally 
behave.

1110
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:01,823
So,
and that may also not merely be a 

1111
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:09,471
consequence of laying out the,
the vast array of empirical facts that's

1112
01:04:11,491 --> 01:04:13,650
associated with psychological 
investigation.

1113
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:14,484
It might also be a consequence of the 
sorts of things that piaget talked 

1114
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:18,954
about,
which is the observation of how 

1115
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:21,354
societies right from the small societies
of childhood all the way up organize 

1116
01:04:26,581 --> 01:04:30,060
themselves into coherent and functional 
large scale units.

1117
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:31,343
So,

1118
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,743
okay,
how do you walk the line between being 

1119
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:48,380
too agreeable or disagreeable when in a 
relationship,

1120
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:49,633
not making it,
not making it boring or impossible to 

1121
01:04:51,501 --> 01:04:53,360
work with the other person?
Well,

1122
01:04:53,361 --> 01:04:54,194
you,
you walk the line between being too 

1123
01:04:55,671 --> 01:05:00,671
agreeable or disagreeable by self 
reflection at by self reflection,

1124
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,240
listening and negotiation.
So the self reflection is um,

1125
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:13,420
continual self analysis about whether or
not you,

1126
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:14,313
the relationship is fulfilling those 
things that you need to be fulfilled in 

1127
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:19,360
to commit to it.
Um,

1128
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:20,194
self reflection is continuing analysis 
of whether you're acting in the other 

1129
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:24,484
person's best interest in a way that 
facilitates your own interest in a 

1130
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,444
manner that makes the relationship 
likely to last and maybe to extend out 

1131
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,980
beneficial beneficial consequences into 
the broader community.

1132
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,563
And then less by listening,
you get a chance to see how the other 

1133
01:05:40,271 --> 01:05:43,930
person views the situation.
And by negotiating you enjoy,

1134
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,990
you engage in joint problem solving and 
the person will tell you often if you're

1135
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,590
being a pushover,
you know,

1136
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:54,010
you never tell me what you want to do it
and,

1137
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:54,873
and then you get angry about it.
That that's often an indication that 

1138
01:05:57,011 --> 01:05:57,844
you're being a pushover or,
or maybe you don't take enough during 

1139
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:02,014
sex or maybe you give,
you give too much or you don't take 

1140
01:06:04,691 --> 01:06:05,524
enough during sex,
which is actually quite frustrating for 

1141
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:10,270
the other person.
And so it's self reflection,

1142
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:14,530
listening and negotiation that that'll 
help.

1143
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,360
So that,
that's basically the,

1144
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:18,220
uh,
uh,

1145
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,920
short and straight forward answer to 
that.

1146
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:22,493
MMM.

1147
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:31,580
Um,
let's see here.

1148
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,670
Somebody said that Julian is cute.
Well,

1149
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:37,800
I'll tell him that.
I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that.

1150
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:38,634
I think he's cute too.
Although he's 25 year old man and he's 

1151
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:44,250
not necessarily all that thrilled when I
refer to him as cute.

1152
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:48,420
He's actually quite tough and that I 
think is actually tough plus cute.

1153
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,760
That's a killer combination.
So

1154
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,753
Elvin artists says,
I love your serious tone when answering 

1155
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:58,450
dumb questions.
Well,

1156
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:01,510
thank you very much.
I appreciate the positive feedback.

1157
01:07:01,511 --> 01:07:02,344
It's how tall and my Dr. Peterson.
It depends on whether I'm sitting down 

1158
01:07:05,171 --> 01:07:06,004
or standing up.
So at the moment I'm about three foot 

1159
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,700
six,
but generally speaking,

1160
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:11,770
if I'm standing up,
I'm about six foot one.

1161
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:13,113
So you could ask me some more questions 
like that because it's getting late at 

1162
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,373
night.
And so those questions are really easy 

1163
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:19,323
to,
um,

1164
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,910
to answer.
Someone says,

1165
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:24,310
my father is dead.
Who Do I save from the whale?

1166
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,031
Well,
that's easy.

1167
01:07:25,031 --> 01:07:27,190
You save your spiritual father from the 
whale.

1168
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:30,310
Um,
saunder behind her sis.

1169
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,020
My feet lost weight.
Well,

1170
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,900
possibly I haven't weighed them 
independently of my body,

1171
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,850
so,
but it is certainly possible.

1172
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,213
Um,
Chinese culture mansplain says plus one 

1173
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:42,130
for Paleo.
You know,

1174
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,383
I know a number of people who have 
benefited substantially from a Paleo 

1175
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:47,140
Diet,
including,

1176
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,033
uh,
a relative of mine who's a great genius 

1177
01:07:49,961 --> 01:07:52,690
and whose life,
whose probably in better shape,

1178
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:53,733
better shape.

1179
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:55,780
Now that he's 60,
then he was,

1180
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:56,614
when he was 45,
he made very radical dietary 

1181
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:00,363
transformations of approximately the 
same sort that I've made in my keys in 

1182
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,970
extremely good physical shape and,
and doing very well mentally.

1183
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:07,804
And so there is a lot more to the Diet 
picture then we know and at least for 

1184
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:12,454
some people a heavy carbohydrate diet 
seems to be absolutely catastrophic and 

1185
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:17,234
it's something I wouldn't have expected 
because I'm one of those people who 

1186
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:23,030
regarded people who was,
who were hyper concerned with their diet

1187
01:08:23,031 --> 01:08:23,864
as,
as,

1188
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:26,240
as tending towards the unbearably 
neurotic.

1189
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,730
And I certainly learned my lesson about 
that.

1190
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:32,900
I no doubt in any group of people who 
are hyper concerned about something,

1191
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:35,000
there are people who are unnecessarily 
concerned,

1192
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:38,570
but there's definitely something going 
on with our diets,

1193
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,003
especially in North America because 
everyone is overweight and far too many 

1194
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:44,510
people are depressed.

1195
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:45,873
Um,
and I do think that it has something to 

1196
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,130
do.
I hesitate to say this,

1197
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:49,964
but I do think that it has something to 
do with eating too much green derived 

1198
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:58,610
carbohydrate,
specifically perhaps wheat and dairy.

1199
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,270
Um,
there's there,

1200
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:02,123
the situation may be more complicated 
than that and it's not an area of 

1201
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:05,714
specific expertise for me,
so I'm hesitant to say anything more 

1202
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:09,884
about that.
So Robby Kelly says storing is from 

1203
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:13,034
being overweight,
sleep paralysis stops muscles in the 

1204
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:17,270
throat from keeping the fat away from 
crushing windpipe.

1205
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,961
Yeah.
Well,

1206
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:19,910
I thought that too when I stopped 
snoring.

1207
01:09:19,911 --> 01:09:24,500
But the thing is after I changed my diet
to basically a paleo diet,

1208
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,753
I stopped snoring within a week.
It happened long before I lost enough 

1209
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:30,560
weight to make that,
that canonical reason.

1210
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:31,783
So,

1211
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:37,240
um,
let's see.

1212
01:09:38,250 --> 01:09:39,083
A commenter says,
Paleo meat plus vegetables did great 

1213
01:09:41,131 --> 01:09:43,440
things for my depression,
weight and health in general.

1214
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:43,981
Yes.
Well,

1215
01:09:43,981 --> 01:09:44,880
that,
that is,

1216
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:45,850
that is,
uh,

1217
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,203
um,
that is something that's characteristic 

1218
01:09:49,441 --> 01:09:50,274
of many people's experience.
Loser lesser 55 says his snoring a bad 

1219
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,350
thing.
Uh,

1220
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,243
well,
not if you enjoy it and not if you're 

1221
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,950
partner enjoys it.
But yes,

1222
01:09:58,951 --> 01:09:59,784
generally it's a bad thing because it 
interferes with your sleep and anything 

1223
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:06,200
that interferes with your sleep is 
generally a bad thing I get.

1224
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:07,043
And it can devolve into sleep apnea 
where you spend substantial periods of 

1225
01:10:10,141 --> 01:10:13,340
time each night,
not breathing and uh,

1226
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:15,300
that can cause very serious health 
problems.

1227
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:16,134
So,
um,

1228
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,520
so yes,
it can be,

1229
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:18,383
it generally snoring is a bad thing.
So what would you recommend to someone 

1230
01:10:22,561 --> 01:10:23,394
who wants to try to be productive in 
their free time but always gets sucked 

1231
01:10:26,191 --> 01:10:28,650
in by video games and other 
distractions?

1232
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:32,370
While I would say,
define more carefully,

1233
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,970
precisely what you mean by productive.
So get,

1234
01:10:35,971 --> 01:10:36,804
get a plan in order,
delineate the plan down to the level of 

1235
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,260
a daily routine.
Set up a daily routine,

1236
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:44,094
using a calendar,
put in times that you're going to get 

1237
01:10:47,191 --> 01:10:51,000
sucked in by video games and other 
distractions because obviously you enjoy

1238
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:51,834
that and then set yourself up so that 
it's difficult to get access to those 

1239
01:10:56,161 --> 01:10:56,994
things.

1240
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,083
So

1241
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,380
that's the answer to that question.

1242
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:13,860
Okay.

1243
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:15,300
More technical trouble here.

1244
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,770
Hey,
because of that,

1245
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:24,880
why in the world do you think it's doing
that?

1246
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,620
I don't know.
So technological mysteries.

1247
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:32,950
So,
um,

1248
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:37,510
let's see here.
Congratulations on the socks,

1249
01:11:37,511 --> 01:11:39,790
the weight loss and better sleep.
Stay healthy.

1250
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:40,571
We need you.
Well,

1251
01:11:40,571 --> 01:11:41,404
I'm doing my best.
I've had a lot of health problems over 

1252
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:43,804
the last,
well I guess to some degree over the 

1253
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:49,600
course of my entire life though I had a 
very terrible time in December,

1254
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:55,060
but I think I'm doing okay and um,
I don't think the health problems were a

1255
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:57,430
consequence of all the political 
controversy that I'd be in.

1256
01:11:57,431 --> 01:12:00,910
I just think they happened to Cole,
although one probably didn't really help

1257
01:12:00,911 --> 01:12:02,380
the other,
so,

1258
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:07,533
all right.

1259
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:12,890
Hey Julian.
Julian,

1260
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,400
someone thinks that your cute.
Yeah,

1261
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,290
someone thinks you're cute.
Hey,

1262
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,183
you want to come and look at these 
people and they can judge for 

1263
01:12:21,801 --> 01:12:22,670
themselves.
Yeah,

1264
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,190
sure.
Why not?

1265
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:24,770
All right.
So this is Julian.

1266
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,120
He's,
he's my son.

1267
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:29,160
He's been helping me with all of the 
technical issues that,

1268
01:12:29,230 --> 01:12:32,750
that I've been coming up against or the 
last few months.

1269
01:12:32,751 --> 01:12:35,120
And so he wouldn't think I was cute if 
you knew me.

1270
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,490
Yeah,
well that's exactly right.

1271
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:40,640
So I think actually if you know anyone,
you pretty much stopped thinking they're

1272
01:12:40,641 --> 01:12:42,780
cute.
So anyways,

1273
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:44,960
so,
all right,

1274
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,400
so let's see,
what else have we got here?

1275
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:50,630
What type of therapy should I seek for 
my social anxiety with so many different

1276
01:12:50,631 --> 01:12:52,050
options available?
Um,

1277
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,293
I would say the most straight forward 
form of therapy for something like 

1278
01:12:56,451 --> 01:12:57,284
social anxiety is behavioral therapy and
the behavioral therapists are very 

1279
01:12:59,931 --> 01:13:00,530
practical.

1280
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:02,480
And so if it's relatively straight 
forward,

1281
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:04,280
social anxiety,
uh,

1282
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,890
exposure therapy is very useful for that
sort of thing.

1283
01:13:06,891 --> 01:13:09,820
And sometimes social skills training,
if you don't feel that you have the,

1284
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:10,973
the like the skill and wherewithal to 
conduct yourself appropriately in a 

1285
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,710
social environment.
And some people aren't,

1286
01:13:15,711 --> 01:13:18,650
weren't socialized very well and so they
don't have those skills or they didn't,

1287
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:20,870
they didn't get the opportunity to 
practice.

1288
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,033
I would say what's probably more 
important is that you find a therapist 

1289
01:13:24,171 --> 01:13:25,004
that you're comfortable with and who is 
pushing you and helping you and 

1290
01:13:28,491 --> 01:13:32,030
listening to you in a proper manner.
But behavioral therapy is very,

1291
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:37,031
very effective for relatively straight 
forward ils issues of anxiety and um,

1292
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,490
and skill deficit,
let's say.

1293
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,270
So.
Okay.

1294
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:44,510
What else have we got here?

1295
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,033
Okay.

1296
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:58,700
Do you think science is a different 
domain then spirituality or religion and

1297
01:13:58,701 --> 01:14:00,910
therefore can't answer questions each 
other's domain?

1298
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:01,400
Yeah,
I do.

1299
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:02,233
I do essentially believe that.
I think that science is pretty good at 

1300
01:14:05,031 --> 01:14:05,864
laying out the landscape of empirical 
facts and that the religious is the 

1301
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,620
domain that attempts to answer the 
question,

1302
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,633
how is it that we should act in the 
world and there's overlap between the 

1303
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:21,130
two.
They can't be entirely separate domains,

1304
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:21,964
but roughly speaking.
That's the distinction and I think the 

1305
01:14:24,071 --> 01:14:28,810
reason is is that value free empirical 
facts cannot.

1306
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:33,640
You cannot derive values from a set of 
value free empirical facts and empirical

1307
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:34,474
facts by their nature are value free,
partly because the value is eradicated 

1308
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:41,380
from the empirical fact by the 
scientific method.

1309
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,870
That's actually what the scientific 
method does.

1310
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,033
Now.
It cannot do it completely because 

1311
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:46,893
scientists tend to concentrate on facts 
that they assume are relevant to the 

1312
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,300
solution of a given problem.

1313
01:14:52,510 --> 01:14:53,343
They don't just randomly search for 
facts and that's a good thing because 

1314
01:14:55,901 --> 01:14:56,734
there's an infinite number of the 
irrelevant facts to get separate them 

1315
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,160
completely.
I believe that the,

1316
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,003
some domains are separate,
but that the scientific domain is 

1317
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:08,320
necessarily nested inside the 
metaphysically religious domain.

1318
01:15:08,321 --> 01:15:09,154
And I believe that that domain is 
isomorphic in some sense with the 

1319
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:12,424
Darwinian domain.
And that's the point I was trying to 

1320
01:15:13,961 --> 01:15:16,360
make in the discussions I had with Sam 
Harris.

1321
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:18,310
I have a lecture about that,
Tom,

1322
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,180
the name of which I don't precisely 
remember unfortunately at the moment,

1323
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:27,130
but it's a lecture on Darwinian versus 
Newtonian approaches to the truth.

1324
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:31,210
And I tried to delineate my,
my thoughts about that more particularly

1325
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:33,670
in that video.
So

1326
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:40,430
how old was I when everything you 
understood started to come together?

1327
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:44,240
Um,
I think that really started happening to

1328
01:15:44,241 --> 01:15:45,074
me,

1329
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,390
started probably happening to me when I 
was in my early twenties.

1330
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,930
Um,
I think the most important realization I

1331
01:15:53,931 --> 01:15:54,764
had,
and I outlined this realization in my 

1332
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:59,690
book,
in the preface of my book maps,

1333
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:00,583
maps of meaning that I realized at about
that age that almost everything I said 

1334
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:06,254
was a false set of one form or another.
It was either I was using language 

1335
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:11,893
instrumentally in order to win arguments
or to attain dominance or to indicate 

1336
01:16:15,741 --> 01:16:19,640
that I was intelligent or to use it for 
victory,

1337
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:20,390
for,
for,

1338
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,223
for narrow local personal victory.
And I realized that when I was in my 

1339
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:27,853
early twenties and I started to cause a 
voice in some sense of voice started 

1340
01:16:30,561 --> 01:16:31,394
inside my head,
which I now regard as something 

1341
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:36,620
equivalent to the cricket in Pinocchio.
And it basically continued,

1342
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:41,710
continually informed me that the things 
I was saying weren't in some fundamental

1343
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:42,950
sense weren't true.

1344
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:43,783
And it was very disquieting because the 
voice that was commenting on what I was 

1345
01:16:48,291 --> 01:16:53,291
saying was making comments of that sort.
I wouldn't call him disparaging act,

1346
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:57,490
our voices of voice.
It was more just a,

1347
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:58,933
a matter of fact commentary.
But it was saying it about about 95% of 

1348
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:04,250
what I was saying.
And I thought,

1349
01:17:04,251 --> 01:17:06,260
well,
that's a strange conundrum because now I

1350
01:17:06,261 --> 01:17:07,094
don't know if I'm the voice that's 
criticizing what I'm saying or if I'm 

1351
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:12,770
the thing that's saying what's being 
criticized,

1352
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,400
how do you figure that out?
But I decided that I would take a chance

1353
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:17,234
and assumed that the part that was 
suggesting that I wasn't saying things 

1354
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:21,644
truthfully was accurate.
And I started to practice only saying 

1355
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,090
things that that voice wouldn't object 
to.

1356
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,243
And I think that's also equivalent to 
some degree to trying to say only those 

1357
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:34,760
things that make you strong instead of 
weak or that make you,

1358
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:35,913
that,
that do not fill you with a post speech 

1359
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:39,890
sense of shame and regret.

1360
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:42,200
And I really think that was the 
beginning of,

1361
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:43,710
of all of this,
um,

1362
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:44,623
about this.
It was at the same time though that I 

1363
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:49,550
was starting to work out to,
are starting to work on the problem that

1364
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:51,860
I think is obsessed my,
my entire life,

1365
01:17:51,861 --> 01:17:56,780
which is what's the pathway between 
nihilism and totalitarianism?

1366
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,260
Is there,
is there a genuine pathway between those

1367
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,780
two pathological extremes?
So,

1368
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:03,614
and I think those things wove together.
I had a serious problem to solve and I 

1369
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:07,784
also tried to,
tried to begin to sort out my language 

1370
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:12,710
and really to learn how to work as well.
So,

1371
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:14,880
and that was in my early twenties.
Um,

1372
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,630
I mean I had lots of things to 
straighten out in my life.

1373
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:18,770
Many,
many things.

1374
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:20,960
And I still have many things to 
straighten out in my life,

1375
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,530
but I think that's it.
So,

1376
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:27,603
oh,
okay.

1377
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:40,443
Okay.
But isn't the future authoring program 

1378
01:18:41,741 --> 01:18:43,720
just praying?
Ah,

1379
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,220
well,
you know,

1380
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:48,970
whenever you ask a question and the 
question is of the form,

1381
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:53,140
is x equal to y?
The answer is always,

1382
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:56,980
it depends on how you define x.
And it depends on how you define why and

1383
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:58,930
it's not a copout.
I mean,

1384
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:00,820
your question really means something 
like,

1385
01:19:00,821 --> 01:19:01,654
are there important similarities between
what people conventionally described as 

1386
01:19:06,251 --> 01:19:07,084
prayer and the meditative exercise that 
you might undertake while doing the 

1387
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:11,260
future authoring?
And I would say yes,

1388
01:19:11,261 --> 01:19:12,094
there are important similarities.
I don't think it's reasonable to say 

1389
01:19:14,741 --> 01:19:15,574
that they're the same because people 
wouldn't automatically assume that they 

1390
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:18,694
were the same.
They're not obviously in the same 

1391
01:19:19,811 --> 01:19:20,644
category.
But I would say that completing the 

1392
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:26,560
future authoring exercise is to a large 
degree,

1393
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,943
um,
putting into practice in a very 

1394
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:30,544
pragmatic way,
the ethical guidelines that were 

1395
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:33,694
outlined in the sermon on the mount.
Because what the sermon on the mount 

1396
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:36,604
basically says is something like aim at 
the highest good that you can conceive 

1397
01:19:39,971 --> 01:19:43,780
of and then concentrate on the day.
It's something like that.

1398
01:19:43,781 --> 01:19:47,170
And there's also a tremendous call to 
truth in that sermon.

1399
01:19:47,171 --> 01:19:48,700
So yes.
Um,

1400
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:53,710
Sam Dogan asks,
what is my favorite biblical story?

1401
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,200
I don't know if I have a favorite.
I mean,

1402
01:19:57,201 --> 01:19:59,270
some of them I've analyzed more than 
others.

1403
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:01,630
I guess maybe that's wrong.
Maybe the story that,

1404
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,633
that,
that,

1405
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:07,400
that
packs the most punch for unitive of,

1406
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,490
of,
of,

1407
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,123
of conceptual effort
per unit of conceptual effort is the 

1408
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:17,430
story of Cain and Abel.
That is really quite a story.

1409
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,080
I mean it's,
it's very,

1410
01:20:19,081 --> 01:20:23,340
very short and it's unbelievably punchy.
So,

1411
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,190
so far that's the one that's been most 
remarkably illuminating to me.

1412
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:31,190
Now that's not it.
It's a tough,

1413
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:32,053
tough question because I could say the 
same thing about the story of Adam and 

1414
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:37,680
eve.
I mean when I understood like,

1415
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:38,903
I mean,
gaining some of the insights that I've 

1416
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:44,640
had into these stories has really been a
mind altering experience.

1417
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:45,421
So,
for example,

1418
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:46,254
when I understood why it is in our,
at least I believe I understood why it 

1419
01:20:50,701 --> 01:20:51,534
is that in the story of Adam and Eve,
that human beings accrued the knowledge 

1420
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:55,434
of good and evil,
that they were transformed into moral 

1421
01:20:57,361 --> 01:21:01,080
agents when the scales fell from their 
eyes and they realized they were naked.

1422
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,420
That was unbelievably powerful 
revelation for me.

1423
01:21:03,421 --> 01:21:04,254
And the revelation was,
for those of you who haven't heard me 

1424
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:06,954
talk about it,
that there's no difference between 

1425
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:10,014
recognizing that you're naked and 
vulnerable and mortal and that you're 

1426
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:15,300
going to die so that you're a vulnerable
creature.

1427
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:19,140
And,
and being able to take advantage of that

1428
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,200
vulnerability as it's manifested in 
yourself and other people.

1429
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:23,303
So you cannot be evil without knowledge 
of your own vulnerability and the 

1430
01:21:26,431 --> 01:21:27,264
vulnerability of others.
And you can be evil as soon as you know 

1431
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:30,624
that,
because as soon as you understand that 

1432
01:21:31,591 --> 01:21:34,620
vulnerability,
you understand how to exploit it.

1433
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,290
So animals,
for example,

1434
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:41,130
predatory animals don't exploit the 
vulnerability of their,

1435
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,560
of their prey.
I mean they killed them.

1436
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:46,110
And so in that sense,
I suppose it's an exploitation,

1437
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:49,590
but they don't take conscious advantage 
of the prey.

1438
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:52,680
Knowing what would hurt them as 
individuals,

1439
01:21:52,681 --> 01:21:53,514
the milks,
they can't torture and they certainly 

1440
01:21:55,321 --> 01:21:57,960
can't torture intensely and for long 
periods of times,

1441
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:01,020
like human beings scout now it requires 
self consciousness.

1442
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,273
And so it's the emergence of self 
consciousness that gives people moral 

1443
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:05,963
agency because they,
they develop the capacity for evil at 

1444
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:11,910
that point and developing the capacity 
for evil.

1445
01:22:11,911 --> 01:22:14,580
They offer also develop the capacity for
the opposite.

1446
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:15,443
Which minimum is the,
the decision not to be as Google would 

1447
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:23,250
put it,
not to be any more evil than necessary.

1448
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,110
Let's say.
So

1449
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,330
Dr. Peterson,
am I in the Illuminati?

1450
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:46,220
Huh?
Well,

1451
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,810
if I wasn't in the Illuminati and I said
no,

1452
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:53,180
that would just be proof that I was in 
the Illuminati.

1453
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:54,014
So I don't see any way I can answer that
question without obviously offering 

1454
01:22:58,911 --> 01:23:01,760
proof that I am in the Illuminati.
So,

1455
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,910
um,
I don't,

1456
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:06,760
I'm in the Illuminati.
How's that?

1457
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,990
That,
that might work out?

1458
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,093
So

1459
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,600
let's see.
Jordan,

1460
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:24,850
Dr. Peterson,
will you visit Fredericton,

1461
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,690
New Brunswick?
I have visited Fredericton.

1462
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,130
I actually had quite a nice time there.
Um,

1463
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:31,660
I,
I'm try,

1464
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:32,523
I'm going to try to limit my travel to 
about once every six weeks because I 

1465
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:38,650
have a bunch of other obligations that I
have to keep up with.

1466
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,960
And so,
and at the moment,

1467
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:41,794
Fredericton isn't on my travel schedule.
I am releasing a book in the early part 

1468
01:23:46,511 --> 01:23:47,344
of 2018 it's called 12 rules for life,
an antidote to chaos and it's 12 essays 

1469
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:58,760
that I derived from a set of answers 
that I gave on the website.

1470
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,340
Cora,
to the question,

1471
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:03,070
what are the most valuable things that 
everyone should know?

1472
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:05,440
What are the most valuable things that 
everyone should know?

1473
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:06,303
I think I wrote 42 little rules there 
and you can find 

1474
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:12,110
them@jordanbpeterson.com some,
um,

1475
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:13,103
uh,
they're accompanied by photographic 

1476
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:18,130
images that one of my viewers has kindly
donated to the project.

1477
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:21,970
People have been doing all sorts of Nice
and creative things for me,

1478
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:24,970
helping me facilitate what I'm doing on 
Youtube.

1479
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:27,020
And they did that.
Um,

1480
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,173
the reason I mentioned that is because I
presume that when that book is released 

1481
01:24:31,221 --> 01:24:35,320
that I'll be going on a speaking tour 
and it's possible that Fredericton would

1482
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,154
be on that agenda,
but I don't know because none of that 

1483
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:41,170
has been formulated yet.
So,

1484
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,490
um,
the book,

1485
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,733
I'm happy with the book,
I've been writing it for about three 

1486
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:46,144
years and it's been quite thoroughly 
edited and commented on by my editor at 

1487
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,393
Penguin Random House is publishing it in
Canada and fed a number of friends of 

1488
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:57,510
mine who are good authors and sometimes 
excellent authors,

1489
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:58,840
um,
review it.

1490
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:00,440
And so,
um,

1491
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:02,003
uh,
that should give me the opportunity to 

1492
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:05,080
do some more traveling and to talk about
the book.

1493
01:25:05,081 --> 01:25:07,600
So,
okay,

1494
01:25:07,780 --> 01:25:08,613
so let's say a Dr. Peterson,
how did the postmodernist so 

1495
01:25:12,701 --> 01:25:14,860
successfully take over the education 
system?

1496
01:25:14,890 --> 01:25:16,840
Man,
I should certainly knew,

1497
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,280
wish I knew the answer to that dedicated
effort over three decades would do it.

1498
01:25:21,281 --> 01:25:23,770
But I would also say,
you know,

1499
01:25:23,771 --> 01:25:28,510
if people are continually funded by the 
public purse for the political activity,

1500
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:32,980
they can spend a tremendous amount of 
time concentrating on it.

1501
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,413
And so,
and when you also add to that the fact 

1502
01:25:36,551 --> 01:25:39,280
that 80% of humanities papers,
uh,

1503
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:40,143
Garner zero citations,
which means essentially that no one 

1504
01:25:42,581 --> 01:25:45,310
reads them or if they do,
they don't do anything with them,

1505
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:46,683
then you don't have to spend a lot of 
time concentrating on what you're 

1506
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:52,780
writing because it tends to be a very 
low quality,

1507
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:56,020
at least judged by the standards of 
attracting readership.

1508
01:25:56,021 --> 01:25:56,854
And so I would say we've devoted a 
substantial proportion of the public 

1509
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:01,054
funding of higher education to the 
production of precisely the kind of 

1510
01:26:03,561 --> 01:26:08,561
ideological ideologically minded 
activists who are aiming precisely at,

1511
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,243
at,
at occupying positions of power 

1512
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:12,644
everywhere they possibly can and 
transforming the social institutions 

1513
01:26:15,561 --> 01:26:18,350
into,
into puppets of their particular form of

1514
01:26:18,351 --> 01:26:19,970
possession.
So,

1515
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:22,603
okay.

1516
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,133
Iq and wisdom.
What's the relationship between Iq and 

1517
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:30,284
wisdom?
I would say virtually no relationship 

1518
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,670
whatsoever.
There no evidence of any relationship.

1519
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,770
So for example,
I,

1520
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:39,650
wisdom seems to be something more like 
the balance between,

1521
01:26:39,651 --> 01:26:40,100
uh,
uh,

1522
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,680
a large set of,
of abilities and virtues.

1523
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:45,620
And there is no evidence that I know of 
that,

1524
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:50,090
that people with higher iqs are,
are wiser than people without high iqs.

1525
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:52,280
I don't,
I don't see any evidence for that.

1526
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:53,533
So,
and I think it's partly because you can 

1527
01:26:56,601 --> 01:26:57,470
be,
your,

1528
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,573
your capacity to think can lead you into
very bad places just as well in some 

1529
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:05,210
sense as it can lead you into very good 
places.

1530
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:07,070
So it's a tool.
It's a very,

1531
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:09,890
very powerful tool and it's a tool that 
can be wielded for,

1532
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:10,873
for better or for worse.
And even in relationship to your own 

1533
01:27:13,371 --> 01:27:15,620
wellbeing,
have you seen many people who,

1534
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:17,143
whose intelligence and rationality has 
become nothing but the kind of critical 

1535
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:22,430
force that completely undermines their 
capacity to live?

1536
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:24,980
It makes them nihilistic and bitter and 
resentful and,

1537
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,180
and it's,
uh,

1538
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:27,013
it's uh,
and proud as well because it's very 

1539
01:27:28,581 --> 01:27:29,414
intelligent.
People tend to be very proud of their 

1540
01:27:30,591 --> 01:27:31,424
intelligence,
which is also a mistake because they're 

1541
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,124
not the creators of that intelligence 
and have no reason to take personal 

1542
01:27:36,681 --> 01:27:38,210
credit for it.
So,

1543
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:40,130
but wisdom,
whatever wisdom is,

1544
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:40,973
doesn't seem to be related to in any 
straight forward manner to street 

1545
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:45,140
intelligence.
So,

1546
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:46,873
um,

1547
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,610
someone says,
I made the mistake of using,

1548
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:56,503
um,
psychedelic and recreational drugs to 

1549
01:27:58,901 --> 01:28:02,170
access when I was young and I'm sorry I 
missed,

1550
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,193
I can't see the question right now.
So I'm going to have to regenerate it 

1551
01:28:05,261 --> 01:28:09,040
for memory.
And the consequence of that I believe is

1552
01:28:09,041 --> 01:28:12,640
that my ability to think has become very
cloudy and uncertain.

1553
01:28:13,450 --> 01:28:14,283
And I don't know what to do about that.
I would say that you should probably go 

1554
01:28:16,451 --> 01:28:19,600
talk to a psychologist or a psychiatrist
because there,

1555
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:23,620
there may be things that could be done 
to sharpen your thinking up again,

1556
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:26,590
and maybe some of them perversely enough
might be pharmacological.

1557
01:28:26,591 --> 01:28:27,460
Perhaps,
you know,

1558
01:28:27,461 --> 01:28:31,390
what you're describing could be a 
consequence of something like depression

1559
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:34,610
or even post traumatic stress disorder.
Um,

1560
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:37,780
so because the evidence on the longterm 
use of,

1561
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:40,240
of,
of psychedelic drugs for example,

1562
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,160
isn't,
it doesn't indicate that in that overall

1563
01:28:45,161 --> 01:28:45,994
they produce negative health 
consequences of the sort that you're 

1564
01:28:48,071 --> 01:28:48,820
describing.

1565
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:53,110
Now you might've had adulterated drugs,
you might've been one of those people.

1566
01:28:53,111 --> 01:28:53,944
And there do seem to be people like that
who are prone to negative consequences 

1567
01:28:57,491 --> 01:29:02,491
for using various recreational drugs.
But I would say if you really think that

1568
01:29:02,851 --> 01:29:04,950
your cognitive ability has been 
impaired,

1569
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:05,784
you should probably go talk to a 
psychologist or a psychiatrist and see 

1570
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:10,260
if you can do something about that.
Because sometimes,

1571
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:11,094
for example,
antidepressants or drugs like 

1572
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:14,400
Wellbutrin,
which is also an antidepressant,

1573
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:18,480
but a different kind can be very useful 
in restoring mental clarity.

1574
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,010
It's worth a shot.
You know,

1575
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,570
you don't want to go through life like 
that.

1576
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,240
So,
okay.

1577
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:25,823
Do I believe in the power of Lord Keck?
What do you think of the rise of belief 

1578
01:29:29,461 --> 01:29:30,960
and need magic?
Well,

1579
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,230
I don't think it's any different.
It's the use of archetypal imagery.

1580
01:29:34,290 --> 01:29:39,290
And I don't know if if,
I mean obviously archetypal imagery,

1581
01:29:40,571 --> 01:29:43,690
it has tremendous power.
And so when,

1582
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:44,593
when right now people are obsessed with 
archetypes of chaos and Kik is a 

1583
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:51,160
manifestation of an archetype of chaos 
and,

1584
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,280
and transformation because the frog is 
a,

1585
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,620
as a,
as a spirit of transformation.

1586
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:56,454
I talked about that did an interview 
with a great Russian Orthodox carver 

1587
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,344
named Jonathan Powell,
who's very knowledgeable about such 

1588
01:30:03,451 --> 01:30:04,380
things.
And we did a,

1589
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:05,350
uh,
uh,

1590
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,430
a youtube video on the metaphysics of 
pepe.

1591
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:11,100
And so if you're interested in that,
you might want to take a look at that.

1592
01:30:12,280 --> 01:30:13,113
Um,

1593
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:22,870
is there a universal female story 
opposite to the hero myth?

1594
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:24,160
Yeah,
I think there is.

1595
01:30:24,161 --> 01:30:27,060
I think it's beauty and the beast.
Um,

1596
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:32,100
although I think that
the taming of the partner,

1597
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:38,050
the taming of the wild partner as an as 
a,

1598
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,840
as a myth is applicable to men and 
women.

1599
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:41,703
There's an element of taming that goes 
on in a relationship regardless of the 

1600
01:30:45,911 --> 01:30:48,640
sex of the people who were involved in 
the relationship.

1601
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:51,280
So men,
team women and women take men.

1602
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:52,773
Um,
I think the idea of taming and 

1603
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:56,614
civilizing men is more directly a part 
of the fundamental archetype of the 

1604
01:31:00,491 --> 01:31:01,324
feminine.
And I think that for a variety of 

1605
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,114
reasons,
but I think beauty and the beast might 

1606
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:08,710
be the canonical female heroes story.
So,

1607
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,900
uh,
I would like to elaborate on that.

1608
01:31:10,901 --> 01:31:11,734
But what,
I'm starting to get tired and I don't 

1609
01:31:13,241 --> 01:31:16,990
have the mental energy to do that.
I may do a video on beauty and the beast

1610
01:31:16,991 --> 01:31:18,520
though I'd like,
I would like to do that.

1611
01:31:19,390 --> 01:31:21,340
So,
um,

1612
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:28,443
what do I think is the archetype whole 
significance of the popularity of the 

1613
01:31:31,031 --> 01:31:33,400
anti hero in American television?
Oh,

1614
01:31:33,401 --> 01:31:34,510
well that's,
that's easy.

1615
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:38,540
I mean the,
the anti hero nature,

1616
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:44,550
nature made the proposition that he said
that morality is cowardice.

1617
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:48,040
No,
that's not exactly what he said.

1618
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:49,263
What he,
what he said in a more elaborated for 

1619
01:31:51,891 --> 01:31:52,724
him is that very frequently people are 
afraid to do things and they're often 

1620
01:31:57,551 --> 01:31:58,384
things that other people regard bad.
And because they don't want to admit to 

1621
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:05,710
themselves that the reason they won't do
those things that are regarded as bad is

1622
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:06,544
because they're cowardly.
They pretended to that it's because 

1623
01:32:08,531 --> 01:32:09,364
they're moral.
And so often conventional morality is a 

1624
01:32:12,461 --> 01:32:13,294
consequence of conventional cowardice.
And the problem with conventional 

1625
01:32:16,421 --> 01:32:19,810
cowardice is that it's not sufficient to
solve serious problems.

1626
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:24,160
And so for example,
it's necessary for a man and perhaps for

1627
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:24,994
a woman as well to become a bit of a 
monster or even a lot of a monster in 

1628
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:31,030
order to move through life successfully.

1629
01:32:31,450 --> 01:32:36,450
And that doesn't mean precisely that you
have to act out being a monster,

1630
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,403
but it means that you need to be able to
be a monster when the circumstances 

1631
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:42,034
demanded.
And so the reason that anti heroes like 

1632
01:32:44,051 --> 01:32:45,400
Walter White,
for example,

1633
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:50,730
are so popular in American culture is 
because the criminal Walter White was by

1634
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:56,080
no obvious,
was in no obvious way,

1635
01:32:56,081 --> 01:33:01,081
less moral than the conventional and 
cowardly Walter White.

1636
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,570
Now you might say he went from one 
extreme to another,

1637
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,433
which he did,
but it's also the case that in order to 

1638
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:09,693
expand past the domains of conventional 
morality slash cowardice from the 

1639
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:14,374
Nietzschean perspective,
it's necessary to incorporate elements 

1640
01:33:17,861 --> 01:33:18,694
of the shadow.
And that's in some sense what needs you 

1641
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:23,890
meant when he said that we need to go 
beyond good and evil.

1642
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:24,724
And it's certainly what you meant when 
he said that it's necessary for someone 

1643
01:33:27,701 --> 01:33:28,534
who wants to burst forth from the 
potentially pathological combined 

1644
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:36,150
confines of their conventional persona 
into the,

1645
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:40,750
the journey towards individuation and,
and the development of the self was that

1646
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,790
the shadow had to be incorporated.

1647
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:46,480
And that means often in part,
the capacity for aggression,

1648
01:33:46,860 --> 01:33:49,240
uh,
the capacity for sexual expression,

1649
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:53,860
the capacity to defy defy convention,
that capacity to take your own road.

1650
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,003
And that's all predicated on the 
development of an inner relationship 

1651
01:33:57,761 --> 01:33:58,594
with the monster.
And it's the same idea that's expressed 

1652
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:01,534
in Harry Potter.
Harry Potter is actually able to combat 

1653
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:05,824
voldemort who's essentially Satan for 
all intents and purposes because he has 

1654
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:13,330
a pace of evil,
lodged firmly within him.

1655
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,440
And it's also what makes him a,
uh,

1656
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:18,400
redeeming rule breaker.
Right?

1657
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:21,850
So,
so the anti hero is the shadow,

1658
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:23,163
roughly speaking.
And the shadow is the thing that the 

1659
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:28,330
persona needs to incorporate to become 
the hero.

1660
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:32,980
So
South Fresno says,

1661
01:34:32,981 --> 01:34:36,010
I preached a sermon and use some of your
cane enables stuff.

1662
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,000
Well,
that's good.

1663
01:34:37,001 --> 01:34:39,670
I wouldn't say that it's,
my cane enables stuff though much as I'd

1664
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:40,780
like to take credit for it.

1665
01:34:41,090 --> 01:34:42,640
Um,
but I'm happy to hear that.

1666
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:43,800
And uh,
um,

1667
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,033
I hope it worked well and,
and that there were people at your 

1668
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:49,090
sermon because otherwise that would be a
problem.

1669
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:51,070
So,
um,

1670
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,810
Jordan,
what's your favorite mean?

1671
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:55,930
Made a view?
Well,

1672
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:58,410
I don't know.
Um,

1673
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,740
I don't know if I've developed a 
favorite.

1674
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,530
Um,
let me think about that for a minute.

1675
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:07,220
I find the fact that they're being made 
of great amusement,

1676
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,083
I think it's absurd.
It's absolutely absurd and ridiculous 

1677
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:13,100
and I can't believe that it's happening.
So,

1678
01:35:13,790 --> 01:35:15,770
um,
I know that that's not much of an answer

1679
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:16,760
to your question,
but,

1680
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:19,820
um,
I find the whole category,

1681
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:23,650
I don't know what to say about it.
It's surreal.

1682
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:27,370
It's a surreal phenomenon.
And,

1683
01:35:27,371 --> 01:35:32,020
uh,
the association that has emerged between

1684
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,990
me and,
and kermit the frog and pepe,

1685
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,910
I also find that that's,
that's,

1686
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:41,970
that was actually the most
market form of synchronicity that I,

1687
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:44,023
I've ever seen manifest itself.
So that was really something quite 

1688
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:49,940
remarkable and amazing.
And I talk about that also with Jonathan

1689
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:52,100
Patio on the,
in the metaphysics of pepe.

1690
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:53,623
So

1691
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,460
turned off again.
Yeah,

1692
01:36:20,580 --> 01:36:21,413
I turned it back on.
It seems to turn off on a relatively 

1693
01:36:23,581 --> 01:36:25,500
regular basis.
So there must be something.

1694
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:26,453
There must be some setting that we just 
don't understand that any of you have a 

1695
01:36:28,561 --> 01:36:29,394
Canon camera and you use it for video 
broadcasting and it shuts off now and 

1696
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:35,840
then,
and you know why you could,

1697
01:36:35,841 --> 01:36:37,380
uh,
put that in the comment section.

1698
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:38,253
I'm sure we'll figure it out,
but it does seem to be a regular 

1699
01:36:40,261 --> 01:36:41,850
occurrence.
So,

1700
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,113
all right,
so I'm going to sign out here pretty 

1701
01:36:44,671 --> 01:36:45,504
quick because I'm starting to wear out 
and I don't want to say anything 

1702
01:36:48,330 --> 01:36:49,163
pathologically idiotic for public 
consumption and that could happen and 

1703
01:36:53,101 --> 01:36:54,960
that would be a bad thing.
So,

1704
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:56,700
okay,
so let's see.

1705
01:36:56,701 --> 01:36:58,290
I'll ask answer one more question.

1706
01:36:59,370 --> 01:37:00,203
MMM.

1707
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:15,250
The Canon cameras in the tea range,
go to sleep at Canon.

1708
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:16,960
Cameras in the tea range.
Go to sleep.

1709
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:18,010
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1710
01:37:18,011 --> 01:37:18,844
Hey,
that's from Louis Guillermo Martinez 

1711
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:22,090
Pinzon.
And if I remember correctly,

1712
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,253
please correct me if I'm wrong.
I believe that that is the delightful 

1713
01:37:26,561 --> 01:37:29,140
gentleman from Mexico who's produced 
the,

1714
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:32,590
uh,
excellent graphic intro that I use on my

1715
01:37:32,591 --> 01:37:34,900
videos and he's produced another one for
me,

1716
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:38,830
which I'm going to be using on my 
youtube interviews.

1717
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:40,890
So thank you very much,
Luis,

1718
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,430
and,
and I will,

1719
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:45,510
or Louie and I will check that out.
That's,

1720
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,290
that's a good,
that's good hint.

1721
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:50,290
Thank you very much.
What are my personal spiritual practices

1722
01:37:50,291 --> 01:37:52,270
and rituals?
Um,

1723
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:56,650
the simpsons.
Yeah,

1724
01:37:57,210 --> 01:37:58,043
I'm absolutely addicted to the simpsons.
I think I've watched every single 

1725
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:02,730
episode of the simpsons at least five 
times.

1726
01:38:02,970 --> 01:38:03,803
Generally what I do is I start with 
episode one and I go through all of 

1727
01:38:06,211 --> 01:38:07,044
them.
And that takes about a year or maybe a 

1728
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:10,523
year and a half.
And then I started at the beginning and 

1729
01:38:11,911 --> 01:38:13,110
again,
and I go through them again.

1730
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,940
And I also watched the trailer park 
boys.

1731
01:38:14,941 --> 01:38:17,040
I'm very embarrassed to state to say 
that,

1732
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:17,874
but I,
I've also quite addicted to the trailer 

1733
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:22,560
park boys and that's outside on.
I don't know what to say about that,

1734
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:23,413
but,
um,

1735
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:24,413
I,
I think that bubbles is one of the most 

1736
01:38:25,770 --> 01:38:29,190
remarkable comedic characters that 
Canadian comics have ever developed.

1737
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:30,024
And I think the same thing about ricky,
I really think that show is a profane 

1738
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:35,423
and,
and distasteful work of genius and it's 

1739
01:38:38,671 --> 01:38:39,504
a guilty pleasure.
So I guess those are my spiritual 

1740
01:38:41,140 --> 01:38:44,070
practice watching the simpsons in the 
trailer park boys.

1741
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:45,383
I should also tell you,
because this is a funny story and 

1742
01:38:46,861 --> 01:38:47,694
because my son happens to be sitting 
here with me and he can tell you that 

1743
01:38:49,681 --> 01:38:52,050
this is the truth.
When my kids were little,

1744
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:52,884
we didn't have a television and the only
television show I ever let them watch 

1745
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:58,380
was the simpsons.
Yes,

1746
01:38:58,381 --> 01:39:00,360
exactly.
And so when they were really little,

1747
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:01,194
I used to cover up their eyes when itchy
and scratchy came on because I thought 

1748
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:04,890
that was a bit too much.
But,

1749
01:39:05,230 --> 01:39:06,063
um,
I thought that the simpsons was a very 

1750
01:39:07,231 --> 01:39:10,440
honest satirical show and that it was 
teaching them the proper,

1751
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:15,900
the proper rules of life and they didn't
seem to turn out too badly.

1752
01:39:15,901 --> 01:39:17,610
And they have really good senses of 
humor.

1753
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:18,660
So,
um,

1754
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:21,630
so it seems to have worked on all 
Simpson Diet.

1755
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,970
That's not the ritual I recommend for 
children.

1756
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,680
I didn't take them to church,
but I,

1757
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,903
I had them watch the simpsons on regular
basis and probably I should be hauled 

1758
01:39:30,061 --> 01:39:31,760
off in front of the child,
you know,

1759
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:34,260
child welfare people for that and 
admitting it.

1760
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:35,093
And that's why I need to stop because 
I'll tell you other things that I've 

1761
01:39:37,051 --> 01:39:39,740
done and I'll get myself in trouble.
So.

1762
01:39:40,470 --> 01:39:42,870
All right.
So,

1763
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:43,763
oh,
and Louie Guillermo Martinez has been 

1764
01:39:45,091 --> 01:39:48,120
zone says also when no one presses any 
buttons.

1765
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:49,800
I see.
Okay.

1766
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:50,843
I see.
So it is set to automatically shut off 

1767
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:54,570
because it assumes that no one is doing 
anything.

1768
01:39:54,660 --> 01:39:55,493
Do you know Louis,
what I can do to stop it from shutting 

1769
01:39:57,631 --> 01:39:58,464
off because I don't want to get up in 
the middle of a broadcast and like push 

1770
01:40:01,381 --> 01:40:02,760
a button.
So,

1771
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:05,010
so much,
much appreciated.

1772
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:07,350
So,
okay.

1773
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,400
I think I'm going to stop guys.
Um,

1774
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:12,413
I appreciate that.
I appreciate the support very much and 

1775
01:40:14,281 --> 01:40:17,670
I'm doing my best to put it to the best 
of all possible uses.

1776
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:18,504
One thing I couldn't tell you is that 
you know that I'm doing this series on 

1777
01:40:21,661 --> 01:40:22,140
the Bible.

1778
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:22,973
You may know that or may not.
It's going to start I believe May 16th 

1779
01:40:25,321 --> 01:40:26,154
but possibly May 23rd and I'm going to 
go through the Bible from beginning to 

1780
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:33,270
end describing the psychological 
significance of the stories.

1781
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,580
But another thing that I've got involved
in recently,

1782
01:40:35,581 --> 01:40:38,460
and this is in,
it's in its early stages of development,

1783
01:40:38,461 --> 01:40:39,294
but I met a group of of moderate Muslim 
intellectuals in Toronto a couple of 

1784
01:40:44,911 --> 01:40:49,410
times now and they're planning a 
reformist movement,

1785
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:52,530
a reformist Islam movement that will be 
grounded in Canada.

1786
01:40:52,531 --> 01:40:55,570
And I hope to be involved in out in some
integral manner,

1787
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:56,433
partly as a consequence of doing youtube
videos and podcast interviews on the 

1788
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:00,844
topic of Islam and on how it,
how it's more extremist elements might 

1789
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:08,050
be properly Moto Mod,
your ma moderate it.

1790
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:09,303
And so you know,
that's a big deal and who knows if 

1791
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:11,854
that'll go anywhere.
But that's definitely something that I 

1792
01:41:13,631 --> 01:41:16,720
want to devote my attention towards 
because it seems like an extraordinarily

1793
01:41:16,780 --> 01:41:17,590
important topic.

1794
01:41:17,590 --> 01:41:20,290
And so with any luck,
I'll be able to concentrate my attention

1795
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,124
on elucidating the psychological 
significance of the biblical stories 

1796
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:24,994
from beginning to end.
And also engage in a dialogue with 

1797
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:28,143
intelligent and careful and thoughtful 
moderate Muslims about how we might 

1798
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:32,254
bridge the gap between our two 
civilizations in a manner that would be 

1799
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:38,200
productive.
And so that's part of what I'm,

1800
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:42,580
that's what I'm aiming out utilizing the
resources that you,

1801
01:41:42,581 --> 01:41:43,414
people are partly providing me with as 
well as continuing to develop the 

1802
01:41:46,451 --> 01:41:48,120
youtube channel and,
and the,

1803
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,993
the biblical lectures will be taped by 
the same people who'd be doing my 

1804
01:41:51,161 --> 01:41:52,030
lectures.
And so,

1805
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,980
um,
that's part of,

1806
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:57,970
that's part of the upcoming plan over 
the next couple of years.

1807
01:41:57,971 --> 01:41:58,804
So I would say,
and that might be enough if I could do 

1808
01:42:00,131 --> 01:42:03,790
those two things extraordinarily well or
even well,

1809
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:05,530
hopefully I could do them 
extraordinarily well,

1810
01:42:05,531 --> 01:42:08,650
but if I could devote my efforts to 
doing that credibly,

1811
01:42:08,651 --> 01:42:10,660
that would be,
that would be really worth,

1812
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,130
that would be something really worth 
doing.

1813
01:42:12,670 --> 01:42:13,503
So thank you all and thank you for 
putting up with the technical glitches 

1814
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:18,970
and all of that.
And I'll,

1815
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,850
I'll get better at this as I go.
Uh,

1816
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:22,900
you know how it is when you first do 
something.

1817
01:42:22,901 --> 01:42:26,170
It's okay if you're a fool,
as long as you're not any more of a fool

1818
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:27,004
than you have to be,
and you get better at things by doing 

1819
01:42:29,291 --> 01:42:32,110
them somewhat badly to begin with.
So anyways,

1820
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:33,693
thanks very much.
I'll see some of you again in a month 

1821
01:42:35,260 --> 01:42:36,093
and,
uh,

1822
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:37,413
um,
over now and thanks to Julian very much 

1823
01:42:39,971 --> 01:42:42,730
for helping me sort this out and set it 
up good night.

1824
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:50,983
Hm.
