1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,290
Okay,

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,823
well we're going to continue our 
discussion of the big five traits today 

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,750
and I'm going to talk to you about 
openness and intelligence,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,833
roughly speaking.
So the first thing I want to do is put 

5
00:00:26,671 --> 00:00:27,504
them into context.
You need to understand where 

6
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,761
intelligence fits in the in the trade 
hierarchy structure and so we've,

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,713
we've looked at this before,
but you can break the big five into the 

8
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,764
big to plasticity and stability.
We'll start with stability here and 

9
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:46,524
stable people are conscientious,
high and stress tolerance or emotional 

10
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:54,720
stability or low in neuroticism,
depending on how you look at it and high

11
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,554
in agreeableness.
Then conscientiousness breaks down into 

12
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,324
industriousness and orderliness.
Neuroticism breaks down into volatility 

13
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,000
and withdrawal and agreeableness breaks 
down into politeness and compassion.

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,490
And then for the second major trait,
you have the big two trait.

15
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:18,600
You have plasticity and plasticity is 
made up of extraversion and openness and

16
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:21,180
those look like the reason they clumped 
together.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,583
The reason the first three clump 
together we think is because they're 

18
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,510
roughly associated with serotonergic 
function.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,853
Um,
and the reason the latter two clump 

20
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,560
together is because they're roughly 
associated with dopaminergic function.

21
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:35,394
And the dopamine system mediates 
exploratory behavior in the face of the 

22
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:41,970
unknown,
but it also mediates positive emotion.

23
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,143
And,
and it's because in order to move 

24
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,414
forward into the unknown,
it isn't that you have to experience 

25
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,464
positive emotion.
It's that the emotion you experience 

26
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,254
when you're motivated to move forward 
into the unknown and explore is a 

27
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,374
positive emotion and positive emotion is
very much also associated with 

28
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,604
interaction in the social environment.
And maybe that's because a tremendous 

29
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,624
amount of what you're doing in the 
social environment is essentially 

30
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:07,530
exploratory behavior,
right?

31
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:08,364
Because for example,
when you're communicating with people 

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,580
that's primarily exploratory behavior,
um,

33
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,050
so it's not surprising that the 
circuitry overlaps and in that manner,

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,693
um,
openness is the one we're going to 

35
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,720
concentrate on most particularly today.

36
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,883
And it is openness to experience 
technically and it seems to break down 

37
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,310
into intellect and openness proper,
which is,

38
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,910
it's in its intellect,
which is interested in ideas,

39
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,220
maybe facility with ideas and to 
openness,

40
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:40,380
which is more like creativity.
That's,

41
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,214
that's now.
You can't divide them into interest in 

42
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,650
ideas and creativity.
So precisely because they,

43
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,800
they overlapped to a,
to a great degree.

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,963
But there is,
there is reason for differentiating 

45
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,660
between them.
So for example,

46
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,703
women are about a third of a standard 
deviation higher than men in openness 

47
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,454
slash creativity and men are about a 
third of a standard deviation higher 

48
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,590
than women in interest in ideas and 
intellect.

49
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,100
And that's actually quite a substantial 
difference within a trait.

50
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,710
That's when the two traits are so highly
correlated.

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,940
So there's reason to do the,
to do the fractionation.

52
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,403
So anyways,
so we're going to concentrate on 

53
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,154
openness today and the reason that I'm 
presenting the trait description first 

54
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,434
rather than moving immediately into say 
Iq and creativity is because it's 

55
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,760
reasonable to.

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,893
It's useful to know that you can take 
intelligence and put it in the big five 

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,723
taxonomy and you can actually measure 
intelligence a lot more accurately with 

58
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,374
an Iq test and perhaps also with a 
creativity test than you can with the 

59
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,424
self report.
Personality tests that relies on 

60
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:47,651
adjectives,
you know,

61
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:51,820
because I could ask you guys how smart 
are you on a scale of one to seven?

62
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:54,190
And that would be roughly correlated 
with your Iq.

63
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,200
But if I really wanted to know how smart
you were,

64
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,363
roughly speaking,
it would be much better to give you an 

65
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,344
Iq test and if I was wanting to know how
creative you are rather than asking you 

66
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,350
how creative you are and getting you to 
report,

67
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,210
even though there would be some accuracy
in that,

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,253
it would be better actually to give you 
some of the different tests of 

69
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,310
creativity that we'll talk about today.

70
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,503
Now,
the weird thing about the big five are 

71
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:19,780
one of the weird things about it is that
we don't have great tests for the traits

72
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,530
independently of self report for almost 
all of the traits.

73
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
So for example,
one of the things that I've been trying 

74
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:27,934
to do in my lab for the last five years 
is to find some sort of laboratory task 

75
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:37,240
that conscientious people do better on 
or unconscientious people do worse on.

76
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,060
And you'd think that would be simple 
because conscientiousness,

77
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,894
for example,
is a very good predictor of longterm 

78
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,930
life success.
Success.

79
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,570
It's also a very good predictor of 
university grades.

80
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,510
It's not as good as Iq,
but it's still a good predictor.

81
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,763
But we have had one insanely difficult 
time trying to find a non self report 

82
00:04:56,891 --> 00:04:58,590
test that associate that,
that,

83
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,090
that actually predicts 
conscientiousness.

84
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,610
So much appreciated.
Yes.

85
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,540
No,
it's neuroticism.

86
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,450
Neuroticism is associated with being 
more self aware and it's actually,

87
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:15,284
it loads on negative emotions,
so being self conscious as associated 

88
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,424
with being high in negative emotion.
I mean you can assess neuroticism using 

89
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:27,100
tests that that asks you about anxiety 
and emotional pain or depression,

90
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:30,970
but that's also not much different than 
than than self report.

91
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,013
Anyways,
we're gonna concentrate on openness 

92
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:33,844
today and we're going to concentrate 
both on creativity and intelligence and 

93
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,683
there's actually almost nothing in 
psychology that's more contentious 

94
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,560
generally speaking.
Then the investigations into the,

95
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,453
the technical or the what,
the set of skills and abilities that 

96
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,320
falls under trade,
openness.

97
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,154
And the reason for that,
and this is especially the case with 

98
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,823
intelligence,
is that intelligence is actually quite 

99
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,823
measurable.
We've been able to measure it since 

100
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,070
roughly the beginning of the,
of the,

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,100
of the 20th century.
Been a originated the first,

102
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,323
I would say reliable and valid Iq tests 
and they've been used quite extensively 

103
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:16,170
for a long period of time and ICU.

104
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,100
I'll tell you what Iq is as we go 
through this,

105
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:19,934
but there isn't anything that social 
scientists have been able to measure 

106
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:27,911
more successfully than Iq and there's 
nothing that social or very little one.

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,653
There's one exception.
The relationship between income 

108
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,734
inequality and male homicide is a power 
more powerful relationship than the 

109
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,223
relationship between Iq,
say in general life success or Icu and 

110
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,470
general school success.
It's.

111
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,304
It's even a little stronger than the 
relationship between Iq and the rate at 

112
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:51,140
which you learn something new,
but other than that,

113
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:55,940
it's pretty slim pickings and so we're 
gonna walk through very carefully how Iq

114
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,770
his Iq tests are created and formulated 
and exactly what it is that they measure

115
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:01,604
and why and will equate that to some 
degree to creativity and also 

116
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,924
differentiated from creativity as well.
Making the assumption that the aspects 

117
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:10,700
of openness,
intellect,

118
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,534
and openness proper are the proper 
aspects and that they're usefully 

119
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,273
differentiated.

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,833
So the first thing that you might want 
to consider is that the world is a very 

121
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,214
complicated place.
Now we've talked about this before and 

122
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,000
the way that you handled this way too 
much complexity for you to handle in its

123
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,070
in its entirety.
So for example,

124
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,143
in a room like this,
there's an endless number of phenomena 

125
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,184
that you could focus your attention on 
right from the sort of macro phenomenon 

126
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,504
which would be the overall say,
color or appearance of the room to the 

127
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:44,804
micro phenomena,
which would be the details at the 

128
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:47,714
highest level of detail that you're able
to perceive that litter the landscape 

129
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:52,460
anywhere.
And so one of the problems that you have

130
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:56,300
to solve when you're operating in the 
world is how you perceive the world.

131
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,433
And we do that in part by making,
I would say that we perceive low 

132
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:01,784
resolution representations of the world 
and we also confuse those with the 

133
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:04,970
world.

134
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,803
So when I'm looking at you,
I'm really looking at a low represent 

135
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,730
what I perceived consciously as a low 
representation,

136
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,190
low resolution representations of you.
Right?

137
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,260
I only see the front of you to begin 
with.

138
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:19,640
I only see your surface and in some 
sense,

139
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,623
you know,
I even perceive you in some sense as a 

140
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,390
more or less uniform color.
It's hard to tell exactly what color his

141
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,930
skin is.
It's sort of a light pink,

142
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:29,190
roughly speaking,
but my,

143
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,173
my perception is fairly is fairly.
I don't know a better way of putting it 

144
00:08:33,561 --> 00:08:34,394
than low resolution and I seem to 
perceive you at the level of resolution 

145
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:42,710
that's sufficient,
the the lowest resolution.

146
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,993
That's sufficient to facilitate our 
interactions because I don't want to 

147
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:51,190
clutter up my perceptions of you when 
we're just talking with excess details,

148
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:53,210
so there's lots of things about you I 
don't need to see.

149
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,043
I certainly can't see any of your micro 
below the below the phenomenal level 

150
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,304
like I can't tell without tremendous 
further investigation what you're made 

151
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:04,320
of biologically.
For example,

152
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:05,154
and I certainly can't perceive the 
networks of society that you're engaged 

153
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:11,760
in your family or the other sorts of 
networks that you're embedded in.

154
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,623
I see you here now,
the front of you at low resolution and 

155
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:17,394
you can tell that to some degree,
and we've talked about this before 

156
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,334
because if you see say animated movies 
that use very low resolution 

157
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:29,040
representations of people like South 
Park's a really good example because the

158
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:34,041
imitate or the animation in South Park's
very iconic and and and simple.

159
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,180
It actually makes almost no difference 
to following the story and so that shows

160
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,490
you how iconic your perception really 
is,

161
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,510
can be replaced by very simple icons and
you instantly adapt to that,

162
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,344
you know,
and so we can go and see the lego movie 

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,240
Batman Lego movie for example,
and the fact that it's Batman,

164
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,074
which is an abstraction to begin with 
and then it's made out of Legos is 

165
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:55,950
almost irrelevant to following the plot.

166
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,393
So some people have compared our 
perceptions to the user interface on a 

167
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,834
computer.
You know when you're interacting with 

168
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,020
your computer,
you don't really interact,

169
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,913
so to speak with the computer.
There are iconic representations on the 

170
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:11,490
screen of the computer that you interact
with and those represent,

171
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,850
obviously they share some functional 
relationship with what's going on in the

172
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:15,684
computer,
but mostly they're there so that you 

173
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,863
using your perceptual structures can 
interact with the computer in a manner 

174
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:23,850
that's easy for extremely intelligent 
apes,

175
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,283
roughly speaking now,
so one of the problems that you have to 

176
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:28,254
solve in the world because it's so full 
of detail and so complex is how do you 

177
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,680
actually see the world?
How do you actually perceive it,

178
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,843
and it isn't really self evident that 
that's a problem because you think when 

179
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,540
you look at the world that it just 
presents itself to you,

180
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,890
but it's a tremendously complicated 
problem and that's partly why developing

181
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,873
artificial intelligence systems that can
actually see the world and act in it in 

182
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,494
any real way has proved to be a much 
more difficult problem than people had 

183
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,290
originally suppose.

184
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,143
Because you know,
we were told maybe from the early 

185
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:04,461
sixties onwards that such things as 
speech to text or object recognition,

186
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,800
recognition or robots that could operate
in the world.

187
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:10,140
We're only two or three years away and 
well,

188
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,960
I mean we're in.
We're in a situation now where there are

189
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,794
some fairly complicated robots built,
but they're still really in their 

190
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,034
nascent form and it's because perceiving
the world and then figuring out how to 

191
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:20,244
act and it turns out to be a much more 
complicated problem than we originally 

192
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,174
thought because the borders between 
things are not self evident and what 

193
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:28,764
level of resolution you should be 
perceiving things at for say maximal 

194
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:34,350
functional utility is also not self 
evident.

195
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,420
It's also tied up very strangely and in 
ways we don't understand with the nature

196
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:40,710
of your embodiment,
you know.

197
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,544
So for example,
we tend to see things that are handy 

198
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,803
because we can pick them up and 
manipulate them and we can make use of 

199
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:48,510
them.

200
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,343
And so to some degree our brains are 
evolved to make the world manifest 

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,460
itself to us in a set of discrete,
usable tools.

202
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
That's,
that's a reasonable way of thinking 

203
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:00,154
about it.
And there are discrete and usable 

204
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,330
because we have a certain kind of 
biological platform,

205
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:05,164
you know,
because we have hands and mouths and 

206
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,500
because we walk in a bipedal manner,
then it's logical for us to break up the

207
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,980
world in a manner that makes operating 
in this body maximally useful.

208
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,993
But that doesn't mean that there's a 
straightforward one to one relationship 

209
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:21,880
between our perceptions of things and 
the things themselves.

210
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,250
Quite the contrary.
And that's partly,

211
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,450
of course we know that because with any 
perceptible object,

212
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:32,830
like I could conceptualize you as one 
thing for all sorts of purposes.

213
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,360
But if I'm trying to solve a complex 
problem in relationship to you,

214
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,480
it's going to be very difficult to 
determine how to conceptualize you.

215
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,343
So if I'm,
if you come to me because you're 

216
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,690
suffering from a psychological problem 
of some sort,

217
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,310
then I have to figure out,
you know,

218
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,480
is it organic?
Is it,

219
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,314
is there's actually something 
physiological wrong with you and I need 

220
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:55,930
to know what level of analysis I would 
probably conceptualize you out.

221
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,010
Is it psychological?
Is it.

222
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,040
And if it's psychological,
is it functional?

223
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:00,874
Like do you lack the skills or do you 
lack the ability to apply the skills or 

224
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,320
is there something really going wrong 
with your family,

225
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,520
or maybe it's even a reflection of an 
overarching sociological problem.

226
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:10,840
We know,
for example,

227
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,780
that when the unemployment rate goes up 
one percent,

228
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:16,330
psychiatric hospitalizations go up five 
percent,

229
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,610
and so then you might ask,
well,

230
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:19,360
you know,
if you're.

231
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,130
If there's a huge rise in depression and
anxiety across the population and at the

232
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:27,130
same time there's a huge increase in 
unemployment.

233
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,130
You have to ask yourself what level of 
perception would best be suited to solve

234
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,004
that problem because it isn't self 
evident that it's psychological at the 

235
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:38,140
level of the individual.
Anyways.

236
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,410
My point is is that perception is a very
difficult problem and so now here's.

237
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:46,120
Here's something interesting.
You can think about this for a minute.

238
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,540
I went and saw an autistic woman speak 
at one point.

239
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,990
Her name was temple grandin.
She's really worth looking up.

240
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:55,000
Temple Grandin is a very interesting 
person.

241
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,820
She's very seriously autistic when she 
was a child,

242
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,290
but her mother and her worked her out of
it so that she could be,

243
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,720
she's very functional.
She works as a professor,

244
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,260
I don't remember where it's in the 
midwest somewhere now.

245
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,603
She's famous,
not only be for being a highly 

246
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:12,634
functional autistic person who talks a 
fair bit about what it's like to be 

247
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,174
autistic,
but also for designing slaughterhouses 

248
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,350
across the United States.

249
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,183
And the reason she can do that as far as
she's concerned is because she thinks 

250
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:27,640
she thinks like an animal thinks.
And so she doesn't.

251
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,560
And she's identified maybe at least part
of what the core problem is with autism.

252
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,723
So she talk,
I heard her at was in Arizona and it 

253
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:37,640
was,
uh,

254
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,940
was a really,
uh,

255
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,093
entrancing talk she sewed,
she showed some really interesting 

256
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:43,294
pictures of animals.
So what she's done is she's redesigned 

257
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,940
slaughter houses so that when the 
animals enter the slaughterhouse,

258
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,380
they go into like a spiral.
Basically.

259
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,450
They can't see what's around the corner 
and the walls are high,

260
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,520
so they're not distracted by anything 
outside.

261
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:57,560
So one of the things she showed,
for example,

262
00:14:57,561 --> 00:14:58,394
was a bunch of cows going through a 
standard sequence of of gates 

263
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:03,344
essentially and off to the side there 
was a windmill spinning and the cows 

264
00:15:06,111 --> 00:15:09,290
would stop because the windmill,
they didn't understand what the windmill

265
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,124
was and they'd stop or showed other 
pictures where cows were going down a 

266
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,700
pathway to and there was a coke can 
sitting in the middle of the pathway and

267
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:17,534
the cows would all stop because they 
didn't know what to do with it or she 

268
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:21,194
had another picture of cows out in the 
middle of the field all surrounding a 

269
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,064
briefcase and they are all looking at 
the briefcase and the cows didn't like 

270
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:30,530
anything that shouldn't be there and had
a hard time mapping it.

271
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,040
Now she said,
here,

272
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,760
here's a little exercise she did.
She said,

273
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,210
think of a church.
Okay,

274
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,150
so maybe you think you imagine a child's
drawing of a church.

275
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,930
It's like your standard house,
like a pen tag Pentagon,

276
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,000
right.
Which is basically how children draw the

277
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:47,834
front of a house with a steeple on top 
and maybe a cross on top of it or 

278
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:52,610
something like that,
which actually isn't at church.

279
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,533
It's an icon of a church.
And you think about how children draw 

280
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,800
houses too.
Pentagon,

281
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,970
rectangle.
What is a trapezoid chimney?

282
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,400
Almost always with smoke,
which is quite interesting.

283
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:05,234
It's.
I don't know where kids get that 

284
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,004
exactly,
but they almost always draw a chimney 

285
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:11,660
with smoke even though chimneys with 
smoke aren't that common anymore.

286
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,750
But anyways,
you know,

287
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,880
you can see what a child's picture of a 
house looks like in your imagination.

288
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,983
One of the things that you might want to
think about is that is not a picture of 

289
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:21,560
a house at all,
right?

290
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,310
It's an iconic representation that's 
Kinda like a hero cliff because no house

291
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:26,144
looks like that.
And then you think about how a child 

292
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,450
will draw a person circle,
stick,

293
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,021
stick,
stick,

294
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:30,854
stick,
stick.

295
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,840
And you show it to somebody to go,
that's a person.

296
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:34,280
It's like,
really?

297
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,720
It looks nothing like a person,
right?

298
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,083
I mean you.
You immediately recognize it as a 

299
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,600
person,
but it looks nothing like a person.

300
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,153
Well,
what grand and said was that when she 

301
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,000
thinks of a church,
she has to think of a church.

302
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,893
She's seen.
She can't take the set of all churches 

303
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,420
in abstract out an iconic representation
and use that to represent the set of all

304
00:16:56,421 --> 00:16:57,310
churches.
She has.

305
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,273
She gets fixated on a specific exemplar 
and she thinks that one of the problems 

306
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:03,794
with autistic people and they have a 
very difficult time developing language 

307
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:08,204
by the way,
is that they can't abstract out a 

308
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,310
generalized representation across a set 
of entities.

309
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,143
They can't abstract and then they end 
well and of course if you can abstract 

310
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:18,614
and it's also very difficult to 
manipulate the abstractions and you see 

311
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:23,420
very strange behavior with autistic 
children for example.

312
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,254
So they don't like people and that's 
because people don't stay in their 

313
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:32,150
perceptual boxes like a human being is a
very difficult thing to perceive because

314
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,030
we're always shifting around and moving 
and doing different things.

315
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:36,890
Like we don't stay in our categorical 
box.

316
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,820
Autistic people have real trouble with 
other people,

317
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,280
but they also have trouble,
so for example,

318
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:46,250
if you're autistic,
child gets accustomed to your kitchen,

319
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,620
let's say,
and you move a chair,

320
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,570
then it especially if they're severely 
autistic,

321
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,404
they'll have an absolute fit about it 
because you think kitchen with chair 

322
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:57,114
moved,
they think completely different place 

323
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,003
because they can't abstract the 
constancy is across the different 

324
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,560
situations and represent them 
abstractly.

325
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,840
So I made this little diagram.

326
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,110
I made this little diagram here to kind 
of give you a sense of what you might be

327
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:16,944
doing when you're abstracting 
perceptually and so you could say think 

328
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:24,210
about something that's that complicated.
It's sort of my model of how complex the

329
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,430
world is,
but the world is a lot more complex than

330
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,264
that,
but the world is made out of everything 

331
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:30,384
is made out of littler things and those 
littler things are made out of littler 

332
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,640
things and so forth and those things are
nested inside.

333
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:36,474
Bigger things and so forth.
And where you perceive on that level of 

334
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,140
abstraction is somewhat arbitrary.
It has to be bounded by your,

335
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,303
by your goals.
That's the other thing is that your 

336
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:49,710
perceptual structures are determined by 
the goals that you have at hand.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,833
I mean some of that,
that's not completely true because your 

338
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,960
perceptual systems also have 
limitations,

339
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:55,170
right?

340
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,050
There's things you can't see or hear 
even if you need to.

341
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,740
So there are limitations built in,
but within that set of limitations,

342
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:02,574
you're still trying to tune your 
perceptions to your motivated goals and 

343
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:06,864
that's also very useful to think about 
when you're trying to understand 

344
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:12,600
artificial intelligence because for 
human beings,

345
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,510
without goals,
there's no perception because there's no

346
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:16,344
filtering mechanism that you can use to 
determine the level of resolution at 

347
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:20,960
which you perceive.
Anyway.

348
00:19:20,961 --> 00:19:21,794
So there's the,
there's a thing made of smaller things 

349
00:19:24,481 --> 00:19:26,580
which are made out of smaller things and
it's so.

350
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,600
It's kind of my iconic representation of
the complexity of the world and then you

351
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:31,440
could think,
well,

352
00:19:31,441 --> 00:19:34,290
what is this?
How can you see this object?

353
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,340
And I think if you just look at it,
you can detect.

354
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,293
So like a necker cube,
you know those cubes that are line 

355
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:43,910
drawings that you can see the front of 
it.

356
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,840
Then it'll flip to the back.
Have you seen those?

357
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,093
So this is kind of necker cube like or 
at least it is for me in that when I 

358
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:53,580
look at it,
my perceptions play around with it.

359
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:54,414
Sometimes I focus on the kind of cross 
like shape in the metal and sometimes I 

360
00:19:58,651 --> 00:19:59,484
can see these other lines and then 
sometimes I'll focus on that square and 

361
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,293
sometimes I can see the little dots 
there are maybe one daughter and my 

362
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,104
perceptions are going like this,
trying to fit a pattern to it and you 

363
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,660
can kind of detect that when you're 
watching it.

364
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,763
And so I would say,
well you have the options of perceiving 

365
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:21,150
this in its full complexity or you can 
simplify it essentially.

366
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,130
There's lots of ways you can simplify 
it,

367
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:26,820
but some of them are laid out there.
So you take the complex complex thing,

368
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,550
you make a low resolution representation
of it,

369
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,350
so that's rough.

370
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,960
That's the rough area that all those 
dots occupy,

371
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,940
that's the rough area broken down to its
most fundamental quadrants.

372
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,790
That might be how you would look at it 
if,

373
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,250
if this was a map of an orchard and you 
were trying to walk from south to north,

374
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,770
that would be a useful representation.
This,

375
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,550
this and this.
That's the.

376
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,420
That's the highest level of resolution 
that you can perceive this object at.

377
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,240
That's lower resolution than the object 
itself.

378
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,480
So the first issue is how should you 
look at things?

379
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,613
Well,
that's a problem that intelligence has 

380
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:04,864
to solve.
So that's one of the problems that 

381
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,800
intelligence goes after.
And then I think what happens is we have

382
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:09,634
the thing in itself and then we simplify
it with a perception and that's an 

383
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:15,574
iconic representation.
And then we nail the iconic 

384
00:21:17,951 --> 00:21:18,784
representation with a word and that's 
how we compress the world's complexity 

385
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:23,590
into something that we can manage.

386
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,663
We take the complex thing,
make it into an icon and represent the 

387
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:31,270
icon with a word.
And then when I throw you the word,

388
00:21:31,271 --> 00:21:32,104
so to speak,
you decompose it into the icon and then 

389
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,070
decompose it even further into the 
thing.

390
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,113
If you can't,
if you know the icon and you know the 

391
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,560
thing.
And so then we can use shorthand,

392
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,423
right,
because you have representational 

393
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,100
structures of Soda,
why?

394
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,880
And I'm just tossing you markers about 
your representational structures and you

395
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:49,714
can unfold them and that's what you do 
when you're reading a novel because the 

396
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:57,790
novel comes alive in your imagination,
in your own idiosyncratic way,

397
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:01,750
and it wouldn't if you didn't understand
the references of the novel,

398
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,763
right?
The novelist has to assume that your 

399
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:05,344
basic perceptual structures and your 
intuitions and your instincts are 

400
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:09,094
basically the same as his or hers 
because otherwise they have to assume 

401
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:12,784
that because otherwise they would be 
lost in an infinite regress of 

402
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:16,150
explanation.

403
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:19,780
So it's problematic.
Often.

404
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,300
For example,
if you start reading Victoria novels,

405
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,740
you may find that it takes awhile to get
into them because the presuppositions,

406
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,530
the expectations are slightly different 
and so is the language.

407
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:33,380
You have to update the representations,
but anyway,

408
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:35,380
so that's roughly as far as I'm 
concerned,

409
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:38,680
that's roughly a representation of what 
intelligence is doing in the world.

410
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,523
It's a big part of it.
It's how in the world do you look at 

411
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:46,510
things so that you can use them for the 
purposes that you need to use them for,

412
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,110
and then the next problem that 
intelligence has to solve,

413
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:50,944
which is related,
is once you've got the perceptual 

414
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,704
landscape sorted out,
how do you abstractly represent the 

415
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,000
action patterns that you're going to 
implement in the world?

416
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,270
So it's how do you perceive where you 
are now,

417
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,753
how do you perceive where you're going 
and how do you construct op and then 

418
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:11,434
implement strategies that enable you to 
move from where you are to where you're 

419
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:14,740
going.

420
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,000
So it's a continual process of mapping 
and movement.

421
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,310
And so it's.
It's,

422
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,390
it's navigation.
That's what we're doing in the world all

423
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,150
the time is navigating through it 
because we're mobile creatures.

424
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,253
We're navigating through it attempting 
to make the world manifest itself in 

425
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:31,114
accordance with our wishes.
And that's the fundamental problem that 

426
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:38,311
intelligence has to solve and animals 
have their perceptions to rely on.

427
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,323
But we have our perceptions and our 
ability to abstract from those 

428
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:48,721
perceptions multiple and then to 
abstract finally until into language.

429
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,083
So we live in a very abstracted world 
and it also means that we can learn the 

430
00:23:54,591 --> 00:23:57,650
lesson in one place and generalize it 
across many other places,

431
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:58,484
which is also something that animals 
have a hard time doing because they 

432
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,950
don't know how to do that perceptual,
initial,

433
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,410
perceptual generalization.
So,

434
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,830
okay,
so then the question might be,

435
00:24:13,831 --> 00:24:16,080
well,
if intelligence has to solve the problem

436
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:21,081
of how to perceive in and perceive and 
navigate within the world towards ends,

437
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,240
towards in order to fulfill,
in order to,

438
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,210
uh,
to make the world manifest what it needs

439
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:33,060
to manifest so that you can maintain 
yourself and stay alive.

440
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,670
What ends is it orienting itself 
towards.

441
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:38,010
And I think that's a good way of 
thinking about the traits,

442
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,233
the traits,
the traits motivate the perceptual 

443
00:24:41,161 --> 00:24:42,750
frame.
And so you might think that,

444
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,823
well,
extroverted people are after social 

445
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:46,764
success and you can understand why that 
would be because social success brings 

446
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:51,024
with it all sorts of rewards.
Social failure brings costs and you 

447
00:24:54,541 --> 00:24:57,860
could also understand why that would 
frighten you away from it.

448
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,703
And social success also requires the 
expenditure of effort and introverted 

449
00:25:02,221 --> 00:25:05,460
people seem to be much more conservative
in a sense,

450
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:06,983
in terms of expanding social,
expending energy socially and I suppose 

451
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:13,590
they're protecting themselves to some 
degree against the possibility of social

452
00:25:13,591 --> 00:25:14,250
failure.

453
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,083
We don't really know.
We know more about how extroverts in 

454
00:25:17,821 --> 00:25:20,910
some sense,
how and why extroverts orient themselves

455
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:24,600
the way they do in the world.
We're not so sure about introverts.

456
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,903
What it is that what the,
what the proper landscape is for 

457
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:31,860
introverts.
I can show you a word cloud.

458
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:32,694
I'll do that at some point that 
introverts that were generated from 

459
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:40,161
introverts on facebook and they seem to 
be into fantasy and gaming a lot and and

460
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,873
I don't know why that is exactly because
the fantasy element should be more 

461
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:49,950
locally localized in openness.
But the introverted types,

462
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,873
I mean I suppose they're the people that
are on the Big Bang theory roughly 

463
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:54,624
speaking,
you know,

464
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:55,743
they seem to be the introverted types 
and but we don't understand that much 

465
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:00,234
about them and exactly how it is that 
they're orienting themselves in the 

466
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:04,110
world.
People are high in neuroticism,

467
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,180
are oriented towards security and 
safety,

468
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,570
agreeable people versus disagreeable 
people are oriented,

469
00:26:09,571 --> 00:26:12,000
say towards cooperation versus 
competition.

470
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,050
Conscientious people are oriented 
towards order,

471
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,450
duty,
obligation and implementation and open.

472
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:22,340
People are oriented towards abstraction 
in both idiation,

473
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,000
landy and representation,
and so those are also to some degree,

474
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:29,460
you might also think about those as 
value systems,

475
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:33,240
right,
because what you value is definitely not

476
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,850
only what you pursue,
that's too narrow a view.

477
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,043
Value is also what you perceive and 
pursue and so thinking about these 

478
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:44,880
things as this entire frame of I think 
is a much better way of doing it.

479
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,743
We talked about this earlier,
this sort of structure earlier as a 

480
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:48,714
micro personality and I mentioned that 
determination of micro personalities by 

481
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,163
fundamental underlying biological 
systems like defensive aggression and 

482
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:58,764
sexual sexual
desire and hunger and thirst and so 

483
00:27:04,441 --> 00:27:07,260
forth.
Those are all systems that can grab your

484
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,094
perceptions,
make you look at the world in a certain 

485
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:11,184
way,
make you pursue something else in a 

486
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,374
certain way,
and prime action responses that are in 

487
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,130
keeping with all of that.

488
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,403
The traits seem to be something like 
higher order agglomerations of those 

489
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,124
more fundamental biological motivations.
Although we don't quite understand the 

490
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,730
relationship between the underlying 
biology and the traits,

491
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,560
we're starting to sort it out so we 
know,

492
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,394
for example,
if you look at the function of the 

493
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:34,464
hypothalamus,
the hypothalamus regulates the basic 

494
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,350
biological motivations that I just 
outlined,

495
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,483
but it's also the place where the 
exploratory systems find their ultimate 

496
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,893
physiological grounding and openness and
extroversion seemed to be variant 

497
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:50,634
manifestations of the exploratory 
impulse and that's grounded in the 

498
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,983
Hypothalamus,
so we're starting to be able to put the 

499
00:27:56,581 --> 00:28:00,190
traits to sort of nail the traits down 
to their underlying biology.

500
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,660
With regards to neuroticism.
Well,

501
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,613
if you're high in neuroticism,
you're more sensitive to anxiety and 

502
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,970
that's regulated at least in part by the
hippocampus and generated in part by the

503
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:14,100
Amygdala.
There's another part of the brain called

504
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:14,934
the periodic with aqua ductal gray that 
seems to be associated with the 

505
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:22,080
experience of pain and pain is quite a 
complex phenomena.

506
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,230
Depression is pain like grief is pain,
like social isolation is pain.

507
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,074
Like disappointment is pain,
like there's anxiety components to that 

508
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:33,810
too,
and so neuroticism seems to be something

509
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:37,980
like threshold for activation in those 
negative emotions systems.

510
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,110
So if you're higher in neuroticism,
one unit of uncertainty might produce,

511
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,500
let's say three units of 
psychophysiological response.

512
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:47,334
Whereas if you're lower in neuroticism,
one unit of uncertainty might produce 

513
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:52,320
one unit of psychophysiological 
response.

514
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,710
It's hard,
obviously that's a simplified Schemata,

515
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:56,544
but there's variability because if 
something unexpected or threatening 

516
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,074
happens to you,
it isn't obvious how upset you should 

517
00:29:03,271 --> 00:29:06,270
get one answer,
what might be a brush it off,

518
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,170
it's nothing.
Now.

519
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:08,004
Their answer might be it's a bloody 
catastrophe and often when something 

520
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,084
uncertain or threatening occurs,
you don't have enough information at 

521
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:19,270
your disposal to make a full 
determination of the potential import of

522
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:22,020
this circumstance,
especially if it's uncertain.

523
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,090
And so then you have to guess at how 
upset you should be and where you are on

524
00:29:27,091 --> 00:29:29,850
the normal distribution with regards to 
trait neuroticism.

525
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:34,500
Say that sort of determines what your 
guests on average is going to be.

526
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,480
So you know,
the other with conscientiousness say,

527
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,040
might say,
well how hard should you work?

528
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,840
Well,
that's a really difficult question.

529
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,674
If you're going to die tomorrow and then
you probably shouldn't work very hard 

530
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:48,664
today at all.
So one thing you might say is that the 

531
00:29:51,761 --> 00:29:52,594
degree to which you should work hard is 
dependent on your assumptions about the 

532
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:59,170
stability of the future.
We actually know this to be true because

533
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,910
if you put people in wildly uncertain 
circumstances,

534
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,090
they discount the future,
which is exactly what you should do,

535
00:30:07,091 --> 00:30:07,924
right?
It's only makes sense to store up goods 

536
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,193
for future consumption.
If the future is likely to be very 

537
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:15,730
similar to the past and the present.

538
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,800
You need a stable society for that and 
conscientiousness only works in a stable

539
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:24,250
society because all you do otherwise,
if you're piling up goods,

540
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:26,050
which is kind of what conscientious 
people do,

541
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,093
is leaving them there for the criminals 
to take or waiting for the next chaotic 

542
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:32,680
upheaval to wipe out everything that 
you've stored.

543
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,740
And so even conscientiousness is a kind 
of guests,

544
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,420
hardworking people say,
well,

545
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,990
you know,
sacrifice the present for the future.

546
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,853
That's great.
As long as the future is going to be 

547
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:43,624
there and you can predict it.
But if it's not going to be there and 

548
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:48,640
it's unpredictable,
then the right response is take what you

549
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,100
can take right now.
Well,

550
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:50,934
the getting's good.
Now obviously there are troubles with 

551
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,191
that too.
It,

552
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:55,990
I'm speaking,
you know,

553
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,093
I'm offering rough rules of thumb,
but I'm trying to provide you with some 

554
00:31:01,061 --> 00:31:01,894
indication of how and why these 
difference in value structures exist 

555
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,170
because there are applicable in 
different environments.

556
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,103
You know,
sometimes in a dangerous social 

557
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:11,644
environment,
it's not obvious that being an 

558
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:16,090
extroverted person is a good idea 
because extroverted people,

559
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:16,924
they stand out,
especially if they're extroverted and 

560
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:19,810
creative,
right?

561
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,170
Because not only are they noisy and 
dominant and assertive,

562
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,670
they're also colorful and flamboyant and
provocative.

563
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,890
Well,
that's great if you're in a society that

564
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:32,200
rewards that sort of thing.
But if you have,

565
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,650
you know,
if you're ruled by an authoritarian king

566
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,484
who wants absolutely no threat 
whatsoever to his stability ever than 

567
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,780
dressing in gray and shutting the hell 
up is a really good survival tactic.

568
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,643
So the utility of the trait depends on 
the structure of the environment that 

569
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:52,234
surrounds it.
And that's why there's variability in 

570
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:54,514
traits.
And so you have to be careful when 

571
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:57,784
you're thinking about it from a strict 
scientific perspective to make the 

572
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,294
assumption that positioning at any place
on the normal distribution is 

573
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:08,230
preferable,
preferable to positioning anywhere else.

574
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,150
Now,
one exception to that maybe might be icu

575
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,763
because one of the things that you can 
see an icu with Iq is that people with 

576
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:18,604
higher Iq seemed to do better,
but that's also only true in complex 

577
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:22,534
societies.
And then there's another problem that 

578
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:27,790
seems to emerge with Iq and I don't know
exactly what to make of this,

579
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:30,190
but we know that as women's Iq 
increases,

580
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,503
the probability that they're going to be
to remain without a mate also increases 

581
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,560
because women tend to mate across or up 
dominance hierarchies.

582
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:40,100
And so

583
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,933
if you're a woman with an Iq of 130,
then you've already eliminated about 95 

584
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,810
percent of the men.
And that's only using one criteria.

585
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:48,644
That's just straight intelligence.
And so there also might be limitations 

586
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,154
to the,
to the utility of intelligence with 

587
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:57,290
regards to reproduction that we don't 
really understand very well yet.

588
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,200
So
anyway,

589
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:02,690
so you get the point.
So there's these underlying,

590
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,890
I kind of put down to value structures.
They're capitalize on social groups.

591
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:08,940
That would be an extroverted value 
structure,

592
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:09,774
say maintain order.
That would be a a conscientious 

593
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:13,934
strategy.
Conscientious people are going to want 

594
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,950
to maintain order because they don't 
want things to shift across time because

595
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:22,610
if they shift too much across time,
then the things that have been stored up

596
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:25,520
for the future start to become 
increasingly irrelevant.

597
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,310
There's lots of other reasons to 
maintain order as well,

598
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:29,150
but that's one of them.

599
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,763
So all right,
so that your cognitive ability allows 

600
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:37,970
you to do modeling.
Now this is where human beings have have

601
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:42,971
leapt ahead of their competition.
So an animal animals can think,

602
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,020
but it isn't exactly obvious how they 
think.

603
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,363
They think strategically.
I think they think the same way that 

604
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,170
children think in some sense when 
they're playing with Legos,

605
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:55,880
when they're not thinking about the 
Legos.

606
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,800
You know when they're,
when they're just moving them around.

607
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:58,933
We know of like if you watch a smart 
Predator group like lions go after a 

608
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,080
target or watched chimpanzees hunt down 
a monkey,

609
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,200
you can see intelligence at work because
hunting behavior is very,

610
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,330
very complicated.
Obviously,

611
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,164
you know,
especially if you're chasing something 

612
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:13,724
intelligent,
but there isn't that level of abstract 

613
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,770
representation.
So whereas,

614
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,640
so let's look at this.
So here's,

615
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,850
here's a,
here's a picture of the,

616
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,450
of the human brain with someone facing 
this way,

617
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,200
right?

618
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,070
So here's the,
here's the primary motor Cortex,

619
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,770
okay,
so you're using that to voluntarily move

620
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:38,180
your body.
Okay?

621
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:39,740
Now,
then I might say to you,

622
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:42,050
close your eyes and imagine doing 
something.

623
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,913
So just close your eyes and imagine 
picking up the cup that's in front of 

624
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,760
you and just visualize it.
Okay?

625
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:47,690
So then you might say,
well,

626
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,970
what part of your brain are you using 
then?

627
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,280
And the answer is used part of this 
part,

628
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,143
this part because it,
that's where you have your body 

629
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:57,320
represented,
but use this part here,

630
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,370
the premotor cortex to envision 
potential auctions.

631
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,683
Now what's happened is that this part of
the brain evolved out of this part and 

632
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:10,760
that makes sense because the first part 
is just how you would move,

633
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:11,594
but the second part is how you would 
think about how you would move and then 

634
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:17,150
the next part,
which is this part huge in human beings,

635
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,253
is how you would think about how you 
would think about how you would move so 

636
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,023
because that enables you to start to do 
extraordinary extraordinarily abstract 

637
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,390
planning.

638
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,650
So I could say,
well,

639
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,693
envision how you would pick up the cup 
and obviously that's something that 

640
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,164
you've separated out as a,
as a potential simulation from the 

641
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:36,884
actual action,
but we can talk about extraordinarily 

642
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:44,661
high level abstractions that have 
effects across multiple specific domains

643
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:49,671
way into the future and the more 
abstract that your manipulations become,

644
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:50,514
the more they seem to be moved away,
say from the primary motor cortex out 

645
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,970
into the prefrontal cortex.
Hierarchies of abstraction.

646
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,390
And the reason for that as this was Karl
Popper,

647
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,260
this is really,
really were thinking about why.

648
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:05,094
Think.
Let's say you're an animal and you act 

649
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:08,963
and it doesn't go very well.
Then you die while you've learned that 

650
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,280
the acting that way didn't work,
but now your dad,

651
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,430
so that's not that helpful.
Then you might think,

652
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,264
well,
maybe you should represent how you're 

653
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:24,201
going to act so you know here's a box 
with the snake in it and your Coffee Cup

654
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,640
is inside the box with the snake in it 
and I say to you,

655
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:30,150
imagine picking up the Coffee Cup and 
you imagine it and you think,

656
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,013
oh,
I'll pick up that coffee cup and then 

657
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,220
the snake will bite me and old die,
and so then you do.

658
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,040
You decide that implementing the 
strategy of picking up the Coffee Cup is

659
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:43,041
probably not a very good idea and so 
that stupid idea has to die and not you.

660
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,133
And so popper's idea was that the reason
that we developed the capacity to 

661
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:52,230
abstract was so that our stupid ideas 
could die instead of us.

662
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,483
And that's really it.
It's almost impossible to overstate how 

663
00:36:57,151 --> 00:37:00,000
brilliant and observation that is 
because what me,

664
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,090
what it means is that as a standard 
animal,

665
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:05,580
you would have to produce variance of 
yourself,

666
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,423
reproductively to go out into the world 
and try their hand at survival and 

667
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:11,274
that's pretty costly because you have to
produce all the biological replications 

668
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:15,834
of you,
so you could only probably manage that 

669
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,143
maybe 13 times if you really,
really worked at it and then then the 

670
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,520
cost of their failure is extraordinarily
high because they die while you can just

671
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:27,354
sit there and produced like 20 different
versions of you stay extending out over 

672
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:32,484
the next week or the next month and you 
can run them through a simulation and 

673
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:36,714
kill off all the ones that you don't 
regard as suitable and then only 

674
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:41,610
implement the successful ones.

675
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,623
Now you know,
you could debate about how accurate you 

676
00:37:45,451 --> 00:37:48,420
might be at doing that because it would 
depend on your knowledge,

677
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,463
but we do know that intelligent people 
tend to do better across the course of 

678
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,654
their life.
And so it does seem that there is some 

679
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:03,090
utility with regards to survival or at 
least with regards to positioning in the

680
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:03,924
dominance hierarchy,
which is somewhat of a proxy for 

681
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:06,744
survival and for reproductive success.
There's some association between that 

682
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,943
and the ability to abstract.
So we could say that part of the reason 

683
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:15,624
that people got smarter was because 
smarter people were more likely to stay 

684
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,660
alive.
Now,

685
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,670
I think it's more complicated than that 
too,

686
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:25,170
because I believe that human males and 
females are in an evolutionary cognitive

687
00:38:25,171 --> 00:38:27,360
arms race,
roughly speaking.

688
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:32,361
And so as men get trickier,
women get trickier to understand them.

689
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:34,500
And then as women get trickier to 
understand,

690
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:36,100
men get trickier to understand them.

691
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
And so we'd been chasing each other 
around this cortical expansion loop 

692
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,950
pretty much since we parted ways with 
our common,

693
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,800
with the ancestor that we had in common 
with chimpanzees.

694
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:49,960
And so that's roughly about 7 million 
years ago.

695
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,550
We've undergone a tremendous cortical 
expansion since then and there's lots of

696
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:57,760
reasons that have been propelling that.
So.

697
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,200
So what do you have to do with when 
you're thinking while you have to figure

698
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:03,034
out where you are and how to see that 
you have to figure out where you're 

699
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:09,220
going and what that should be,
and then you have to era.

700
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,223
You have to
generate and represent appropriate 

701
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,890
auction strategies and simulate those in
time and space.

702
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,240
And then one of the things that's worth 
noting is that what you do when you read

703
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,074
a story or when you tell a story,
and so part of the reason that you like 

704
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:26,944
to read stories is because that's 
exactly what story stories are telling 

705
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:29,650
you.

706
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,510
How someone is going about doing that.
And so then you can see how if you think

707
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:39,070
about preference for fiction,
which is actually part of openness,

708
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,293
preference for fiction,
that utility in fiction is that allows 

709
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:44,044
you to experience a plethora of 
simulated worlds and to embody the 

710
00:39:48,581 --> 00:39:49,414
consequences in abstraction without 
having to go through the trouble of 

711
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:53,104
doing that for yourself.
And we do know there's good empirical 

712
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:56,644
literature now showing some of it done 
by x students from my lab showing that 

713
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,580
reading fiction does improve your 
interpersonal intelligence,

714
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:04,414
for example,
your ability to understand the position 

715
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:07,234
of other people logically enough because
that's what you're doing when you're 

716
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:12,430
reading.
So okay,

717
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:13,264
so I'm trying to give you some 
background so that you can understand 

718
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,023
what it means to abstract and also why 
it's useful because we need that in 

719
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:24,700
order to move forward with the idea of 
intelligence.

720
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,830
So here we go.
Okay.

721
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:27,664
So that's how you act voluntarily and 
then that's how you represent how you 

722
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:32,164
act voluntarily.
And then that's how you think about how 

723
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:34,744
you represent acting voluntarily.
And the reason I'm telling you this is 

724
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,464
because it's useful to think about 
intelligence as abstract action because 

725
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:46,810
we tend to think about intelligence as 
abstract representation,

726
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,673
right?
Intelligence is the manipulation of 

727
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:53,080
facts or the understanding of facts,
but if you look at it neurologically,

728
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,153
I would say that's a miss apprehension 
because of the part of the brain that 

729
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:57,094
does the highest level of abstract 
thinking is actually something that's 

730
00:40:59,981 --> 00:41:02,370
emerged from the motor cortex.
Now you can.

731
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,160
That doesn't mean you don't use your 
intelligence to represent you do,

732
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,563
but the purpose of intelligence is to 
represent potential action patterns and 

733
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,480
we're embodied creatures and we need to 
move in the world,

734
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,670
and so that's the proper as far as I'm 
concerned.

735
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,800
That's the proper way to conceptualize 
intelligence.

736
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,950
So,
and here's a.

737
00:41:20,951 --> 00:41:21,784
here's a study I'll read you.
This study imagery and the premotor 

738
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,200
cortex.
Well,

739
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:27,034
studies on healthy subjects have shown a
partial overlap between the motor 

740
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:34,280
execution and motor imagery.
Neural circuits.

741
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,683
Few have investigated brain activity 
during motor imagery in stroke patients 

742
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:39,584
with Hemiparesis,
so a partial overlap between the motor 

743
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:43,850
execution and motor imagery neural 
circuits.

744
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,863
Well,
here's an interesting side consequences 

745
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:46,844
of that.
So let's say I'm thirsty and I look at 

746
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:52,304
that glass of water and part of what 
happens when I look at the glass of 

747
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:59,840
water is that my eyes activate this 
directly.

748
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,530
So you know I've already talked to you 
to some degree about how your eyes work,

749
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:04,341
right?
There's patterns,

750
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:08,800
they're out there in the world,
the patterns are mapped onto the retina,

751
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,590
so it's a pattern display
matrix,

752
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:13,963
and then that pattern is propagated 
along the optic nerve and then that 

753
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:17,414
pattern manifests itself in the visual 
cortex and then that pattern manifests 

754
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,283
itself in the motor cortex and it 
manifests itself in bodily movement or 

755
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,510
preparation for bodily movement.

756
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:30,560
Technically you don't need conscious 
imagery for that to happen.

757
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,790
Now that's something really useful to 
know is that your eyes can activate your

758
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,624
body without you being aware of the 
image because you think there's the 

759
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:39,831
world.
I see it.

760
00:42:39,831 --> 00:42:42,350
Then I determine how to act.
It's like yes,

761
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,830
but also no.
There's the world and seeing it prepares

762
00:42:45,831 --> 00:42:47,690
me to act.
Forget about the damn imagery.

763
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,943
So when I look at that Cup,
part of the part of the act of looking 

764
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:54,674
at it is preparing that gesture and 
that's especially the case if I also 

765
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,264
happened to be thirsty because if I'm 
thirsty the cups signifies something 

766
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:03,854
that I can use to quench my thirst,
which makes it a very different thing 

767
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,323
than what it is when it's empty or when 
I'm not thirsty so I'm not even gonna 

768
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,143
use the same part of my brain to 
perceive it because it's not the same 

769
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,950
thing in relationship to me.

770
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,110
So I look at it and then just just even 
just understanding the size of it,

771
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:22,243
there's not much difference between 
understanding the size of it and doing 

772
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,540
this.
So let's see how I got that.

773
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,033
So that's pretty good.
So that's my underneath when you will 

774
00:43:31,101 --> 00:43:31,934
ask,
well what does it mean to understand 

775
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,124
something?
Well that's what it means in so far as 

776
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:41,060
this is a cup because it could be tinder
for lighting a fire for example,

777
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,253
or something to stomp on to make a noise
in so far as it's a cup than 

778
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,000
understanding it means pattern.
Mapping it onto exactly this

779
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,270
and if I do that successfully,
then I get a little reward,

780
00:43:56,271 --> 00:43:57,104
a little hint,
a little kick of dopamine and that 

781
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,370
dopamine makes me feel a little bit 
better,

782
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,760
but it also bathes the neural tissue 
that I use to make that perceptual,

783
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:09,143
that to to to structure that perception 
and also to undertake that act and it 

784
00:44:14,841 --> 00:44:15,674
makes just a little bit more likely that
I'll see it that way and act that way 

785
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:21,290
and its presence again,
and that's how you learn,

786
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:21,590
right?

787
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:24,290
You lay out a perceptual scheme,
it's got a goal.

788
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,780
If the perceptual scheme and its 
associated action patterns make the goal

789
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:29,614
of manifest itself,
then you get a little burst of positive 

790
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,543
click.
Then that makes it those little neural 

791
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:36,414
circuits that instantiated that thrive a
little bit and get a little bit more 

792
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,930
predominant and that's also why you got 
to watch yourself.

793
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:46,200
If you're taking psychomotor stimulants 
like cocaine or alcohol,

794
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,034
even for that matter,
because they produce hyper learning and 

795
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:50,364
so you know,
I'll glance at that and maybe it'll 

796
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,780
trigger off a bit of thirst,
but if that was,

797
00:44:54,781 --> 00:44:58,350
if I was a cocaine addict and that was 
cocaine paraphernalia and I glanced at,

798
00:44:58,351 --> 00:44:59,340
it was like,
wow,

799
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,743
that thing that I've built in my head 
out of repeated know massive hits of 

800
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:08,640
dopamine is going to grab my perceptual 
structures and my auctions and bring me.

801
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:09,563
That'll be that craving,
which is an impulse to move forward 

802
00:45:12,061 --> 00:45:12,894
towards it.
You'll feel that instantiated in your 

803
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:16,140
body.
That's the craving.

804
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,393
It's very,
very difficult to get rid of that even 

805
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:19,943
if you're.
If you're a cocaine abuser and you've 

806
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:26,730
gone to a treatment center for several 
weeks and got over the worst of the,

807
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,350
at least initial parts of the elearning 
not to abuse the second you go back into

808
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:34,200
your natural environment and take a look
at the cues.

809
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,630
Bang.
Nothing will be right back there.

810
00:45:36,631 --> 00:45:37,464
Directing your action,
and what happens is when one of those 

811
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:42,390
perceptual systems comes up,
you can see this when you're hungry.

812
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,570
It suppresses all the other potential 
perceptual systems.

813
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,580
You can see this when you're angry too,
right?

814
00:45:47,581 --> 00:45:48,414
You get angry and you're angry with your
partner and all you can think of is all 

815
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,280
the stupid things they've done for the 
last 10 years.

816
00:45:53,281 --> 00:45:55,230
You don't even remember that you like 
them.

817
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,180
It's like you could remind them.
I know you're mad,

818
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:58,940
but remember you liked me now.
Well,

819
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,810
not right now.
You know,

820
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:01,644
so.
So it just shows you how those micro 

821
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:06,750
personalities can dominate and suppress.
That's,

822
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,613
that's what happens because if they 
didn't suppress the other micro 

823
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:10,554
personalities,
they wouldn't be able to run themselves 

824
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:14,400
to conclusion.

825
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,010
And then you'd never get what you want.
Okay?

826
00:46:19,011 --> 00:46:19,844
So anyways,
studies have shown a partial overlap 

827
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:29,120
between the motor execution and motor 
imagery neural circuits.

828
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,103
So what happens is you see something and
it primes you for the appropriate 

829
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:33,404
action.
Few have investigated brain activity 

830
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:40,100
during motor imagery in stroke patients 
with hemiparesis.

831
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,360
Hemiparesis is motor impairment from,
from,

832
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:45,950
uh,
from the stroke.

833
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,963
This work is aimed at examining 
similarities between motor imagery and 

834
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:50,864
execution in a group of stroke patients.
11 patients were asked to perform a 

835
00:46:53,961 --> 00:46:54,794
visual motor tracking task by either 
physically or mentally tracking a sine 

836
00:46:58,491 --> 00:47:01,250
wave forest target using their thumb and
index finger.

837
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,400
So they're doing this
during FMRI scanning results.

838
00:47:06,941 --> 00:47:07,774
Whole brain analysis confirmed shared 
neural substrates between motor imagery 

839
00:47:11,981 --> 00:47:14,590
and motor execution in bilateral 
premotor cortex.

840
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,900
So that's the part that I was talking 
about.

841
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,680
I won't tell you about the rest of the 
brain in pride.

842
00:47:19,681 --> 00:47:20,514
A lobule.
This is partly associated with body 

843
00:47:22,151 --> 00:47:27,151
recognition.
So.

844
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,130
So basically I showed

845
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:30,963
you that study because it it.
It's one of the studies that lend 

846
00:47:33,281 --> 00:47:34,114
credence to what I was just describing 
is that imagery is the precursor to 

847
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:37,504
action and that it's associated.
Get the imagery going here and the 

848
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:42,970
action there.
Think about,

849
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:47,200
think about thanking think act.
That's roughly how it works.

850
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,443
Okay.
Now,

851
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,330
now down to cognitive ability.
Well,

852
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:57,480
how can you conceptualize intelligence?

853
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:01,663
Well,
this is a major problem because your 

854
00:48:02,511 --> 00:48:06,680
initial conceptualization determines in 
part the strategies that you're going to

855
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:11,150
use to investigate intelligence.
And when you say,

856
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,970
when you,
when you pair a sentence down to what is

857
00:48:13,971 --> 00:48:17,330
intelligence,
the sentence is problematic because part

858
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:18,164
of it is a question about
if and how such a thing might manifest 

859
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:27,980
itself in the world.
So there's a fact out there that are set

860
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:29,690
of facts that corresponds to 
intelligence.

861
00:48:29,691 --> 00:48:30,680
But the other problem is,
well,

862
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:33,320
what do you mean when you say 
intelligence?

863
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:34,693
And you kind of have to nail that down.
If you're going to have a conversation 

864
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,610
about intelligence that doesn't go 
entirely astray.

865
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,863
And so you've got to.
You've got a definitional problem as 

866
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:45,800
well as an empirical problem.
And so

867
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,343
there have been,
and this was especially true in the 19 

868
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:50,744
nineties,

869
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,790
people have been studying intelligence 
Iq intelligence since the 19 twenties.

870
00:48:56,791 --> 00:48:59,580
And it is a very well established branch
of psychology.

871
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:00,623
One of the things I have to tell you 
about Iq research is that if you don't 

872
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,453
buy Iq research,
you might as well throw away all the 

873
00:49:08,311 --> 00:49:09,144
rest of psychology.
And the reason for that is that the 

874
00:49:12,481 --> 00:49:14,040
psychologists,
first of all,

875
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:14,874
who developed intelligence testing,
were among the early psychologists who 

876
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:22,851
instantiated the statistical techniques 
that all psychologists use to verify and

877
00:49:22,981 --> 00:49:23,814
test all of their hypotheses.
So you ended up throwing the baby out 

878
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,264
with the bathwater and the ICU people 
have defined intelligence in a more 

879
00:49:32,251 --> 00:49:33,084
stringent,
stringent and accurate way than we've 

880
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:39,690
been able to define almost any other 
psychological construct.

881
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:42,780
And so if you toss out the one that's 
most well defined,

882
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:45,120
then you're kind of stuck with the 
problem of what are you going to do with

883
00:49:45,121 --> 00:49:45,954
all the ones that you have leftover that
are nowhere near as well defined or as 

884
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:49,914
well measured or as or as a or,
or who's predictive validity as much 

885
00:49:55,201 --> 00:50:00,120
less than it has been demonstrated with 
much less vigor and clarity anyways.

886
00:50:00,121 --> 00:50:00,954
Despite all that,
people have posited a number of 

887
00:50:03,361 --> 00:50:06,950
different intelligences and reasonably 
so because there's a.

888
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,853
If you think of intelligence as that 
which might move you forward 

889
00:50:11,821 --> 00:50:12,654
successfully in the world,
obviously there's a fair number of 

890
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:16,403
phenomena that are associated with 
individuals that might fit into that 

891
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:19,770
category.
So we have

892
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,240
people have made these distinctions.

893
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,870
Bob Sternberg,
for example,

894
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:30,704
is distinguished between practical 
versus analytical intelligence and he 

895
00:50:34,101 --> 00:50:34,934
kind of thinks of practical as like 
street smarts and has attempted to 

896
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:39,014
dissociate that from the kind of 
analytical intelligence that that 

897
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,200
characterize this more straight Iq 
research.

898
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:46,034
I don't think he's done it successfully 
as well at all and since the 19 

899
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:49,814
nineties,
interest in his practical intelligence 

900
00:50:52,251 --> 00:50:57,251
has declined precipitously because when 
it is matched head to head with standard

901
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:58,363
Iq intelligence,
the Iq intelligence seats up all the 

902
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,724
variability.
What's really happened as far as I can 

903
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:08,120
tell so far is that when we're trying to
predict people's course through life,

904
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,040
Iq does a very good job and then one of 
the traits does a very good job as well,

905
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:17,930
which is conscientiousness,
but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.

906
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,033
Now,
that partly might be because we can't 

907
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:21,440
measure conscientiousness very well.

908
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:27,580
We're stuck with self reports or maybe I
could gather peer reports about you or I

909
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:28,414
could gather your parents reports about 
your teachers reports and each of those 

910
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:36,610
seems to pick up a little bit more of 
the pattern because you know yourself,

911
00:51:36,611 --> 00:51:37,444
but other people know you differently 
than you know yourself and there are 

912
00:51:39,951 --> 00:51:40,784
still some accuracy in that.
You can get multiple rater reports of 

913
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:45,760
something like conscientiousness and 
that'll up.

914
00:51:45,761 --> 00:51:48,580
It's predictive validity,
but in the final analysis,

915
00:51:48,581 --> 00:51:49,414
the best you seem to be able to deal 
with conscientiousness is about a point 

916
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,070
four correlation with longterm 
performance.

917
00:51:54,071 --> 00:51:54,904
Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,
you can probably get point five and 

918
00:51:58,001 --> 00:51:58,834
maybe point six.
Point five is 25 percent of the 

919
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:03,010
variance.
You've got to square it.

920
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:06,430
Point six is 30 percent,
36 percent of the variance,

921
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,040
and point four is 16 percent of the 
variance.

922
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,030
So even at the low end,
let's say high end for conscientiousness

923
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:13,864
is point four or 16 percent.
Low End for Iq is point five or 25 

924
00:52:18,341 --> 00:52:19,174
percent low and estimates of Iq make it 
one and a half times more powerful than 

925
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:23,584
the high end estimates of 
conscientiousness and I think that's 

926
00:52:25,931 --> 00:52:27,100
about right.
You'd think,

927
00:52:27,101 --> 00:52:27,934
why do we even have to debate this 
because it's so bloody obvious to me 

928
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,250
that intelligence is a major predictor 
of life success.

929
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:34,084
I mean you people.
I've measured the Iq of University of 

930
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,580
Toronto people,
you know,

931
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:41,440
people in this room who have an Iq of 
less than 120 are rare.

932
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,813
Well,
why?

933
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,833
Well smart people go to university now.
Is that actually a contentious 

934
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:48,034
statement?
What shouldn't be a contentious 

935
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:50,830
statement?
It's self evident.

936
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:51,664
Universities were actually set up so 
that smart people could expand their 

937
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:56,080
abilities.
That's why they were there.

938
00:52:56,081 --> 00:52:56,914
And you're selected on the basis of 
assessments that are essentially there 

939
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:04,591
to assess something like intelligence.
Yes,

940
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:12,020
but that,
that will,

941
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,930
that will.
That is part of the controversy.

942
00:53:13,931 --> 00:53:14,764
Is it reasonable?
And this is a measurement issue and 

943
00:53:17,261 --> 00:53:18,094
that's why we're.
That's why I've been instructing you to 

944
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:22,720
some degree in psychometrics because we 
actually know how to do this.

945
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:26,160
We know how to answer that question,
so let's a look at how

946
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:30,000
at how intelligence has been assessed 
and why,

947
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:32,190
and then you can make up your own mind 
anyways.

948
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,024
Here's some of the examples of other 
forms of intelligence and so then the 

949
00:53:37,561 --> 00:53:38,400
question is,
well,

950
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:41,550
what does it mean to have a different 
form of intelligence?

951
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,384
Would would form a and form b be 
completely uncorrelated like 

952
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:47,214
extroversion and neuroticism,
or would they be slightly correlated or 

953
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:51,600
would they be highly correlated and then
you might ask,

954
00:53:51,601 --> 00:53:52,434
well,
how highly correlated did they have to 

955
00:53:53,701 --> 00:53:54,534
be before they're the same thing or how 
uncorrelated did they have to be before 

956
00:53:58,801 --> 00:53:59,634
they're different things and actually 
the answer to that comes down to 

957
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:04,530
something like practical utility.
It's like,

958
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:05,873
imagine I'm trying to figure out how 
well you'll do in university and I 

959
00:54:08,491 --> 00:54:12,510
measure one thing and it's correlated at
point seven with another thing I measure

960
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:13,920
about you.
Then I might say,

961
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:14,754
well,
are those two things the same or 

962
00:54:15,391 --> 00:54:15,750
different?

963
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,030
They're pretty highly correlated.
Your high and what it means you're going

964
00:54:18,031 --> 00:54:19,740
to be higher than the other.
Well,

965
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:20,574
so what is there any utility in 
measuring both things and the way you 

966
00:54:24,151 --> 00:54:26,640
figured that out actually is you do it 
statistically,

967
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:27,474
so we take the target,
which might be your performance across 

968
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:32,190
university.
Then we say,

969
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,024
well,
can we predict your performance across 

970
00:54:34,831 --> 00:54:38,370
university better by using one variable 
or two variables?

971
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,460
So we would enter them both into a 
regression equation.

972
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:44,190
All a regression equation does.
It's quite simple,

973
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,383
so you're trying to predict the target 
and the regression age regression 

974
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,960
equation tells you how well you can 
predict that target.

975
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,003
If you know another fact now,
then it gets a little complicated 

976
00:54:57,451 --> 00:55:01,980
because that's a correlation.
How well you can predict be with a well.

977
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,770
A regression will say how much you can 
predict.

978
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:09,830
See if you know a and B or a and B and c
and d and e because you can use multiple

979
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,810
predictors and you can weight them.

980
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,290
So it might be two times a plus one 
times b equals c,

981
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:17,483
and that's all a regression equation 
does is just multiplication and 

982
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,311
addition.
Very,

983
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:21,144
very straightforward.
And so two variables are sufficiently 

984
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:24,984
different functionally if you can use 
both of them simultaneously to predict 

985
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,360
something of interest.
So again,

986
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,310
it's a tool like approach.
This is how the psychometricians do.

987
00:55:33,311 --> 00:55:35,610
It is something real well,
it's real.

988
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:36,980
If you can measure,
measure it,

989
00:55:36,981 --> 00:55:37,814
it,
it helps you predict that that's how 

990
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:40,680
it's defined.
So then you might say,

991
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,514
well,
are are there these multiple 

992
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:45,960
intelligences?
Well,

993
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,550
the first question would be,
well,

994
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:51,000
what do you mean by are there?
And the answer to that would be,

995
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,863
well,
let's specify the question since we're 

996
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:54,084
going to be scientific about it.
Let's predict how well people do in 

997
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:57,324
university.
We'll start with the assumption that 

998
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,753
intelligence,
if intelligence isn't associated with 

999
00:56:03,811 --> 00:56:04,644
university success,
then you're probably not talking about 

1000
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:09,390
intelligence.
Now you could argue that,

1001
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:10,680
right?
Because you could say,

1002
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:11,514
well,
intelligence has nothing to do with 

1003
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:14,760
university success,
but that's a definitional matter.

1004
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:15,803
We'd have to agree to begin with.
Is it reasonable to start with the 

1005
00:56:19,471 --> 00:56:20,304
presupposition that intelligence and 
university success share something in 

1006
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:24,730
common?
Well,

1007
00:56:24,731 --> 00:56:28,930
I think you have to be daft to,
to deny that initial proposition.

1008
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:29,950
Although you could,

1009
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,230
because you could say it was privileged 
or socioeconomic status or or or,

1010
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,250
or any number of sociological phenomena 
and some of those are obviously relevant

1011
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,040
social class for example,
because you know,

1012
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:47,780
if you're in a higher social class and 
all things being equal,

1013
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,810
intelligence included,
if you're in a higher social class,

1014
00:56:50,811 --> 00:56:53,330
you're more likely to go to university 
then you are if you're in a lower social

1015
00:56:53,331 --> 00:56:54,530
class.
So there's other,

1016
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,633
there's other factors that are going to 
influence whether or not you do well in 

1017
00:56:58,251 --> 00:56:59,084
university,
but we're going to assume that one of 

1018
00:57:00,051 --> 00:57:04,020
them might be intelligence.
Well then you would ask,

1019
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:07,350
well,
if you measured social intelligence,

1020
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,620
so that's what do they call that?
Social Intelligence.

1021
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,940
Now,
emotional intelligence,

1022
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,480
which does not exist by the way.
Emotional intelligence,

1023
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:18,460
moral intelligence,
linguistic musical,

1024
00:57:18,461 --> 00:57:19,570
logical,
mathematical,

1025
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,100
spacial body,
kinesthetic,

1026
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:24,400
interpersonal and intrapersonal.
All different forms of intelligence.

1027
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:25,443
Okay,
so to answer the question of whether 

1028
00:57:27,251 --> 00:57:28,084
they exist,
what you do first is pick a target 

1029
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:31,503
prediction of university performance.
Then you make a measure for each of 

1030
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:34,864
them.
Then you test to see if the measure 

1031
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:40,390
measured the same thing across multiple 
instances within the same person.

1032
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:43,330
That's a reliability tests because what 
the hell good is your ruler.

1033
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:44,164
If it stretches when you use it has to 
measure the same thing multiple times 

1034
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,490
and then you would say,
okay,

1035
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:49,443
we'll take all these different 
intelligence is measured the way we've 

1036
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:53,704
decided to measure them.
The first thing we'll do is see how 

1037
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:57,670
highly correlated they are because if 
they're complete,

1038
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:59,200
two of them are completely correlated.

1039
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,033
Then you have one.
You don't have to because that's 

1040
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,630
virtually the definition of one.
Instead of two.

1041
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,673
You can factor analyze them and see if 
you can pull out what's common across 

1042
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:09,574
all of them.
That's another thing because then you 

1043
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:11,561
might say,
well,

1044
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:15,250
intelligence is what's common across all
the measures of these intelligences.

1045
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,040
It's a proposition.
It's not a fact.

1046
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,990
You have to decide if you're going to 
agree with it,

1047
00:58:19,991 --> 00:58:20,824
but that if you were going to do that,
you'd use a factor analysis and you'd 

1048
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,124
say,
well,

1049
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,740
if someone was more likely to be 
musical,

1050
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,723
if they were also high in linguistic 
ability and more likely to be logical 

1051
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:33,370
and mathematically inclined,
if they had a high spatial ability,

1052
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:34,204
et Cetera,
then you'd be hypothesizing that there 

1053
00:58:35,801 --> 00:58:36,634
was one factor behind all of those 
manifestations that somehow similar and 

1054
00:58:41,111 --> 00:58:41,944
maybe there wouldn't be,
and then you take all your measures and 

1055
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:44,764
you put them in something like a 
multiple regression analysis and you'd 

1056
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:50,890
predict your target university 
performance and then maybe you'd say,

1057
00:58:50,891 --> 00:58:51,491
well,
wait a minute.

1058
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,100
Let's not just use university 
performance.

1059
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:58,240
Let's use junior high performance,
high school performance,

1060
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,103
university performance and job success,
and then let's say that the only things 

1061
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:07,600
that predict success across all of those
categories and that are the same,

1062
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:09,610
we're going to define as intelligence.
Well,

1063
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:11,440
that's basically how you end up with Iq.

1064
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,723
You could say that Iq is what's common 
across all possible sets of of 

1065
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,030
intelligence tests.
Now people are

1066
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:27,030
going to debate that because you still 
have to define what constitutes a test,

1067
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:28,683
but the way the psychometricians have 
managed it and have taken care of this 

1068
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:32,950
at least to some degree,
is to say,

1069
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,410
well,
we're going to.

1070
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:38,320
We're not going to define everything 
that we measure as intelligence,

1071
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,050
so extroverted people are more socially 
fluent.

1072
00:59:41,051 --> 00:59:43,090
Are we going to call that intelligence?
No.

1073
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:44,223
We're going to call that personality.
We're going to call that extroversion 

1074
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:47,800
and we're going to call stress 
tolerance.

1075
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,083
You could say,
well,

1076
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,940
if you can tolerate more stress,
you're more intelligent.

1077
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:52,511
It's like,
well,

1078
00:59:52,511 --> 00:59:53,980
no,
that isn't how we've defined it.

1079
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,590
We're going to define that as being 
lower in neuroticism.

1080
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:59,140
If you're cooperative,
you're more intelligent.

1081
00:59:59,141 --> 01:00:01,120
That's emotional intelligence.
Well,

1082
01:00:01,121 --> 01:00:03,430
what you're less intelligent if you're 
competitive.

1083
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,630
Well,
no.

1084
01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:07,900
So we parsed that off to agreeableness,
so then the question might be,

1085
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:11,320
is there anything left of these so 
called intelligences?

1086
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:16,270
Once you control for personality and Iq 
and the answer is no.

1087
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,793
Nothing,
nothing left of them and the people who 

1088
01:00:20,441 --> 01:00:21,274
keep pushing these ideas keep trying to 
push them because they don't like the 

1089
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:24,694
idea of real individual differences.
And to me that's just a matter of 

1090
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,024
sticking your damn head in the sand 
because it's obvious here you're going 

1091
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:32,404
to have a child,
you want the child to have an Iq of 65 

1092
01:00:34,871 --> 01:00:37,840
or 145 decide,
okay,

1093
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:39,310
so you're all going to vote.
Okay.

1094
01:00:39,311 --> 01:00:42,610
You think any one of you is going to 
vote to have a child with an Iq of 65,

1095
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:46,510
that child's going to have a hard time 
developing even linguistic ability.

1096
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,120
They're never going to learn to read,
right?

1097
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,700
They're never going to leave home in all
likelihood.

1098
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,100
So which child are you going to pick?
Well,

1099
01:00:54,101 --> 01:00:55,660
so do you believe in intelligence or 
not?

1100
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,790
Well obviously if you have any sense

1101
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:04,210
for every time something statistically 
came up in the morning.

1102
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,880
Yup.
Yup.

1103
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:12,750
So all these things just have their 
statistical validity and just names.

1104
01:01:12,751 --> 01:01:14,890
So then if we're going to assign me to 
the doctor,

1105
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,010
are we assigning the names based on what
we consider to be reasonable?

1106
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,470
Okay,
that's a good question.

1107
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,970
So look here.
Here's one thing.

1108
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,103
So let's say this is actually what 
happened when people develop the big 

1109
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:26,940
five.
So I'm going to give a very large number

1110
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:31,260
of people every question,
every a huge set of questions that cover

1111
01:01:31,261 --> 01:01:33,840
every element of their personality.
I can think of.

1112
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,670
It's agnostic,
right?

1113
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,533
What I'm really trying to do is come up 
with the biggest possible set of 

1114
01:01:38,851 --> 01:01:42,590
descriptors that someone could actually 
fill out that's eliminated.

1115
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,483
I can't give you 10,000 questions as so 
maybe I take a set of 10,000 questions 

1116
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,970
and randomly select a few sets of 100,
right?

1117
01:01:50,971 --> 01:01:53,430
Because then I would have represented 
the entire set.

1118
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,250
Then I give them to a thousand people 
agnostically.

1119
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,370
Then I do the factor analysis,
Bang five factors come out,

1120
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,623
and then the factor analysis tells me 
which questions load on each factor in 

1121
01:02:04,171 --> 01:02:05,640
what the factor analysis is saying.

1122
01:02:05,850 --> 01:02:09,210
Here's 20 questions and there's 
something about them that's the same.

1123
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,370
So then I read the questions and I 
think,

1124
01:02:11,371 --> 01:02:12,204
wow,
those questions are referring to 

1125
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:15,330
something the same.
What is that?

1126
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,760
Well then maybe I talked to three 
colleagues and we think,

1127
01:02:17,761 --> 01:02:22,761
well that's something like band.
We have a name and then we could go see.

1128
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,840
Now that we have a measure of 
sociability,

1129
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,440
we could go associated with other 
measures of sociability.

1130
01:02:28,441 --> 01:02:29,430
Like we might say,
well,

1131
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:32,400
are people who score high on this 
measure,

1132
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:36,210
associate it more likely to go to 
parties and the answer would be yes,

1133
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:41,160
because what happens if you take 10,000 
questions about personality and randomly

1134
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:41,994
select sets of 100 and give each of them
to a thousand people and do a factor 

1135
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:45,894
analysis.
The first factor is extroversion and 

1136
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:49,344
it's the.
It's the factor in human personality 

1137
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:54,960
that seems to pick up the biggest amount
of variance and so so then we say from a

1138
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:57,600
statistical perspective,
extroversion is real,

1139
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:58,890
but we define real.

1140
01:02:59,160 --> 01:02:59,993
Real means that if you use linguistic 
representation randomly applied across 

1141
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:07,650
large sets of people and you factor 
analyze it,

1142
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:08,484
these come out as clumped together 
because you have to define what 

1143
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:12,650
constitutes real.
If you're going to play that,

1144
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:13,484
this is real game,
which is basically what you're doing in 

1145
01:03:14,911 --> 01:03:16,980
science,
and so that's what happened with the big

1146
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:18,960
five and then people started to look,
well,

1147
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:19,913
okay,
is there a biological substrate for 

1148
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:21,970
this?
Bang,

1149
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:25,620
it turns out there is incentive reward.
That's the positive reward system.

1150
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,993
So and then while neuroticism,
that's often but not always the second 

1151
01:03:29,911 --> 01:03:30,721
factor.
Well,

1152
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:33,120
is there a biological basis for it?
Yes.

1153
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:36,840
Threat sensitivity and pain sensitivity,
they seem to lock together.

1154
01:03:37,170 --> 01:03:38,003
Agreeableness,
that's the care system that Jaak 

1155
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,060
Panksepp has identified.
So that's basically.

1156
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,940
That's basically matter analogy.
It's something like that.

1157
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:45,930
You had another question

1158
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,810
but
intelligence.

1159
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,350
Well,
it's because we found out how to measure

1160
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:03,840
intelligence so and so,
and I'll get into that right now.

1161
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,040
So then the question is,
well,

1162
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,080
how do you measure intelligence?
Okay,

1163
01:04:07,081 --> 01:04:07,914
well it's similar.
It's similar to this linguistic 

1164
01:04:11,371 --> 01:04:13,350
approach,
but here's how it differs.

1165
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,233
Generate 10,000 questions that require 
knowledge and you get get 50 people to 

1166
01:04:19,111 --> 01:04:19,944
do it and have them and have them be of 
diverse opinions about what constitutes 

1167
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:26,130
knowledge so much the better then you 
cover that.

1168
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,640
You want to oversample the territory,
so you want to have some quick questions

1169
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:30,474
in there that only one person out of 50 
would think that measures intelligence 

1170
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,960
because you can over sample statistics 
will take care of that.

1171
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:41,520
So you want to ask more questions than 
you think are reasonable and that's part

1172
01:04:41,521 --> 01:04:43,860
of the way that you get rid of bias in 
the sampling.

1173
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:47,730
It's like you think goal,
find out 10 questions that someone could

1174
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:48,090
answer.

1175
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,070
If you think they're intelligent,
I don't care what they are.

1176
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,470
And then 50 of you do that.
Bring me the questions.

1177
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,513
Well,
let's say we get a nice set of 10,000 

1178
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:55,884
questions and we can take random sets of
100 and give them to a thousand people 

1179
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,313
and then we can score their answers to 
the questions and then we can rank 

1180
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,980
order,
we could say correlate their performance

1181
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:11,850
across different sets of questions.
So I give you one set of 100 questions.

1182
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,730
You scored 90.
I'll give you another set of questions.

1183
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:18,030
You score 90 out of 100,
you score out of 100.

1184
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:20,170
Well then we would think if a bunch of 
people did that,

1185
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:21,213
those aren't measuring the same thing 
because if you're high on one and you 

1186
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:27,490
should be high on all of them.
Well with Iq it's like if you do that,

1187
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,320
the reliability is like point nine.

1188
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:33,280
It's unbelievable.
You take one set of 100 questions,

1189
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:37,450
you rank order people,
you take another set of 100 questions.

1190
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:40,420
You rank order people,
you correlate the rank orders.

1191
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:44,800
It's like this is point nine.
The people who did well in one do on all

1192
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:45,634
of them.
The people who did bad on one do bad on 

1193
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,860
all of them.
That's ICU or more technically,

1194
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:51,963
this is what Iq is.
Take a thousand people and give them 20 

1195
01:05:56,111 --> 01:06:00,790
tests of 100 items and then factor,
analyze the 20 tests and extract out the

1196
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,220
central factor.
That's g,

1197
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:06,880
that's fluid intelligence.
So then what do you do with that?

1198
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,430
Well then you can try to use it.
Then you can see,

1199
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:11,170
well is there a biological basis for 
this?

1200
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:12,004
Is there something about if you're 
higher in the ability to operate across 

1201
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:16,084
these sets of questions,
are there things about you that are 

1202
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:18,520
physiologically different?

1203
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:22,390
And the answer to that is yes.
Your reaction time is faster,

1204
01:06:22,391 --> 01:06:26,470
just simple reaction time,
so light turns on you push a button,

1205
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,450
light turns on you push a button.
Okay.

1206
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:31,180
There's a lag between the light going on
and you pushing the button.

1207
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,370
The shorter the lag,
the smarter you are.

1208
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:34,853
Well,
what is it that's really interesting 

1209
01:06:35,921 --> 01:06:39,430
because you know if you're perceiving 
something complex,

1210
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,990
it takes a lot of neural connections to 
generate the perception,

1211
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,410
but simple reaction time is like two 
neurons whack.

1212
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,633
There's no complexity in that at all and
yet how fast you are at that is still 

1213
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:54,130
correlated only at about point two,
five,

1214
01:06:54,131 --> 01:06:57,580
but that's not trivial.
If you're doing research in psychology,

1215
01:06:57,581 --> 01:06:58,414
generally speaking,
and you come out with a point two five 

1216
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,310
correlation between whatever you're 
measuring and whatever you're interested

1217
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,200
in,
you're having a pretty good day.

1218
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,034
Point two,
five is not bad at all and so it's not 

1219
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:09,424
accounting for all of it,
but it's accounting for a fair bit of 

1220
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:12,670
it,
how big your head is.

1221
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,833
That's also correlated how how big your 
brain is physically and then even more 

1222
01:07:17,321 --> 01:07:20,140
accurately,
how big your brain is in relationship to

1223
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:21,460
your body.
Now again,

1224
01:07:21,461 --> 01:07:23,440
these are small correlations,
but they're not.

1225
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,740
They're not nonsignificant.
What else?

1226
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,530
Nerve peripheral nerve conduction 
velocity.

1227
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:30,364
That's this study.
Two studies with sample sizes of 90 and 

1228
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:34,054
90 roughly speaking,
are reported that investigated 

1229
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,510
relationships among measures of 
intelligence,

1230
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,344
speed of information processing,
and peripheral nerve conduction 

1231
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:42,370
velocity.
In both studies,

1232
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,240
neural conduction velocity was 
significantly correlated with Iq scores.

1233
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:47,470
Point four,
two point four,

1234
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:48,490
eight.
Man,

1235
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,250
that's a whopping correlation.
How do I know that?

1236
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,300
Because a guy named Hemphill,
where is he right there.

1237
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,471
You might say,
well,

1238
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:59,890
how big is the correlation Coefficient 
before you call it big?

1239
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,100
And the answer to that is generally lets
guests.

1240
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,053
So if you talk to psychologists and they
talked to you about how big the effect 

1241
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:07,924
sizes are,
they use guesses that were generated by 

1242
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,463
statisticians in the fifties and so they
radically underestimate the actual of 

1243
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:19,100
correlation coefficients because they 
never studied it empirically.

1244
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,560
Well,
this guy handheld because here,

1245
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,170
how big is the correlation Coefficient 
to be big?

1246
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:28,610
How do you answer that?
Take a thousand psychology studies rank,

1247
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:31,580
order the effect sizes and break them 
into percentiles,

1248
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,590
right?
That's an empirical way of doing it.

1249
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:36,440
How big is the effect that the typical 
study generates?

1250
01:08:36,710 --> 01:08:37,543
Then you can use that as a way of 
assessing how impressive the effect is 

1251
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:42,020
that you generated.
Okay,

1252
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:43,190
so this is it.
Here,

1253
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,080
Hemphill,
2003.

1254
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,260
Interpreting the magnitude of 
correlation coefficient.

1255
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,573
Now you could say that's a dopey way to 
do it because why defined size in 

1256
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:56,540
accordance with the size that people 
have discovered and handheld would say,

1257
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,710
well that's because I'm doing it this 
way with this paper.

1258
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:02,780
If you want to do it a different way,
go right ahead,

1259
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,740
but there's utility in this.
You come up with an RF point two,

1260
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,633
how likely is it that your next paper is
going to have an effect size of that 

1261
01:09:10,941 --> 01:09:11,600
magnitude?

1262
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,370
How happy should you be?
Well,

1263
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:15,230
the answer is a lot happier than you 
think.

1264
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,860
So to get it our of point five,
that's 25 percent of the variance.

1265
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:21,884
So you still have 75 percent of whatever
explaining your phenomena left to be 

1266
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:27,800
explained.
Our point five,

1267
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:30,500
92 90,
a 97th percentile,

1268
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:35,090
so 19 out of 20 psychology studies that 
are published and that's a hell of a lot

1269
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:37,790
more fewer psychology studies that 
exist,

1270
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:38,624
right?
Because this tiny fraction of them get 

1271
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:43,490
published,
95 percent of them show up a correlation

1272
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,330
coefficient of less than point five for 
her third point three,

1273
01:09:47,331 --> 01:09:48,230
five,
two point five,

1274
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:49,064
zero.
It's that's greater than 75 percent of 

1275
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:52,040
them.
Point one,

1276
01:09:52,041 --> 01:09:52,430
five,
two.

1277
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:53,263
Point three five is pretty typical and 
the typical correlation between a 

1278
01:09:56,361 --> 01:09:57,194
personality trait and the target of 
interest is usually something in the 

1279
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:02,330
neighborhood of point two,
two point two five.

1280
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:04,460
With Iq,
you get up two point five.

1281
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,593
The relationship between income 
inequality and male homicide is like 

1282
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,370
point seven five.
It just covers all of it,

1283
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:14,480
which is to say that everywhere that 
everyone's poor,

1284
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,510
there's no male homicide and everywhere 
that everyone's rich,

1285
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:21,170
there's no male homicide,
but places where there's poor people and

1286
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:23,540
rich people,
the male homicide rate goes way the hell

1287
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,374
up right,
especially if it's a steep distribution 

1288
01:10:27,381 --> 01:10:28,214
because the men at the bottom think 
somebody has a lot more than me and 

1289
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:33,380
that's not very fair.
I'm going to do something about that and

1290
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:36,210
that usually means killing other men and
so it's a.

1291
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:40,010
it's unbelievably powerful relationship.
That's a useful thing to keep squirreled

1292
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:43,610
away in your imagination.
Poverty does not cause crime.

1293
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:49,720
Relative poverty causes crime.
That is a completely different thing,

1294
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:54,920
so and its dominance hierarchy issue.
Fundamentally it's men.

1295
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:55,813
Men are generally the criminals and as 
the dominance hierarchy gets harder to 

1296
01:10:58,281 --> 01:10:59,210
climb,
the young man,

1297
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:01,910
especially the aggressive ones,
get more likely to turn to violence.

1298
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,180
You really need to know that.
So credibly important fact.

1299
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,700
I'm going to interview the guy who 
figured that out.

1300
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:09,530
Martin Daly.
I'm going to interview him for one of my

1301
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:10,364
podcasts in the next month or so,
so you might be interested in tuning in 

1302
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:13,920
on that if you're interested in this 
sort of thing.

1303
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,710
Okay,
so back to these correlations.

1304
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:17,544
Look,
peripheral nerve conduction velocity is 

1305
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:23,070
correlated with Iq at like point,
let's say point four five.

1306
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,010
It's a whopping effect man,
and that's.

1307
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:26,844
That's a pretty straightforward thing.
Speed of electrical propagation along 

1308
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:32,730
your neural tissue determines how 
intelligent you are.

1309
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,490
While is that really so surprising you'd
expect,

1310
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,340
if that's associated with neurological 
integrity,

1311
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:40,770
at least to some degree,
it's exactly the sort of thing you would

1312
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:41,604
expect,
but it shows you how biologically based 

1313
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,210
it is too.
Faster.

1314
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:46,044
Neural conductance philosophy was 
associated with higher Iq scores and 

1315
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:50,730
faster speed of processing.
Why?

1316
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:54,480
Who knows?
Here's a hypothesis.

1317
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,670
What if you're trying to remember a 
phone number?

1318
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:00,504
Just the seven digit one.
What do you do when you're remembering 

1319
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:04,320
the phone number?
You say it over and over again,

1320
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:05,550
right?
Or you or you.

1321
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,890
If you don't say it,
you think it over and over again,

1322
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:10,620
and if someone distracts you,
then you lose it.

1323
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,450
That's working memory,
roughly speaking and your working memory

1324
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:16,613
capacity,
so imagine you could do four digits and 

1325
01:12:19,141 --> 01:12:21,120
remember them.
You could do six,

1326
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:22,800
you could do eight,
you could do 12,

1327
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:23,933
likely not 12 is really pushing it.
That's a great estimator of Iq working 

1328
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,464
memory.
In fact,

1329
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:29,783
there's almost no neuropsychologists 
like to think that working memory is 

1330
01:12:33,271 --> 01:12:34,104
something in and of itself,
but that's because they don't know a 

1331
01:12:35,461 --> 01:12:37,560
damn thing about psychometrics.
Generally speaking,

1332
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,603
there's almost no difference between 
fluid intelligence and working memory 

1333
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,053
and the reason for that is that all 
measures of intellectual function 

1334
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:50,370
collapse into Ge and so we can take a 
look at what that means.

1335
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,600
This is from this character here,
Carol joynt.

1336
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:55,463
Carol,
if you want to know everything there is 

1337
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:57,684
to know about Iq.
This is a book that everyone who's a 

1338
01:13:00,241 --> 01:13:01,830
psychologist should.
It should.

1339
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:02,843
You shouldn't be able to be a 
psychologist unless you've read this 

1340
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:05,220
book.
In my estimation.

1341
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:07,560
There's a couple of key texts and this 
is one of them.

1342
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,461
This guy,
Carol,

1343
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:09,294
wrote this thick book.
You don't have to read the whole thing 

1344
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:11,724
because a lot of it's just in some sense
demonstrations and proof of what he 

1345
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:17,550
saying,
but what he did for Iq is the same thing

1346
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:20,070
that psychometricians did for the big 
five.

1347
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:23,790
You've got the big two at the top.
They're not very highly correlated.

1348
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,860
I think it's about point two,
something like that.

1349
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:29,790
So they're pretty independent.
Then they fragment into the big five and

1350
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:30,624
then you can differentiate them further 
into the big tent and there really are 

1351
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,220
five different traits because they're 
only correlated with each other at about

1352
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:39,720
point two to point three.

1353
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,500
So really quite distinct.
Um,

1354
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:46,590
the question is,
if you fractionate Iq,

1355
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,010
how correlated are the things that you 
fractionated into.

1356
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:52,290
And the answer to that is point eight or
point nine.

1357
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:57,290
There's one factor in Iq,
roughly speaking you,

1358
01:13:57,390 --> 01:13:58,860
if you,
if you take

1359
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:04,710
imagine that you took an Iq test and you
took,

1360
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:07,083
it was 100 items long and you took the 
50 items that were the most correlated 

1361
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:10,884
with each other.
And then the 50 items that were the 

1362
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:13,924
least correlated with those 50 items.
So you broke it into two as much as you 

1363
01:14:17,921 --> 01:14:19,630
could,
you maximally differentiated,

1364
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,123
you might ask,
well how correlated with the scores 

1365
01:14:22,571 --> 01:14:26,020
beyond those two different subsets,
and the answer would be like point nine

1366
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,740
because there isn't two things that 
you're measuring.

1367
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,290
Even if you break it up that way,
post hoc and say,

1368
01:14:32,291 --> 01:14:35,230
well it's unfair,
but we're going to say because these are

1369
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,320
the 50 most highly correlated and these 
are the leftovers,

1370
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,660
like we're really capitalizing on chance
there.

1371
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:41,643
You're still going to get an almost 
identical readout from both sections of 

1372
01:14:44,561 --> 01:14:47,860
the Iq test and it's just not the same 
with personality.

1373
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,903
So and so this is,
this is carol's model basically stratum 

1374
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:55,180
three.
That's the highest level of abstraction.

1375
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:56,014
That's fluid intelligence and then you 
can break it down into these sub 

1376
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,140
categories of cognitive ability and you 
might say,

1377
01:15:02,141 --> 01:15:04,300
well,
how different are those subcategories?

1378
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:06,970
And the answer is not very.
If you're high in one,

1379
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,740
you're very likely to be high in all of 
them.

1380
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:13,890
Now there's a bit of a Coda to that,
which is that the lower your Iq,

1381
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:20,050
the higher the correlation between these
sub aspects of intelligence,

1382
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,273
the lower your Iq,
the higher the correlation between the 

1383
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:24,274
sub aspects of intelligence.
As you get up into the higher strata of 

1384
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:28,710
Iq,
your eye,

1385
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:29,593
your intelligence differentiates more 
across the potential range of 

1386
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:32,944
differentiation,
which is to say there's one way of not 

1387
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:36,034
being very bright,
but there's multiple ways of being 

1388
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:39,844
bright.

1389
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,880
So,
but even even so,

1390
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:42,903
if you're high on one,
you're still quite likely to be high on 

1391
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:45,124
the rest of them.
So then the question is what's the 

1392
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:47,644
correlation between Ge and each of these
sub elements of Ge and then what's the 

1393
01:15:51,251 --> 01:15:53,680
correlation between the sub elements of 
GE themselves?

1394
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:58,300
So if this was plasticity and we were 
looking at openness and extroversion,

1395
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,850
the correlation here would be about 
point.

1396
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,130
I think it's about point five,
something like that,

1397
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,880
and the correlation between openness and
extroversion would be about point three.

1398
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:09,310
Quite a bit of difference.
But with this,

1399
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,480
there's GE,
there's the sub elements,

1400
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,690
there's the correlation coefficients 
point nine,

1401
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:19,540
almost point nine,
five point.

1402
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,220
What is that?
Six or eight?

1403
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,890
Eight point eight point six,
point eight,

1404
01:16:23,891 --> 01:16:25,030
point eight,
point nine.

1405
01:16:25,031 --> 01:16:26,050
Pretty much.
Point nine.

1406
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:27,220
Pretty much.
Well,

1407
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,860
you can fractionate it the best you 
possibly can.

1408
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,110
It doesn't matter.
It's one thing.

1409
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:33,663
It's one thing and it looks like it's 
the ability to abstractly represent and 

1410
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:40,570
then to manipulate the abstractions.
I said with working memory,

1411
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:41,733
you know you can get it.
That's simply how many digits can you 

1412
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:48,280
keep in your head simultaneously without
dropping one.

1413
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,320
That's it.
God.

1414
01:16:50,830 --> 01:16:52,810
It's unbelievable.
It's pretty straightforward.

1415
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:56,020
And then it's this viciously powerful 
predictor of longterm life success.

1416
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,090
Probably prediction of around point 
five.

1417
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:02,530
Now psychologists,
psychologists hate this.

1418
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,513
They won't admit that it exists and I 
think it's because there's something 

1419
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:11,660
about intelligence that against our 
intrinsic egalitarianism,

1420
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:13,370
right?
There's two things that do it.

1421
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:15,530
First,
let's say you're successful.

1422
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:17,840
You like to think I'm successful,
you know,

1423
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,790
and you like to attribute it to your 
own,

1424
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:21,110
do it.
And Fair enough.

1425
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:22,373
I'm not saying that there isn't an 
element of it that's your own doing 

1426
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:25,334
whatever that means,
but if your nerve conductive velocity 

1427
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,353
happens to be high,
there's a lot more probability that 

1428
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:32,774
you're going to be successful and it's 
kind of hard to blame that on you or to 

1429
01:17:35,301 --> 01:17:36,680
attribute it to you for that matter.

1430
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:41,890
So it indicates a kind of statistical 
arbitrary ness about the distribution of

1431
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,470
success and failure in our society.
Okay,

1432
01:17:44,471 --> 01:17:46,580
so that's one thing people don't like 
that idea.

1433
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,623
The second thing is,
is that it turns out to be very 

1434
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:51,674
difficult to raise Iq.
Now it's tricky because it looks like 

1435
01:17:55,731 --> 01:17:56,564
you can raise Iq across whole 
populations because these fluid 

1436
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:00,974
intelligence looks like it's been rising
quite substantially over the last 

1437
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,430
hundred years.
Maybe as people are better nourished and

1438
01:18:07,431 --> 01:18:08,264
better educated,
but also more prone to continually 

1439
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:13,820
manipulate abstractions in their life.
Because I mean kids start with computers

1440
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:15,390
when they're like two,
you know,

1441
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,333
so.
But if you take a group of people and 

1442
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:22,790
you try to.
If you take a group of low Iq people and

1443
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,500
you try to raise their Iq,
it's very,

1444
01:18:24,501 --> 01:18:27,290
very difficult to manage it without a 
tremendous amount of investment.

1445
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,620
That doesn't necessarily mean the 
investment isn't worthwhile,

1446
01:18:30,621 --> 01:18:32,210
but it does mean that it's very 
difficult.

1447
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,463
Well,
the best thing to do as far as we can 

1448
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:40,100
tell,
the best thing to do is get nourishment.

1449
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:42,770
Right?
That seems to be the most effective.

1450
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:43,941
Yeah.
Yeah.

1451
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:45,770
Yeah.
So I'm part of the reason.

1452
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:46,663
Part of the reason,
the theory is part of the reason that 

1453
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:49,184
population iqs have been increasing over
the last hundred years is because 

1454
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:52,844
there's just no one left who's seriously
enough malnourished so that it's going 

1455
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:59,480
to profoundly impact their intellectual 
capabilities.

1456
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:02,840
So breastfeeding seems to raise Iq,
so it's two,

1457
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,713
two points,
three points with every year of 

1458
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:06,320
breastfeeding.
It's something like that.

1459
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,070
So it's,
it's,

1460
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:08,600
it's,
and that's actually quite a lot.

1461
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:10,910
Two or three points actually makes a 
difference as it turns out.

1462
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,550
So.
Okay.

1463
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:17,870
So.
So he's Iq real depends what you mean by

1464
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:18,704
real Iq is average performance across 
average sets of questions that require 

1465
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:30,581
abstraction to conceive of.
And and answer is it real well,

1466
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:31,934
it's real statistically,
and you can use it to predict important 

1467
01:19:34,791 --> 01:19:39,791
outcomes that other things can't predict
and from a scientific perspective,

1468
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:45,200
and it's also correlated with various 
physiological and biological phenomena.

1469
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:46,363
While that's,
that's how you define real 

1470
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:48,920
scientifically.
So yes,

1471
01:19:48,921 --> 01:19:49,754
it's real.
Are there other factors that determine 

1472
01:19:52,071 --> 01:19:52,904
people's success and worth?
Iq Isn't a measure of people's worth in 

1473
01:19:56,451 --> 01:19:58,070
any intrinsic sense.
It's a,

1474
01:19:58,190 --> 01:20:01,920
it's an estimate of their ability to 
succeed in abs,

1475
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:02,863
in hierarchies that are dependent on the
ability to manipulate complex sets of 

1476
01:20:06,561 --> 01:20:07,394
information.
There's lots of other things about 

1477
01:20:08,941 --> 01:20:12,960
people that differentiate them in terms 
of quality and quantity and all of those

1478
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:13,794
things.
And the most evidence of those are the 

1479
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:16,980
big five traits.
Now,

1480
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:17,814
if you're a psychologist,
and this is another thing every 

1481
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:20,124
psychologist should be taught,
if you want to discover something about 

1482
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,870
human beings that hasn't already been 
discovered,

1483
01:20:28,110 --> 01:20:32,640
the first thing you should do is make 
sure it isn't Iq and it isn't any of the

1484
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:33,474
big five traits and psychologists almost
never do that because what happens is 

1485
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:40,260
that if they control for ICU,
so in regression you'd say,

1486
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:41,094
okay,
here's the thing I'm interested in 

1487
01:20:41,731 --> 01:20:42,510
predicting.

1488
01:20:42,510 --> 01:20:44,760
The first thing we're going to do is add
ICU and not.

1489
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:45,594
I've measured that you took in five 
minutes either like a real Iq test 

1490
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:49,403
because you want to use a good measure 
to test your hypothesis against and not 

1491
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:56,340
a 10 item measure of the big five.
Either like 100 item measure.

1492
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:59,370
So you get a reliable measure.
You throw in Icu,

1493
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,293
you throw in the big five,
and then you throw in your dopey 

1494
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:04,680
construct and then you see if it can 
predict anything.

1495
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:08,880
And the answer is no.
And so psychologists don't do it because

1496
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:09,714
whenever they do it properly,
it destroys their construct and that 

1497
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:15,840
makes them irritated because their claim
to their position.

1498
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:20,130
Of Authority in the educational 
dominance hierarchy is predicated on the

1499
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:22,260
validity of their construct.
Now,

1500
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:23,094
if you're a real scientist,
what you try to do is destroy your 

1501
01:21:25,081 --> 01:21:26,550
construct.
You think,

1502
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,070
okay,
it looks like this is real.

1503
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,053
Then you think it's probably not,
and I don't want to spend the next 10 

1504
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:33,954
years chasing a ghost and a Mira,
so I'm going to try to destroy the damn 

1505
01:21:37,621 --> 01:21:39,000
thing.
So you say,

1506
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:40,980
well,
we'll match it up against a good measure

1507
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:44,280
of Iq and a comprehensive big five and 
it still survives.

1508
01:21:44,281 --> 01:21:45,114
We'll do a couple of replications to 
make sure that we can't kill it any 

1509
01:21:47,551 --> 01:21:48,384
other way and maybe we'll do the 
statistics three or four different ways 

1510
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:51,834
to make sure that the thing just doesn't
disappear when you use a different 

1511
01:21:54,631 --> 01:21:57,570
statistical procedure and people don't 
do that,

1512
01:21:57,571 --> 01:21:58,404
and that's why the replication rate even
among well established psychological 

1513
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,240
finding,
so to speak,

1514
01:22:03,241 --> 01:22:06,930
once that have been highly cited is 
extraordinarily low and no,

1515
01:22:06,931 --> 01:22:07,764
if you talk to psychologists,
they'll wave their hands and they'll 

1516
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:09,811
say,
well,

1517
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:11,610
I don't really believe in Iq.
It's like,

1518
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:12,713
okay,
you know,

1519
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:15,270
we're not talking about what do you call
those?

1520
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,823
What did the ghostbusters hunt down?
We're not talking about paranormal 

1521
01:22:20,461 --> 01:22:23,100
phenomena.
They're not things you get to believe in

1522
01:22:23,101 --> 01:22:23,940
or not,
right?

1523
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,090
There are rules for defining what 
constitutes something that's real from a

1524
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:29,910
scientific perspective and a 
psychometric perspective,

1525
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,420
so you don't get to say,
well,

1526
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,770
apply one definition of reality because 
I don't like Icu,

1527
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,550
and then I'll use the same definition to
justify my own constructs.

1528
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:39,384
Like,
sorry,

1529
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,610
that isn't how it works.
Not You can do that.

1530
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,470
If you're a postmodernist,
you can do that,

1531
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,050
but if you're a person who actually 
thinks scientifically,

1532
01:22:46,051 --> 01:22:49,970
you don't get to play that game,
so now you know,

1533
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:52,500
part of the reason that we need to know 
about these sorts of things.

1534
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:57,150
See how are we doing for time here?
Oh yeah,

1535
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:57,984
we're doing good.
I think we need to know these things 

1536
01:23:00,391 --> 01:23:02,580
partly because they have policy 
implications.

1537
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:03,413
First of all,
you need to know them for your own life 

1538
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,110
because you got to know that there are 
differences in intelligence.

1539
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:08,944
It's really important.
If you go into a job and you're not 

1540
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:12,274
smart enough for that job,
you're going to have one bloody 

1541
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:14,824
miserable time and you're going to make 
life wretched for the people around you 

1542
01:23:17,651 --> 01:23:21,670
because you won't be able to handle the 
position and as you climb hierarchies of

1543
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:22,504
competence,
the demand on fluid intelligence 

1544
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:27,190
increases,
and so unless you want to fail,

1545
01:23:27,191 --> 01:23:30,340
you don't put yourself in over your head
while what's over your head.

1546
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,350
Well,
that's a tricky thing to figure out.

1547
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:34,810
I mean you have to figure that out with 
intelligence.

1548
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:36,580
You have to figure it out with 
conscientiousness.

1549
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:38,050
You have to figure it out.
With creativity,

1550
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,890
you have to figure out with stress 
tolerance with agreeableness because you

1551
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:44,590
want to go into a cooperative 
environment and not a competitive one.

1552
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:47,050
If you're agreeable and with 
neuroticism,

1553
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:51,880
you probably want to keep the stress 
level of your job relatively low because

1554
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:52,714
those are all places that you can break 
down and most people have at least one 

1555
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,630
significant weakness in their 
intelligence,

1556
01:23:58,631 --> 01:23:59,464
personality makeup,
and you got to be careful not to place 

1557
01:24:01,091 --> 01:24:03,790
yourself in a position where that's 
going to be a fatal flaw.

1558
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:06,610
But what you really want to do as far as
I can tell,

1559
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:07,444
if you want to maximize your chances for
both success and let's say wellbeing is 

1560
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:12,814
you want to find a strata of occupation 
in which you would have an intelligence 

1561
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:18,190
that would put you in the upper core 
tile.

1562
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:19,803
That's perfect.
Then you're a big fish in a small pond 

1563
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:23,013
and you don't want to be this.
You don't want to be the stupidest guy 

1564
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:28,000
in the room.
It's a bloody rough place to be.

1565
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,343
So.
And you probably don't want to be the 

1566
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:30,994
smartest guy in the room either because 
what that probably means is you should 

1567
01:24:33,251 --> 01:24:34,960
be in a different room,
right?

1568
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:37,630
You should look at a place where if 
you're right at the top,

1569
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:41,020
it's you've mastered it.
It's time to go somewhere where you're a

1570
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:43,270
little lower so that you've got 
something to climb up for.

1571
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,600
So I can.
If you're not hyper conscientious,

1572
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:47,434
for example,
you're probably not going to want a job 

1573
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:49,324
that you have to work 70 hours a week at
because you're just not wired up that 

1574
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:52,504
way.
You'd rather have some leisure and like 

1575
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:56,080
more power to you if that's how you're 
wired up.

1576
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:57,820
There's nothing wrong with having some 
leisure,

1577
01:24:58,330 --> 01:25:02,500
but if you're someone who can't stand,
sitting around doing nothing ever,

1578
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,633
then maybe you can go into a job that's 
going to require you to work 75 hours a 

1579
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,234
week and almost all jobs that are at the
top of complex dominance hierarchies 

1580
01:25:10,241 --> 01:25:11,074
require very high intelligence and 
insane levels of conscientiousness as 

1581
01:25:14,591 --> 01:25:14,950
well.

1582
01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:15,783
Generally speaking,
as pretty damn high levels of stress 

1583
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:18,530
tolerance,
you know,

1584
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:19,413
because that can knock you out too 
because there's going to be sharp 

1585
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:25,360
fluctuations in your career generally 
speaking,

1586
01:25:25,361 --> 01:25:26,560
at the higher levels of,
uh,

1587
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:27,810
of a,
of a,

1588
01:25:28,030 --> 01:25:28,863
of a structure.
And you have to make very complicated 

1589
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:33,010
decisions often with very short time 
horizons.

1590
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,960
So you have to decide if that's what you
want.

1591
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:38,560
Okay?
So here's some ICU items.

1592
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,950
So this is,
this is from a task roughly.

1593
01:25:41,951 --> 01:25:42,784
It isn't from the direct test,
but it's an analog of the Raven's 

1594
01:25:45,131 --> 01:25:46,510
progressive matrices.
Now,

1595
01:25:46,511 --> 01:25:49,900
here's how the Ravens was derived.
So imagine that you have,

1596
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,393
you got your hundred questions and you 
can take out the some of those and call 

1597
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:56,710
that Iq.
Okay,

1598
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:57,544
so now you'll have a score.
Then you can do a correlation between 

1599
01:26:00,491 --> 01:26:01,324
all of the items and that and you can 
find out which single item is the best 

1600
01:26:06,981 --> 01:26:07,814
predictor of the total score because you
might see that question 39 has no 

1601
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:13,610
correlation with with the,
with the meat,

1602
01:26:13,611 --> 01:26:15,050
with the average.
You say,

1603
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:17,960
well that isn't a very good question.
You would actually throw that out of the

1604
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:19,460
next test,
but you'd say,

1605
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:24,461
well item number 15 is correlated at 
point seven five with a total score.

1606
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:25,563
So that's a good single item.
So then imagine that you went across 

1607
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:28,784
sets of Iq tests and you took out the 
best single item predictors of full 

1608
01:26:32,481 --> 01:26:36,020
scale Iq.
What you'd end up with is something like

1609
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:36,854
this.

1610
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:42,840
So the Raven's progressive matrices is a
very good test of fluid intelligence and

1611
01:26:42,841 --> 01:26:46,440
it's relatively non-linguistic,
which is also an advantage,

1612
01:26:46,441 --> 01:26:48,510
right?
Because imagine you wanted to assess the

1613
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:49,344
intelligence of a very diverse range of 
people and they all came from different 

1614
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:53,214
linguistic backgrounds.
Well as long as they can understand the 

1615
01:26:55,741 --> 01:26:58,230
instructions which are almost self 
evident,

1616
01:26:58,470 --> 01:26:59,490
then they're going to be able to do 
this.

1617
01:26:59,491 --> 01:27:00,330
Okay,
so this is,

1618
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:01,853
you see,
you have to guess case you didn't 

1619
01:27:04,711 --> 01:27:05,544
already figured this out,
which you would have had you been using 

1620
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:08,604
your intelligence and applying it.
You're trying to replace the question 

1621
01:27:10,921 --> 01:27:14,490
mark with one of these.
And so here's how you do it.

1622
01:27:14,491 --> 01:27:16,340
Roughly speaking,
it's also,

1623
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:17,353
it's probably a working memory task 
because you have to hold a variety of 

1624
01:27:19,561 --> 01:27:21,300
variables in imagination at the same 
time.

1625
01:27:21,301 --> 01:27:22,450
Okay.
So the first thing you think,

1626
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:25,410
see us,
every role has a star,

1627
01:27:25,411 --> 01:27:26,850
a triangle,
and a square.

1628
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:31,110
And each role has a dot,
two dots and three dots.

1629
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,510
And so every role has to have a 
triangle,

1630
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:37,320
square and star and one,
two or three dots.

1631
01:27:37,321 --> 01:27:38,250
Okay.
So this one,

1632
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,143
first of all,
what's it missing in terms of shape 

1633
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:42,870
triangle.
Excellent.

1634
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:45,360
See,
that's why you're at the UFT and then.

1635
01:27:45,810 --> 01:27:47,700
Okay.
And then what's it missing for dots?

1636
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,380
Two dots.
Excellent.

1637
01:27:49,381 --> 01:27:51,510
So we do a little scan here and we say,
oh look,

1638
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:53,940
well it could be that one or it could 
be.

1639
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,643
That's it.

1640
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,280
It's that one.
And so is that right?

1641
01:27:59,370 --> 01:28:00,810
Yes.
Aren't we smart?

1642
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,190
No,
that was easy.

1643
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:03,083
So No,
you're not very smart if you figured 

1644
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:06,120
that one out because pretty much 
everybody can figure that one out.

1645
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:11,450
I think this next one is more difficult.
Okay.

1646
01:28:18,731 --> 01:28:22,090
So in the first row you see that there's
two objects.

1647
01:28:22,420 --> 01:28:24,940
Each are different color and they move 
together,

1648
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,310
right?
They joined that one.

1649
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:29,940
There are separate there.
They joined,

1650
01:28:29,941 --> 01:28:31,060
they're together,
they're separate.

1651
01:28:31,061 --> 01:28:32,410
They're.
And they joined there.

1652
01:28:32,411 --> 01:28:35,890
So this one should be halfway in between
those two.

1653
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:41,100
And the other thing that happens is,
let's see up this item actually might be

1654
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:45,290
incorrectly represented because the blue
should be on the other side.

1655
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,303
Whatever.

1656
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:53,390
What's that
three?

1657
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:57,080
Yes.
Did they flip?

1658
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:00,031
Okay,
well anyways,

1659
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:00,864
you see that it's three.
See not very bright because I've 

1660
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,070
lectured for an hour.
Okay.

1661
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,790
So.
So that was a more difficult item.

1662
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:08,940
And then this one is more difficult if I
remember correctly.

1663
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:13,560
So let's see.
So they're all three different colors so

1664
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:14,403
it has to be color than what's the other
thing and the relationship between the 

1665
01:29:17,971 --> 01:29:20,640
colors change.
So what's the answer?

1666
01:29:22,860 --> 01:29:23,970
Pot.
You're all,

1667
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,830
you're all scared to answer,
aren't you?

1668
01:29:25,831 --> 01:29:26,664
Because you might be wrong and the more 
anxious people are even less likely to 

1669
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:33,570
answer number three.
Okay.

1670
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:34,404
So if you want to test someone's Iq,
then you put together a nice batch of 

1671
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:38,544
these at different levels of difficulty 
and then you sum them and then you rank 

1672
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:45,990
order and then you correct for age and 
then you have Iq and that's that.

1673
01:29:45,991 --> 01:29:46,824
And then you can say,
well then you can sort people into the 

1674
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:51,570
complexity of their occupations.
And isn't that dismal and wretched,

1675
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:54,630
but it's true.
So here you go.

1676
01:29:55,950 --> 01:29:56,783
This is from the wonderlic people.
There are commercial company that makes 

1677
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,593
general cognitive ability tests and it's
often used by corporations even though 

1678
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:07,920
it's actually illegal,
it's actually illegal to use Iq test,

1679
01:30:07,921 --> 01:30:08,850
but the wonderlic doesn't

1680
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,103
promote themselves as testing Iq.
I think they think it's general 

1681
01:30:14,211 --> 01:30:15,980
cognitive ability,
which is the same thing,

1682
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:19,160
but whatever the sats,
the Gres,

1683
01:30:19,161 --> 01:30:21,140
the Olsat,
all of those are Iq tests,

1684
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:25,760
so now they're more crystallized than 
fluid and we'll get to that in a minute,

1685
01:30:25,790 --> 01:30:28,370
but crystallized knowledge is what you 
accrue across type,

1686
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:32,060
so you could say that fluid intelligence
is what programs your brain,

1687
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,690
it fills it with facts.
Let's say it fills it with knowledge and

1688
01:30:35,691 --> 01:30:36,524
then,
but you can get an estimate of your 

1689
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:40,760
intelligence by sampling your domain of 
factual knowledge,

1690
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:41,953
and the reason for that is that while 
obviously the better the program or the 

1691
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:45,794
better the content,
and so what that also means is that you 

1692
01:30:47,781 --> 01:30:49,030
can.
You could,

1693
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:52,550
if your prefrontal cortex was damaged 
later in life,

1694
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:55,430
your fluid Iq could plummet,
but you're crystallized.

1695
01:30:55,431 --> 01:30:56,990
Iq remain more or less intact.

1696
01:30:57,320 --> 01:31:01,970
So even though they're not different,
one produces the other,

1697
01:31:01,971 --> 01:31:02,804
and then once the producer has produced,
then the producer can disappear and you 

1698
01:31:06,201 --> 01:31:11,030
still got the encoded knowledge.
So at least that's how it looks to me.

1699
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,133
So okay,
so how smart do you have to be to be 

1700
01:31:14,421 --> 01:31:16,100
different things in life?
Well,

1701
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:21,790
if you were to have an Iq of 116 to 130,
which is 85th percentile and above,

1702
01:31:23,841 --> 01:31:27,680
so it's one person in eight up to one 
person in 1:30,

1703
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:29,750
I believe is 85,
90 95.

1704
01:31:29,751 --> 01:31:31,730
Is it 95?
Ninety five,

1705
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,250
one person,
eight to one person in 20.

1706
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,353
Then you can be a attorney,
a research analyst and editor and 

1707
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:39,440
advertising manager,
a chemist,

1708
01:31:39,441 --> 01:31:41,870
an engineer and executive manager,
et Cetera.

1709
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:43,310
That's,
that's the,

1710
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,790
that's not the high end for ICU by the 
way.

1711
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,280
It can go up.
Well,

1712
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:50,114
it can go up indefinitely,
although there's fewer and fewer people 

1713
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:52,904
as it goes up.

1714
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:56,000
So if you want to be the best at what 
you're doing,

1715
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:57,403
bar none,
then having an Iq of above 145 is a 

1716
01:32:00,251 --> 01:32:01,084
necessity and maybe you're pushing one 
60 in some situations and maybe that's 

1717
01:32:04,061 --> 01:32:04,894
make me make a new one person in 10,000 
or even one person in 100,000 and then 

1718
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,274
also to really be good at it.
You probably have to be reasonably 

1719
01:32:12,011 --> 01:32:14,170
stress tolerant and also somewhat 
conscientious,

1720
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:15,243
so people think,
well why is it that smart people are at 

1721
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:20,314
the top of dominance hierarchies and the
answer to that in part is because they 

1722
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:24,130
get their first,
right.

1723
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:26,590
I mean everything's a race roughly 
speaking,

1724
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:27,723
and the faster you are,
the more likely you are to be at the 

1725
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:32,980
forefront of the pack.
And intelligence in large part is speed.

1726
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:33,873
That's not all of it is.
So if you're moving towards something 

1727
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:39,340
difficult rapidly,
the faster people are going to get there

1728
01:32:39,341 --> 01:32:42,850
first.
So Iq of 1:15,

1729
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,650
1:10 to 1:15,
so that's 80,

1730
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:45,700
fifth to 70,
30,

1731
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:48,040
85th percentile.
Copywriter,

1732
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,150
accountant,
manager,

1733
01:32:49,151 --> 01:32:51,910
sales manager,
sales analysts,

1734
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,130
general manager,
person,

1735
01:32:53,170 --> 01:32:54,790
purchasing agent,
registered nurse,

1736
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:58,660
sales account executive.
If you look at universities,

1737
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,880
the smartest people are.
They're above this.

1738
01:33:00,881 --> 01:33:02,380
Who are the smartest people at 
University?

1739
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:03,603
What do you think?

1740
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,670
Mathematicians,
physicists,

1741
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:07,750
and mathematicians.
Right?

1742
01:33:08,050 --> 01:33:10,360
Right.
I can tell you who's on the other end,

1743
01:33:10,361 --> 01:33:14,950
but I won't.
Yeah,

1744
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:16,720
I'd like to though.
Anyway.

1745
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:18,590
Anyways.
Okay.

1746
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:22,900
Going down the wonder three to one a way
to slightly above average rate,

1747
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:25,600
60th to 70th percentile,
store manager,

1748
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,800
bookkeeper,
credit clerk,

1749
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:28,300
lab tester,
general sales,

1750
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:29,770
telephone sales,
accounting clerk,

1751
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:31,840
computer operator,
customer service Rep,

1752
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:32,710
technician,
clerk,

1753
01:33:32,711 --> 01:33:35,260
typist.
So you see at this level people are.

1754
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,273
People have some technical skill and 
some ability to deal with complex 

1755
01:33:38,981 --> 01:33:39,820
things.
Okay,

1756
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:44,530
that's dead.
Average hundred is average dispatcher in

1757
01:33:44,531 --> 01:33:47,050
a general office,
police patrol officer,

1758
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:48,880
receptionist,
cashier,

1759
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:51,430
general clerical inside sales clerk 
meter reader,

1760
01:33:51,431 --> 01:33:52,750
printer teller,
data entry,

1761
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:53,650
electrical helper,

1762
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,460
95th to 98 machinists,
food department manager,

1763
01:33:59,461 --> 01:34:00,600
quality control,
check,

1764
01:34:00,620 --> 01:34:02,880
security guard,
unskilled labor maintenance,

1765
01:34:02,881 --> 01:34:03,481
arc,
welder,

1766
01:34:03,481 --> 01:34:05,250
die setter mechanic.
Good,

1767
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,370
good Iq range for relatively qualified 
tradespeople.

1768
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:13,890
80 seven to 93 messenger,
factory production worker Assembler,

1769
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:15,480
food service worker,
nurses aid,

1770
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:16,920
warehouseman,
custodian,

1771
01:34:16,921 --> 01:34:18,270
janitor,
material handler,

1772
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:20,100
packer.
Now what you're seeing,

1773
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:22,710
what you're starting to see is that as 
you move down the hierarchy,

1774
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,083
the jobs get simpler.
They're more likely to be assigned by 

1775
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:26,724
other people or the repetitive because 
what Iq predicts to some degree is how 

1776
01:34:31,681 --> 01:34:34,150
rapidly you can learn something,
but once you've learned it,

1777
01:34:34,151 --> 01:34:36,840
it doesn't predict how necessarily how 
well you do at it,

1778
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:41,940
and so the more repetitive jobs,
10 people with lower iqs are more suited

1779
01:34:41,941 --> 01:34:45,690
to more repetitive jobs under 87.
Is there something?

1780
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:47,400
Well,
no,

1781
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:50,123
right,
that's a big problem and it's something 

1782
01:34:52,291 --> 01:34:57,291
our society has not addressed at all.
Jobs for people with our of less than 85

1783
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:59,810
are very,
very rare.

1784
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:02,420
So what the hell are those people 
supposed to do?

1785
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:05,480
It's like one,
it's 15 percent of the population.

1786
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,810
What are they supposed to do?
Well,

1787
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:09,793
we better figure it out because one of 
the things that's happening too is that 

1788
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:12,974
as the,
as the High Iq tech geeks get a hold of 

1789
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:16,724
the world,
the demand for cognitive power is 

1790
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:19,940
increasing,
not decreasing,

1791
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:21,320
right?
You want to be a teller.

1792
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:23,540
Well,
you know those checkout machines,

1793
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:26,510
they're not so simple.
You want to work at Mcdonald's.

1794
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:27,344
You think that's a simple job.
You don't see robots working at 

1795
01:35:28,911 --> 01:35:29,744
Mcdonald's and the reason for that is 
that what Mcdonald's workers do is too 

1796
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:36,560
complex for for robots to do so

1797
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:40,943
well.
So this is a discussion that no one 

1798
01:35:41,971 --> 01:35:43,380
wants to have,
but that's okay.

1799
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:46,530
It's still a problem and it has to be 
dealt with.

1800
01:35:46,770 --> 01:35:47,603
So the US government,
I think I told you this at one point 

1801
01:35:49,381 --> 01:35:50,214
already,
it's illegal to induct anyone into the 

1802
01:35:51,961 --> 01:35:54,300
US army if they have an Iq of less than 
83,

1803
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,793
right?
It's about 10 percent of the population 

1804
01:35:58,530 --> 01:35:59,363
because the US army and they'd been 
doing Iq testing since Iq testing began 

1805
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,263
because they want everybody they can 
possibly get into the army because in 

1806
01:36:06,631 --> 01:36:07,464
peace time they use it as a way of 
moving people up the socioeconomic 

1807
01:36:10,201 --> 01:36:13,830
ladder and in war time.
Well obviously you need as many soldiers

1808
01:36:13,831 --> 01:36:14,664
as you can get your hands on and so 
you're not going to be any pickier than 

1809
01:36:18,001 --> 01:36:20,210
you have to be.
So when the U,

1810
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:23,580
s army says it's illegal to induct 
anybody into the armed forces.

1811
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,413
If they have an Iq of less than 83,
then you know that they've done it for 

1812
01:36:26,911 --> 01:36:29,280
absolute necessity.
Right?

1813
01:36:29,281 --> 01:36:30,114
And when people have made a finding that
contradicts what they want to hear and 

1814
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:35,520
they're doing it out of absolute 
necessity,

1815
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,473
you can be reasonably true that it's one
of those facts that just won't bloody 

1816
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,680
well go away.
And so you might think,

1817
01:36:40,681 --> 01:36:41,514
well,
if there's nothing for someone with an 

1818
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:43,524
Iq of less than 83 to do in the army,
what makes you think that there's 

1819
01:36:46,021 --> 01:36:48,090
something that they can do in the 
general population?

1820
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:51,450
And then the issue is because the 
Conservatives will say,

1821
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:53,460
well,
they should just work harder.

1822
01:36:53,461 --> 01:36:54,091
It's like,
sorry,

1823
01:36:54,091 --> 01:36:56,040
that ain't gonna fly,
and the liberals will say,

1824
01:36:56,041 --> 01:36:56,874
well,
there's no difference between people 

1825
01:36:57,810 --> 01:36:58,643
anyhow and you can just train people to 
do everything that's wrong so they're 

1826
01:37:01,861 --> 01:37:04,020
both wrong and they're seriously wrong.

1827
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:07,380
And the fact that neither side of the 
political perspective,

1828
01:37:07,381 --> 01:37:08,214
we'll take a good cold hard look at this
problem means that we're going to 

1829
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:11,904
increasingly have a structural problem 
in our societies because we're 

1830
01:37:14,311 --> 01:37:15,144
complexifying everything so rapidly that
you can't find employment unless 

1831
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:21,180
increasingly,
unless you're intelligent,

1832
01:37:21,181 --> 01:37:22,860
you guys are really going to face this.
You know,

1833
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:23,843
lawyers are disappearing like mad.
And the reason for that is you can look 

1834
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:29,430
it up online.
Increasingly.

1835
01:37:29,431 --> 01:37:31,500
You can do things yourself if you're 
smart.

1836
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:32,813
And so like the working class people 
have been wiped out pretty nicely over 

1837
01:37:35,461 --> 01:37:38,910
the last 30 years by by automation and 
various other things.

1838
01:37:39,150 --> 01:37:42,390
It's the low end of the white collar 
class that's coming up next.

1839
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:44,910
So I'm not saying that lawyers are in 
the low end,

1840
01:37:44,911 --> 01:37:48,750
but low end lawyers are in the low end 
of the white collar class.

1841
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:50,003
So there's still going to be plenty of 
positions for people who are creative 

1842
01:37:52,321 --> 01:37:55,050
and fast on their feet and super smart.
In fact,

1843
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,063
people are going to have all the money 
that's already happening to a great 

1844
01:37:58,711 --> 01:37:59,670
degree,
you know,

1845
01:37:59,950 --> 01:38:02,190
because if you're smart and you can use 
a computer,

1846
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:04,650
you're so smart.
It's just absolutely unbelievable.

1847
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:07,440
Right.
And if you can't use a computer and lots

1848
01:38:07,441 --> 01:38:10,260
of people,
and I don't mean you can open word,

1849
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:12,210
that isn't what I mean.
I mean maybe,

1850
01:38:12,211 --> 01:38:13,044
I mean you can program and if you can't 
program while you're right at the next 

1851
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:19,440
and so if you haven't got that with you,
you're,

1852
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,360
you're going to be left behind.

1853
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:28,020
Oh,
a lot of them will take demerol.

1854
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,510
That's what's happening in the United 
States.

1855
01:38:30,690 --> 01:38:31,590
Yeah,
it's an opiate.

1856
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,353
Yeah.
So there's a massive drug problem 

1857
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:35,484
emerging and.

1858
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:39,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

1859
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:39,921
No,
I'm telling you,

1860
01:38:39,921 --> 01:38:41,090
that is what's happening there.

1861
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:45,740
Yes.
Drugs.

1862
01:38:46,730 --> 01:38:48,380
Yeah.
Drugs of abuse.

1863
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,083
Well,
that what,

1864
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:56,570
what is happening to a large degree is 
people drop out of the employment race.

1865
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,150
They get very depressed.
They develop chronic pain problems,

1866
01:38:59,151 --> 01:38:59,984
especially if they're men,
because chronic pain and depression are 

1867
01:39:02,361 --> 01:39:03,194
very much the same thing.
And then they subsist on opiates which 

1868
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,900
are subsidized by Medicaid in the US.
I'm not kidding about this.

1869
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:10,460
This is exactly what's happening.
What,

1870
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:13,280
what else is going to happen to people 
for whom there is nothing to do.

1871
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:16,310
They have a terrible time,
especially if they're conscientious.

1872
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:23,030
That's a good question.
You know the Ai guys are pushing hard on

1873
01:39:23,031 --> 01:39:23,720
this.
Hey,

1874
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:27,590
what's the biggest employment category

1875
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,880
driver?
Think about it.

1876
01:39:32,620 --> 01:39:33,453
What's Tesla doing?
What are all the ai guys working on as 

1877
01:39:35,921 --> 01:39:38,860
fast as they possibly can?
Driverless cars,

1878
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:39,993
no problem.
Except that's the biggest employment 

1879
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:43,630
category for men.
So what are those guys going to do?

1880
01:39:45,070 --> 01:39:45,903
Yeah,
they're going to sit home and be 

1881
01:39:46,811 --> 01:39:47,644
miserable with their wives and take 
opiates because they have chronic pain 

1882
01:39:49,511 --> 01:39:50,800
problems,
right?

1883
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:52,450
Nasty,
and you might think,

1884
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:53,284
well,
could they think of something else to 

1885
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:55,480
do?
Well,

1886
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:56,763
if you have an Iq of 83 or less,
you're not going to be doing a lot of 

1887
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:01,060
thinking about something else to do.
You know?

1888
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:03,470
That isn't how it works because you're 
more of a.

1889
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:07,090
you're an act person,
not a thinking person,

1890
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,790
roughly speaking,
you know,

1891
01:40:08,791 --> 01:40:11,680
and so if you have a task at hand,
especially if you're conscientious,

1892
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,250
you can diligently go about it,
but you know,

1893
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:15,093
I've tried to train people with Iqs of 
80 and less to do what I would consider 

1894
01:40:20,410 --> 01:40:21,243
tasks that,
that one of you could learn to do in 10 

1895
01:40:23,561 --> 01:40:24,394
minutes and never make a mistake again.
And it's like tens of hours with bare 

1896
01:40:28,601 --> 01:40:33,580
minimum mastery of the tasks.
So it's ugly situation,

1897
01:40:33,610 --> 01:40:36,750
no doubt about it.
Okay.

1898
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:40,740
Openness.
So creativity.

1899
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,113
Oh

1900
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:45,880
well I can talk more about this on,
on,

1901
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:46,883
on Thursday.
Maybe we'll just stop and I'll go into 

1902
01:40:48,541 --> 01:40:51,540
creativity on Thursday.
So we've got about five minutes.

1903
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:52,374
So if anyone has a question,
I'd be more than happy to entertain a 

1904
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:56,470
question.
So it did it.

1905
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:57,333
What I tell you what you need.
We're in a technical area to some 

1906
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:00,761
degree,
right?

1907
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:01,594
So you need to understand how these 
tests come about because you can't 

1908
01:41:03,581 --> 01:41:05,770
understand the concepts without 
understanding it.

1909
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:07,023
So I'm hoping that the way I told you 
that the Iq tests were derived made 

1910
01:41:09,821 --> 01:41:11,140
sense.
I mean,

1911
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:11,993
it's a fairly straightforward thing,
but that's what you want to concentrate 

1912
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:14,584
on.
You had a question?

1913
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:20,110
Yep.
Yep.

1914
01:41:24,220 --> 01:41:26,650
You can't change.
You can't train simple reaction time.

1915
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:31,090
It's really hard.
You talk about very rapidly and it here.

1916
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:33,430
But let's take your question a little 
further.

1917
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:35,020
So let's say,

1918
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,513
um,

1919
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:40,710
Iq predicts how fast you'll master of 
video game.

1920
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,080
So then,
and it does.

1921
01:41:43,110 --> 01:41:45,690
So then let's say we're going to train 
the hell out of you on a video game.

1922
01:41:45,691 --> 01:41:48,540
So you get super good at it and then 
you'll get like tetris.

1923
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:49,770
You know,
everyone.

1924
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:51,630
Does everyone know what Tetris is?
Okay,

1925
01:41:51,631 --> 01:41:52,464
well,
this is really an I an Iq test for all 

1926
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:57,240
intents and purposes.
It's spacial rotation test.

1927
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:59,580
So you can get really good at Tetris,
right?

1928
01:41:59,581 --> 01:42:00,001
And you think,
hey,

1929
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:01,740
my Iq is increasing.
It's like,

1930
01:42:01,741 --> 01:42:02,790
well,
here's the problem.

1931
01:42:03,450 --> 01:42:08,450
Let's say I produce a variant of Tetris 
that requires that the idea is basically

1932
01:42:09,481 --> 01:42:11,220
the same,
but it requires different operations.

1933
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,950
Being good at Tetris won't help you be 
good at that test.

1934
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:15,143
You don't get crossover.
And people have been trying this for a 

1935
01:42:17,401 --> 01:42:18,181
long time.
It's like,

1936
01:42:18,181 --> 01:42:19,014
well,
maybe you could practice a bunch of Iq 

1937
01:42:19,861 --> 01:42:21,210
tests and you'd get better.

1938
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,691
It's like,
no,

1939
01:42:21,691 --> 01:42:23,460
you get better on the Iq test,
you practice,

1940
01:42:23,461 --> 01:42:28,461
but you don't get better on Iq tests and
you see even fluid,

1941
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:29,513
you can't move it.
And there are people who come up with 

1942
01:42:31,261 --> 01:42:33,750
claims all the time.
Like the lumosity people.

1943
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:34,670
It's like,
well,

1944
01:42:34,670 --> 01:42:36,720
here's a bunch of complex.
So then they thought,

1945
01:42:36,721 --> 01:42:39,720
look,
practice one test.

1946
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:40,673
That doesn't work to make you smarter.
So then practice a whole bunch of tests 

1947
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:47,430
and then maybe what you learned across 
all the tests will make you smarter.

1948
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:48,653
No,
it doesn't work and it really sucks 

1949
01:42:50,791 --> 01:42:51,624
because one of the things you'd hope is 
that once you had extracted out a 

1950
01:42:54,421 --> 01:42:55,254
central factor for intelligence that you
could get people to practice the micro 

1951
01:42:58,531 --> 01:43:01,530
skills that were associated with it and 
it would boost icu.

1952
01:43:01,830 --> 01:43:06,420
It's like it doesn't work and you know,
about every five years someone comes out

1953
01:43:06,421 --> 01:43:07,470
with a claim that says,
hey,

1954
01:43:07,471 --> 01:43:09,930
we've developed a new test and if you 
just do this test,

1955
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:10,913
you'll get smarter.
And then someone tested out and they 

1956
01:43:13,201 --> 01:43:17,070
usually use the Raven's progressive 
matrices as the marker and they show no,

1957
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:17,904
it's the same thing.
Domain specific knowledge doesn't 

1958
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:23,010
generalize to other areas.
So it's a hell of a thing if you,

1959
01:43:23,011 --> 01:43:25,200
if you can figure out how to raise 
people's fluid Iq,

1960
01:43:25,201 --> 01:43:26,034
you will be a billionaire,
but you won't be able to do it because 

1961
01:43:28,351 --> 01:43:30,130
it looks like it's impossible,
but you never know,

1962
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:30,691
you know,
you know,

1963
01:43:30,691 --> 01:43:32,220
maybe someone will crack it at some 
point,

1964
01:43:32,221 --> 01:43:34,320
but we certainly haven't yet.
So

1965
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,440
no transfer?
No.

1966
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:41,923
There's no generally no.
No generalizability of a specific skill 

1967
01:43:44,601 --> 01:43:46,880
to ICU.
So,

1968
01:43:46,881 --> 01:43:49,290
you know,
if you practice one thing and it,

1969
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,353
there's something that you're doing 
that's close that there's going to be 

1970
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:52,784
some generalizability.
It's Kinda hard to define what close 

1971
01:43:54,981 --> 01:43:59,981
means though.
Pro Pro.

1972
01:44:01,510 --> 01:44:02,410
Well,
it depends on.

1973
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:04,900
It would depend on how big the factor 
you changed was.

1974
01:44:04,901 --> 01:44:06,910
But the general rule of thumb is no 
transfer.

1975
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:08,193
Yes.

1976
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,070
Oh yeah.
The higher the Higher Iq.

1977
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:22,560
Oh yeah.
The Higher Iq person will lose and learn

1978
01:44:22,561 --> 01:44:25,170
the new thing faster.
Pretty much no matter what it is.

1979
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:26,730
Yes,
yes.

1980
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:29,490
But even so then you might think,
well,

1981
01:44:29,491 --> 01:44:32,160
what if you practice learning a bunch of
new things fast,

1982
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:34,530
would that make you faster at learning 
new things?

1983
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:37,470
And the answer is a,
people are doing that all the time.

1984
01:44:37,590 --> 01:44:41,190
So you're probably maxed out on that to 
some degree and be no,

1985
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:43,260
it won't.
So.

1986
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:45,210
And it,
believe me,

1987
01:44:45,211 --> 01:44:46,044
people have tried this for a long time,
so and for good reason and we haven't 

1988
01:44:50,101 --> 01:44:51,000
got anywhere.
Yes,

1989
01:44:52,360 --> 01:44:53,193
Yep.

1990
01:44:58,870 --> 01:45:01,400
Yeah.
The language one is tougher because like

1991
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:06,540
if you say say you learn two languages,
can you pick up the third faster and.

1992
01:45:06,630 --> 01:45:07,463
Well the answer is how it depends on how
linguistically close the new languages 

1993
01:45:12,061 --> 01:45:15,210
to the two that you've already learned.
And then if you learn 30,

1994
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:20,370
you can probably learn a new one in like
two days because once you've learned 30,

1995
01:45:20,371 --> 01:45:21,204
you've covered the domain of languages.
So the language issue is a little bit 

1996
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:24,624
more complex because languages have a 
fair bit of commonality in their 

1997
01:45:27,391 --> 01:45:29,220
underlying structure.
So,

1998
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:30,113
but you don't learn one language faster 
after you've learned three because 

1999
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:33,534
you've got smarter,
you learn one language faster after 

2000
01:45:35,881 --> 01:45:38,250
you've learned three,
because you know more about languages.

2001
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:39,730
So.
Okay,

2002
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:43,650
we should stop.
We'll see you Thursday.
