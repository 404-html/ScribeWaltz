1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,223
It's possible that you guys have been 
following this political and economic 

2
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:07,864
news from the Ukraine,
so it says here that this is off CBC in 

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:15,934
a clear warning to Ukraine.
Putin on Wednesday ordered massive 

4
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:22,720
military exercises involving most of the
military units in western Russia

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,083
on Thursday as part of the exercises.
Fighter jets were put on combat alert 

6
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,194
and we're patrolling the border.
Russia's defense ministry said in the 

7
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,534
statement it didn't specify the areas 
where patrol missions were being 

8
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:36,484
conducted.
The military also announced measures to 

9
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,054
tightened security at the headquarters 
of Russia's Black Sea Fleet on the 

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,730
Crimean Peninsula and south eastern 
Ukraine.

11
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,983
There's a rumor that I believe,
I believe it was [inaudible] gave the 

12
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:52,324
Crimea to the Ukraine when he was drunk.
The military maneuvers prompted a sharp 

13
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:00,790
rebuke from us,
secretary of state,

14
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,624
John Kerry,
who warned Russia that any military 

15
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:06,790
intervention in Ukraine would be a grave
mistake.

16
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,310
So
why did I tell you that?

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,650
Well,
it's,

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,483
it's for the same reason that I've been 
conducting these last few lectures on 

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,420
phenomenal logical and existential ideas
in psychotherapy and I think I mentioned

20
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:35,380
to you that these ideas are often not 
covered anymore in personality classes,

21
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,910
but I think that's a big mistake because
I think that these theories have more to

22
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:40,744
tell us about
what happened in the 20th century than 

23
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,920
any other theories that I've ever come 
across.

24
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:50,080
And that's very important because

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,393
that,

26
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,263
that terrible mass movements of the 20th
century occurred because of the nature 

27
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,970
of people's personality and it's a 
mistake to concentrate on.

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,710
It's a mistake not to concentrate on 
factors that play that massive a role in

29
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,800
determining the destiny of the entire 
world.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,270
And you know it.
It may seem to you that the Soviet Union

31
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,750
is a long ways away since it collapsed 
in 1989,

32
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,050
but there's no evidence that we're done 
with it yet.

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,360
I mean,
potent was a kgb officer and the KGB was

34
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,194
the Soviet secret service and the Soviet
secret service was one catastrophic Lee 

35
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,014
awful organization
and the tension that's occurring in the 

36
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:42,414
Ukraine right now that looks like it 
might explode into civil war and 

37
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,764
hopefully not is still a consequence of 
the remnants of the pathologies that 

38
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,840
dominated the Soviet Union for for most 
of the 20th century.

39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,203
It isn't clear to me that we've really 
learned what we had to learn from what 

40
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:09,350
happened in Nazi Germany say and in 
Mao's China,

41
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:13,670
which is obviously still run by the 
communist party or in the Soviet Union.

42
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:17,990
Even though there's been a reprieve for 
the last 35 years or so.

43
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,140
Meet you in particular,

44
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,430
predicted what was going to happen in 
the 20th century.

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,350
I'm going to read you something that he 
wrote.

46
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,740
I'm going to try to tell you today why 
the events in the 20th century happened.

47
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:38,740
So the mass genocidal movements in 
particular,

48
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,574
which were probably the defining 
characteristic of the 20th century and 

49
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:46,690
then also what that has to do with 
individual psychology.

50
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,773
My first degree was in political science
and I was interested in political 

51
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,544
science because I was interested 
fundamentally and the reason that human 

52
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:59,080
societies went to war and when I was 
studying political science,

53
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,914
which is quite a long time ago,
the fundamental theory that underlie 

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,193
political scientists,
explanations for conflict or economic 

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,553
people fight over resources and that 
never seemed reasonable to me because 

56
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,940
first of all,
obviously many wars are fought for other

57
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,050
reasons than resources.
Um,

58
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,030
to Central American countries.
I think it was Guatemala and Honduras,

59
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,850
if I remember correctly,
went to war over a soccer game.

60
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,160
So the outcome of the disputed,
the disputed outcome of a soccer game.

61
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,280
And even if you do think that the reason
that people,

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,300
groups of people engage in conflict are 
for economic reasons.

63
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,343
That doesn't exactly explain much 
because that doesn't explain whether 

64
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,424
they are fighting for because of 
absolute differences in wealth or 

65
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:50,810
because of relative discrepancies and 
wealth and those.

66
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,780
Those are very,
very different causal elements.

67
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,900
And then even if people do fight for 
economic reasons,

68
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:58,000
which means they're fighting for things 
that they value,

69
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,013
it isn't exactly clear why people value 
what they value because different 

70
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,704
societies value different things.
So economics in the final analysis ends 

71
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,504
up being a shallow explanation and I 
pursued economic and political and 

72
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:15,070
sociological explanations for social 
conflict for a long time.

73
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:17,740
But eventually they became untenable to 
me.

74
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:21,280
And that's partly why I went and studied
clinical psychology because it struck me

75
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,114
that the right level of analysis for 
understanding mass movements like the 

76
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,374
Nazi movement or the or the the 
ideological possession that 

77
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:35,401
characterized the Stalinist Soviet 
communists or or or Pol Pot's,

78
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,374
Cambodian communists or any of the 
dictators that you can talk about who 

79
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,980
are on the far left or the far right 
during the 20th century.

80
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,203
To me,
those were failings of individual 

81
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,423
personality and the most astute writers 
that I've ever read who described what 

82
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:59,251
they assume to be the causes of these 
terrible conflicts made the same point.

83
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:00,494
Which is why I'm having you read Viktor 
Frankl and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 

84
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,680
associates and is not generally regarded
as a personality psychologist.

85
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,100
But he,
of all the people I've ever read,

86
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:10,934
he's the one who lays out the connection
between the existential failure of the 

87
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:19,370
individual and the mass catastrophes of 
society.

88
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,190
And to me that's too important to link 
to overlook.

89
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:24,380
And it.
It also strikes me that it's the primary

90
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:28,850
lesson of the 20th century mean.
One lesson for example,

91
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,684
is beware of videology.
So the reason I'm going to walk you 

92
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:33,134
through Nea Chin,
a bit of Kierkegaard today is because 

93
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,643
these people in the late 19th century 
with their antennas up knew that the 

94
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:42,950
collapse,
one way of looking at is the collapse of

95
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,330
traditional Western values.

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,193
That's one way of looking at what setup 
the preconditions for the people's 

97
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,883
humanity.
Susceptibility to dog is in the 20th 

98
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,850
centuries,
in the 20th century.

99
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:56,684
The other way of looking at it in some 
senses that as the world came together 

100
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:00,824
in the 19th century and ideas were 
passed around from culture to culture 

101
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,950
more rapidly than they had ever been 
passed around.

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,690
Every culture suffered.
D culturation in some sense because if I

103
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,524
believe something and you believe 
something and there's a long history 

104
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,404
behind both of our beliefs,
when we come into contact with will 

105
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,080
either fight and I'll try to destroy you
or or if I don't,

106
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:23,120
if I take you seriously and you take me 
seriously,

107
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,954
then that's going to leave us both 
wondering exactly what's what's rock 

108
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:27,644
solid underneath us.
That's what needs to comments on on in 

109
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,610
this particular quilt
of what is Great.

110
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:37,880
One either must be silent or speak with 
greatness,

111
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,890
with greatness.
That means cynically in with innocence.

112
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,130
What I relate is the history of the next
two centuries.

113
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,880
I described what is coming,
what can no longer come differently?

114
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,060
The advent of nihilism.
Nihilism is the belief that nothing

115
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,960
or the belief that things have no 
meaning.

116
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,543
Our whole European culture is moving for
some time now with a tortured tension 

117
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:09,420
that is growing from decade to decade as
towards a catastrophe

118
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,843
restlessly violently and headlong like a
river that wants to reach the end that 

119
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:18,630
no longer reflects it,
is afraid to reflect.

120
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,283
He that speaks here has conversely done 
nothing so far but to reflect as a 

121
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,544
fellow philosopher and solitary by 
instinct who has found his advantage in 

122
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:33,260
standing,
aside outside,

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,350
why has the event advent of nihilism 
become necessary

124
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,013
because the values we have had hitherto 
thus draw their final consequence 

125
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,753
because nihilism represents the ultimate
logical conclusion of our great values 

126
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,324
and ideals.
Because we must experience nihilism 

127
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,090
before we can find out what value those 
values really

128
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,560
we require at some time.
New Values.

129
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Nihilism stands at the door.
Whence comes this uncanny first of all,

130
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:05,974
guests

131
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,050
point of departure.

132
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,763
It's an error to consider social 
distress or physiological degeneration 

133
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,460
or corruption of all things as the cause
of nihilism.

134
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,910
Ours is the most honest and 
compassionate age,

135
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,503
so Nisha dispenses right away with 
sociological explanations for people's 

136
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,090
lack of belief in meaning in life.
You know what?

137
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,953
A lot of what you're taught in 
universities is sociological in its 

138
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:38,324
causal thinking that the causal path is 
often that's the social conditions that 

139
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:46,370
people find themselves in that 
determined their response to the world,

140
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:49,700
but niches stands violently against that
perspective.

141
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:50,534
And this is 150 years ago,
even before in some sense it was 

142
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:53,444
thoroughly well developed and the reason
he stands against it is because he 

143
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:02,110
points out that
wherever you're positioned in society,

144
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,770
your position can be made subject to any
number of individual interpretations.

145
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,040
It's meaning like the meaning of being 
poor,

146
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:12,874
say,
or the meaning of being comparatively 

147
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:17,580
poor isn't a meaning that's etched in 
stone and so it.

148
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,670
It has to be interpreted psychologically
before it can become a causal factor,

149
00:10:21,671 --> 00:10:23,290
and if it can be interpreted 
psychologically,

150
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,320
then it's not a fact like the existence 
of a mountain is a fact.

151
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,000
It's still an interpretation.

152
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,520
He says,
distress itself,

153
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,100
whether psychic,
psychological,

154
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,934
physical,
or intellectual also need not produce 

155
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,664
nihilism.
So he also reject suffering itself as a 

156
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,510
cause of nihilism.

157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,580
Need not at all produced nihilism.
That is the radical rejection of value,

158
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,414
meaning and desirability.
Such distress always permits a variety 

159
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:51,834
of interpretations.
Rather it is in one particular 

160
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:56,184
interpretation.
The Christian moral nihilism is rooted 

161
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,743
the end of Christianity at the hands of 
its own morality which cannot be 

162
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:06,780
replaced,
which turns against the Christian God.

163
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,943
The sense of truthfulness,
highly developed by Christianity is 

164
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:11,394
nauseated by the falseness and 
mendacious snus of all Christian 

165
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:18,531
interpretations of the world and of 
history to rebound from God is the truth

166
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,790
to the fanatical faith,
all his false and active

167
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,500
Buddhism.
So it's a strange interpretation because

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Nietzsche,
although he was violently anti Christian

169
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:30,450
in his,
in his,

170
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,810
in his what in his self presentation to 
the public was more like a,

171
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,080
in my opinion,
was more like a beneficial critic of,

172
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,213
of the,
of the western Christian tradition and 

173
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,663
because the first thing he realized was 
that the domination of the West by 

174
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,943
essentially by the Catholic church for 
something like 1900 years was necessary 

175
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:54,394
in order for,
for the European mind to become trained 

176
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:01,360
and focused.
So his point was that you,

177
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,543
unless you learn to place an 
interpretive scheme on the world and 

178
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:08,590
interpret that world in a coherent 
manner through that scheme,

179
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,510
you don't have a trained mind.
And,

180
00:12:11,511 --> 00:12:11,891
and,
and,

181
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,724
and for Nietzsche in some sense,
it didn't really matter what the 

182
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:15,964
interpretive scheme was.
It was just that at some point you had 

183
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,630
to discipline yourself.

184
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,740
And this would be something like a post 
adolescent process you had to discipline

185
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:28,360
yourself by developing an adherence to 
some sort of coherent deep,

186
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:31,060
coherent view and the consequence of 
that,

187
00:12:31,061 --> 00:12:34,210
at least in principle,
could be that you would be this.

188
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,490
You could come to be the sort of person 
that would,

189
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,533
that would be respectful of the truth 
and also someone who was who regarded 

190
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,640
truth as a,
as a moral virtue,

191
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,170
as a higher order,
more virtual,

192
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,423
but then he just point was that 
Christianity developed that sense in 

193
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,114
Europe to such a degree that the spirit 
of truth seeking went after the axioms 

194
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:58,930
of Christianity and demolished them.
That was his view of what happened

195
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,623
during the enlightenment as a 
consequence of the interaction between 

196
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,950
science and religion.
So

197
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,080
Nietzsche's view was that the modern 
mind will say,

198
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,914
because we're speaking 150 years later,
the modern mind had been trained 

199
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,630
rigorously to interpret things through a
coherent structure.

200
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,120
And then once that training had 
occurred,

201
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,820
then it could use any number of coherent
structures.

202
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:29,260
And then it could also use it's ability 
to form a relationship with the truth.

203
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,303
To criticize the very thing that gave 
rise to that mind and that and that 

204
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,510
Nietzsche's diagnosis of the 20th 
century individual,

205
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,923
a pursuit of truth itself had undermined
the structure that gave birth to the 

206
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,360
pursuit of truth and that left people 
wide open and left them wide open.

207
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,080
On the one hand to nihilism and nihilism
is the belief that nothing has meaning.

208
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,393
Nothing has any final meeting and the 
best way of expressing nihilism is what 

209
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,380
the hell difference is it going to make 
in a,

210
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:00,250
in a thousand years what we do today or 
in 100 years for that matter,

211
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,370
and it's a real.
It's a rational reduction of,

212
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,950
of all of the experiences of life to,
to,

213
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,510
to rational insignificance.

214
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,463
Nothing has any final meaning.
And so the question of course that 

215
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,190
emerges from that is,
well,

216
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:18,270
why do anything on a deeper question 
that emerges for that?

217
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,570
From that is,
well,

218
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:24,571
why bear suffering?
And but that's not the only problem from

219
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:29,410
an existential point of view because the
existentialists and niches,

220
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,303
well also believed that nihilism was 
actually unbearable because people 

221
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:37,090
suffer.
They have to have a framework of meaning

222
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,260
in which to place the suffering because 
otherwise it undermines their ability to

223
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:46,261
live and then people can't move forward 
in that condition,

224
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,750
and so another one of Nietzsche's 
prognostications was that nihilism would

225
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:53,564
produce its counterpart which was 
totalitarianism and people would leap 

226
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,670
from their immersion,
say in in,

227
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,563
in,
in evolutionarily emergent systems of 

228
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:08,231
faith and jump head long into rational 
utopian constructions of reality because

229
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,104
you,
because people can't do without an 

230
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:14,054
interpretive framework,
so it wasn't as if the consequence of 

231
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,010
moving beyond religion was going to be a
step into enlightenment,

232
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,940
which is what materialist rationalist 
all's was presumed.

233
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,773
They presume if you could just shed the 
superstitious clap trap that's 

234
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:32,570
associated with your religious heritage,
you'd instantly be enlightened,

235
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,890
but niches point was that is not what's 
likely to happen.

236
00:15:36,891 --> 00:15:38,360
What's likely to happen.
There's two things.

237
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:39,194
People will either give up on life 
completely and become cynical 

238
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,890
prematurely.
Cynical,

239
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,280
which is certainly a disease of of young
people.

240
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,590
Maybe it's always been a disease of 
young people,

241
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,424
but it's certainly been a disease of 
young people since say the end of World 

242
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,533
War Two.
So they become nihilistic and not 

243
00:15:55,101 --> 00:15:55,934
believe that anything has any meaning,
and that undermines their ability to 

244
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:03,030
strive or they'd fall prey to some sort 
of rigid ideology and niche.

245
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:08,031
He also understood that if people fell 
prey to a religion to originate theology

246
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,074
or several rigid ideologies,
that the only plausible outcome of that 

247
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,180
would be like ics,
exceptionally intense warfare.

248
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,050
And of course that's exactly what 
happened in the 20th century.

249
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Now he also says this can't be reversed.
Skepticism regarding morality is what is

250
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:30,434
decisive.
The end of the moral interpretation of 

251
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,124
the world,
which no longer has any sanction after 

252
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,350
just tried to escape into some beyond 
leads to nihilism,

253
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,820
all lacks meaning.
Then he says the untenable.

254
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,380
We have one interpretation of the world 
upon which a tremendous amount of energy

255
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,214
has been lavished,
awakens the suspicion that all 

256
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:52,184
interpretations of the world are false.
So it's a brilliant observation because 

257
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,870
he.
His point is,

258
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,400
I've seen this in,
in fundamentalist Christians,

259
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,473
for example,
who who I've taught in the past because 

260
00:17:04,761 --> 00:17:09,761
I have a very biological view of things 
and these people.

261
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,930
I met more of them when I was in the 
United States.

262
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,330
They were more intelligent than
than they were wise,

263
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,790
meaning the constraints within which 
their intellect was forced to operate,

264
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,290
which would be the Christian 
fundamentalists.

265
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,680
Constraints were not sophisticated 
enough to encapsulate their intellect.

266
00:17:27,681 --> 00:17:29,330
They were too smart for their own 
theories,

267
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,373
so they come to university and and and 
be exposed to ideas that were outside 

268
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:35,924
the scope,
say of Christian fundamentalism would 

269
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:41,150
just blow their fundamentalist 
presuppositions into bits and so then of

270
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:45,260
course they fall into nothing but Nina 
says it's even worse than that.

271
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,850
It's not only that you fall into 
nothing,

272
00:17:46,851 --> 00:17:51,300
it's that once one of your systems of 
belief has been destroyed,

273
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,793
you also learn that systems of beliefs 
themselves are unreliable and so you 

274
00:17:56,791 --> 00:18:00,870
can't just move easily from one to 
another because it's like,

275
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,450
well,
you're in a boat and it sunk,

276
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,700
and now you know that if you jump to the
next boat,

277
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,850
that boat could also sake.
So it's.

278
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,873
It's not only that your boat has sunk,
it's now you know that all boats can 

279
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:13,494
sync,
and so that's part of the position of 

280
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,300
the modern person as far as nature is 
concerned,

281
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,600
is that every one of us knows,
at least in principle,

282
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:26,550
that all the boats that we wanted jump 
into could potentially sink and so Nicha

283
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:30,150
saw nihilism as the inevitable 
consequence.

284
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,050
The inevitable rational consequence of 
that realization.

285
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:36,000
Now,
I told you guys before,

286
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,050
Nisha was a very,
very influential person,

287
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,860
influential,
influenced heidegger,

288
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,110
and heidegger influenced pinks,
Wanger and boss,

289
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,333
but nature also influenced young as much
as Freud did and young spent his whole 

290
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:51,330
career trying to solve the question that
needs to post.

291
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,493
One of the questions was
because we must experience nihilism 

292
00:19:07,461 --> 00:19:10,010
before we can find out what value these 
values really have.

293
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,283
So
the collapse of a belief system makes 

294
00:19:15,121 --> 00:19:16,500
all the values within it.

295
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,230
No longer tenable that that's the 
meaning of niches statement,

296
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:22,370
that God is dead.
He said,

297
00:19:22,371 --> 00:19:26,540
if you take the central axiom out of a 
system of belief,

298
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,590
you can't hold on to all the things that
were derived from that axiom.

299
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,140
So here an example is this,
so for example,

300
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:33,974
in,
in modern Western law there's a 

301
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:35,894
presupposition and the presupposition is
that in some weird sense everyone is 

302
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,513
equal before the law and that's 
predicated on the idea that not even 

303
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:44,924
applies to someone who's a murderer.
You're a murderer and you and it's 

304
00:19:47,571 --> 00:19:50,180
known.
You have to be treated with respect,

305
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:51,014
you know,
you have to be treated with respect by 

306
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,300
the legal system.
And that's a very,

307
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:56,170
very strange.
It's a miracle that,

308
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:59,120
that something like that ever emerged 
because it's so unlikely.

309
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,340
So then you might ask,
well,

310
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:06,341
what is the idea that everyone has worth
before the law grounded in,

311
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,880
where does that idea come from?

312
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,820
It comes from the idea of natural rights
that we have natural rights.

313
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,953
And then you might ask,
well where did the idea of natural 

314
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,040
rights come from?
Well then you're,

315
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,993
then you're starting to move beyond the 
realm of rational philosophy because 

316
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,643
natural rights,
the idea of natural rights has been 

317
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:23,774
something that has been an idea that's 
been emerging for thousands and 

318
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:26,924
thousands of years.
You know it's grounded in Christianity 

319
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:31,214
at least two in the in the map.
It's grounded in Christianity to the 

320
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:37,844
degree that one of the things that 
distinguishes Christianity is the idea 

321
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,080
that there's a universal faith and that 
everyone,

322
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,123
whether they're in that faith or not,
has intrinsic value and so natural 

323
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,124
rights are grounded in the idea of the 
intrinsic value of the soul and then 

324
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:54,754
that's grounded in the idea that 
consciousness itself participates in 

325
00:20:58,451 --> 00:20:59,284
creation and say that's an idea that's 
embedded in genesis and also in most 

326
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:02,704
creation stories.
So when you get rid of the religious 

327
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,790
underpinnings,
which which,

328
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:11,810
which ground the entire system in a kind
of dreamlike mythology.

329
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:12,644
When you get rid of that,
there's no reason that what's leftover 

330
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,600
rationally can survive and,
and,

331
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,563
and you can see that if you look at what
happened in the 20th century because 

332
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:28,340
there were at least two major challenges
to the,

333
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,743
to the civilizations that evolved and 
they weren't only Christian or Jewish 

334
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,120
civilization.
The same thing happened in China.

335
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,863
There,
there was a replacement of these evolve 

336
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,203
moral systems that emerged over a 
tremendous amount of time that no one 

337
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,594
rationally created once people started 
to criticize them and to destroy the 

338
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:52,070
axioms on which they were built and move
them aside.

339
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,300
Then there was a gaping hole left and 
the hole was filled well.

340
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,150
It was filled most particularly either 
by Nazi-ism,

341
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,040
which spread like mad throughout central
Europe or by communism,

342
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,020
which still possesses China,
so it'll even though China came from,

343
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,063
from a,
from a historical culture that was 

344
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:15,020
substantially different from say that of
Western Europe once,

345
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:15,854
once,
once rationality emerged to the point 

346
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:18,644
where it can be used as a critical force
which happened in Europe that spread 

347
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:25,700
like mad and it undermined the societies
of China.

348
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,370
Just like it undermined the societies of
the West.

349
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,590
I mean Russia.
You can read.

350
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,990
You can read this if you read Tolstoy,
for example,

351
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,373
tolstoy's confessions.
Russia was really the last country that 

352
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:41,870
underwent the transformations that were 
associated with the enlightenment.

353
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,060
So when tolstoy was a young person in 
the late 19th century,

354
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,900
he lived.
He said he could literally remember when

355
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:55,730
the announcement spread through his 
school that God was dead.

356
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,653
Now you're western Europeans had been 
working on that idea for a couple of 

357
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:01,880
hundred years,
you know,

358
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,640
with the dawn of the dawn of scientific 
thinking,

359
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:08,090
but the Russians were very backwards in 
some sense,

360
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,200
and they never,

361
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,520
they never.
They were never affected by the conflict

362
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,354
between rationality and religion until 
it happened all at once and it happened 

363
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:23,050
all at once at the end of the 19th 
century,

364
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,870
and the consequence of that,
it's complicated,

365
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:26,704
but the consequence of that was that the
monarchy exploded and then the 

366
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:30,124
consequence of that was that the 
Russians were left with nothing and the 

367
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:36,130
consequences of that was the Bolshevik 
revolution,

368
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,940
and then that was what started the 
entire Soviet nightmare.

369
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,100
You see very frequently that when a 
society loses its grounding,

370
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,203
say it's historical truths,
that it turns to something as an 

371
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:50,481
alternative.
You see,

372
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:55,040
the same thing happened in Quebec 
because Quebec didn't undergo the modern

373
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,330
transformation until the late 19 
fifties.

374
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,183
It was probably the last European 
society to go through the enlightenment 

375
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,920
revolution because the Catholic Church 
was an incredibly dominant force in,

376
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,390
in,
in,

377
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,320
in Catholic Quebec,
until the late 19 fifties in the average

378
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,154
family size during that time,
must've been in the neighborhood of 10 

379
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:18,970
children and then all of a sudden in the
late 19 fifties,

380
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,140
the Quebec has just lost their 
catholicism.

381
00:24:21,141 --> 00:24:23,390
It was just gone and now,
for example,

382
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:28,391
the Quebecois have the lowest marriage 
rate in the in the western world and one

383
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,080
of the lowest reproduction rates as 
well.

384
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,540
And there was a Gallup poll that was 
conducted.

385
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,960
I heard about this,
about must be 10 years ago.

386
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:36,794
Now.
I don't know if this information has 

387
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:38,744
ever been made public,
but there was a Gallup poll that 

388
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:43,940
indicated that if you are a Catholic who
had lost your faith,

389
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:44,774
so you left the church,
you were 10 times more likely to be a 

390
00:24:47,241 --> 00:24:50,160
separate list.
So you can see.

391
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,410
The consequence of it is,
is that if one belief system disappears,

392
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,780
well,
nihilism is one possibility,

393
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,680
but another possibility is that you just
adopt the next thing that's close.

394
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:03,290
That gives you structure and and 
nationalism,

395
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,790
of course,
it's one of those things,

396
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,820
so nature does diagnose the disease 
fundamentally,

397
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,550
and then the psychoanalysts like young 
in particular,

398
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,420
they were trying to see neat.
You believe that if God died because God

399
00:25:19,421 --> 00:25:21,490
died,
people were going to have to take on the

400
00:25:21,491 --> 00:25:25,390
responsibility that was once gods,
so to speak,

401
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:30,391
as a personal problem,
so me and thus spake Zarathustra.

402
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Nietzsche said,
God is dead.

403
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,430
We have killed him and we'll never find 
enough water to wash away the blood.

404
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,440
But he also said in order for people to 
withstand that catastrophe,

405
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:44,050
they would have to become gods 
themselves essentially.

406
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,723
And while you can see how that might go 
wrong if you think about people like 

407
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:51,340
Stalin and Hitler,
but,

408
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,460
but the psychoanalysts also like 
psychoanalysts especially you.

409
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,470
And then heidegger for,
for his part,

410
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,520
took that idea seriously and they young 
young said,

411
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,050
was trying to figure out,
well,

412
00:26:05,051 --> 00:26:08,320
if we lose our historically conditioned 
values,

413
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,213
we no longer believe in them.
And if nihilism is the outcome on one 

414
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,140
hand and totalitarianism is,
that would come.

415
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:19,090
On the other hand,
what's left and the union idea was while

416
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:24,091
the revelation of the self is that the 
individual could not as a rational mind,

417
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,140
but the individual as a totality.
It's something that Rogers also believed

418
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,270
the individuals that totality would be 
capable of bringing forth genuine values

419
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,360
as a consequence of self exploration and
honesty,

420
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:38,194
something like that,
and that's associated with the 

421
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:42,490
existential idea of individual 
responsibility.

422
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,823
So the one of the upshots of,
of the union theory is that to the 

423
00:26:49,361 --> 00:26:50,194
degree you don't bear the responsibility
for your own actions to the degree that 

424
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:58,060
you avoid responsibility or shrunk them 
off onto say,

425
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,043
totalitarian or ideological system.
So by when you avoid responsibility for 

426
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:04,174
your own thoughts,
because if you're the follower of an 

427
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,753
ideological system,
you have avoided the responsibility of 

428
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,294
thinking for yourself and the 
consequence of that was continual 

429
00:27:14,321 --> 00:27:15,154
catastrophe.
As those pathological rational systems 

430
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,100
unfolded themselves,
Solzhenitsyn

431
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,650
wrote the Gulag archipelago in,
published it in early 19 seventies,

432
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:29,484
and

433
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,100
there were two things that made that 
book very striking.

434
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,293
One was the stories that he told were so
unbelievably powerful that you couldn't 

435
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:44,191
read them and not believe it was true,
and that was even the case if you were a

436
00:27:44,711 --> 00:27:45,544
devoted Marxist and at that time in the 
universities and in many ways it hasn't 

437
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,434
changed that much.
The universities in the west were 

438
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:52,984
dominated by Marxists and and to some 
degree that was ethically inexcusable 

439
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,340
because people had known since the 19 
fifties,

440
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:01,174
especially since George Orwell wrote,
people had known since the 19 fifties 

441
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,660
that this telling the state was 
murderous beyond belief.

442
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:08,763
So Stalin for example,
killed 6 million Ukrainians in the 19 

443
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,890
thirties.
He starved them to death.

444
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:15,724
He took because all of the farmers have 
been collectivized at that point and 

445
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:19,444
what that meant was all the good farmers
had been killed and all the resentful 

446
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:22,954
farmers had been given the land and then
they collectivized farms and then sell 

447
00:28:26,451 --> 00:28:30,640
into all the food to feed the cities or 
to or to start with the Ukrainians.

448
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,773
Depending on how you look at it and the 
edicts were so harsh that if you are 

449
00:28:35,111 --> 00:28:35,944
Ukrainian and you had a family and they 
were starving and you went into a field 

450
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,563
after it had been harvested and you 
picked out individual grains from the 

451
00:28:44,081 --> 00:28:46,390
dirt to gather in a bowl to feed your 
family.

452
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,610
If you got caught,
then they would shoot you.

453
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,973
Solzhenitsyn observed this and he.
He was very interested in how this 

454
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,654
system developed and his conclusion 
after decades of thinking was that the 

455
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:07,284
reason the Russian system was able to 
maintain itself fundamentally was 

456
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:11,214
because individuals were willing to give
up the responsibility of their own 

457
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,593
relationship to the truth,
to the state and constantly lie to 

458
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:22,320
themselves about everything.
And that if the.

459
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,913
If the individuals that compose the 
state had refused to accept things that 

460
00:29:29,241 --> 00:29:30,074
they knew full well to be untrue,
that the state wouldn't have been able 

461
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,030
to survive.
And you know,

462
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,640
social units.
It's case is very strong because in some

463
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:41,300
sense he was the first person who told 
the truth about the Gulag archipelago,

464
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,980
which was this chain of prison camps 
that the Soviets had erected on.

465
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:47,050
Which their economy was essentially 
based.

466
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,183
He was the first person who really told 
the truth about that and he hit the 

467
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:56,821
foundations of Marx's theory so hard 
that well,

468
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,443
partly it collapsed and partly it went 
underground into movements like 

469
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:03,700
postmodernism.
So his,

470
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,990
his proposition,
it's a dusty proposition actually.

471
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:11,710
That one person who stopped lying could,
could overturn a tyranny.

472
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,503
It's a hard thing to believe,
but there's been multiple examples of 

473
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:17,194
that sort of thing.
In the 20th century it happened with 

474
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,044
Gandhi happen with Vaclav Havel and 
Czechoslovakia happen with Nelson 

475
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,850
Mandela and Hatton was soldier nets and 
you know,

476
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,950
so those are pretty powerful examples 
of,

477
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,360
of the power of a single individual who 
refuses to accept the convention.

478
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,020
The convention will lie.

479
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,930
Notice the Esky was writing about the 
same time as Nietzsche.

480
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,850
And Dostoevsky is a very interesting 
person.

481
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,320
He was an Orthodox Christian,
although he's a very intelligent man and

482
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,920
Dostoevsky.
Nietzsche are twins in some sense.

483
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:54,754
So what niche you wrote in philosophy,
Dostoevsky wrote in literature and 

484
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,690
dusty,
dusty as keys primary

485
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,400
statements was that if there is no god,
everything is permitted.

486
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:11,140
So it's to take on niches,
discussion of nihilism,

487
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:11,621
it's like,
well,

488
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,350
if there's no ultimate value of any 
sort,

489
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,020
then why can't you do exactly what you 
want?

490
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,300
And that's a theme he explores to great 
purpose in crime and punishment.

491
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,523
Neat Dostoyevsky's conclusion was that 
the reason you can't do anything you 

492
00:31:28,471 --> 00:31:29,304
want is because you actually come 
equipped with an inherent set of values 

493
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,180
that are real and that if you violate 
them to to greater degree,

494
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,193
you'll destroy your own structure as 
well as damaging to society that's 

495
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,260
around you.
So Dostoevsky was a big believer in some

496
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:44,094
sense like the unions and the Rogerian,
that there are the locus of values 

497
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,470
within a human being and,
and,

498
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,360
and then it's an actual thing.
You can't disregard it without damage.

499
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,470
Dostoevsky was also a very powerful 
critic of reason,

500
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,810
and the reason for that was

501
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,030
it was rezoned in some sense that 
brought down the house of cards,

502
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,570
so to speak,
that constituted classical face.

503
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,703
But the consequence of that rational 
destruction of values was the emergence 

504
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:18,160
of nihilism or totalitarianism.
And the consequences of those two things

505
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,203
is either the inability to live or the 
emergent emergence of the murderer 

506
00:32:22,481 --> 00:32:23,314
estate.
So Dostoevsky looked at that and 

507
00:32:25,061 --> 00:32:25,691
thought,
okay,

508
00:32:25,691 --> 00:32:30,691
well perhaps our belief that reason 
itself is the proper guide to reality is

509
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:33,424
wrong.
And so this is one of the things he 

510
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,034
wrote in notes from underground when he 
was exploring this idea notes from 

511
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:40,401
underground.
By the way,

512
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,770
it's very short book and it's very much 
worth reading.

513
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,020
It's a dusty Esky wrote five books that 
are in calculus really great.

514
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,053
And what happened to Dostoevsky,
I don't remember if I told you this or 

515
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,760
not,
but he was a student radical and he was.

516
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,653
He was arrested by the as men because of
a riot tour or a protest that him and 

517
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,670
his compatriots had come up with.
He was sort of a bit player in it,

518
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,700
but they put them in prison when he was 
a young man.

519
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,070
And then he was in prison for quite a 
while.

520
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,270
And then one day they took him out into 
the courtyard and they shot him at dawn.

521
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,223
You know,
they had the soldiers lining up and put 

522
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:19,790
them by a post and shot them,
but they used blanks,

523
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,163
but he didn't know that and it scared 
him so bad he had an epileptic seizure 

524
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,573
and then he had epileptic seizures for 
the rest of his life and the kind of 

525
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:31,460
epileptic seizures he had were 
associated with mystical experience,

526
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,473
so Dostoevsky before he got a seizure,
would have the sense that he was 

527
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,003
experiencing the world in a more and 
more meaningful way until he was on the 

528
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:44,990
very dawn of sort of nip omniscient 
knowledge and then he'd have a seizure,

529
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,693
but it wasn't until he was shot with 
blanks and then putting this terrible 

530
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:50,384
prison for a long period of time and had
epilepsy that he became a great 

531
00:33:53,271 --> 00:33:54,020
novelist.

532
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,650
It changed them in some way.
His early writings are really,

533
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,830
they're not good.
They're sterile and dry,

534
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,873
and his later writings,
the five grade novels in particular are 

535
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,350
there in a.
they're in a class of their own.

536
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,420
So Dostoevsky.
The first thing Dostoevsky tried to come

537
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:12,254
to grips with was the fact he didn't 
believe that life itself was a rational 

538
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,990
because that's an enlightenment 
proposition,

539
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:22,190
that the structure of reality is in and 
of itself rational so it can be held.

540
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,233
It can be dealt with by rational means 
and that's been a very powerful theory 

541
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:26,864
because it's enabled us to develop.
This is scientific viewpoint and the 

542
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,644
technology that goes along with it,
but rationality is not the only mode of 

543
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:36,554
human knowing.
There's all sorts of other modes of 

544
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:41,630
human knowing and many of those are 
associated with emotion and motivation.

545
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:42,464
They're more biologically instantiated,
saying less computational and 

546
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,343
rationality has a very difficult time 
even conceptualizing how those other 

547
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:55,550
modes of knowing might be real and so 
what it tends to do is denigrate them as

548
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,140
mirror opponents to rationality,
but the Dostoevsky and perspective,

549
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:03,620
and this is also something that Roger's 
followed up on and young,

550
00:35:03,621 --> 00:35:08,621
was that life itself is so irrational or
experience itself is so irrational.

551
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,290
Given it suffering and its and its 
absurdity.

552
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:17,590
That a merely rationally formulated 
representation of life is insufficient.

553
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,173
It can't.
It can't manage the job and what 

554
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:28,631
rationality will they're there for do is
cut away everything from life,

555
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,493
cutaway,
everything from its definition of 

556
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:35,330
reality that it can't actually 
encapsulate.

557
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,370
Dostoyevsky

558
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,203
said in short,
one may say anything about the history 

559
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,014
of the world,
anything that might enter the most 

560
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:45,504
disordered imagination.
The only thing one can't say is that 

561
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,470
it's rational.
The very word sticks in one's throat

562
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:57,030
and indeed this is the odd thing that is
continually happening.

563
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,480
They're continually turning up in life,
moral and rational persons,

564
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,403
sages and lovers of humanity who make it
their object to live all their lives as 

565
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:07,920
morally and rationally as possible,
to be so,

566
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:08,754
to speak,
a light to their neighbors simply in 

567
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:10,644
order to show them that it is possible 
to live morally and rationally in this 

568
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:14,904
world,
and yet we all know that these very 

569
00:36:17,671 --> 00:36:20,280
people sooner or later have been false 
to themselves.

570
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,773
That's a precursor of Freudian ideas 
playing some queer trick often and most 

571
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,284
unseemly one.
Now I asked you what can be expected of 

572
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:36,270
band since he is a being endowed with 
such strange qualities,

573
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,613
shower upon him,
every earthly blessing drown them in a 

574
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:41,934
sea of happiness so that nothing but 
bubbles of bliss can be seen on the 

575
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:49,140
surface,
give them economic prosperity so that he

576
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:51,000
should have nothing else to do,
but sleep,

577
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,313
eat cakes and busy himself with the 
continuation of the species and even 

578
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,881
then out of sharing gratitude and spite 
man would play you some nasty trick.

579
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,613
He would even.
Risk is cakes and would deliberately 

580
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:07,314
desired the most fatal rubbish,
the most uneconomical absurdity simply 

581
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,010
to introduce into all this positive good
sense,

582
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,540
his fatal fantastic element.
It is just as fantastic.

583
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,374
Dreams is vulgar.
Folly that he will desire to retain 

584
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,063
simply in order to prove to himself as 
if that was so necessary that men are 

585
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:28,344
still men and not the keys of a piano,
which the laws of nature threatened to 

586
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,084
control so completely that soon one will
be able to desire nothing except by the 

587
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:39,990
calendar.
And that's not at all.

588
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,740
Even if men really were nothing but a 
piano key.

589
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,040
Even if this were approved to him by 
natural science and mathematics,

590
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,320
even then he would not become 
reasonable.

591
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,813
He would do purposefully do something 
perverse out of simple in gratitude 

592
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,463
simply to gain his point,
and if he does not find means he will 

593
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:02,160
contrive destruction and chaos and 
suffering of all sorts,

594
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,600
only to gain his point.

595
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,213
He will launch a curse upon the world 
and as only men can curse gets his 

596
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,194
privilege.
The primary distinction between him and 

597
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:14,820
other animals.
Maybe by his curse alone,

598
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:15,654
he will obtain his object.
That is to convince himself that he's a 

599
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:19,224
man and not a piano key.
And if you say that all of this too can 

600
00:38:22,531 --> 00:38:26,070
be calculated and tabulated and chaos 
and darkness and curses.

601
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:30,300
So the mere possibility of calculating 
it all beforehand would stop.

602
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,134
It all and reason would reassert itself.
That man would purposefully go mad in 

603
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,110
order to be rid of reason and gain his 
point.

604
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,600
I believe in it.
I answer for it.

605
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,583
For the whole work of man really seems 
to consist of nothing but proving to 

606
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:47,830
himself every minute that he's a man,
not a piano key.

607
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,173
It might be at the cost of his skin,
it might be by cannibalism and this 

608
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:53,794
being so can one help being tempted to 
rejoice that it is not yet come off and 

609
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,740
that desire still depends on something 
we don't know.

610
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,233
You will scream at me.
That is if you condescend to do so that 

611
00:39:05,391 --> 00:39:06,224
no one is touching my freewill,
that all they're concerned with is that 

612
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,674
my free will should have itself of its 
own free will coincide with my own 

613
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:16,520
normal interests and the laws of nature 
and arithmetic.

614
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,110
Good Heavens.
Gentlemen,

615
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:18,944
what sort of free will is left when he,
when we come to tabulation and 

616
00:39:21,201 --> 00:39:24,080
arithmetic,
when it will all be a case of twice two,

617
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,850
makes four,
twice.

618
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:27,410
Two,
makes four without my will.

619
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
As a freewheel meant that

620
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,220
well that was written

621
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,740
and the late teenage,
late 18 hundreds is as well,

622
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:36,574
and Dostoevsky had already figured out 
by that point that the consequence of 

623
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:46,241
the new ideas swimming into Russia and 
undermining Orthodox Christianity,

624
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:47,594
which was the say,
the natural culture in some sense of 

625
00:39:49,491 --> 00:39:53,210
Russia was going to be either nihilism 
or totalitarianism,

626
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:54,523
and he examined the propositions of 
totalitarianism and the propositions of 

627
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:01,490
totalitarianism.
We're essentially utopian,

628
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:02,703
so the idea was except it's like a cult,
except this mode of being except this 

629
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:12,251
interpretation of the world and society 
will advance towards a point where while

630
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:16,190
it's saying the case of communism,
wealth is equally distributed in,

631
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:17,024
everyone is free and it's a very,
very powerful idea obviously because it 

632
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,650
attracted hundreds of millions of people
each according

633
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,680
to each,
according to his need,

634
00:40:28,681 --> 00:40:31,740
from each according to his ability.
Sounds Fair.

635
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,633
You get what you.
You get what you need to live and you 

636
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,160
contribute what's in it,
what's in you to contribute,

637
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,460
and when it was laid out in the world,
it was an absolute catastrophe.

638
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,430
And Dostoevsky criticized this before it
even happened.

639
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,720
He said,
look,

640
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,200
human beings do not want utopia.
We're too insane for that.

641
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,390
If you,
if you had comfort,

642
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,703
sterile comfort,
if you had everything you want to just 

643
00:40:57,481 --> 00:40:58,314
given to you,
all you do is go crazy just so that you 

644
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:03,000
wouldn't have to be bored by all that 
perfection.

645
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,170
You destroy it so that the irrational 
element that's inside of you,

646
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:12,171
so this Dionysian element could leap out
and live and so whatever utopia is,

647
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,560
it's not the permanent solution to all 
of your problems.

648
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:19,170
You don't even want to live without 
problems.

649
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,710
Kierkegaard writing out a little earlier
on,

650
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:29,150
but all along the similar,
a similar track of ideas.

651
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,400
He's also criticizing idea of utopia,

652
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:35,983
believing at least in part,
that the meaning in life is to be found 

653
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,363
within the struggle that constitutes 
life and not in the solution to that 

654
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:49,640
struggle which may be as equivalent to 
death and not to utopia.

655
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:51,573
It is about four years ago that I got 
the notion of wanting to try my luck as 

656
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,050
an author.
I remember it quite clearly.

657
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,970
It was a Sunday.
Yes,

658
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,103
Sunday afternoon.
I was seated as usual outside at the 

659
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,314
cafe in the Fredericksburg Garden.
I'd been a student for half a score of 

660
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,200
years,
although never lazy.

661
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,213
Oh,
my activity nevertheless was like a 

662
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,134
glittering inactivity,
a kind of occupation for which I still 

663
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:19,100
have a great partiality and for which 
perhaps I even have a little genius.

664
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,593
I read much spent the remainder of the 
day idling and thinking or thinking an 

665
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,240
idling,
but that was all it came to,

666
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,063
so I sat there and I smoke my cigar 
until I lapsed into thought among other 

667
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,360
thoughts.

668
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,193
I remember these you are going on.
I said to myself to become an old man 

669
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,073
without being anything and without 
really undertaking to do anything on 

670
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,174
other hand,
wherever you look around you in 

671
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,214
literature and in life,
you see the celebrated names and 

672
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:48,854
figures,
the precious and much heralded men who 

673
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,420
are coming into prominence and are much 
talked about,

674
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,913
the many benefactors of the age who know
how to benefit mankind by making life 

675
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,350
easier and easier.
Somebody railways,

676
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,770
others by omnibuses and steamboats,
others by the telegraph,

677
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,873
others by easily apprehended compendiums
and short recitals of everything worth 

678
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:09,284
knowing,

679
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,983
and finally the true benefactors of the 
age who makes spiritual existence in 

680
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:17,470
virtue of thought easier and easier,
yet more and more significant,

681
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:18,993
and what are you doing here?
My soliloquy was interrupted because my 

682
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:26,320
cigarette with smoked out and a new one 
had to be lit so I smoked again,

683
00:43:26,321 --> 00:43:28,960
and then suddenly this thought flashed 
into my mind,

684
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,113
you must do something,
but in as much as with your limited 

685
00:43:33,251 --> 00:43:34,084
capacities,
it will be impossible for you to make 

686
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,200
anything easier than it has already 
become.

687
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,153
You must with the same humanitarian 
enthusiasm as the others undertake to 

688
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:44,254
make something harder.
This notion pleased me immensely and at 

689
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:50,134
the same time,
it flattered me to think that I liked 

690
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:54,730
the rest of them would be loved in 
esteemed by the whole community,

691
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,600
for when all combined in every way to 
make everything easier,

692
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,260
there remains only one possible danger,
namely that the eas will become so great

693
00:44:04,301 --> 00:44:09,110
that it becomes altogether too great.
Then there's only one left,

694
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:09,944
although it is not yet a felt want,
when people will want difficulty out of 

695
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:18,260
love for mankind and out of despair at 
my embarrassing situation,

696
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,243
seeing that I had accomplished nothing 
and was unable to make anything easier 

697
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,234
than it had already been made and moved 
by a genuine interest in those who make 

698
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:27,134
everything easy.
I can save that as my task to create 

699
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:31,250
difficulties everywhere.

700
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,550
Character guard is often regarded as an 
existentialist.

701
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,813
Now,
one of the ideas that runs its way 

702
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:48,204
through existentialism is the idea that 
to be human is to simultaneously be 

703
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:55,500
saddled with an intrinsic 
responsibility,

704
00:44:55,501 --> 00:45:00,060
a moral responsibility that you are 
responsible not only to yourself,

705
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:00,894
to your soul saying,
but also to the people around you and 

706
00:45:03,181 --> 00:45:04,014
that that isn't
an arbitrary imposition that's imposed 

707
00:45:07,701 --> 00:45:11,180
upon you by rationality or by your 
fellow man for that matter,

708
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:15,920
but something that's right at the heart 
of the reality of existence itself,

709
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,000
such that if you

710
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,823
fort

711
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,150
or fall short of bearing,
that responsibility,

712
00:45:22,151 --> 00:45:25,180
you'll pay a price in guilt and in shape
and it's suffering.

713
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,440
Vince Wanger and brought boss working 
off heidegger's lead said that guilt and

714
00:45:34,911 --> 00:45:38,930
fear our debts to possibility.
If you're guilty about something,

715
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,900
well it's because you're not upholding 
your responsibility.

716
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,260
Whereas for Freud that was often a form 
of pathology,

717
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:46,843
excess guilt,
and of course excess guilt can become 

718
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:50,790
pathological,
but Kierkegaard,

719
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:53,840
his point is that guilt itself isn't 
something to be cured.

720
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,793
It's,
it's,

721
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,673
it's,
it's an integral and necessary part of 

722
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:58,664
reality.
Just like disgust and despair and fear 

723
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:01,484
and all the negative emotions.
They alert you to your place in the 

724
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:08,690
world and guide you towards the 
unfolding of your spirit.

725
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:14,630
Failure to shoulder your existential 
burden is what results in neurotic,

726
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:15,680
guilt and fear,

727
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:21,683
Vince Wanger and boss also believed that
like existential anxiety and that's the 

728
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:30,360
feeling of nothingness,
is fear of loss of world.

729
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,113
That the world that you inhabit,
the conceptual world that you inhabit 

730
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,520
can be destroyed at any moment and that 
you're aware of that at some level.

731
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:39,354
It's the same comment that needs to made
and and and Nisha believe that this was 

732
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:43,404
something that modern people were 
particularly susceptible to because our 

733
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:46,314
rationality is always capable of sawing 
off the branch that we're sitting on 

734
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,170
because no matter what you're doing,
even if you're engaged in it deeply,

735
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,300
the critical part of your mind can 
always say,

736
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,134
well,
what makes you think that's so 

737
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:58,440
worthwhile?
And you know an answer could be,

738
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,274
well,
it manifests itself as being worthwhile 

739
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,190
and why should I pay attention to those 
rational doubts,

740
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,233
but that's not how we're trained.
We're trained that rationality is the 

741
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:12,660
thing that encompasses everything.
Instead of being trained.

742
00:47:12,661 --> 00:47:16,200
That rationality is something that's 
encompassed by something else,

743
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,350
and so if doubts come up that 
irrational,

744
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,140
we immediately believed them because the
rational,

745
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,150
instead of asking ourselves,
well,

746
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:24,984
if the rational doubt is undermining the
meaning in my life and making it 

747
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,094
difficult for me to proceed,
maybe the thing to do is to question 

748
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:33,370
whether or not that doubt is valid.

749
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,730
Now it depends on what you regard as 
real because if it's,

750
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,000
if it's the rational argument itself 
that's real,

751
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,730
then you can't dispense with the doubts,
but if you say,

752
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:44,564
well,
rationality is too limited in its 

753
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,740
apprehension to deal with the absurdity 
of life.

754
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,220
There are other sorts of answers like 
music for example,

755
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:56,240
or or art or or the kind of engagement 
that you,

756
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:57,643
that you experienced when you're 
involved in something that you're 

757
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,690
incredibly interested in.
Those are forms of reality that are that

758
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,263
you can regard those as forms of reality
that transcend rationalism instead of 

759
00:48:09,561 --> 00:48:10,394
being something embedded inside 
rationalism that can be destroyed by 

760
00:48:12,711 --> 00:48:13,544
doubt,
and the problem with doubt is that it 

761
00:48:15,231 --> 00:48:17,540
can undermine you completely.
Not Smiling,

762
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,443
but even worse than that.
It can lay you open to ideological 

763
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:25,751
possession and that's,
that's say tannic in its in its,

764
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,150
in its catastrophe.

765
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,833
We're all talked to you a little bit now
about the concentration camp 

766
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,960
concentration camps were established 
there.

767
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,890
There were established in England,
Germany,

768
00:48:41,891 --> 00:48:42,641
Russia,
China,

769
00:48:42,641 --> 00:48:46,510
Cambodia and Yugoslavia,
and in the Soviet Union,

770
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,790
the estimates,
these are estimates that were derived by

771
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:49,624
soldier nets and where that 66 million 
people died and internal repression in 

772
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:56,650
the Soviet Union between 19,
19 and 1959.

773
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,000
That's a figure that's 10 times as great
as the figures that are commonly used to

774
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:03,400
describe the genocide rate in the 
Holocaust,

775
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:06,730
which was more like 6 million and so 
it's and it's and also estimated,

776
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:07,564
but no one knows that 100 million people
died in China during Mao's cultural 

777
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,274
revolution.
When Michael decided that he was going 

778
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:14,344
to wipe out all of Chinese tradition and
destroyed much of the much of the 

779
00:49:18,101 --> 00:49:20,680
ancient artifacts that characterize that
tradition in a,

780
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,180
in a like a riotous catastrophe that 
lasted more than a decade.

781
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,670
Oh,

782
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,620
Solzhenitsyn says the imagination and 
strength,

783
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,513
spiritual strength of Shakespeare's 
evildoers stopped short and it doesn't 

784
00:49:37,731 --> 00:49:41,530
corpses because they had no idea ology 
ideology.

785
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,740
That's what gives evil doing.
It's long sought justification and gives

786
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:49,130
the evildoer the necessary steadfastness
and determination.

787
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,400
That's the social theory,
which helps to make his act seem good.

788
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:55,250
Instead of bad in his own eyes and 
others,

789
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:56,683
this was how the agents of the 
inquisition fortified their wills by 

790
00:49:59,061 --> 00:49:59,894
invoking Christianity,
the conqueror of foreign lands by 

791
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:04,490
extolling the grander of their 
motherland,

792
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:09,500
the colonizers by civilization that 
Nazis by race and the Jacob begins early

793
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,334
and late by equality,
brotherhood and the happiness of future 

794
00:50:12,621 --> 00:50:16,220
generations without evildoers.
That would have been new archipelago.

795
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,013
The archipelago,
the Gulag archipelago is social 

796
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,533
knutson's metaphor for the for the 
prison camps like the prison camps that 

797
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:31,271
exists now in Korea in which millions of
people are starving and dying for the.

798
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,713
For the prison camps that littered the 
entire Soviet Union and those cultures 

799
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,900
became so pathological that in east 
Germany,

800
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:39,734
for example,
before the wall fell down and East 

801
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:45,350
Germany was arguably one of the more 
civilized parts of the Soviet state.

802
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,200
One person out of three was a government
informer.

803
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:49,693
So if you have a family of five people,
there's a reasonable probability that 

804
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,390
two of them are going to tell a 
government agent what you say and think,

805
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,000
and that that was also portrayed as the 
highest possible moral virtue because it

806
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:02,834
was much better for you to be a 
admirable citizen of the state than say 

807
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:09,140
a loyal daughter,
and that's where children were taught in

808
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:09,974
school,
that the family was a defunct unit and 

809
00:51:12,141 --> 00:51:12,974
that individual relationships were 
secondary and not all that mattered was 

810
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,780
adherence to the dog.
With that constituted,

811
00:51:17,781 --> 00:51:18,614
this central axioms of the state
is this Solzhenitsyn's description of 

812
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:29,170
how communist ideological uniformity was
enforced.

813
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,123
In the prison camp,

814
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:36,410
an anonymous author is told how 
executions were carried out at a Dac,

815
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,433
a camp on the river.
They would take the opposition members 

816
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:41,303
with their things out of the camp 
compound on a prisoner transport at 

817
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:47,700
night and outside the compound stood the
small house of the third section.

818
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,030
The condemned men were taken into a room
one at a time and they.

819
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:56,560
The camp guards sprang on them.
Their mouths were stuffed with something

820
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:59,650
soft and their arms were bound with 
cords behind their backs.

821
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,473
Then they were led out into the 
courtyard where harnessed carts were 

822
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:03,994
waiting.
The bound prisoners were piled on the 

823
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:09,700
carts from five to seven at a time and 
driven off to the Gorkha,

824
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:12,280
the camp cemetery.
On arrival,

825
00:52:12,281 --> 00:52:15,580
they were tipped into big pits that had 
already been prepared and buried alive,

826
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,750
not out of brutality.
No,

827
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,620
it had been ascertained

828
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,793
that weren't dragging and lifting them.
It was much easier to cope with living 

829
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:25,070
people.

830
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:25,903
Corpses,
the work went on for many nights at a 

831
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:32,150
DAC and that is how the moral political 
unity of our party was achieved.

832
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,453
If you have a rigid belief system and 
that's what it is because it's axioms 

833
00:52:42,971 --> 00:52:43,804
are such that it encompasses all of 
reality and then there are details left 

834
00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:50,800
outside that don't seem to fit into that
reality well then you ignore that,

835
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:51,634
but what if they're embodied?
What if there are people who are 

836
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:55,960
objecting to the way you think?
Well,

837
00:52:55,961 --> 00:53:00,760
the equivalent to repressing evidence 
that runs contrary to your theory is the

838
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,070
murder of people who object to what you 
say,

839
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,590
and those two things are linked much 
tighter than you would think you know,

840
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,351
you might think,
well,

841
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,870
I would never do something like the 
Communists did in,

842
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:11,830
in,
in,

843
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,560
in,
in the what?

844
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,620
The,
the evangelization of my beliefs.

845
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,280
But the truth of the matter is,
is that in general,

846
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:26,281
people will do such things if they're 
granted the and provided with the proper

847
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:31,941
apparatus.
This is Frankel from his accounts of the

848
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,300
concentration camps under Nazi Germany.

849
00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:43,760
The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours 
of camp life was the awakening when at a

850
00:53:43,761 --> 00:53:46,760
steel nocturnal our,
the three shrill blows have a whistle,

851
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,890
Torres Pediculus,
Leslie from are exhausted,

852
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:51,320
sleep and from the longings in our 
dreams.

853
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,060
We then began to tussle with our wet 
shoes into which we could scarcely force

854
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:59,000
our feet,
which were sore and swollen with edema,

855
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,793
and then there were the usual moans and 
groans about petty troubles such as the 

856
00:54:03,231 --> 00:54:05,750
snapping of wires which replaced 
shoelaces.

857
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:06,793
One morning I heard someone whom I knew 
to be brave and dignified cry like a 

858
00:54:09,831 --> 00:54:13,880
child because he finally had to go out 
to the snowy marching fields in his bare

859
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:16,550
feet as the shoes were too shrunken for 
him to wear.

860
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:21,090
In those ghastly moments,
I found a little bit of comfort,

861
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,403
a small piece of bread which I drew out 
of my pocket and munched with absorbed 

862
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,830
delight,
Solzhenitsyn.

863
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,940
Many of the Gulag camps contained two 
classes of prisoners,

864
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:40,720
rapists,
murderers and thieves who were very well

865
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:43,930
organized in Russia and the Soviet Union
and political prisoners,

866
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,280
and because the Soviets believed that 
the reason that people were thieves,

867
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:49,114
murderers and rapists was because of the
appalling sociological conditions that 

868
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:53,854
they grew up into.
They believed they were socially 

869
00:54:56,411 --> 00:54:58,810
friendly elements who could still be 
redeemed,

870
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,693
so they put them in charge of the camps,
and so the political prisoners were at 

871
00:55:04,031 --> 00:55:09,031
the bottom of the hierarchy.
The prisoners ran the camps with minimal

872
00:55:09,441 --> 00:55:10,274
supervision and the counts were often 
forced labor camps and forced labor 

873
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:18,890
meant do something difficult and 
pointless until you die.

874
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:24,700
It didn't mean it meant only secondarily
produced something of potential value to

875
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:26,384
the state.
You saw this with Nazi Germany to the 

876
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:29,354
Nazis.
When they started to lose the Second 

877
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:32,443
World War,

878
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:34,383
they could have stopped their holocaust 
machinations and used the people they 

879
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:38,740
had imprisoned

880
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:41,100
to build implements to further the war 
effort,

881
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,830
which they did to some degree so they 
could have used them as slaves.

882
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:46,740
So this would be the logic.
Take the slaves,

883
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,970
make the munitions when the war.
Then after you've won the war,

884
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:51,953
you can run around and mop everybody up,
but that isn't what the Nazis did when 

885
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:58,020
they started to lose.
Instead of doing what you think would be

886
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:02,220
rational in the pursuit of what was 
hypothetically their goal,

887
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:03,803
they amped up the killing and and took 
resources away from the war itself and 

888
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:09,984
some of the conclusion that's reasonable
to draw from that is that the killing 

889
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:14,394
was the purpose of the war.
All the rest of it was just window 

890
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:18,114
dressing and exactly as associates and 
described in the earlier quotes that I 

891
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:23,364
told you was ideology was only there to 
allow the people who were fundamentally 

892
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:27,514
motivated,
motivated towards genocide and 

893
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:29,494
destruction to pretend to themselves 
that they hadn't become rotten to the 

894
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:36,400
absolute core,
but when push came to shove and they had

895
00:56:36,401 --> 00:56:39,940
to show where their allegiances lie,
they weren't even.

896
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,343
They weren't even valid followers of the
Nazi party because they put the 

897
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:47,434
continued pursuit of death above their 
own survival even as an ideology and 

898
00:56:51,881 --> 00:56:52,714
that's how we the only Gigi generates.
And part of the reason for that is that 

899
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,930
the narrower the box that you stuffed 
yourself into,

900
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:03,640
the weaker your character becomes 
because there's nothing left of you.

901
00:57:03,641 --> 00:57:04,474
You're just a shell that has demons in 
it and but you're still the sort of 

902
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:10,210
thing that can suffer.
And so if you cram everything,

903
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,210
you are into a box,
a small box,

904
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,190
and you get rid of everything that 
doesn't fit.

905
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,203
You get rid of everything in you that 
makes life bearable and then life 

906
00:57:18,731 --> 00:57:21,640
becomes unbearable and then if life 
becomes unbearable,

907
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:22,474
well then of course you're motivated to 
do nothing but to take revenge on it 

908
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:26,163
because why wouldn't you?
If all you were doing with suffering 

909
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:32,830
stupidly and meaninglessly,
how could you positively,

910
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:33,723
how could you possibly show a positive 
face to yourself into the rest of 

911
00:57:36,731 --> 00:57:41,731
humanity in called lower than 60 degrees
below zero work days were written off.

912
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,730
In other words,
on such days,

913
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:48,370
the records show that the workers had 
not gone out to work.

914
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,520
They were often digging canals on the 
frozen Siberian prairie by hand.

915
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,920
There was one canal,
I think it was on the river,

916
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:01,323
but I can't remember precisely,
so Stalin killed 300,000 people in a 

917
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:10,480
single winter digging it by hand and 
when it was done,

918
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,580
it was so shallow that no ships could 
use it.

919
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,520
The record showed that the workers had 
not gone out to work,

920
00:58:17,521 --> 00:58:18,354
but they chased them out anyway and 
whatever they squeezed out of them on 

921
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:20,874
those days was added to the other days.
Thereby raising the percentages and the 

922
00:58:24,271 --> 00:58:25,104
survival medical section road off those 
who froze to death on such cold days on 

923
00:58:28,651 --> 00:58:29,484
some other basis and the ones who were 
left who could no longer walk and we're 

924
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:35,490
straining every sinew to crawl along on 
all fours on the way back to camp,

925
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,533
the convoy simply shot so that they 
wouldn't escape before they could come 

926
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:39,530
back.

927
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:40,363
The.

928
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:46,030
This is from William Blake whole rose,
the art sick.

929
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,103
The invisible world that flies in the 
night in the howling storm have found 

930
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:54,220
out diabetic crimson joy and his dark 
secret.

931
00:58:54,221 --> 00:58:55,900
Love does die.
Life destroy

932
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,540
is a soldier in Edson fire.
Fire the branches,

933
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,630
crackle in the night.
Wind of late autumn blows up the

934
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,370
flame of the bonfire,
back and forth.

935
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,960
The compound is dark.
I'm alone at the bonfire and I can bring

936
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:14,860
it still some more carpenter shavings.
This compound here is a privileged one,

937
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,340
so privileged that it's almost as if I 
were out in freedom.

938
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:22,130
This is an island of paradise.
This is the Marfino Sriracha,

939
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,000
a scientific institute staff by 
engineers

940
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,530
staffed with prisoners in its most 
privileged period.

941
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,140
No one is overseeing me,
calling me to a cell,

942
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:33,974
chasing me away from the bonfire,
and even then it is chilly in the 

943
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:41,270
penetrating wind,
but she was already been standing in the

944
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:43,570
wind for hours,
her arms,

945
00:59:43,571 --> 00:59:45,140
straight down,
her head drooping,

946
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:46,730
weeping,
and then growing,

947
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,560
numb and still,
and then again,

948
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:51,140
she begs pityingly,
citizen chief,

949
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:53,630
please forgive me.
I won't do it again.

950
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,550
The wind carries her moan to me just as 
if she were moaning next to my ear.

951
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,560
The citizen chief at the gate house 
fires up his stove and does not answer.

952
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,083
This was the gatehouse of the camp next 
door to us from which workers came into 

953
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:09,564
our compound to lay water pipes and 
repair the old ramshackle seminary 

954
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:14,154
building across from me beyond the art.
Fully intertwined many stranded barb 

955
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:19,994
wire barricade and two steps away from 
the gate house beneath a bright lantern 

956
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:24,413
stood the punished girl head hanging the
wind tugging at her gray work skirt her 

957
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,230
feet growing numb from the cold

958
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,453
and a thin scarf over her head.
It had been warmed during the day when 

959
01:00:36,521 --> 01:00:38,590
they had been digging a ditch on our 
territory.

960
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:43,000
And another girl slipping down into a 
ravine had crawled your way to the Vladi

961
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,150
Kino highway and escaped a guard had 
bungled.

962
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,780
And Moscow city buses ran right along 
the highway.

963
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,820
When they caught on,
it was too late to catch her.

964
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:53,283
They raised the alarm,
a mean dark major arrived and shouted 

965
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:57,723
that if they failed to catch the girl,
the entire camp would be deprived of 

966
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:03,490
visits and parcels for a whole month.
Because of her escape

967
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,570
and the women bring it.
Tears went into a rage and they were all

968
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:09,670
shouting.
One of them in particular,

969
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:13,090
who kept a viciously rolling her eyes.
Oh,

970
01:01:13,091 --> 01:01:14,410
I hope they catch her.
The bitch.

971
01:01:14,411 --> 01:01:16,540
I hope they take scissors and clip,
clip,

972
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,030
take off all her hair in front of the 
lineup.

973
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,850
This wasn't something she had thought of
herself.

974
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:23,710
This is the way they punished women in 
the Gulag.

975
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,843
But the girl who was now standing 
outside the gate house in the cold had 

976
01:01:27,101 --> 01:01:31,750
sighed and said instead,
at least she can have a good time out in

977
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:32,584
freedom for all of us.
That jailer overheard what she said and 

978
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:35,824
now she was being punished.
Everyone else had been taken off to the 

979
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:39,184
camp,
but she had been sent outside there to 

980
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,700
stand at attention in front of the gate 
house.

981
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,360
This had been at 6:00 PM and it was now 
11:00 PM.

982
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,090
She tried to shift from one foot to 
another,

983
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,620
but the guard struck out his head and 
shoulder stand at attention,

984
01:01:53,621 --> 01:01:57,820
whore or it will be worse for you and 
now she was not moving.

985
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:00,790
Only weeping.
Forgive me,

986
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:03,460
citizen chief,
let me into the camp.

987
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:07,120
I won't do it anymore,
but even in the camp,

988
01:02:07,121 --> 01:02:09,040
no one was about to say to her,
all right,

989
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,120
idiot,
come on in.

990
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,250
The reason they were keeping her out 
there,

991
01:02:12,251 --> 01:02:13,084
so lauren was that the next day was 
Sunday and she would not be needed for 

992
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,040
work.
Such a straw.

993
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,100
Blonde,
naive,

994
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,860
uneducated,
uneducated slip of a girl.

995
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,460
She had been in prison for some spool of
thread.

996
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,630
What a dangerous thought.
You expressed their little sister.

997
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:34,140
They want to teach you a lesson for the 
rest of your life.

998
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:36,970
Fire,
fire.

999
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:37,953
We fought the war and we looked into the
bonfires to see what kind of victory it 

1000
01:02:41,951 --> 01:02:42,784
would be.
The wind wafted a glowing husk from the 

1001
01:02:45,131 --> 01:02:48,730
bonfire
to that flame in you.

1002
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,430
Girl,
I promise the whole wide world will read

1003
01:02:51,431 --> 01:02:52,264
about you

1004
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:56,003
from Milton.

1005
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,060
This is from paradise.
Lost.

1006
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,103
Milton wrote,
paradise lost just before the rise of 

1007
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:01,444
the nation states and melt and also had 
the intuition that there was something 

1008
01:03:05,351 --> 01:03:06,184
wrong with rationality and he identified
rationality with the mythology of Satan 

1009
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:13,360
and in the mythology of Satan,
Satan was

1010
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:18,490
represented as the highest angel in 
God's heavenly kingdom.

1011
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:19,533
So you can think about that as the 
highest psychological function who had 

1012
01:03:22,421 --> 01:03:25,570
rebelled against God and that was then 
cast into hell.

1013
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,643
And the idea.
There's an idea that's being expressed 

1014
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:29,200
by Milton.
He was.

1015
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,033
He was one of the most.
He was one of the foremost politik 

1016
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:34,384
geniuses of the English language milkmen
Shakespeare and what Milton was trying 

1017
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:39,514
to understand what's what is the nature 
of evil and his representation gathered 

1018
01:03:45,131 --> 01:03:49,720
up the dream like theories of evil that 
had been collected around all of Western

1019
01:03:49,721 --> 01:03:53,110
civilization for thousands of years.
And his hypothesis was this.

1020
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:54,843
Evil is the force that believes that 
it's knowledge is complete and that it 

1021
01:03:59,531 --> 01:04:03,190
can do without the transcendent and as 
soon as it makes that claim,

1022
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:08,220
it instantly exists in a place that's 
indistinguishable from hell and it could

1023
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:13,480
get out merely by admitting it's error 
and it will never do that

1024
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:17,403
for when,
but from the author of all ill could 

1025
01:04:19,331 --> 01:04:23,290
spring so deep,
a malice to confound the race of mankind

1026
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:28,291
in one route and earth withheld to 
mingle and involve done all to spite the

1027
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,164
great creator.
This is from Richard the Third 

1028
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:37,280
Shakespeare.
I shall despair.

1029
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,870
There is no creature,
loves me,

1030
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,970
and if I die,
no soul will pity me,

1031
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,410
nay,
wherefore should they.

1032
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:46,700
Since that I myself find in myself,
no pity to myself.

1033
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:51,223
Soldier knits and describes the 
reactions inactions of Communist Party 

1034
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:56,320
members who are devoured by the system 
because that often happened.

1035
01:04:56,620 --> 01:04:57,390
The the,
the,

1036
01:04:57,390 --> 01:04:58,223
the prison system.
The [inaudible] system was very in 

1037
01:05:00,231 --> 01:05:03,260
discriminating.
You could land there for good reasons or

1038
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:04,094
bad and the bad reasons.
We're probably better because the 

1039
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:09,380
punishment was more severe.
If you were in prison for your innocence

1040
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:10,663
and Communist Party members often got 
vacuumed up and this was ontologically 

1041
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:15,013
and existentially intolerable for them 
because they committed their whole soul 

1042
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:22,921
to the ideological dogma and then it's 
it's tyrannical aspect.

1043
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:24,004
Pick them up and destroyed them like 
they were worth nothing to say that 

1044
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:29,740
things were painful for them is to say 
almost nothing.

1045
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,830
They were incapable of assimilating such
a blow,

1046
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,790
such a downfall and from their own 
people to form their own dear party.

1047
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,833
The typical arrest was you're at home 
with your family in your bed and it's 

1048
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:43,114
3:00 in the morning and the doors kicked
down and they take you out of your bed 

1049
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:48,034
in whatever you happen to be wearing and
they tell you to say goodbye to your 

1050
01:05:50,501 --> 01:05:51,334
family and give you like 25 seconds to 
pack and then you're gone and no one 

1051
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:56,650
sees you again.

1052
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,070
They take you to the prison.
They take off all your clothes.

1053
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:00,963
They shave your head.
They have you pick out some random 

1054
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:06,970
clothes from a pile of clothes.
Hopefully they don't fit and then you're

1055
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:09,070
tried.
You confess,

1056
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,790
if you will,
and you're off to the prison camp to say

1057
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:15,190
that things were painful for them,
is to say almost nothing.

1058
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:17,680
They were incapable of assimilating such
a blow,

1059
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:18,783
such a downfall and from their own 
people to from their own dear party and 

1060
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,810
from all appearances for nothing at all.
After all,

1061
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:28,420
they had been guilty of nothing as far 
as the party was concerned,

1062
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,523
nothing at all.
It was painful to them to such a degree 

1063
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:33,963
that it was considered taboo among them 
on comradely to ask what were you in 

1064
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:38,584
prison for?
They were the only squeamish generation 

1065
01:06:41,021 --> 01:06:41,854
of prisoners.
The rest of us with our tongues hanging 

1066
01:06:43,241 --> 01:06:45,460
out,
couldn't wait to tell the story to every

1067
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:49,270
chance newcomer we met and to the whole 
cell as if it were an anecdote.

1068
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:54,490
Here's the sort of people they were told
us.

1069
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:55,333
The Oseberg's husband had already been 
arrested and they had come to carry out 

1070
01:06:57,971 --> 01:06:58,804
a search and arrest her too.
The search lasted for hours and she 

1071
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:03,814
spent those four hours sorting out the 
minutes of the congress of the bristle 

1072
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,533
brush industry,
of which she had been the secretary 

1073
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:11,464
until the previous day.
The incomplete state of the minutes 

1074
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:17,320
troubled her more than her children who 
she was now leaving forever.

1075
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,800
Even the interrogator conducting the 
search could not resist telling her,

1076
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,710
come on now,
say farewell to your children.

1077
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:25,683
Here's the sort of people they were a 
letter from her 15 year old daughter 

1078
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:31,320
came to yellows,
Aventa,

1079
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:34,630
set Cova in the prison for longterm 
prisoners.

1080
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,340
Mama,
tell me,

1081
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:39,010
write to me,
are you guilty or not?

1082
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,340
I hope you weren't guilty because then I
won't join the Komsomol,

1083
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:43,263
which was the young communist 
organization and I won't forgive them 

1084
01:07:45,911 --> 01:07:48,700
because of you,
but if you are guilty,

1085
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:50,380
I won't write you anymore and I will 
hate you.

1086
01:07:51,010 --> 01:07:51,843
And the mother was stricken by remorse 
in her damp grave like cell with it's 

1087
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:58,060
dim little lamp.
How could her daughter lived without the

1088
01:07:58,061 --> 01:07:58,894
Komsomol?
How could she possibly be permitted to 

1089
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:04,000
hate Soviet power?
Better that she should hate me.

1090
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:05,620
And so she wrote,
I am guilty.

1091
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,000
Enter the Komsomol,
how could it be anything but hard.

1092
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,163
It was more than the human heart could 
bear to fall beneath the beloved acts 

1093
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,040
and then to have to

1094
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
justify its wisdom,
but that's the price of man pays for 

1095
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,680
interesting,
his God given salty human dogma.

1096
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,903
Even today,
any orthodox communist will affirm that 

1097
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:25,784
set go the acted correctly even today.
They cannot be convinced that this is 

1098
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:29,894
precisely quote the perversion of small 
forces that the mother perverted her 

1099
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:36,044
daughter and harmed her soul.
Here's the sort of people they were yt 

1100
01:08:39,051 --> 01:08:41,510
gave sincere testimony against her 
husband.

1101
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,480
Anything to aid the party.
Oh,

1102
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,314
how one could pity them if they at least
had come to comprehend their former 

1103
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:49,994
wretchedness.
This whole chapter could have been 

1104
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,890
writing quite differently if today,
at least they had forsaken their earlier

1105
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:55,724
views,
but it happened the way Marissa Daniel 

1106
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,380
had dreamed it would.
If I leave here someday,

1107
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,710
I'm going to live as if nothing had 
taken place.

1108
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:07,820
Loyalty in our view,
it's just plain pigheadedness.

1109
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:10,820
Those devotes to the theories of 
development,

1110
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:11,803
construed loyalty to that development to
mean renunciation to any personal 

1111
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:18,080
development whatsoever.
As Nikolai Adamovich villain,

1112
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:20,690
chuck said,
after serving 17 years,

1113
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,930
we believed in the party and we were not
mistaken.

1114
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:27,740
Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?
No,

1115
01:09:27,741 --> 01:09:29,720
it was not for show and not out of 
hypocrisy.

1116
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,823
Hypocrisy that they argued in the cells 
and defense of all the government's 

1117
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:33,734
actions.
They needed ideological arguments in 

1118
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,640
order to hold onto a sense of their own 
rightness.

1119
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,360
Otherwise insanity was not far off.

1120
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:47,710
Is this from paradise lost?
So in this scene,

1121
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,093
Satan is cast into hell and it's because
of his rebellion against the 

1122
01:09:54,911 --> 01:09:58,990
transcendent.
His idea that he himself is sufficient.

1123
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:03,310
This is his statement to his crew,
farewell,

1124
01:10:03,311 --> 01:10:08,311
happy fields where joy forever dwells.
Hail horrors,

1125
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,390
hail infernal world and Dow Profundus.
Tail received.

1126
01:10:12,391 --> 01:10:13,224
I knew possessor,
one who brings a mind not to be changed 

1127
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:18,124
by place or time.
The mind is its own place and in itself 

1128
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:24,350
can make a heaven of hell or hell of 
heaven.

1129
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,393
What matters?
Where if I be still the same and what I 

1130
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:33,200
should be all but less than he whom 
thunder have made greater.

1131
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:37,640
Here at least we shall be free.
The Almighty hath not built here for his

1132
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:40,580
envy will not drive us,
hence here we may rain,

1133
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:45,581
secure and in my choice to reign is 
worth ambition,

1134
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:47,023
though.
Inhale better to reign in hell than 

1135
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:49,634
serve in heaven.
The existentialists of the late 19th 

1136
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:12,211
century attempted to diagnose the 
pathology of the human personality at a

1137
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
deeper level.
I believe that anyone else had ever 

1138
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:20,400
attempted,
and there are fundamental conclusion was

1139
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,234
that
there are destruction by rationality of 

1140
01:11:32,991 --> 01:11:35,600
the evolved systems of meaning that 
people had

1141
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:42,100
previously lived within,
had undermined

1142
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:44,963
the psychological strength of each 
individual divorced from their own 

1143
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:54,151
history
that led them to be to gravitate towards

1144
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:59,731
either nihilism or as a counter position
to gravitate towards totalitarianism.

1145
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:03,653
The whole 20th century played out the 
pendulum swing between nihilism and 

1146
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:08,424
totalitarianism and in the background 
the existentialists and the 

1147
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:12,414
psychodynamic theorists were putting 
forward a theory which was that if 

1148
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:20,991
people lived up to their own possibility
and held onto their own experience as if

1149
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:26,910
it were true and did not substitute for 
that idiot,

1150
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:27,823
logical and consensual beliefs,
that it would be possible for each 

1151
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:33,864
person to find a wellspring of meaning.
That would be a sufficient replacement 

1152
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:41,910
for what had been lost historically 
without having to fall into the pitfalls

1153
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:44,610
of nihilism or totalitarianism,
and so you might say,

1154
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:45,444
well,

1155
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:47,970
nihilism.
Well,

1156
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,160
that's one thing because it's mostly 
that effects you,

1157
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:50,994
although if you're nihilistic than 
everyone around you is going to be 

1158
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:56,220
pulled down as well,
but totalitarianism is a whole different

1159
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:57,054
issue because what we know now is that 
once things become ideologically 

1160
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,120
totalitarian,
the next step is mass murder and and it.

1161
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,033
It's the next step is mass murder in a 
manner that makes it appear that the 

1162
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:10,584
purpose for the ideological rigidity 
vacation to begin with was the 

1163
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:16,200
opportunity to participate in mass 
murder.

1164
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:17,663
So you know how Hitler died.
Hitler lost faith in the German people 

1165
01:13:21,871 --> 01:13:22,770
because they were

1166
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:28,850
losing the war,
and so he concluded in the waning stages

1167
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:32,580
of world war two,
that Germany should just be destroyed in

1168
01:13:32,581 --> 01:13:36,330
fire and everything else that he could 
possibly consume would go with them.

1169
01:13:36,331 --> 01:13:39,990
And so he died in a bunker underneath 
Berlin when it was in flames.

1170
01:13:39,991 --> 01:13:40,824
He committed suicide when Europe was 
inflamed and Hitler was a worshiper of 

1171
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:49,791
the kind of fire that purifies,
use that mythology of cleansing fire to

1172
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,333
to enter into a terrible pact with the 
with the entire nation that he followed 

1173
01:13:57,721 --> 01:14:02,721
and lead and Stallon Stellan just didn't
just kill individuals that he pulled off

1174
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:08,600
the streets.
He killed like all the engineers and all

1175
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,860
the doctors because he believed they 
were records.

1176
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:16,360
They killed all the good farmers.
They killed 6 million Ukrainians.

1177
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:17,283
They moved whole nations of people into 
Siberia and let them die and there's 

1178
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,200
every,
every,

1179
01:14:23,260 --> 01:14:24,093
every bit of evidence there is suggest 
that what Stalin was doing was 

1180
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:29,434
practicing murderous genocide on an ever
larger scale and hoping that it would 

1181
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:40,411
culminate in a thermonuclear war
and we escaped that just by a thread.

1182
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:45,443
The existentialists make that claim,
which I think is a remarkable and 

1183
01:14:48,661 --> 01:14:49,494
powerful claim that the way out of those
catastrophic situations is not through 

1184
01:14:57,001 --> 01:14:57,834
political action per se or it's not 
going to be resolved by one party 

1185
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:05,100
defeating another or one position 
defeating another.

1186
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:10,140
That's our continuation of the same 
process that produces the problem,

1187
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:17,290
the existential and the psychodynamic 
answer to this problem is that it's more

1188
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,600
a disease of the soul than a disease of 
the state,

1189
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:22,213
and that the way to address it is to 
ensure that you live in a manner that 

1190
01:15:25,851 --> 01:15:30,851
makes you neither nihilistic nor 
susceptible to ideological possession.

1191
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:34,010
Soldier in Edson

1192
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,220
and uh,
and other other thinkers liked him,

1193
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,433
liked frankl,
believed that this society was a 

1194
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:51,680
macrocosm of the individual,
not the other way around.

1195
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:56,681
Not that the individual is sub element 
of society believed that the choice that

1196
01:15:57,171 --> 01:16:02,171
each individual made was potentially so 
powerful in relationship to pathological

1197
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:03,434
behavior or honest or honest and 
thoughtful behavior that a single 

1198
01:16:08,751 --> 01:16:12,440
individual properly developed could 
stand up against the tyranny and wind.

1199
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:16,310
And it seems to me,
and I thought about this for a very long

1200
01:16:16,311 --> 01:16:17,144
time,
that the lesson of the 20th century is 

1201
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:25,660
that a single individual can stand up 
against a tyrant and when,

1202
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:33,090
and each of us are single individuals 
and the danger of tyranny and the danger

1203
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:38,251
of nihilism or not passed.
And so as inheritors of the catastrophic

1204
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:44,800
legacy of the 20th century and there's 
inhabitants of the new millennium,

1205
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:50,340
part of your responsibility is to live 
your own life and to live it honestly,

1206
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:56,620
and to pay attention to your own 
experience and not take the easy way out

1207
01:16:56,621 --> 01:17:01,621
that ideological systems offer you.
They're destined to transform themselves

1208
01:17:02,241 --> 01:17:03,074
into rigid and murderous pathologies.
And you offload your responsibility for 

1209
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:09,680
thinking and acting to them.

1210
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:12,850
And then you have to ask yourself,
well,

1211
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:16,400
what are they?
Well,

1212
01:17:16,410 --> 01:17:17,243
all the evidence suggests that they're 
not the sort of thing that you want to 

1213
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:24,261
have in your head.
The grades are up.

1214
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:33,570
We'll see you on Tuesday.
