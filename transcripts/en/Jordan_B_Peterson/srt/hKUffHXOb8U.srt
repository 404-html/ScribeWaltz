1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,113
Welcome to the fence planers.
I'm Danielle crittendon and I'm 

2
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:04,294
Christina Hoff summers and we are 
thrilled to have the father of all 

3
00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:09,574
mansplainers in our studio today.
I think he's actually more of a man 

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,540
whisperer.
Yes,

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,553
a man whisperer.
I'm the mad genius behind the 

6
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:22,570
intellectual dark web,
whatever.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,120
Welcome to the FIMS planers Jordan 
Peterson.

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:25,954
Thank you very much.
So delighted to have you and it's an 

9
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:32,890
honor to have you honor.
It's an Ode to our listeners.

10
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,963
We're recording this in front of a live 
audience at the American Enterprise 

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:37,983
Institute in Washington DC where 
Christina is a resident scholar and 

12
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,364
there'll be video of the podcast as well
and we will let you know where to find 

13
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:46,594
that when it's ready and we're also 
grateful to Aei every week for the use 

14
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:50,524
of its recording studio for the podcast 
and now for an introduction though he 

15
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:57,520
needs no introduction to the people 
here,

16
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:58,354
but Jordan Peterson is a professor at 
the University of Toronto and author of 

17
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:03,124
many books and and poster of many 
fantastic lecturers and his most recent 

18
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:11,560
book has.
I can't keep track of how many languages

19
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:12,394
it's been translated into and the sales.
Just a phenomenally successful book 

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,280
tour.
In fact,

21
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:20,680
my first question is really about your 
tour.

22
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,260
You look pretty good for somebody who's 
visited what,

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,360
100 cities in the past since January 
23rd.

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,420
I don't know how you do it and mostly 
flying.

25
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
What do you do for fun?
What do you ever get to relax in brief 

26
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:41,950
moments and what do you do?
Go on twitter and

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,043
good.
Although I've been qualified that is 

28
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:49,400
relaxing and I tried to forestall that 
temptation as much as possible.

29
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,830
Well,
I have the automotive bit of time that I

30
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,710
spend with my wife.
She does travel with me and so,

31
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,580
you know,
we've had,

32
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,483
we,
we try to take some time to walk around 

33
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,850
the cities that we're in,
um,

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,620
and see what we can.
It's,

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,473
we're usually not at any given place for
more than a day or two and they're 

36
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,730
usually pretty packed up with,
well,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,833
whatever is associated with the lecture.
And then with press that the publishers 

38
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:13,634
usually arrange.

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,593
Well,
I heard you interviewed in Sweden in 

40
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,300
Stockholm and you were,
you had a half an hour to visit the city

41
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:24,130
with your wife and you loved it,
but that,

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,510
you know,
it's true

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,160
breaks where you get them.
Well,

44
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:28,994
the thing is is that the,
the lecture tour is unbelievably 

45
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:36,080
positive and a lot of this is,
is ridiculously positive,

46
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:36,531
you know,
like,

47
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,910
so if I'm going out on the streets now 
or in cafes or you know,

48
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:41,744
airports,
I meet people all the time and they're 

49
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,510
always polite and they're always happy 
to see me and they always have some very

50
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:54,731
touching story to relate and then the 
audiences themselves are very positively

51
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:59,920
predisposed to whatever it is that doing
together.

52
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:04,921
And so that makes it a lot easier to
stay motivated and,

53
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,063
and to continue right now.
I mean it's demanding because 

54
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,314
everything's scheduled so tightly and,
and I do a different lecture every 

55
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,170
night,
every,

56
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,003
every time I go,

57
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,883
I find that amazing because I get a lot 
of lectures that I anguish over every 

58
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:23,954
word.
And then I have another one and you go 

59
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,740
up without notes.

60
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,491
Yeah.
Well,

61
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:31,650
I have a large collection of things that
I know what,

62
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,613
how to talk about and usually what I try
to do is to formulate a problem before 

63
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:41,231
the lecture so I'm addressing a specific
problem and then I can track how I would

64
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,630
set up the argument and then I walked 
through it,

65
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:48,290
but part of it's also an attempt to 
formulate the argument on the fly,

66
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:48,850
you know,
to,

67
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,683
to make the question what would you say 
to formulate it more precisely and to 

68
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:56,420
make a more precise and engaging answer 
and then I can use the audience to judge

69
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,460
whether or not that's,
that's happening.

70
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,210
And so it's also a real challenge to do 
that.

71
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:03,044
So I enjoyed that and it's a excellent 
intellectual workout and I've been 

72
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:09,374
recording the lectures and I've been 
using fair some of them to write the 

73
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:18,260
first draft of the chapters for my next 
book and for books after that.

74
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:19,310
And so,
you know,

75
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm,
I'm able to maximize the,

76
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,603
what would you say that utility of doing
this at each event and my wife seems to 

77
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:29,420
be particularly well suited to traveling
like that.

78
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,254
She actually enjoys it quite a bit and 
is a very stable person and so that's 

79
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,060
also helpful.
So,

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,960
uh,
and,

81
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,561
and,
you know,

82
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:40,394
it's nice to have an extra brain along 
because things are scheduled so tightly 

83
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,500
that we don't ever have any room for 
error.

84
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,180
Yes.
Well,

85
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,340
we're going to,
I can't,

86
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,683
I don't know how intellectually rigorous
we plan to be with you today because we 

87
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:56,210
know that when ever you on one of these 
platform,

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,660
you're talking about your ideas,
but on the fence planners,

89
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:02,510
we want to hear more,
a little bit more about Jordan Peterson,

90
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:07,250
the man desk desperately and definitely 
want to hear about your wife Tammy,

91
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,880
and also you're so well known for your 
views on men or how your ideas have been

92
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,240
taken up.
So enthusiastic or by young men,

93
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:19,940
but we want to talk to about women.
Yep.

94
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,930
That's good.
So,

95
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,803
but
one of the things you and I share is 

96
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,980
that we both grew up in Canada.
I promise,

97
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:30,380
Christine,
I would not do my Canadian accent.

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,890
So while you were here,
but you grew up in rural Alberta.

99
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,530
I grew up in Toronto.
Um,

100
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,620
and you are what the country's most 
famous guru now since Marshall Mcluhan,

101
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,583
m and a,
but it's the fact that you came from 

102
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:51,050
Canada,
have any effect on your views,

103
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,060
do you think,
has it formed you in any way?

104
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,380
I mean,
what did,

105
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,303
what would it,
what would it be the same if you think 

106
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,070
you'd grown in rural Texas?

107
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,640
How is Canada contributed to your 
worldview?

108
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,240
She's always looking to the Canadian 
Angle Canada.

109
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:06,130
So in Canada,

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,713
well I think is a particular part of 
Canada I grew up in probably was 

111
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,360
formative to some degree.
I mean the town I grew up in was only 50

112
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:18,194
years old and the particular part of the
world that I grew up in was really the 

113
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:26,030
last settled part of the North American 
prairie.

114
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,560
This was outside of Edmonton,
correct?

115
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,970
Both 400 miles north of Edmonton.
Oh,

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,833
400 years.

117
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,461
Yeah.
Yeah,

118
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,050
it's right at the tip of the short,
short,

119
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,710
short.
So the prairie,

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,153
the prairie stretches up that far north.
It's stretches up farther north in 

121
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:42,040
Alberta than it does anywhere else in 
the North American continent.

122
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:45,910
And so we were at the tip of viable 
farming essentially,

123
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,010
and so it was,
um,

124
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,660
it was a new place and it was a rather 
raw place and it was,

125
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,940
it was a rather harsh place in many 
ways,

126
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,410
especially because of the winter and it 
was fundamentally a working class place,

127
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,450
although a prosperous working class 
place,

128
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:02,284
right.
Because most of the industry there was 

129
00:07:03,911 --> 00:07:04,744
related to the oil and gas industry on.
Although it was cyclical when things 

130
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:12,520
were good working class people could 
make a very good living.

131
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,860
This was during the whole.
Yeah,

132
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,763
that's great.
I to be a kid in 400 miles outside a 

133
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,150
small town.
But yeah,

134
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
I liked it when I was a kid.
I,

135
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,500
I wouldn't say it was as fun when I was 
a teenager.

136
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,890
Um,
but I'm not convinced that,

137
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,950
you know,
the majority of people who are teenagers

138
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,350
necessarily have the most wonderful time
of it.

139
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:36,723
Um,
I think adults often look backwards at 

140
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:40,264
the pass through rose colored glasses.
I think that's what the cartoonist 

141
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,670
trudeau accused Reagan of doing 
continually.

142
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,193
Gary,

143
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,280
Mr. No,
no,

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,313
definitely not.
Used for it in your book was teenage 

145
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:57,510
wasteland?
Yeah,

146
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,270
what you call it,
but yeah,

147
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,710
but it's Canadianness does.
How does that form you or affected you,

148
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,860
if at all?
Maybe it didn't.

149
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,153
It's hard to say.
I mean I've lived in lots of different 

150
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,650
parts of Canada now and and Canada does 
quite different.

151
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:18,510
I lived in Alberta for a while and it 
had this particular flavor of existence.

152
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,344
I mean mostly in fairview.
I was striving to leave [inaudible] and 

153
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:26,460
to move ahead let's say,
or two moves,

154
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,223
I hesitate to say up,
but somewhere different somewhere more 

155
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,580
urban,
but that's the case with many people.

156
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,890
I mean the small towns all across the 
West in theU ,

157
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,873
s and Canada are dying.
They're down to nothing because 

158
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:43,110
everyone's moved to the cities.
I lived in Montreal for a good while and

159
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,180
that was interesting because it was a 
very,

160
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:49,530
very different culture.
It was a culture that was to some degree

161
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,430
stratified by language and by class.
None of that was true in Alberta because

162
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,500
it was so new that there is no class.
Right.

163
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,160
So that was quite

164
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,130
interesting.
You worked what I loved.

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
I pulled a passage because I think as 
you say,

166
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,340
people are born in small places 
everywhere and someone to leave and some

167
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,190
don't.
You said I wanted to be elsewhere.

168
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,113
I wasn't the only one.
Everyone who eventually left the 

169
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,144
fairview I grew up knew they were 
leaving by the age of 12 I knew and my 

170
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,720
wife who grew up with me on the same 
street knew.

171
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,330
What was that thing?
What would you call that?

172
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,300
What's the thing that makes you want to 
leave and sets you off?

173
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,910
Because you point out there was no class
system.

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,890
Education was cheap in Canada compared 
to them.

175
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,890
It wasn't ego,
it wasn't cost.

176
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,190
It was stopping people from a middle 
class or you other

177
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,980
teacher.
And my wouldn't.

178
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,570
My mother was a librarian.
The Bush,

179
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,730
you're trained as a nurse.
So,

180
00:09:39,731 --> 00:09:41,360
you know,
we had a comfortable,

181
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,870
I would say a suburban lifestyle 
essentially,

182
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,183
you know,
um,

183
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,080
moderate,
middle class suburban lifestyle.

184
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:48,914
That's what fair have you looked like?
It looked like a suburb that was built 

185
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:51,704
mostly in the ninth,
say between the 19 fifties in the 19 

186
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:55,340
seventies.
So

187
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,310
the young Jordan and the then young 
Tammy,

188
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:01,100
and you'll have to tell us that story,
how you met but wanted,

189
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,293
wanted more.

190
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,373
Well,
you know,

191
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,000
I think that's one thing that is 
different to some degree about class.

192
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,643
Um,
my father and my mother had both left 

193
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:15,094
the towns they were from and they were 
forward future looking people and you 

194
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,714
know,
most of my friends who quit school and 

195
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,120
who didn't attend university,
they didn't have,

196
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:29,390
they didn't have that sense.
I would say that more developed sense of

197
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:32,870
a world outside of what they knew.
And the other thing is that my,

198
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,110
my father took us on long trips when I 
was a kid.

199
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,273
He was a teacher and so he had summer 
holidays and we drove all over western 

200
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:43,580
Canada and down into theU ,
s long driving trips,

201
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:45,420
thousands of miles.
And you know,

202
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,500
that also gave us the sense that the 
world was a bigger place.

203
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:49,334
But I knew way before I was 12.
I believe that I was off at least to 

204
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,060
university.
And I think generally in your family,

205
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,960
if you're liable to go to university,
people don't even really talk about it.

206
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:02,450
It's just a given that that's what's 
going to happen.

207
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,310
It's something that you take in with 
every breath almost.

208
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,583
It's,
it's an and it's often an unspoken 

209
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:11,804
expectation and maybe people make casual
reference like well when you go to 

210
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:16,664
college,
but it's not like there's a question 

211
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:19,424
about it.
Whereas if you're from a working class 

212
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:24,320
background,
especially if your family hasn't pursued

213
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,154
postsecondary education that isn't in 
the realm of unspoken or spoken 

214
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:31,220
expectation.
And it wasn't like,

215
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,083
like lots of my friends,
including many of them who dropped out 

216
00:11:33,981 --> 00:11:36,530
before they hit high school,
they weren't by,

217
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:39,800
they were by no means the dumbest people
in the class.

218
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,663
Like they were plenty smart but they 
weren't oriented towards the idea of 

219
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,640
pursuing a career that involved 
intellectual.

220
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,930
What intellectual engagement wasn't in 
their worldview.

221
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,320
And you know,
when you hear people on the,

222
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,960
let's say more socialist end of the 
distribution,

223
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:02,794
talk about barriers to education.
They are often talk about cost and 

224
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,490
sometimes cost is a barrier.
And,

225
00:12:07,491 --> 00:12:09,010
and,
and it's more the merrier.

226
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,210
Yeah.
And it's more of a barrier,

227
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,044
although there's still plenty of 
community colleges and state colleges 

228
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:17,080
where you can get educated for a 
perfectly reasonable amount of money.

229
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,273
But for my friends,
it was never a reason that money was 

230
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,384
never a reason.
They didn't pursue post secondary 

231
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,454
education.
It was more like a truncated view of 

232
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,890
time,
I would say,

233
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,783
you know,
there was more of an emphasis on the 

234
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,360
here and now and there were jobs the 
plenty.

235
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,800
I guess there also that.
Yeah.

236
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:37,600
Yeah.
And well paying jobs,

237
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,434
like it wasn't obvious that you were in 
better shape economically to go to 

238
00:12:40,991 --> 00:12:41,530
university.

239
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,720
They have.
Yeah.

240
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,583
Well,
especially if you were doing something 

241
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:45,570
like working on the oil rigs.
Right.

242
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,310
But um,
but you know,

243
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,450
that was rough,
cold,

244
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,284
harsh work and it wasn't,
it wasn't once you had an in you could 

245
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,160
stay employed,
but it wasn't that easy to land an entry

246
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,350
level job either.
And so,

247
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,270
um,
yeah,

248
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,104
well it was wise for lots of work.
He caused people to work in those jobs 

249
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,060
because they were unbelievably 
lucrative.

250
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,613
So,
and they should have been because they 

251
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,950
were very difficult and dangerous and 
frigid cold and,

252
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
and,
and rough.

253
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,193
So,
you know,

254
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,850
it's not like the people didn't earn 
your money.

255
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,360
Let's just tell us quickly how you met 
your wife.

256
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:20,194
You were,
you met her when you were seven or 

257
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:24,850
eight,
or in grade three and grade three?

258
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,050
Yeah.
And you,

259
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,750
did you fall in love with her in grade 
three?

260
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,950
Grade three,
yeah.

261
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,410
And was it mutual?

262
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,750
She wouldn't,
she wouldn't admit it if it was.

263
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,510
There were lots of the boys in grade 
three were in love with her.

264
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,883
She had a whole little crew of guys that
were perfectly willing to follow her 

265
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,500
around and she was perfectly willing to 
exploit that.

266
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,650
She very good at it.
Yeah.

267
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,930
She was very popular.
Little girl.

268
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,780
Wonderful.
That you met his children.

269
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,370
We were friends for a long time.
You know,

270
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,233
we used to play chess together and 
croquet and she is a vicious croquet 

271
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:02,180
player.
She would,

272
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know if you've ever played 
croquet,

273
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:04,834
but if it's,
if your balls touch then you can stand 

274
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:08,944
on Ireson wack it and then the other 
person's ball will vanish off into the 

275
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,983
stratosphere and she liked to knock it 
all the way down the street and then 

276
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,130
she'd laugh and so she,
she always had a good sense of,

277
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,063
of good vicious sense of humor is one of
the things I actually admired about my 

278
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:28,120
wife when we're not,
when we've had our verbal disputes,

279
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,470
which you know,
have certainly happened.

280
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,390
She can string together a sequence of 
insults that.

281
00:14:32,391 --> 00:14:37,330
So hair racing that you have to laugh.
It's like,

282
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,000
did she have brothers?
She did.

283
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,280
She has a brother much older,
eight years older,

284
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,290
but he's quite a peaceful person and she
had two brothers can't seem to get along

285
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:52,010
with guys where they show love and 
affection by

286
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,143
insults and jabs and jeers.
And if you and I had brother and I sort 

287
00:14:57,181 --> 00:14:57,951
of learned,
okay,

288
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,420
I can,
but if you don't have brothers,

289
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,201
girls like,
oh,

290
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,280
that's so rude.
That's so,

291
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,120
so she was.
Yeah.

292
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,740
Well,
she,

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,573
she,
she has a naturally or maybe case she 

294
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:10,190
came by it naturally in twists.
She lost her father is,

295
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,610
are quite sharp,
witted and,

296
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,170
and,
and um,

297
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,343
well he was a real town character.
He's still alive and he was a real 

298
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,790
character in the tone,
real hyper extrovert.

299
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,683
Everybody knew him and he had a pretty 
good width on them and she had some of 

300
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,720
that while it still does have some of 
that,

301
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,110
so she was a side from her humor and her

302
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,330
ability to whack balls and I just don't 
want to go further on that description,

303
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,960
that many,
many things that tells us about you.

304
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,340
What else brought,
what else attract.

305
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,110
I mean you've known her pretty much your
whole life,

306
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,973
so some of the other qualities that not 
just attracted you but enable you to 

307
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,720
sustain.
I mean,

308
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,450
I think every young person in this room 
will want to know,

309
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,060
and maybe there isn't one,
but what's the secret?

310
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:58,590
What's it like to be with someone that 
long?

311
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:00,420
How do you sustain that?

312
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,380
We're fortunate.
Some of it's,

313
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:06,490
some of it's good fortune.
When I would say this is true,

314
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,470
I've watched people in their 
relationships,

315
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,873
no personally for a long time,
but also as a professional because I've 

316
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:16,780
done a lot of clinical counseling and I 
mean there's some things that need to be

317
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:17,614
a given about the relationship.
I would say it doesn't hurt to find the 

318
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:23,740
other person very attractive,
you know,

319
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,574
and that's a mysterious thing where 
we're not exactly sure what it is that 

320
00:16:27,731 --> 00:16:29,950
produces,
let's say chemistry between people.

321
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,590
Although chemistry is definitely part of
what produces it.

322
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,920
There's subtle things that attract 
people to one another that are way below

323
00:16:35,921 --> 00:16:38,440
the level of consciousness.
So for example,

324
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,800
women don't like the older men who have 
rh blood factors.

325
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,630
Who if they had children with would be 
likely to produce a stillborn infant.

326
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,290
Well that's definitely a category on 
match.com.

327
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,740
Well,
it's so strange though,

328
00:16:55,741 --> 00:16:58,870
because you
know,

329
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,260
that's a good question.
And you know,

330
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,010
you know,
by older apparently,

331
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,933
and so there's all wearing Cologne
then it would depend on what type of 

332
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,050
Cologne
smell is very

333
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,083
strange sense and it's very deeply tied 
to very profound emotions including 

334
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:18,634
memory.
And so you find people attractive for 

335
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:25,231
reasons that you can't always determine.
And so,

336
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,000
so that,
that was part of it.

337
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:28,834
I mean I've always found her very 
attractive and that continues and I 

338
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,570
liked her combativeness,
you know,

339
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,433
like I think that there's,
you want someone I think in a 

340
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,754
relationship that you can spar with and 
it's partly because you have hard 

341
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:51,001
problems to solve and if the person 
you're with isn't willing to put forward

342
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,063
their opinion,
then you only have half the cognitive 

343
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:56,334
power that you would otherwise have now.
And hopefully you find someone who's 

344
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,433
interestingly different from you,
like not so different that you can't 

345
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,390
communicate and you have to be careful 
of that.

346
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,590
But interestingly different.
And then hopefully they have the ability

347
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,450
and the will to express their opinion.

348
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,700
And then all,
then it's,

349
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,043
you know,
then then your interests stays 

350
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:20,190
heightened and there has to be that 
tension in a relationship.

351
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,210
You know,
people think,

352
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,140
well I want to get along perfectly with 
my partner.

353
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:26,400
It's like,
no,

354
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,403
you probably don't.
You just get bored and then you go 

355
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,074
looking for trouble.
And so you want a little bit of trouble 

356
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:36,570
in the relationship and the little bit 
of mystery and a little bit of combat of

357
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:41,571
medicine and the ability to exchange 
opinions forthrightly and,

358
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,070
and I trust her,
which is a huge element.

359
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,820
I mean,
when,

360
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,340
when we finally did decide to get 
together permanently,

361
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,180
we're both in our later twenties and,
you know,

362
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:58,190
one of the things that I had learned by 
that point and insisted to her about was

363
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:04,101
that we had to tell each other the truth
and she took to that wholeheartedly,

364
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,640
you know,
and um,

365
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,670
for better and for worse because truths 
can be harsh.

366
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,880
Does that include like does this outfit?
Yeah.

367
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:17,714
Well,
the truthful answer to that is I don't 

368
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,570
answer questions that are likely to get 
me in trouble.

369
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,840
So my,
I have a son who will answer honestly,

370
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:27,674
and it's infuriating,
but then I realized if you want the 

371
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,140
truth,
talk to Tamworth.

372
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,810
Well that's the thing,
you know,

373
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:33,644
it's,
it's useful to know the truth is 

374
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:38,570
empowering truth tellers are 
charismatic.

375
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:41,600
And actually both my sons are like 
brutally honest,

376
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:42,770
which is disconcerting.
Yeah.

377
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,473
But it's,
I can see that it has made them very 

378
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,000
formidable.
And,

379
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,953
and because of that,
people trust them and friendships and 

380
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,060
just,
it gives them the.

381
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,590
And you've written a lot about this.

382
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,331
Well,
you know,

383
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,450
if,
if I tell my wife that she looks good in

384
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:01,900
an outfit,
she knows that I mean it.

385
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,020
Yeah.
And so there's some utility.

386
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:04,923
No.
And then if you're silent and say I 

387
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:07,850
don't answer her questions that she goes
and she goes,

388
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,020
well sometimes sometimes,
you know,

389
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,900
she'll say,
you know,

390
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,120
do you like this and all Keller that I 
don't.

391
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,470
And,
and you know,

392
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,230
and that really

393
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,630
make her happy in the moment.
Right.

394
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,170
But,
but if I do say I like it,

395
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:24,300
she knows that I mean in,
and you know,

396
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,040
I actually liked her sense of style a 
lot.

397
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,190
So it turns out that 90 percent of the 
time it's pretty easy for me to say,

398
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,390
look,
I think you look great and mean it.

399
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,190
And uh,
you know,

400
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,700
she's a fairly harsh standard bearer to 
like,

401
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,593
she's,
she's insisted that I stay in whatever 

402
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:41,760
reasonable physical shape I happened to 
be in,

403
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,570
you know,
that was,

404
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,403
that was something that she's very 
demanding of and I would say that it's 

405
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:51,531
the same my side and we've been good at 
negotiating,

406
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,130
which is,
you know,

407
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:56,500
what do you want from a partner?
Fundamentally,

408
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,910
what,
what do you want need,

409
00:20:57,911 --> 00:20:58,744
I mean,
the first thing is that I'll hopefully 

410
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,481
you,
like I said,

411
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:02,314
you're blessed with the fact that you 
find each other attractive and I think 

412
00:21:05,141 --> 00:21:05,974
it's very difficult for the relationship
to begin or proceed or sustain itself 

413
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,460
without that.

414
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,250
But having that,
then what do you want?

415
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,980
While you want someone that you can 
trust,

416
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,833
you want someone that you can build a 
view of the future with and you want 

417
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:21,454
someone that you can negotiate with.
And that's very hard to negotiate with 

418
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,340
people because they have to tell you 
what they think.

419
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:30,130
They have to know what they want or 
figure it out.

420
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:30,964
They have to tell you what they want.
They have to be satisfied when they get 

421
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:34,744
what they want,
which is also a very difficult thing to 

422
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:36,994
manage and you have to continually 
update that because your life goes 

423
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,254
through different stages and well in 
your attraction wanes as we all know it 

424
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,290
are

425
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,290
agent live not fatally necessarily for 
yourself but but no,

426
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:54,540
but you will go.
I mean you will not be 25 forever so.

427
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,270
So that that has to be renegotiated.
Yeah,

428
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,160
well when you have to work at that too,
you know,

429
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,063
and that's something that people also 
don't understand because they tend to 

430
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:04,640
think that,
well,

431
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,120
the that all romantic interaction should
be spontaneous.

432
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,141
It's like,
well,

433
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:10,974
if that's your theory,
then you might as well just give up 

434
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,853
right now if you're going to get married
because that like the only reason you 

435
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:17,934
can think that is because you don't have
enough responsibility to make romantic 

436
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:24,330
entanglement virtually impossible.
And what happens when you're married,

437
00:22:24,331 --> 00:22:26,040
especially when you have little kids,
is that,

438
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,680
and you both have a job,
let's say,

439
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,753
is you're so busy that the probability 
that you're going to find time for 

440
00:22:32,521 --> 00:22:36,330
spontaneous mutual interaction is 
decreased to zero.

441
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,720
And so if that's what you're hoping for,
then you're never gonna have it.

442
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:43,200
And so what you have to do is you have 
to make time for each other and you know

443
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,034
if you're dating,
when you're establishing a relationship 

444
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,580
while you put some effort into it,
do you know you,

445
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,483
you decide that you're going to go out 
for dinner and you dress up to some 

446
00:22:52,981 --> 00:22:53,814
degree and you know you try to present 
yourself to each other in some halfways 

447
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,623
mutually acceptable manner and you hope 
that there's going to be a positive 

448
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:01,584
consequence of that,
that you're going to find each other 

449
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,594
attractive.

450
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,600
But then as people somehow think that 
once they're married,

451
00:23:06,601 --> 00:23:09,390
that the same amount of effort isn't 
necessary.

452
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:10,224
And that's wrong.
I would say more effort is necessary on 

453
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,560
the same front end.
And you have to think it through.

454
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,810
It's like,
you know,

455
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,820
if you don't want to be bitter about the
intimate element of your relationship,

456
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,100
how much time do you have to spend 
together each week,

457
00:23:26,101 --> 00:23:26,934
and my,
my rule of thumb sort of derived from 

458
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:30,144
clinical observations is that you need 
to spend 90 minutes a week with your 

459
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,494
partner talking and that means you're 
telling each other about your life and 

460
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:40,320
staying in touch,
you know,

461
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:41,154
so that you each know what the other is 
up to and you're discussing what needs 

462
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:45,324
to be done,
keep the household running smoothly and 

463
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:47,894
you're laying out some mutually 
acceptable vision of how the next week 

464
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:52,820
or the next months are going to go 
together.

465
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,683
Right?
So that,

466
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,760
that keeps your narratives locked 
together.

467
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,680
Like a,
like the strands in a rope.

468
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,663
You need that for 90 minutes or you 
drift apart and you need to spend 

469
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,140
intimate time together at least once a 
week and probably more like twice.

470
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,410
And that has to be negotiated.
And if you don't negotiate it and if you

471
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:13,130
don't make it a priority,
then it won't happen in all likelihood.

472
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,450
And then,
well,

473
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,170
well then you don't have it.
And that's a catastrophe because there's

474
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:21,620
not that many things in life that are 
intrinsically,

475
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,993
what would you say,
engaging and meaningful and pleasurable 

476
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:29,180
and also bonding all of that.
And if you let that go,

477
00:24:29,181 --> 00:24:30,014
then well part of you dies and part of 
the relationship dies and while then 

478
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:34,994
there's always the possibility of 
becoming attracted by alternative 

479
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,720
entanglement,
which,

480
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,450
which you would do if you had any spirit
left.

481
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,520
Right?
I mean that's the thing is if,

482
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,540
well,
if you're not,

483
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,990
if you're.
If your relationship at home is entirely

484
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,260
unsatisfying sexually,
what are you supposed to do with that?

485
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,920
Nothing is supposed to just bear it in 
one way.

486
00:24:54,921 --> 00:24:56,930
The answer is yes because it's your 
marriage,

487
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,710
but another way as well,
that's all the fight you've got in you.

488
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,993
You're going to just let the erotic 
element of your life die and accept 

489
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:06,944
everything that goes along with that 
because you're not willing to cause a 

490
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,420
bit of trouble to ensure that it's 
maintained and you know,

491
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:17,060
and we're not very good at thinking 
these things through consciously.

492
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,493
I mean,
people are bad at negotiating period as 

493
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,134
far as I can tell,
but they're particularly bad at 

494
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,650
negotiating things that are deeply 
private.

495
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,770
How much do you want your partner to 
know about you anyways?

496
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,353
It takes a lot of trust to have a real 
conversation about what you need and 

497
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,214
want.

498
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,590
Now you have it in the press.
People read that you are a.

499
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,730
You have a following of young men and I 
went to hear your lecture and Washington

500
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,730
DC and there were a lot of women there 
and your book,

501
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,123
first of all,
men don't buy books that often compared 

502
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,554
to women,
so I'm presuming you have a lot of 

503
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:58,564
female readers and I found it,
Danielle and I found it completely 

504
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,793
readable and it wasn't uncommon for men.
It was more like a delusional desire on 

505
00:26:08,741 --> 00:26:09,574
the part of the radical leftists that 
the only people that could possibly be 

506
00:26:12,221 --> 00:26:14,430
attracted to me or angry men.
Exactly.

507
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,960
It'd be better if they were angry young 
white men,

508
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,730
you know,
because then that fits the narrative.

509
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,623
Particularly,
there's a way you have a diverse 

510
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:21,754
audience and diverse following,
including many women and they're also 

511
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,960
not particularly angry.
I mean,

512
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,023
I've talked to 200 using the anger.
That's the point of your book is stop 

513
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,290
being angry.
Stop being resentful.

514
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:32,680
Right.

515
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,320
Of resentment is that.
That's absolutely crippling.

516
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:38,410
Resentment.
Just zenman deceit,

517
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,730
arrogance.
That's part of.

518
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,030
I'm writing another book and one of the 
rules is don't allow yourself to

519
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,760
resentful receiptful,
deceitful and arrogant fingers together.

520
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,500
Yeah,
but it could be rad if you just.

521
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,910
Well,
that's supposed to be a good thing.

522
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,343
Yeah.

523
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,990
There's been 250,000 people,
as I said,

524
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:01,960
come to the lectures and there hasn't 
been a single negative incident.

525
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,953
Not One.
This is what I find fascinating is that 

526
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,803
I found you early on.
I said I'd had no idea you were just 

527
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:11,594
that.
It was like butch cassidy and the 

528
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:15,390
Sundance kid.
Like who is that guy?

529
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,343
Who is that guy?
Like you were pretty good and we were 

530
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,430
covering a lot of the same topics later 
on.

531
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,650
Yeah.
Wow.

532
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,830
And then,
you know,

533
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:24,983
I found out who you were.
What is astonishing to me is that 

534
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,273
there's this amazing,
it just split between the positivity of 

535
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,300
your audience,
the diversity of your audience,

536
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,220
the,
the,

537
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:40,410
the,
the intellectual content of your message

538
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,590
and then you get with a snarky 
journalist with an agenda.

539
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,390
And I'm not mentioning names,
but

540
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,670
no,
no,

541
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,553
this,
this young woman from a Gq and it was 

542
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,180
just me on,
so it was just like lady.

543
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,910
Gotcha,
Gotcha,

544
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,540
Gotcha.
For we don't want to blame the BBC saint

545
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,470
and then I.
and she seemed,

546
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,050
you know,
like as often she seemed intelligent and

547
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:07,884
capable of insight up to a point,
but it's almost as if something had 

548
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:16,780
seized her mind and show you something,
had something new.

549
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,733
But I think people,
it can be a poly says that a whole 

550
00:28:21,931 --> 00:28:22,764
generation,
some of our most talented young women 

551
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,750
are incapable of thought because of 
this.

552
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,663
I thought maybe you can just an openness
to she couldn't and you were saying 

553
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,510
completely like interesting,
fascinating,

554
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:40,050
original things even to me who've 
studied these topics and.

555
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,473
Wow.

556
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,990
No,
it was quite the day.

557
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:46,240
So I went to Baltimore.
You survived it very well,

558
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:50,940
but it just made me think a lot that day
because I went there and I had to go out

559
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:53,190
of my way to do it.
Not that I'm complaining,

560
00:28:53,191 --> 00:28:55,710
but there's a reason for saying that,
you know,

561
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,660
so I got there in Baltimore.
Yeah.

562
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,260
Well I was talking in Baltimore,
so.

563
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:00,020
Okay.
So,

564
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,853
so,
um,

565
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,763
the aquarium and I showed up to the,
to the hotel room where this was all 

566
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:08,760
occurring and you know,
what you expect generally speaking,

567
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,560
even from journalists who aren't,
you know,

568
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,430
who are more of the attack dog variety 
or who may be,

569
00:29:14,431 --> 00:29:18,390
aren't positively predisposed to you 
ideologically or personally,

570
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,740
you expect a certain modicum of 
professional politeness.

571
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,890
Right.
Because while you don't have to be there

572
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,220
and you came and you and you accepted an
invitation and,

573
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,910
and all of that.

574
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,550
And so even with the channel for 
journalists,

575
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:35,620
Kathy Newman,
she was quite polite and,

576
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,530
and forthcoming in the,
in the green room before the interview,

577
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,364
you know,
so she would have had at least that 

578
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:44,020
professional persona,
which is,

579
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,420
it's not nothing right there.
There's something to be said for,

580
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,433
for going through the motions 
professionally in an inappropriate 

581
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:55,300
manner,
but when I walked into the hotel room in

582
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:58,810
Baltimore,
it was obvious that this interviewer had

583
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:03,040
already made up her mind about me 100 
percent and that she was absolutely,

584
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,283
you know,
negatively predisposed to me with a 

585
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:09,530
personal animus.
Animus is exactly the right word.

586
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,923
There was about a half an hour 
photography session because it was Gq 

587
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,770
and so I was in that atmosphere.
The photographers were fine.

588
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:18,604
I was in that atmosphere for about 45 
minutes before we started to talk and 

589
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,833
part of the reason that I'm so I'm not 
as calm during that interview is are 

590
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,913
usually I'm,
I'm a little bit harsher and the reason 

591
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:32,790
for that is that,
you know,

592
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,210
it just started off instantly combative 
and,

593
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,710
and what I,
what I should have done,

594
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,630
you see,
it's very,

595
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,780
very difficult to be awake enough to do 
these things properly and they interview

596
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,800
progressed fine.

597
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,633
Although by the end of it,
I thought that I had maybe done enough 

598
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:55,060
interviews for awhile because I didn't 
think I had regulated my temper as well.

599
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,280
During that interview as I might've,
I wish.

600
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,430
Well so bad.

601
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,593
So you were getting it and then she 
brought up a question about anger and I 

602
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:07,670
just saw you kind of adjust and then 
after that it was smooth sailing.

603
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,620
Well that's good because it was touch 
and go,

604
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,580
you know,
and I thought,

605
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,361
boy,
you know,

606
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:13,580
maybe you're running out of patients.
Maybe you know,

607
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,890
maybe it's time to dial back on the 
interviews because you know,

608
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,310
I've had many interviews like that and 
they're very.

609
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,720
I find them like it takes me like three 
days to recover from an interview.

610
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,090
You start thinking yourself like what I 
should've said,

611
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:27,770
I should've said that,
and I dragged myself mad.

612
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,330
No,
but you did very well.

613
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,164
But it's so interesting that what it 
told me was how parochial she was and 

614
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,540
she lives in her own little world,
isn't it?

615
00:31:38,541 --> 00:31:41,330
More a little bit about the ideology of 
our time and Gosh,

616
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:45,530
you encountered this everywhere and I 
used to write about this wisely.

617
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:46,580
I would.
I would encounter it.

618
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,893
I mean,
I think part of the issue is that you 

619
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,550
will acknowledge that there are 
differences between the sexes.

620
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,490
That seems to be,
I know that's a hell of a heresy.

621
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,300
Heresy because when I was reading your 
book,

622
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,493
um,
there's nothing about it that is anti 

623
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:09,990
female.
In fact,

624
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,853
you,
you do a lot of examination of the Adam 

625
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:13,544
and Eve story and you have this 
wonderful passage about like Adam being 

626
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,530
the originally agreed,
okay.

627
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,770
The man who throws the woman under the 
sea,

628
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,540
a return fault do you made her
really funny.

629
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,773
So,
so,

630
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,250
so there's nothing in you

631
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,260
this and the rules such as they are,
you know,

632
00:32:34,261 --> 00:32:37,920
they seem very common sensical.
They could apply to anyone.

633
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,370
Um,
so is that a fair

634
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,683
surmise of why you get so attacked a 
that just the very fact that you're 

635
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:47,114
willing to speak about the sexes as 
being not unequal but different but 

636
00:32:51,441 --> 00:32:52,610
equal?
Yeah.

637
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,710
Well,
you know what,

638
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,510
I would say that that's part of it 
because there's a threat there.

639
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,690
So one of the things that happened when 
I was in Scandinavia,

640
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,820
I just wrote a column about this 
actually,

641
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,520
um,
was interesting being in Scandinavia,

642
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:08,354
especially in Sweden because they've 
pushed the equality of opportunity 

643
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:14,790
doctrine farther than any other country 
in the world today.

644
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:19,930
It almost started there like in the UN 
and the original charter.

645
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,630
The Swedes were there and they,
they've never given us.

646
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:23,301
No,
no.

647
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,134
And so,
and the week that I was there was the 

648
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:31,850
same week that two articles were 
published on gender differences,

649
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,410
um,
in,

650
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,693
in temperament and an interest in the 
biggest sex differences that we know of 

651
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,860
that aren't morphological are in 
interest.

652
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,510
So women are more interested in people 
by and large and men are more interested

653
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:50,780
in things by and large.
And the difference is actually large.

654
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,800
It's one standard deviation.
And so that means if you're a man,

655
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,443
you would have to be more interested in 
people than 85 percent of men to be as 

656
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,920
interested as 50 percent of women.
And if you're a woman,

657
00:34:03,921 --> 00:34:08,480
you'd have to be more interested in 
things than 85 percent of women to be as

658
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,314
interested as the 50th percentile male.
So the difference is actually quite 

659
00:34:12,711 --> 00:34:13,544
substantial and it's certainly large 
enough to drive occupational choice 

660
00:34:17,421 --> 00:34:18,254
differences and it explains a lot of 
configuration of people in the 

661
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,050
workplace.
Absolutely.

662
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:24,561
Well,
and you know,

663
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:25,394
we're approach approaching parody in 
terms of workplace overall workplace 

664
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,194
distribution of women,
but there's massive differences in 

665
00:34:32,421 --> 00:34:34,580
occupational choice.
Like it's very interesting,

666
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:35,414
for example,
to go to the website of the US labor 

667
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,710
department and look at male and female 
dominated industries.

668
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,543
And you know,
there's the top 10 male dominated 

669
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:46,754
industries have basically zero women in 
the brick layers being one of the 

670
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,423
people.
There are people three zones according 

671
00:34:53,931 --> 00:34:57,250
to Camille Paglia that you find is a lot
of men in the people freeze up.

672
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,370
Yeah,
yeah,

673
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,660
yeah.
And the women are in.

674
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:00,494
You ask a group of women and men,
would you rather spend the next three 

675
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:07,760
weeks taking apart a machine and putting
it together or helping a group of people

676
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:11,750
work out their problems and the pool of 
people who want to do them,

677
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,120
she,
it's just far more men than women.

678
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,983
There's more men in women dominated 
industries than there are women and men 

679
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:21,620
dominated industries at the extreme.
So that's like nursing.

680
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,550
Nursing is way more male nurses,
brick layers.

681
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,860
I've studied these male nurses and they 
already,

682
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,103
you know,
gender activists are upset because they 

683
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:34,310
earn more than women.

684
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,833
And a professor of nursing at University
of Pennsylvania tried to find out why 

685
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,883
and she found out they immediately find 
out what's the best paying field 

686
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,233
subfield.
So they go into like nurse 

687
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,273
anesthesiology,
it pays a lot more than men are there 

688
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,390
and disproportionate number and they're 
willing to work in insane hours.

689
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,010
They're far more willing to move to a 
higher same thing.

690
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,883
Feral phone with,
with gender differences is that men are 

691
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:03,510
more willing to move million or more.
They're more willing to,

692
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,320
to,
uh,

693
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,153
work outside.
They're more willing to take on 

694
00:36:06,571 --> 00:36:07,404
dangerous tasks.
They're more likely to work in scalable 

695
00:36:09,571 --> 00:36:10,404
industries,
so we'd like you can't scale personal 

696
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:13,210
care.
It's really very.

697
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,400
It's very,
very difficult.

698
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:18,300
They're much less likely to work part 
time if they have small businesses,

699
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,134
they're much more likely to work full 
time in the small business rather than 

700
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:22,530
this than part time.

701
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,803
And I mean women have their reasons to 
want to work part time and feral also 

702
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:29,730
pointed out that if you work 10 percent 
longer hours,

703
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,564
you make 40 percent more money.
Your non linear nonlinear return on 

704
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:35,600
overtime had something that's really 
useful to know,

705
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:38,790
you know,
in terms of your career to an employer.

706
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,370
They have some also marks you out,
you know,

707
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:44,220
like if you have 10 employees and 
they're all doing a reasonable job,

708
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,860
let's say,
but one of them is working an extra half

709
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,830
an hour a day or 45 minutes a day and 
you can observe that everyday.

710
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,970
Then that gives them an edge with 
regards to potential promotion and so.

711
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,520
And the return on those edges is 
nonlinear.

712
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,833
And so anyways,
so I went to Scandinavia and it was the 

713
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,463
same week that two studies were released
showing what had already been 

714
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:10,251
established beyond a shadow of a doubt 
that the personality differences between

715
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,184
men and women and the differences in 
interest as well actually get bigger as 

716
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,680
your society gets richer and as it gets 
more egalitarian and,

717
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,760
and not just a little bit either.

718
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,950
That's the other thing that's so 
interesting is you might think,

719
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:23,784
well the effect is it's the opposite of 
what the social constructionists would 

720
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,380
predict.
First of all.

721
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:29,214
So that's the first thing to point out 
is it's not only that their hypothesis 

722
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:36,540
wasn't supported,
it was decidedly refuted and,

723
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:38,310
and none of them have come to terms with
that.

724
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,081
And,
and,

725
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:41,010
and it's not a small effect.
The,

726
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:41,844
the,
the difference between personality 

727
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,393
between men and women in Scandinavia is 
a lot larger than it is in non 

728
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:52,080
egalitarianism,
rural but true in the United States.

729
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:55,680
And the richer the democratic,
your household demographic,

730
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,633
your household,
the more likely the woman is to take 

731
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,490
time out and be at home with,
right?

732
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,110
Because you can afford to do it.
And she can afford to major in od,

733
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,840
you know,
low paying fields,

734
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,703
like a feminist dance therapy.
The other thing you see too is that one 

735
00:38:13,201 --> 00:38:15,510
of the things that's also interesting I 
think is that,

736
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,793
you know,
there's this idea that made that 

737
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,070
marriage is a patriarchal institution,
you know,

738
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:22,730
that's primarily put there for the,
for the utility of the,

739
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,840
of the mail and think,
well,

740
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,000
like I think that's complete bloody 
rubbish.

741
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,280
And I don't think there's any evidence 
to support it at all.

742
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:31,320
But I think the best counter evidence is
that,

743
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,663
well if that's the case,
then rich people shouldn't be getting 

744
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,230
married because they don't have to 
oppress themselves.

745
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:42,460
But the truth of the matter is is that 
the higher your demographic position,

746
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:43,294
the more likely you are to be married.
So marriage is falling apart among the 

747
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,960
more likely the wife is staying home and
not.

748
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,100
I mean she has all sorts of pursuits but

749
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,040
wasn't.
She's not.

750
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,940
Well,
there's an old saying,

751
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:54,774
anyone,
any woman who marries for money earns 

752
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,640
it.
But now let me just.

753
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:00,474
Okay.
This is where you might get in a little 

754
00:39:01,261 --> 00:39:05,970
trouble because in your book you call 
men order and women chaos,

755
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,833
and you say order.
The known appears symbolically 

756
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:10,104
associated with masculinity and chaos.
The Eternal Feminine is also the 

757
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,600
crushing force of sexual selection.
Yeah.

758
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:20,340
What's up with that chaotic chaos?
Men and women net

759
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,263
or order and chaos.
It's masculinity and femininity 

760
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:29,191
symbolically and so what's happened 
fundamentally is that we're.

761
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,280
Our brains are wired for social 
cognition,

762
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,990
so we're not natural.
Scientists were natural sociologists.

763
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:40,840
That might be a better,
even though I shutter to think that that

764
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,674
might be true,
especially given the sales associate as 

765
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,314
well.
That's it triggering or maybe or or 

766
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,144
maybe we're more,
we're more naturally a people who 

767
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:52,534
observed through the lens of fiction and
that what we see as the world as 

768
00:39:55,541 --> 00:40:00,541
characterized and w the world.
Obviously it's made out of men and women

769
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:05,440
and children and those seem to be our 
fundamental cognitive categories.

770
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:07,230
Masculinity,
femininity and,

771
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,133
and,
and,

772
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,103
and then the category of children and 
those categories have expanded to take 

773
00:40:14,141 --> 00:40:19,141
on connotations outside of,
of pure person perception.

774
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,670
And so,
you know,

775
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:22,504
it's for this reason that if you go to a
movie and that maybe it's a Disney 

776
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:26,164
animated movie,
and I like to talk about those because 

777
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,520
they draw on a very deep symbolic,
well,

778
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,650
it's perfectly reasonable to see a witch
that lives in the swamp because those go

779
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,540
together like it makes sense.

780
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,583
You know,
the which doesn't live in a gleaming 

781
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,790
chrome,
high rise,

782
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,640
you know,
she lives in the swamp.

783
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:43,474
Is that.
So maybe

784
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,270
you could just fly up.
Well that's it.

785
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,280
That's where the high rise would be 
better for.

786
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:51,100
The brain could take off,
you can take off better.

787
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,520
But there are categories of,
of symbolic association that are natural

788
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:57,424
to the way we think and the fundamental 
elements of those categories seem to be 

789
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,970
gendered.
And so this is partly why make reference

790
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:05,410
to Taoism,
for example.

791
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,380
So for the Daoists,
the world is made out of chaos and order

792
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,573
and chaos is the domain that you don't 
understand and that emerges 

793
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,030
unpredictably,
but also the domain from which new forms

794
00:41:16,031 --> 00:41:17,740
emerge,
right?

795
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,560
Because it's from novelty that the new 
way emerges.

796
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,663
And I think the fundamental association 
between femininity is chaos is the 

797
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:26,164
association between what's unexpected 
and novel and what's new because new 

798
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:33,320
forms emerge from chaos and it's not.

799
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,910
The chaos is,
is bad in order to good that that's both

800
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,860
have their pathologies.
Yes.

801
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,940
And,
and,

802
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,020
and what you're looking for,
and this is,

803
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,820
this is the book concentrates on above 
all,

804
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:50,060
is that you're looking constantly to 
find the balance between those two.

805
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,910
So for example,
formerly speaking,

806
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,420
the domain of order is that place that 
you are,

807
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:59,300
when what you're doing is producing the 
results that you want,

808
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,640
who have produced.
So imagine,

809
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,533
imagine,
think about the preconditions for not 

810
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:06,620
being anxious.
Okay?

811
00:42:06,621 --> 00:42:07,454
So the preconditions are that you're 
constantly making predictions about 

812
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:10,364
what's going to happen next.
And those predictions are tied tightly 

813
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,013
to your behavioral output.
So you act in a certain way and you 

814
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:19,370
presume that a certain thing is going to
happen.

815
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,780
And if your actions produce the results 
that you desire,

816
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,733
then you assume that you know where you 
are and you know what you're doing and 

817
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:29,690
that your plan is intact and that the 
environment is secure.

818
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,760
And that keeps her anxiety under 
control,

819
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,910
that order,
and then you know,

820
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:35,744
maybe you're at a party and you don't 
know anybody and you tell a joke and 

821
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,044
everybody looks at you like what you 
said was not only not funny but also 

822
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:43,784
downright offensive and then all of a 
sudden you've moved from the domain of 

823
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:47,954
order into the domain of chaos because 
you thought you were somewhere and you 

824
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:51,674
thought you were someone and you thought
you were with people that were of a 

825
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:55,784
certain type and you got all that wrong.
And so it causes suggesting it is going 

826
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:02,660
to be the woman who says,
I find that really offended.

827
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,750
I'm not suggesting that,
but it probably is nevermind.

828
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,390
But women are also more sensitive to 
negative emotion.

829
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,343
Right?
So there is some slightly higher 

830
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:14,474
probability that that might be the case.
But then I think women are also 

831
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,194
associated,
at least in men's imaginations with 

832
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:20,804
nature,
which is part of the chaotic domain say 

833
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,570
as opposed to culture because they're 
sexually selective.

834
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,810
So you gotta think what?
What is nature?

835
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,840
When we have that as a cognitive 
category,

836
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:34,310
right?
We think of the natural world,

837
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,130
we think of nature versus culture.
It's a fundamental opposition.

838
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,260
What is nature?
Well,

839
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,450
nature is trees and landscapes and 
animals and all of that up,

840
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:45,290
but that isn't what nature fundamentally
is.

841
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,590
Nature fundamentally is that which 
selects from a genetic perspective,

842
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,093
that's nature.
That's the fundamental definition of 

843
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:54,554
nature,
and it is the case that human females 

844
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:58,004
are sexually selective and it's.
It's a major component of human 

845
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:03,050
behavior,
so the.

846
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:03,943
The evolutionary theory,
roughly speaking is that the reason we 

847
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,200
diverged from chimpanzees 8 million 
years ago,

848
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:13,034
7 million years ago,
is at least in part because of the 

849
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:17,654
differences between sexual selectively 
between female humans and female 

850
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:22,994
chimpanzees.
Female chimpanzees are more likely to 

851
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,204
have offspring from dominant males,
but it's not because of their sexual 

852
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,860
selectivities.

853
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,370
So female chimpanzee has periods of 
fertility that are marked by physical,

854
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:40,350
by observable physiological changes,
not the case with human females.

855
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,483
Human female ovulation is is concealed,
so that's a very profound biological 

856
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:49,920
difference between human females and 
chimpanzees and the chimpanzee.

857
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:50,754
Females will meet with any male,
but the dominant males chased the 

858
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:57,660
subordinate males away,
but human females are sexually selective

859
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,523
and so and and it's not trivial facts.
So you have twice as many female 

860
00:45:02,461 --> 00:45:05,820
ancestors as male ancestors.
You think,

861
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,810
well,
how can that be?

862
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,880
Well,
imagine that on average,

863
00:45:08,881 --> 00:45:09,714
every single human female has had one 
child throughout the entire course of 

864
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:13,914
history,
which is approximately correct by the 

865
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:16,404
way.
Then imagine that half of the men had 

866
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:22,040
zero and the other half had to.
Okay,

867
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,760
and that's roughly the case.
So half of males historically speaking,

868
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:27,594
have been reproductive disasters and the
reason for that is because of female 

869
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,650
sexual collectivity.

870
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,610
So it is actually the case that female 
humans are nature.

871
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:36,503
It's not only that they're,
that they're associated with nature 

872
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,640
symbolically as far as production is 
concerned.

873
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:46,440
They are the force of nature that does 
the selection and so their nature in the

874
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:49,920
most fundamental way and there is a 
chaotic element of that,

875
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:53,220
at least in relationship to men and also
in relationship to women.

876
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:58,221
Because a lot of the female on female 
competition is competition.

877
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,550
That's chaotic for the right to be 
sexually selective,

878
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:03,743
right,
not only with regards to men which 

879
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:06,294
drives a lot of politics,
but also in relationship to each other 

880
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,594
because part of what human females do 
his jockey for position in the female 

881
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:16,350
dominance hierarchy for the top 
position,

882
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:17,184
which is the woman who gets to be most 
sexually selective and so that drives 

883
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:23,640
female female competition and it's a 
different dynamic.

884
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,683
There's similarities between female 
female competition and male male 

885
00:46:27,571 --> 00:46:28,404
competition,
but there are also differences and 

886
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:31,980
they're pronounced.
So men for example,

887
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,690
while men are more likely to compete,
compete for socioeconomic status,

888
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:39,060
and that's partly because that drives 
female mate choice.

889
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:40,343
So the correlation for men between 
socioeconomic status and sexual success 

890
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:48,090
is about point six.
And for women it's zero zero.

891
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,770
In fact,
it's actually slightly negative.

892
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,620
So when that's a huge difference between
men and women,

893
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,530
the anthropologists,
Sarah Hrdy,

894
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:56,750
h r,
d,

895
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,370
y,
and,

896
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,790
and she's like my favorite feminist 
theorist,

897
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,300
although is she would say I'm a theorist
who happens to be a feminist,

898
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:08,130
but she studied primate behavior and she
watched.

899
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,440
She lifted the women very the the 
females.

900
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:11,274
And we very carefully and looked at it,
a chimpanzees and gazelles and found 

901
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:18,280
that,
um,

902
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,400
the female initially like male 
primatologists would look and say,

903
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:26,220
oh,
the females,

904
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,100
the males are dominant in the females 
are so cooperative.

905
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,070
She looked more carefully and so the 
females weren't exactly cooperative,

906
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:35,830
like they would pass around their 
infants,

907
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,120
their baby,
you know,

908
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,150
whatever they were and would find it.
And so the male primatologist who say,

909
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:43,353
oh,
they are,

910
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,900
they're so kind and caring.
She found out that when it was not your,

911
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,730
it was not hers.
They would take a little tufts of hair,

912
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,713
it would come out or they do something 
to the eyes and the baby would be 

913
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,420
injured and she saw all this violence.

914
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,760
But it was true in the status 
differentiation.

915
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:01,913
So it's much more likely that it'll 
happen when a higher status female is 

916
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:05,590
taken care of.
Lower status infant.

917
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,160
Exactly.
And she said the great tragedy,

918
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,980
but it will not tragedy.
She had the reality of our species.

919
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,673
And in fact,
the subtitle for the book is that the 

920
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,233
woman who never evolved,
we didn't evolve for niceness and 

921
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:19,944
cooperative.
There's an immense competition and we 

922
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,200
can,
according to her,

923
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:26,243
we are,
it's indelibly marked in our nature to 

924
00:48:29,671 --> 00:48:34,671
compete for the dominant males and no 
doubt about that and so,

925
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:37,760
and that seems to cross culturally as 
well.

926
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,560
That doesn't fly in a little bit in the 
morning.

927
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:42,620
Gilda tarian societies.
So instead of being exaggerated,

928
00:48:42,621 --> 00:48:44,090
it does flattened to some degree,
right?

929
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:44,924
So you could imagine that there's a 
biological component and the cultural 

930
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:50,930
component both in in,
in that case,

931
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,940
if you modify the cultural component and
that seems to decrease the overall.

932
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:59,300
So like,
let me be more clear about this.

933
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,900
Women are less prone to mate up across 
an upstate is hierarchies in Scandinavia

934
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:07,940
than they are in less egalitarian 
countries,

935
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:10,820
but there are still prone to do it.
So worldwide.

936
00:49:10,821 --> 00:49:12,290
For example,
women,

937
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:15,140
young women find men who are about four 
years older than them,

938
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,810
maximally attractive and they tend to 
mate across an upstairs hierarchies.

939
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,040
And so one of the consequences of that,
for example,

940
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:25,640
is that as women have entered the 
workforce,

941
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,623
they've actually driven in equality 
because rich women will only marry rich 

942
00:49:31,431 --> 00:49:32,960
men.
Men is riches,

943
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:33,794
them or Richard.
Whereas rich man will marry women who 

944
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:38,180
are poor than them,
but women won't,

945
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,313
and so what that means is it's another 
factor that's pooling wealth in the 

946
00:49:42,321 --> 00:49:43,670
hands of fewer and fewer people

947
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:45,263
assortative mating now,
and you just find someone with your 

948
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,113
background.
You'd whereas a doctor might have once 

949
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,470
married his secretary now marries 
another doctor.

950
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,323
Yep.

951
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,850
Can I ask then stepping a little bit 
back from primates as well,

952
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,860
how does this selection work in the era 
of swiping right and left?

953
00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:04,163
How?
What is your reaction to the way young 

954
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,200
people date today?
Oh,

955
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,530
that's a good.
I was really hoping we'd get into that.

956
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,980
I was really into the monkey,
so I didn't want to interrupt.

957
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,823
You know what?
I should close off the Scandinavian 

958
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,393
discussion just by pointing out,
and this is something that the 

959
00:50:20,161 --> 00:50:22,050
scandinavians are already going to have 
to wrestle with,

960
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,913
is that if you institute effective 
policies to promote equality 

961
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,200
opportunity,
which the Scandinavians have done,

962
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:31,963
you're going to produce some equality,
so like a 50 slash 50 distribution of 

963
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:35,504
men and women in the workplace,
but you're also going to exacerbate 

964
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:41,810
certain kinds of inequality and you 
can't get out of that.

965
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:42,703
So you cannot have equality of 
opportunity and equality of outcome 

966
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,430
together.

967
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,380
They don't work together and equality of
outcome.

968
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,453
Essentially quality of outcome doctrine 
which is often described with the code 

969
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:53,654
word equity,
is that at every level of every 

970
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:59,840
occupation,
the people have to be represented by the

971
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:02,600
same number that they're represented in 
the population.

972
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:07,510
So if it's not 50 slash 50 men and women
at each in each occupation I need and in

973
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,290
each strata at each occupation,
then that sort of prime fsc evidence for

974
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,080
discrimination and for systemic 
discrimination.

975
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,310
It's like,
nope,

976
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,203
sorry.
You have to factor in choice and choice 

977
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:21,320
actually turns out to be a very 
important determinant.

978
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,810
And as the society gets flatter and 
flatter,

979
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,170
choice becomes a more important and more
and more important determinant.

980
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:28,303
And so you.
So what that essentially means is that 

981
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:31,574
the most radical end of the left wing 
political agenda is logically 

982
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,320
impossible.
Apart from the fact that it's impossible

983
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:40,460
for a variety of other reasons.

984
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:42,540
And they should look at the data.
I mean it,

985
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:48,220
it's just a cliche now have in,
in a group of activists and they'll say,

986
00:51:49,331 --> 00:51:50,560
oh,
well we need to,

987
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,400
in order for women to achieve equality,
we need government funded daycare and we

988
00:51:56,411 --> 00:51:58,330
need.
They have it in Sweden.

989
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:02,320
Sweden has fewer women in managerial 
levels.

990
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:06,210
The American women are ahead.
In fact now they have a,

991
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,053
they have quotas over there,
so they need more female ceos and 

992
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:10,603
females on boards made any difference 
between bringing in memory American 

993
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:15,400
women because we're so much further 
ahead.

994
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,610
So it's called the no difference in the 
distribution of men and women.

995
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:22,360
Lower in the.
It's called the Nordic paradox and say,

996
00:52:22,361 --> 00:52:24,040
you guys are so wonky.
I want to get back.

997
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,023
Okay.
Yes.

998
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,900
We all want to get back to get back to 
these monkeys.

999
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:30,640
Well,
I was thinking just

1000
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,473
thinking this morning about.
I was talking to a variety of political 

1001
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:38,250
types and we were talking about this 
morning in DC.

1002
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,820
It hard to believe,
hard to believe.

1003
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,420
No,
I'm not.

1004
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,690
I'm not telling you a bunch of 
Republicans here and I'd been talking to

1005
00:52:43,691 --> 00:52:44,524
Democrats as well,
but it was mostly Republicans here and 

1006
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:47,614
we were talking about abortion and I 
made a case that that's really not a 

1007
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:54,244
very productive discussion because 
you're talking about a problem way too 

1008
00:52:59,321 --> 00:53:00,154
late in the sequence of problems.
So by the time the discussion starts to 

1009
00:53:05,621 --> 00:53:06,454
be about abortion,
there's 50 problems that have already 

1010
00:53:08,531 --> 00:53:11,830
emerged that no one has addressed and 
some of those problems are.

1011
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,693
The fundamental problem is how human 
being should regulate their sexual 

1012
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,800
behavior and that's a big problem.
And you think,

1013
00:53:17,801 --> 00:53:22,300
well there's an interesting thing that's
happening because you know the people on

1014
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:24,370
the right would say,
well that's easy.

1015
00:53:24,371 --> 00:53:25,204
It's like don't sleep around and get 
married and have sex with your marital 

1016
00:53:28,651 --> 00:53:32,670
partner and that'll solve the problem.
So there's strictures on sexual behavior

1017
00:53:32,671 --> 00:53:33,504
and those would be the traditional ones 
and what you see on the left is that 

1018
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:41,040
there's this weird paradoxical demand,
let's say

1019
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,823
that people should be allowed to express
their sexuality in any manner that they 

1020
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:48,630
choose whenever they want,

1021
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,593
but that sex is so dangerous that it has
to be carefully regulated at every 

1022
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:56,724
single stage of the interaction.
And so you know that many state 

1023
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,194
legislatures have now followed the 
example of university campuses and put 

1024
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,123
in affirmative consent legislation so 
that every move you make towards 

1025
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:15,170
physical intimacy has to be preceded by 
the instantiation of a verbal contract.

1026
00:54:16,141 --> 00:54:17,070
Essentially.
It's like,

1027
00:54:17,071 --> 00:54:18,510
what?
Can I take your hand?

1028
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,840
Yes.
You actually,

1029
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,670
from what I understand,
you actually have to say yes,

1030
00:54:23,671 --> 00:54:28,671
like nodding is not sufficient.
And so and so each stage has to be,

1031
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,400
has to be proceeded by affirmative 
consent and

1032
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:34,890
you know,
which,

1033
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:35,783
which.

1034
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,950
Well,
I won't,

1035
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,300
I won't say anything about.
Yeah,

1036
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:39,440
I will.
It's desert.

1037
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,453
It's absurd to assume that that's how 
human intimate relationships are 

1038
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,523
supposed to proceed.
And then you have complicated laws 

1039
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,340
emerging that are part of that that,
for example,

1040
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:54,770
this is the case in California as I 
understand it,

1041
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:58,100
is that you cannot give affirmative 
consent if you're intoxicated.

1042
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,220
Okay.
So you think about that.

1043
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:01,490
It's like what?
What does that mean?

1044
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,383
It means that like a lot of sex is.
This unit has been illegal for a long 

1045
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:09,620
time.
Including marital.

1046
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,570
Marital?
Yes.

1047
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,650
Next to me on my honeymoon.
Okay.

1048
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,140
Well that is Marie thinking.
It seems.

1049
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,650
It seems to me,
it seems to mean.

1050
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,180
No,
I'm.

1051
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,070
It seems to me,
to me the California legislation that if

1052
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:30,071
you have sex with your wife or husband 
and either of you is intoxicated,

1053
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,370
then you're either one of you or both is
guilty of rape.

1054
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,740
That's what it looks like to me.
Actually.

1055
00:55:36,741 --> 00:55:39,680
I was in a debate a few years ago at the
University of Virginia Law School

1056
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:44,090
and I turned to my debate partner and 
said,

1057
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,730
so if what you're saying is right,
um,

1058
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,260
two people can rate one another,
right?

1059
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:53,620
She said yes.
And I thought,

1060
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,590
Oh shit.

1061
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,670
I mean,
how can that be?

1062
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,170
Well,
that's the question.

1063
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,860
Well,
okay,

1064
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:01,693
so then I would say,
well it's interesting because I think 

1065
00:56:04,371 --> 00:56:05,204
that a lot of this confusion has emerged
fundamentally as a consequence of the 

1066
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:10,360
birth control pill,
so you know,

1067
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,203
because you gotta think situationally 
before you think ideologically or 

1068
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:14,600
psychologically,
it's like,

1069
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:16,843
it seems to me that the 20th century 
will be remembered for the hydrogen 

1070
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:23,800
bomb,
the transistor and the birth control and

1071
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:24,634
those are unbelievably radical 
technological innovations and maybe the 

1072
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,540
most common.
Yeah,

1073
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:34,550
but on my fair lady,
just dependent on the transistor

1074
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,143
so that,
that's the big technological innovation 

1075
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:39,634
that spawned all that.
And of the three I would say that the 

1076
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,830
birth control pill is probably the 
bigger hydrogen bomb.

1077
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,413
So because it,
it changed the fundamental biological 

1078
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,284
nature of women and men and because it 
gave women for the first time in 

1079
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,063
biological history the,
the option of choosing their 

1080
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,980
reproductive status.
And that's,

1081
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,450
that's,
that's abs.

1082
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:06,850
Well,
yes and no.

1083
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,713
Like,
yes,

1084
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,583
we like it,
but it's not something that's come 

1085
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:11,740
without a tremendous.

1086
00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:16,750
Well it's come with
a fellow.

1087
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:17,880
Can you,
have you been reading align with?

1088
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,060
No,
no I haven't.

1089
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,570
You'll find them interesting because 
he's.

1090
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:21,463
He writes about that I'm not,
I'm not making a case for the abolition 

1091
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:26,890
of the birth control pill by any stretch
of the imagination,

1092
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:30,910
but I'm pointing at its complexity and 
so because one of the questions is,

1093
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,373
well,
once you can regulate your reproductive 

1094
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:34,174
function,
what attitude should you have toward 

1095
00:57:36,581 --> 00:57:37,414
sex?
And one answer might be the more of it 

1096
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,920
under the more varied circumstances,
the better because why not?

1097
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:46,203
And I would say that was actually part 
of the attitude that emerged in the 

1098
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:52,090
aftermath of the birth control pill in 
the 19 sixties.

1099
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,080
Right.
And it was,

1100
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:54,423
it was a reasonable response in some 
sense because it's such a cataclysmic 

1101
00:57:57,761 --> 00:57:59,680
change that you don't know what it 
implies.

1102
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,530
Well,
what's the consequence of that?

1103
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:04,360
Well,
first of all,

1104
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,253
people aren't reliable enough to use 
birth control in an entirely reliable 

1105
00:58:08,771 --> 00:58:09,604
manner.
So even though it can work at near 100 

1106
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,904
percent efficiency,
you have to take it extraordinarily 

1107
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:17,050
regularly and in a discipline manner for
that to work.

1108
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,153
And so
there was still the problem of unwanted 

1109
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:22,630
pregnancy,
let's say.

1110
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,793
And then there was the problem of the 
proliferation of sexual epidemics and 

1111
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,774
that culminated in aids,
which could have easily wiped all of us 

1112
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,434
out but didn't.
But there was other sexual epidemics 

1113
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,660
that could have had the same effect.
But we've,

1114
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,990
we've been fortunate enough to escape 
them.

1115
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,060
And then,
and then more recently there's been this

1116
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,380
weird inversion,
especially on the radical left

1117
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:53,180
that points to the reemergence of 
something like a set of sexual taboos,

1118
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:57,380
you know,
like I think the idea that sex is casual

1119
00:58:57,381 --> 00:58:58,214
and that it's a form of entertainment is
I think it's an absolutely preposterous 

1120
00:59:02,661 --> 00:59:04,100
idea.
I think that

1121
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,543
it's,
it's psychologically shallow beyond 

1122
00:59:08,441 --> 00:59:13,441
belief to hold that as a core 
proposition because it forces you to,

1123
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:16,203
first of all,
if,

1124
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,083
if,
if it's repetitive sex with multiple 

1125
00:59:18,521 --> 00:59:19,354
partners at it,
it forces you to treat people as if 

1126
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:22,874
they're interchangeable.
And I don't see how that's good for you 

1127
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:29,000
psychologically or for the people that 
you're using interchangeably.

1128
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,043
It,
it implies that you can divorce 

1129
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:39,041
sexuality from play,
from the desire for a relationship,

1130
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:42,230
from emotional fragility,
from love,

1131
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,350
from family,
from responsibility,

1132
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,243
all of those things that are part and 
parcel of every one and I don't think 

1133
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:49,304
you can and I don't think people's 
experience indicates that you can and 

1134
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:58,220
especially on the emotional front.
And I think that's partly what's driving

1135
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,323
and there's also a residual sense that 
there's something about sex that's 

1136
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:06,200
fundamentally dangerous and maybe it's 
dangerous emotionally and personally and

1137
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:08,720
maybe it's dangerous socially and 
psychologically,

1138
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,480
which most certainly is because it's a 
powerful force.

1139
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,840
And the way the left is reacting to that
is by insisting that all forms of sexual

1140
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:19,630
behavior are valid and,
and,

1141
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,010
and that it's reasonable to manifest all
of them,

1142
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:23,203
but that it's simultaneously so 
dangerous that absolutely every aspect 

1143
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:30,020
of it has to be state regulated and in 
an increasingly draconian form.

1144
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,213
And so I think what needs to happen is 
that the left and the right have to get 

1145
01:00:34,611 --> 01:00:35,444
together and have like a real discussion
about what constitutes valid sexual 

1146
01:00:38,841 --> 01:00:39,674
morality.
And that's the conversation you have to 

1147
01:00:41,511 --> 01:00:42,344
have.
Way before you worry about solving like 

1148
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:47,660
the abortion debate,
which is very divisive and very and very

1149
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:48,290
intractable.

1150
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:49,123
Well,
one of the things we talked about 

1151
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:50,893
actually just last week on the podcast 
is this cover story in the Atlantic 

1152
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:54,314
about the sexual recession amongst young
people that despite the advent of the 

1153
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:01,250
birth control pill,
abortion is going down.

1154
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:02,970
Um,
uh,

1155
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:03,920
it's,
that there's a,

1156
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:06,720
there's lexus,
there's less thing is going down,

1157
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:07,983
fewer things.
And what have you looked into that you 

1158
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,423
worry about that?

1159
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,990
Well,
if you raise the cost of something,

1160
01:01:13,991 --> 01:01:15,990
you decrease its prevalence.
You know?

1161
01:01:15,991 --> 01:01:17,340
And,
and I think that it's,

1162
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,590
it seems to be,
you know,

1163
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:20,623
your wrists now to look up.
I kinda think that it's also a 

1164
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:25,264
reflection of the same thing that 
Bloomberg reported on just a few days 

1165
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,310
ago.
They said that across businesses,

1166
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,503
men are thinking,
I'm not spending any time with a single 

1167
01:01:33,581 --> 01:01:34,920
woman that isn't,
you know,

1168
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,180
associated with me in some formal 
manner.

1169
01:01:37,181 --> 01:01:38,830
Like my wife.
I'm not going to do it.

1170
01:01:38,831 --> 01:01:41,220
I'm not going to mentor young women.
I'm not going to be in a room alone

1171
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,313
because I could face career annihilation
and instantly they're frightened of 

1172
01:01:45,771 --> 01:01:46,604
young women.
Now,

1173
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:50,090
Kate Julian said that's part of it,
but we can overexaggerate the part.

1174
01:01:50,091 --> 01:01:50,924
I mean,
anxiety and depression is going up 

1175
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:57,050
amongst both young men and young women.
A suicide is going up,

1176
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,221
um,
that,

1177
01:01:58,221 --> 01:01:58,970
that there's,
it's,

1178
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:02,180
it's not just a,
you know,

1179
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:06,500
most people I think are not.
We're talking about an elite demographic

1180
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:07,334
who is into the consent and political 
correctness and workplace [inaudible] 

1181
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,920
this is across the board and it's 
global.

1182
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,000
Um,
it's,

1183
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,833
it's happening even in Sweden.
It's really happening in Japan and 

1184
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:19,470
Japan.
Exactly.

1185
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,353
So

1186
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,220
that speaks to,
and especially in Japan,

1187
01:02:23,221 --> 01:02:24,054
they just have people,
especially young men have given up on 

1188
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,390
intimacy and that having sex is 
actually,

1189
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,300
I mean,
that had too much trouble.

1190
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,690
Sex robots.
Right?

1191
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:34,500
Well,
right,

1192
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,041
right,
right.

1193
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:35,930
Well,
my last question.

1194
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:37,140
Well,
and there's pornography.

1195
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:42,260
There's basically zero risk when you 
allow for pornography that,

1196
01:02:42,261 --> 01:02:43,094
that,
that the men and women will sort of 

1197
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:46,220
separate that from their actual.

1198
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,310
Exactly.
Maybe we were seeing a whole,

1199
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:51,310
I guess,
collapse of intimacy,

1200
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:53,620
let alone sex and,
and,

1201
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:54,191
and,
and,

1202
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:57,640
and I don't think that's just explained 
by the political nature.

1203
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,510
Um,
so I'd be interested in your thoughts.

1204
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:02,361
Yeah.
Well,

1205
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,194
I don't know that I don't know the 
literature on the decline in sexual 

1206
01:03:06,021 --> 01:03:08,690
activity well enough to know if it's 
valid or reliable,

1207
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:11,600
but I mean,
I think that,

1208
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:12,733
you know,
in a stable society you take lots of 

1209
01:03:14,241 --> 01:03:15,710
things for granted.
You take,

1210
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,633
you take the fact that men and women are
going to be sexually attracted to one 

1211
01:03:19,401 --> 01:03:23,360
another for granted and even though it's
more fragile than it appears,

1212
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,300
you know,
and it's suppressed more easily than you

1213
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:27,720
might think.
Um,

1214
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,083
and you take the idea that men and women
are going to move together towards the 

1215
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,480
establishment of longterm intimate 
relationships for granted.

1216
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,733
But that's partly because you don't 
understand what invisible preconditions 

1217
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:44,390
exists to make that self evident,
you know?

1218
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:45,643
And when those invisible preconditions 
are disrupted by rapid technological or 

1219
01:03:49,461 --> 01:03:50,294
sociological change,
then things shift underneath you when 

1220
01:03:52,071 --> 01:03:52,970
you don't know why.

1221
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:56,670
A lot of it is traced to the advent of 
the smartphone,

1222
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,350
especially in the generation z that,
that kate was explaining this to us that

1223
01:04:01,351 --> 01:04:02,184
you could see it was broadband internet 
and the smartphone that led to this 

1224
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,740
increasing fall off of relationship.

1225
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:11,903
Well,
maybe the abstract is more interesting 

1226
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:13,850
than right proximal.

1227
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,170
See that?
I just want to.

1228
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,143
I want to know the truth.
Have you ever been with somebody you 

1229
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:20,390
loved?
If I'm fascinated in all that,

1230
01:04:20,391 --> 01:04:22,700
but you really wanted to get back to 
your smartphone.

1231
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,563
Has that ever happened?

1232
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,600
Yeah.
Well,

1233
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,470
it happens all the time.

1234
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,540
Happens to me.
Happens during our podcast.

1235
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,230
Tell you to put your phone.
I'm,

1236
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,590
I'm researching.
Very addictive,

1237
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:39,110
very addictive.
You know,

1238
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,360
I read the other day that
like they are kind of going together.

1239
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,193
The preferred method

1240
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,073
method of interpersonal communication 
between young people now is testing 

1241
01:04:49,871 --> 01:04:51,520
rather than face to face communication.

1242
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,400
Right.
And the swiping that apes.

1243
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:54,543
Well that's,
that's,

1244
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,860
that's,
that's a very interesting topic to the,

1245
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,510
the like the tinder phenomenon.
That's right.

1246
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,513
Because that that's also a major 
technological revolution because what 

1247
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:08,890
it's done,
I would say for the first time is reduce

1248
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,023
the cost of rejection,
two males to zero because it hides it 

1249
01:05:15,850 --> 01:05:18,220
you the only people you ever hear from 
people who haven't rejected

1250
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:18,821
you,
although,

1251
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:20,020
although they.
True.

1252
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:20,854
But,
but there was one man who had to make 

1253
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,060
300.
He key actually tallied it.

1254
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:29,080
You had to make 300 requests,
a swiping right or whatever.

1255
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,080
So I think he had the sense of,
sure,

1256
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:32,711
sure,
sure.

1257
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:37,150
But it's massively attenuated because 
you're not being humiliated.

1258
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:38,380
Not at all.
Not at all.

1259
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:39,214
It's really,
it's really at arm's length and you 

1260
01:05:40,731 --> 01:05:41,680
know,
you can swipe very,

1261
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:42,514
very rapidly and so you can get all that
rejection over within a very short 

1262
01:05:45,101 --> 01:05:45,934
period of time.
It's like losing a video gamers or will 

1263
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:50,040
last because it's not.
I mean,

1264
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:51,100
not nearly as bad.

1265
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,370
Yeah.
So,

1266
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,260
and I don't know what tinder also 
reduces the.

1267
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:58,633
One of the other things that things that
you want to think about with regards to 

1268
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:01,454
sex,
and I think this is probably 

1269
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:02,954
particularly true for women,
is that to what degree is it in women's 

1270
01:06:05,811 --> 01:06:09,380
interests to allow the cost of sex to 
fall to zero,

1271
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,360
because with pornography certainly does 
that and it just seems to me that that's

1272
01:06:14,361 --> 01:06:15,194
not a very good longterm strategy for 
relationships between men and women 

1273
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,093
because whatever sex is worth,
the cost of zero is the wrong price and 

1274
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:24,380
so that's,
you know.

1275
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,473
All right.
You heard it from Bunny ranch and pay 

1276
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:27,650
quite a bit for it.
Well true,

1277
01:06:27,830 --> 01:06:29,300
true.
That's true.

1278
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:30,134
But

1279
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,403
do you know,
I've heard from a number of women what 

1280
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:35,034
written read blog reports on their 
frustration with their attempts to be 

1281
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:40,913
relatively sexually selective.
Like let's say they decide that they're 

1282
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:48,270
not going to sleep with their new 
partner on the first date.

1283
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:49,733
You know,
they're frustrated by the fact that to 

1284
01:06:51,961 --> 01:06:55,860
the degree that they're being cautious 
in their sexual behavior,

1285
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,903
which I think is actually an admirable 
idea that they're instantly out 

1286
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:01,794
competed.
Especially if their partners are 

1287
01:07:03,391 --> 01:07:08,310
somewhat impulsive by women who will say
yes at the drop of a hat and so,

1288
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,840
well,
again,

1289
01:07:09,841 --> 01:07:12,510
I don't think you know,
it depends on what the goal is.

1290
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,990
That's the thing is that there's the 
short terms there,

1291
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:16,833
short term sexual gratification,
but the literature indicates that 

1292
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:22,770
married couples for example,
or couples in a permanent long term,

1293
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:23,604
monogamous relationship are more 
sexually satisfied than single people 

1294
01:07:26,430 --> 01:07:27,263
and maybe the single people have to be 
parsed out into those who are sexually 

1295
01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:31,163
successful and those who aren't,
but I suspect that wouldn't make that 

1296
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:36,270
much difference,
but whatever.

1297
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:37,923
There's the utility of relatively 
immediate sexual gratification for 

1298
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:42,264
whatever that's worth and the 
adventurousness that goes along with 

1299
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:47,010
that.
Let's say the hunt and the excitement of

1300
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:47,844
having a new partner and all of that and
maybe even the danger that's associated 

1301
01:07:50,611 --> 01:07:53,700
with that because people like to have a 
little bit of danger in their life.

1302
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,240
But what's the goal?
It's like what do people want?

1303
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:58,074
And I mean there.
There's a great book called a billion 

1304
01:08:00,001 --> 01:08:00,834
wicked thoughts that was written by 
Google engineers and so it contains 

1305
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:04,374
great psychology because Google 
engineers don't care about political 

1306
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:08,890
correctness and they just write down 
what they find.

1307
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:11,250
They don't even notice that it's 
politically incorrect.

1308
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:12,263
Hence James Demore for example,
and what they found was that women use 

1309
01:08:16,731 --> 01:08:17,564
pornography just as much as men,
but the pornography that women use is 

1310
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,090
verbal.
It's not in logistic.

1311
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,540
And the pornographic novels essentially 
follow the same extraordinarily standard

1312
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:33,020
plot line to the degree that publishing 
houses like Harlequin,

1313
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:35,840
which was going to say it's the,
it's the bodice rippers the veteran.

1314
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,210
Right?
So in the Harlequin series,

1315
01:08:38,211 --> 01:08:41,600
you have the ones that were published 
like in the 19 seventies that are pretty

1316
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,740
tame.
There's a small bit,

1317
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,040
they're pretty hot actually.
Well,

1318
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,930
there's a variety.
They range from.

1319
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:51,560
They range from red team to essentially 
to hardcore pornography,

1320
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:52,394
but the,
but the plots are quite similar in the 

1321
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,010
plot is,
um,

1322
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:56,781
you know,
young,

1323
01:08:56,781 --> 01:08:59,870
relatively innocent woman finds 
powerful,

1324
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:00,704
interesting,
dangerous male tames him and then they 

1325
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:06,980
live happily ever after.
And it's the beauty and the beast plot,

1326
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,990
which is a fundamental,
which is to search for women on pornhub.

1327
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:13,730
We discovered we did an episode on porn 
was for women.

1328
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:14,370
It was getting

1329
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:15,203
rape.
Wasn't that like there's no lesbianism 

1330
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,980
or at least that was your port.
Yeah,

1331
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,510
that was me.
Oh,

1332
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,353
okay.
I don't like porn is going to the 

1333
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:26,610
William Sonoma store.
I know it is.

1334
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:28,210
It is female.
All those

1335
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:32,940
losses
or Bill Maher,

1336
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:37,800
one said that men and women should never
tell one another their fantasies because

1337
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:42,660
when are outraged by what we say and 
we're totally bored by what they say.

1338
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,740
And I thought like women have kind of 
these scenarios and you know,

1339
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,650
I don't know Unicorns,
I don't know what they're doing.

1340
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:50,160
Storylines,
storylines,

1341
01:09:50,161 --> 01:09:53,850
and it's just like A.
I don't want to say this to you,

1342
01:09:53,851 --> 01:09:57,660
but it is a lot of just close ups of 
female body parts.

1343
01:09:57,920 --> 01:09:59,730
Yeah.
Well men are much more visually oriented

1344
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,920
sexually,
but now they're being shamed.

1345
01:10:01,921 --> 01:10:04,080
I mean now that it's called the male 
gaze,

1346
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:05,780
and so there's all of this sick.

1347
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,600
Oh my God,
the sports illustrated is exploiting the

1348
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:11,060
female figure.
Yeah,

1349
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:16,070
been men like it and I'm worried that 
now sort of the way in the past,

1350
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:18,810
um,
sexual sub,

1351
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,580
you know,
gays were shamed.

1352
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:24,120
We're now reversing it in shaming like 
heterosexual.

1353
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:25,013
Yes,
that's definitely,

1354
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:25,913
that's definitely.
Remember we had the young woman who 

1355
01:10:26,941 --> 01:10:28,680
complained about being whistled at and I
said,

1356
01:10:28,681 --> 01:10:29,670
don't worry,
it stops.

1357
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:30,643
Yeah.
Do we have a little bit of time for a 

1358
01:10:33,151 --> 01:10:33,984
couple more topics with you because one 
of the things that are just coming out 

1359
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:40,170
of this younger generation and you have 
a chapter of in your

1360
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,003
book,
which I wanted to finish what the line 

1361
01:10:42,631 --> 01:10:46,110
that we were pursuing to do this.
Well with sexual behavior.

1362
01:10:46,111 --> 01:10:49,650
The question is what's the end game?
And then this is what people have to ask

1363
01:10:49,651 --> 01:10:50,484
themselves is like,
one of the corollaries to the female 

1364
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:54,834
pornographic romance is actually the 
establishment of a longterm 

1365
01:10:57,690 --> 01:10:59,730
relationship.
And the question is,

1366
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,890
you know,
it's so funny because I got pilloried in

1367
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:03,170
the New York Times,
um,

1368
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:04,503
for,
for talking about enforced monogamy was 

1369
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,793
quite interesting because that gets 
brought up like in every scene was so 

1370
01:11:12,181 --> 01:11:14,820
ridiculous.
I to that woman for two days.

1371
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,863
I know it is just like a little side 
comment and then that became like the 

1372
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:21,210
center showcase,
like like enforced monogamy,

1373
01:11:21,211 --> 01:11:22,880
you mean forced marriage or.
No,

1374
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:23,723
I mean that was an anthropological term 
which she knew perfectly well because 

1375
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:27,684
she's a very smart person and all it 
means is that there's a pronounced 

1376
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,943
proclivity in human societies around the
world to enforce monogamous 

1377
01:11:35,971 --> 01:11:39,420
relationships at multiple levels of the 
sociological hierarchy.

1378
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,240
You do it culturally do it.
You do have an expectation.

1379
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:43,074
You do it legally enforced monogamy.
So my son was just married and if he 

1380
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:49,250
came to me next year and he said,
you know,

1381
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,310
Hey dad,
guess what?

1382
01:11:50,311 --> 01:11:51,144
I've managed to have four affairs in the
last year with hot women and my wife 

1383
01:11:54,031 --> 01:11:54,864
hasn't found out about any of them.
I'm not going to pat them on the back 

1384
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:58,650
and say,
good job,

1385
01:11:58,730 --> 01:11:59,940
kid,
you know,

1386
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:01,500
I'm going to say,
what the hell is up with you?

1387
01:12:01,501 --> 01:12:02,334
You know,
you violated the vow that you took your 

1388
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:04,614
putting your whole future risk.
You're betraying yourself and your wife 

1389
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:08,790
and well,
that's enforced monogamy.

1390
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,210
You know,
the,

1391
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:10,043
uh,
the idea is that the social norm is the 

1392
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:12,954
establishment of a long term monogamous 
relationship and that there are 

1393
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:20,480
structures put in place to support that,
but also to punish deviation from it and

1394
01:12:21,271 --> 01:12:21,871
you say,
well,

1395
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:22,704
you know,
maybe,

1396
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:25,640
maybe not so much on the punishment in,
but you can,

1397
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,220
it depends.

1398
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:27,480
It's like what do you want,
what,

1399
01:12:27,481 --> 01:12:28,314
what is it that you want,
you want a longterm stable relationship 

1400
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,940
or not,
and if that's the goal,

1401
01:12:32,941 --> 01:12:33,774
then your behavior should be devoted to 
whatever it is that facilitates that 

1402
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:38,640
goal.
And I don't see that.

1403
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,130
I certainly don't see that casual and 
impulsive sex fits that bill now,

1404
01:12:43,131 --> 01:12:43,964
not in the least.
And all of the evidence with regards to 

1405
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,513
living together shows that that's 
actually detrimental to the 

1406
01:12:50,161 --> 01:12:52,050
establishment of a longterm 
relationship.

1407
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:54,780
So first of all,
common law marriage,

1408
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:58,170
people who are in a common law marriage 
are much more likely to be be divorced.

1409
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,323
So that's the first thing.
The second thing is people who live 

1410
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:02,454
together before they get married are 
much more likely to be divorced after 

1411
01:13:04,951 --> 01:13:05,784
they get married.
So the idea that while you can try 

1412
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:08,574
someone on for size and see how it works
and then you're going to see if you're 

1413
01:13:10,981 --> 01:13:13,260
compatible,
it's like that's one story.

1414
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,093
Another story is how about you and I 
lived together for a little while and 

1415
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:18,390
you know,
if you're,

1416
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:19,663
you're not so bad,
but maybe I can find someone better and 

1417
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,350
if I do,
you know,

1418
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:25,290
in the next year and a half or so 
because we're not hooked together in any

1419
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,090
formal way,
I can just trade you in.

1420
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,250
It's okay,
you can do the same to me,

1421
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:34,320
but I don't really see that as the sort 
of complimentary mutual interaction that

1422
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:37,230
leads to the formulation of longterm 
trust.

1423
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:38,633
And I think it's a better story for 
interpreting what constitutes living 

1424
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:41,940
together then.
Well,

1425
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:42,774
you know,
we're going to try each other out 

1426
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:45,890
because that's what mature people would 
do it.

1427
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,490
So our rental.
Yeah.

1428
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:49,200
Well that's right,
the rental car.

1429
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

1430
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:51,390
Well that's,
that's it.

1431
01:13:51,391 --> 01:13:51,870
And,
and,

1432
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,610
but what more,
most importantly,

1433
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,593
the data indicate that it doesn't work 
is that you're more likely to get 

1434
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:57,780
divorced.

1435
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:00,480
Not less likely because maybe the right 
attitude is,

1436
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:01,733
well,
you're probably about as flawed as me 

1437
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,220
and you know,
we're lucky that we found each other and

1438
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:06,323
so let's see if we can make a commitment
because we're engaging in something 

1439
01:14:09,391 --> 01:14:10,590
that's very risky,
you know,

1440
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:11,424
an intimate relationship and we're going
to commit to each other and see if we 

1441
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:18,250
can build something of value across time
and there's a definite risk in that,

1442
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:19,900
but there is a compliment to your 
partner.

1443
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:20,650
It's like,
well,

1444
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:25,210
I think you're worth making a sacrifice 
for and what's the sacrifice?

1445
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:28,820
While it's everyone else.
It's a big sacrifice and there's.

1446
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:29,723
If you don't see that as a compliment,
then I don't think you're thinking 

1447
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:33,694
because not only is it a compliment,
it's sort of like the ultimate 

1448
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:36,724
compliment and maybe you don't get to 
have a marriage that works without that 

1449
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:41,134
compliment.
Maybe it's so difficult to establish a 

1450
01:14:43,301 --> 01:14:44,134
longterm relationship that's functional 
that you have to make a walloping 

1451
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:49,360
sacrifice very early on in the 
relationship.

1452
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,610
In order for that to even be a 
possibility.

1453
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,810
Maybe not because what the hell do we 
know about what binds people together,

1454
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:56,644
but,
but it's not that easy to stay with 

1455
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:00,400
someone for a long period of time,
you know,

1456
01:15:00,401 --> 01:15:01,540
it's,
it's a real,

1457
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,720
it's a real commitment.
It takes a tremendous amount of effort.

1458
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,043
So actually you're bringing us back to 
the beginning and your time with Tammy 

1459
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,460
and I'm.
One of the things about.

1460
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:16,660
I think I'm going to guess this is a bit
of an overlooked part in your chapter in

1461
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:19,480
your book,
but I just was like one of my favorites.

1462
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,180
It was your book on modern parenting.
Oh yes.

1463
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,033
And that was good.

1464
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,600
I thought I would get most trouble for.
I know,

1465
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:28,030
but it reminds me don't read that far 
into the book.

1466
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:28,973
Well,

1467
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:30,110
it,
my mother,

1468
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:30,944
when I had my first child gave me a 19 
fifties copy of Dr Spock and he was 

1469
01:15:35,001 --> 01:15:35,834
considered so controversial and yet he 
was just like the most sensible person 

1470
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:40,940
made new children very,
very well.

1471
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:41,774
Was a pediatrician and you,
your rule for parenting is do not let 

1472
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:50,291
your children do anything that makes you
dislike them and you kind of in that one

1473
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:54,080
chapter and it's not even one of your 
longest chapters,

1474
01:15:54,830 --> 01:15:55,663
just did this wonderful sweeping 
overview of modern parenting and the 

1475
01:15:59,601 --> 01:16:00,434
problems and in some ways that we're 
producing maybe some of these kids who 

1476
01:16:04,491 --> 01:16:08,780
are prolonging adulthood,
prolonging the markers of adulthood,

1477
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:10,220
um,
that,

1478
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,540
that you feel that parents,
uh,

1479
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:16,310
you said you see today's parents is 
terrified by their children,

1480
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:19,940
not least because they've denied credit 
for their role as benevolent,

1481
01:16:19,941 --> 01:16:23,060
unnecessary agents of discipline,
order and conventionality.

1482
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,193
And then you told some hilarious stories
about when your wife ran a daycare 

1483
01:16:26,481 --> 01:16:27,314
center out of your house and you would,
you would get into tests of wills with 

1484
01:16:30,621 --> 01:16:31,710
some of the two year olds,
but

1485
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,150
sun is ordinary.
It here,

1486
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,510
he got married.
Congratulations.

1487
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,290
He still doesn't want to do anything he 
doesn't want to do.

1488
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,020
He's very charming and very emotionally 
stable.

1489
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,600
So it's like he's easy to get along 
with,

1490
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:48,730
but trying to get him to do something he
doesn't want to do.

1491
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:49,564
It's like he had my wife defeated when 
he was nine months old and she's tough 

1492
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:55,060
like seriously she,
she's no pushover,

1493
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,103
but he would just sit there with his 
mouth closed and glare adders like I'm 

1494
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,540
not eating out and I can take more than 
you can.

1495
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:03,760
Dish out.
Was really something to see,

1496
01:17:03,761 --> 01:17:04,594
you know,
to see that kind of force of will and 

1497
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:06,850
someone that small.

1498
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,733
Talk a little bit about that and just 
the modern roles between men and women 

1499
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,160
were less.
You know,

1500
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,223
you don't really.
You're not really supposed to 

1501
01:17:16,401 --> 01:17:17,234
distinguish between fathers and mothers 
even though that seems to inevitably 

1502
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:21,290
happen in most.

1503
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:22,833
Well,
it happens in large part because the 

1504
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:26,900
children differentiate between them.
Like parents are under the delusion that

1505
01:17:26,901 --> 01:17:27,734
most of what you do with your children 
is driven by what you want to do with 

1506
01:17:30,261 --> 01:17:31,094
your children.
When in fact it's driven to a massive 

1507
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:36,170
degree by what your children want you to
do with them.

1508
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:41,590
And so there were studies done 30 years 
ago on feminist parents who decided that

1509
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:46,310
they were going to raise their children 
in non-gender differentiated matters.

1510
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:49,430
And when they were studied,
they found that the parents who had that

1511
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:53,060
explicit philosophy,
we're just as gender differentiated with

1512
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:55,400
their children as the parents who didn't
have the philosophy.

1513
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:56,234
And the reason for that is that if 
you're a parent that has any sense at 

1514
01:17:59,361 --> 01:18:00,194
all,
you don't respond to your children as a 

1515
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,584
rigid idea log.
You respond to them as whatever it is 

1516
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:08,300
the child man manifests it,
him,

1517
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:10,400
him or herself as like,
you know,

1518
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,263
with any individualized relationship,
you take your cue from the person and 

1519
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:17,810
you might think,
well a child has no intrinsic nature,

1520
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:18,644
but you know,
if you think that you either don't have 

1521
01:18:20,451 --> 01:18:25,451
children or you've never seen a child or
you're so blinded by your radiology that

1522
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:26,930
you don't have a child.

1523
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:27,763
You just have a blank projection screen 
onto which you project your 

1524
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:33,410
presuppositions and then heaven help 
your child.

1525
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:35,570
You know.
So,

1526
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:36,404
so a lot of the gender differentiation 
is actually driven by the children's 

1527
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:41,120
demands.
And that's all for the good.

1528
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:42,313
That chapter,
I thought I would get into tremendous 

1529
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:46,790
trouble for writing that chapter because
it's contentious,

1530
01:18:46,791 --> 01:18:49,100
right on the surface.
Just to the rule,

1531
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,083
because the rule first implies that 
children can be dislikable and then I 

1532
01:18:53,091 --> 01:18:54,360
would say again,
you know,

1533
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:55,383
like have you met children,
every child where their children you 

1534
01:18:57,891 --> 01:19:01,730
didn't like obviously,
and so lots of children or dislikable,

1535
01:19:01,731 --> 01:19:02,564
but it's taboo to admit that because 
they're all sweetness and light and 

1536
01:19:04,761 --> 01:19:07,210
innocence ever since Rousseau,
but you know,

1537
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:11,390
was so put all five of his children in 
an orphanage where they all died.

1538
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:15,500
So maybe we won't,
so we won't talk too much about Rousseau

1539
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,043
and um,
and then the next taboo is while that 

1540
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:21,770
parents can dislike their children,
right?

1541
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:22,603
But if you're a clinician and you don't 
think that parents can dislike their 

1542
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:27,230
children,
then well then,

1543
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:28,663
well then you're not a clinician because
one of the things you constantly see is 

1544
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:32,324
that path all within families is an 
incredibly common common source of 

1545
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,250
psychological destabilization.
Right?

1546
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:41,084
And it's terrible tension between 
parents and their children in between 

1547
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:46,580
siblings.
What I suggest in the book,

1548
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:50,000
which I think is radical by today's 
standards,

1549
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:55,001
is that your fundamental job as a parent
is to ensure that by the time your child

1550
01:19:57,111 --> 01:19:57,944
is four years old,
that they are maximally desirable to 

1551
01:20:01,311 --> 01:20:02,144
other children and to adults because 
what happens is that after the age of 

1552
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:07,493
four,
you aren't the primary agent of 

1553
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:10,074
socialization.
The social world becomes the primary 

1554
01:20:12,991 --> 01:20:13,824
agent of socialization and if your child
is the sort of child that's invited to 

1555
01:20:18,151 --> 01:20:18,984
play by other children because your 
child is capable of for stolen 

1556
01:20:22,201 --> 01:20:26,270
gratification and taking turns and 
playing someone else's game when,

1557
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:27,183
when it's necessary and abiding by the 
rules and not having a temper tantrum 

1558
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:33,100
when they lose and not getting to,
you know,

1559
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,800
high on their horse when they win,
than many children will invite them.

1560
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,050
Sorry,

1561
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:42,950
I,
I don't know what you mean.

1562
01:20:42,980 --> 01:20:44,360
Just say it.
What do you want me to do?

1563
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:44,640
No,
I,

1564
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,720
I know we,
we have,

1565
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,440
we have our limited time and so I just 
wanted to.

1566
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:49,274
I was actually saying

1567
01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:51,370
anymore,

1568
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:52,203
so this is great.
I was selfish of me because I really 

1569
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:57,780
wanted to hear you talk.
I know I just want to let him take this.

1570
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,430
I'll take 15 seconds to wrap that up and
then stop.

1571
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,920
Well,
so look,

1572
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:03,083
you get married when you have your 
children and you're flawed and your 

1573
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:06,954
partner slaughtered and hopefully you're
flawed in different ways and so you put 

1574
01:21:09,271 --> 01:21:10,104
the two of you together and you make one
approximately normal person and then 

1575
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,390
hopefully and then your child has to 
interact with that dyad.

1576
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,253
That is a reasonable representative of 
social norms and if they disagree or if 

1577
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:27,450
your child disappoints you with their 
behavior,

1578
01:21:27,630 --> 01:21:31,680
the probability that they will 
disappoint other people is very high and

1579
01:21:31,681 --> 01:21:32,514
so you have an ethical obligation to 
ensure that your child is behaving in a 

1580
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:41,160
manner that makes them optimally 
desirable to their playmates and also to

1581
01:21:41,161 --> 01:21:41,994
other adults because then the kids 
invite them to play and they get to be 

1582
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:47,760
socialized,
right?

1583
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:49,800
They get,
they have friends for God's sake.

1584
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:51,090
It's like,
what do you want for your kids?

1585
01:21:51,091 --> 01:21:51,924
How about some friends?
Wouldn't that be nice and maybe what 

1586
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,134
you'd like is that they regulate their 
behavior well enough so that when you 

1587
01:21:57,691 --> 01:22:00,630
take them places,
restaurants to see your friends,

1588
01:22:00,631 --> 01:22:01,464
to see your relatives,
they behave in a manner that's 

1589
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:04,104
sufficiently civilized,
so their intrinsic charm winds over the 

1590
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:11,610
adults and everywhere they go,
people are smiling and welcoming instead

1591
01:22:11,611 --> 01:22:12,444
of wishing with fake smiles that the 
Damn Brat would leave along with their 

1592
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:18,750
foolish parents,
which is not a good.

1593
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:19,763
That's not a good environment to have 
your child constantly exposed to no 

1594
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:29,571
friends because they're too selfish and 
immature and irritated era irritating to

1595
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:34,200
adults so that they're barely tolerated 
under the mask of false smiles.

1596
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,483
It's like you have an ethical obligation
to regulate your child's behavior so 

1597
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:42,090
that they're optimally acceptable 
socially and that is not how people look

1598
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:44,100
at children in the modern world.
They think,

1599
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:44,934
well,
you raising their self esteem or you're 

1600
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:47,184
enhancing their creativity or you don't 
want to put constraints on their 

1601
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,304
behavior because you're going to 
interfere with the flowering of their 

1602
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:55,390
intrinsic self and you know,
it's all roost,

1603
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:59,880
soliah nonsense and there's no evidence 
to support it.

1604
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:03,630
Yeah.
Father,

1605
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:06,280
yeah,
he was such a corrupt

1606
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,353
and he had these babies with this poor 
scullery maid and left them all in a 

1607
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:15,430
actually a place where they would just 
languish and die.

1608
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,001
Yeah,
right.

1609
01:23:16,001 --> 01:23:17,270
Five of them Russo.

1610
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:18,110
Yeah.
No,

1611
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:18,931
I know.
Yeah,

1612
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:20,210
exactly.
Oh man,

1613
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,920
that is intrinsically good.

1614
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,000
Yeah.
One example,

1615
01:23:24,030 --> 01:23:24,960
I just remember

1616
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:30,450
a few weeks ago I was reading about you 
in somehow I got onto somebody's twitter

1617
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:33,850
feed whom I will not mention because,
oh my God.

1618
01:23:33,851 --> 01:23:37,630
But anyway,
a difficult person and she was attacking

1619
01:23:37,631 --> 01:23:38,464
you and had a,
a selection from your book a bit where 

1620
01:23:42,281 --> 01:23:45,100
you would called two-year-olds little 
monsters.

1621
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:46,443
And so suddenly all of these distraught 
twitter followers of this feminist were 

1622
01:23:51,761 --> 01:23:52,594
saying,
ah,

1623
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:53,770
called them.

1624
01:23:55,710 --> 01:23:57,550
Yeah.
Little monsters and everybody.

1625
01:23:57,551 --> 01:23:59,290
And then occasionally there'd be a

1626
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,250
apparent who would take a two year olds 
kind of are monsters,

1627
01:24:04,251 --> 01:24:07,790
you know,
and then there'd be kind of art and they

1628
01:24:07,791 --> 01:24:12,240
had taken this out of context and shown 
it like something to deplore and,

1629
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:13,940
but,
and it was so amusing to me.

1630
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,130
This little.
Yeah.

1631
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:16,740
Hopefully they'll soon be cursed with 
some.

1632
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:22,610
My son was,
I won't say which one was two years old,

1633
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:23,473
had he was a good boy,
but he had an insane meltdown in a 

1634
01:24:27,381 --> 01:24:29,150
supermarket.
I was with my mother.

1635
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:30,560
We both pretended we didn't know

1636
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:36,420
to be the parent and we heard people 
say,

1637
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:37,283
oh my God,
look at that child and watching a two 

1638
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:43,140
year old have a Tantrum is I didn't want
to be associated with

1639
01:24:43,700 --> 01:24:47,300
boy who used to be like when my wife was
taken care of more kids than ours.

1640
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:51,140
There was a little boy who who,
who had learned to throw a pretty decent

1641
01:24:51,141 --> 01:24:51,974
town and and he would do that and it 
didn't work in our house because we'd 

1642
01:24:55,581 --> 01:24:56,414
just leave him,
have his tantrum and going into a 

1643
01:24:57,741 --> 01:24:59,890
different room and then he'd kind of 
wake up out of it.

1644
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,700
There wouldn't be anybody around.
And so that

1645
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:04,640
like if you put all that work to a 
dramatic difference

1646
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,500
play and you have zero audience,
it's not.

1647
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,630
You're not going to sustain it anyways.
He could actually turn,

1648
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,660
hold his breath until he turned blue.
So you should try that.

1649
01:25:13,710 --> 01:25:15,820
Go home and see if you can do that in 
front of the mirror man.

1650
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,780
Like it's hard.
It's very,

1651
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,990
very good.
Will you do.

1652
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:21,250
It was impressive.
It was.

1653
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:22,260
And,
and you know,

1654
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:24,390
two year olds are very impressive.
They're there.

1655
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:28,510
They have unbelievable outbursts of rage
and disinhibited emotion.

1656
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:30,010
And your job is,
you know,

1657
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:30,844
they're,
they're driven by these underlying 

1658
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,513
motivational systems that are 
unbelievably powerful and as part of 

1659
01:25:36,101 --> 01:25:38,500
what makes them delightful because when 
they're happy,

1660
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,780
they're insanely happy.
And when they're playful,

1661
01:25:40,781 --> 01:25:45,070
they're incredibly playful.
And so the positive end of the MS is way

1662
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:46,700
exaggerated compared to,
you know,

1663
01:25:46,790 --> 01:25:47,623
or rather drab adult and,
and so it makes two year olds 

1664
01:25:49,691 --> 01:25:51,040
extraordinarily interesting.

1665
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:53,800
But the same is true on the negative 
emotion side.

1666
01:25:53,801 --> 01:25:56,320
They're completely dysregulated and it's
really hard on them.

1667
01:25:56,350 --> 01:26:00,460
Like to have a two year old who isn't in
control of their emotions means that you

1668
01:26:00,461 --> 01:26:04,310
have a child who's developing central 
personality,

1669
01:26:04,311 --> 01:26:04,850
you know,
their,

1670
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,590
their ego,
for lack of a better word,

1671
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:11,120
is constantly being swamped by these 
powerful underlying emotional systems.

1672
01:26:11,330 --> 01:26:12,163
You know what it's like if you are 
enraged for any period of time or if 

1673
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:17,600
you're engulfed by grief,
like it's exhausting.

1674
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:18,643
It's,
it's demeaning and it's exhausting and 

1675
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:21,464
it's the same with a little candidates 
like it's a real defeat for the 

1676
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:29,231
developing integrated individual to be 
subjugated by those catastrophic,

1677
01:26:29,931 --> 01:26:30,764
really powerful emergency motions and 
part of your job as a parent is to 

1678
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:35,414
scaffold the part of the child that can 
regulate and inhibit those powerful 

1679
01:26:39,951 --> 01:26:42,530
underlying system.
So with my son for example,

1680
01:26:42,531 --> 01:26:46,130
when he used to misbehave,
I would count say you're going to go sit

1681
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:46,964
on the steps.

1682
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:47,751
He'd say,
oh no,

1683
01:26:47,751 --> 01:26:49,400
I'm not.
I would say,

1684
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:50,990
Whoa,
yes you are.

1685
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:54,080
And then usually I'd have to chase the 
morale because he wouldn't go sit on the

1686
01:26:54,081 --> 01:26:54,914
steps and so I put them on the steps.
Say you're going to sit there until 

1687
01:26:57,201 --> 01:27:00,440
you've got yourself under control.
And so he'd say no,

1688
01:27:00,441 --> 01:27:01,274
I not say yes you are.
And then he tried to get up and I just 

1689
01:27:03,661 --> 01:27:04,494
told him,
see,

1690
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:05,563
you're going to sit there.
I'm going to hold you until you sit 

1691
01:27:06,951 --> 01:27:08,030
there.
No,

1692
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:08,864
I'm not.
It's like I could out wait a two year 

1693
01:27:11,151 --> 01:27:11,984
old,
so I usually won those battles and then 

1694
01:27:14,061 --> 01:27:15,260
he'd sit there and say,
look kid,

1695
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:17,450
this is the deal.
I'd say two things like you want to have

1696
01:27:17,451 --> 01:27:18,980
a bad day or you want to have a good 
day,

1697
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:20,960
you think about that because if you want
to have a good day,

1698
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,480
have a bad day,
we could have a bad days.

1699
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,323
You sit here and as soon as you get 
control of yourself and you're ready to 

1700
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:31,220
be civilized,
then you can come back and we can have a

1701
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:33,110
good day.
So we'd sit there

1702
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,660
just,
just,

1703
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:39,380
it was unbelievable to watch.
Just the developed with rage,

1704
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:40,214
you know,
just trying to get himself under 

1705
01:27:42,021 --> 01:27:42,831
control,
you know?

1706
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:45,080
And so I'd come back 30 seconds later 
and I'd say,

1707
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:48,290
you know,
but got yourself,

1708
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:49,280
got your act together.
Yeah,

1709
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,810
no,
now I wait.

1710
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:57,290
And usually it took them two or three 
minutes and he'd calm down and then he'd

1711
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,690
come back out and he'd say,
I'm ready to have a good day.

1712
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,920
And he meant it,
you know?

1713
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:04,190
And I can tell he meant it too because 
whatever resentment,

1714
01:28:04,191 --> 01:28:05,024
I was harboring towards him for his 
misbehavior and you have to watch that 

1715
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:11,490
when you're an adult would vanish 
because he'd come and he'd,

1716
01:28:12,150 --> 01:28:12,983
he was done.

1717
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,360
He was ready to just,
you know,

1718
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:15,383
to proceed on a civilized basis.
And it was really interesting to watch 

1719
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:22,670
that because it took them every time he 
sat on the steps,

1720
01:28:22,671 --> 01:28:25,400
it took them a shorter and shorter 
period of time to attain mastery.

1721
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,200
Right.
Until,

1722
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,033
you know,
it got to the point where he could only 

1723
01:28:28,551 --> 01:28:33,290
have to sit for 15 seconds or so when he
would bring himself under control.

1724
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,153
And that was a victory.
Like if you imagine the neurological 

1725
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:40,400
systems developed that are responsible 
for personality integration,

1726
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:41,373
it was a victory for those systems 
because they were attaining the ability 

1727
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:48,410
to regulate the lower order,
spontaneous emotions and you know,

1728
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:49,430
and,
and he,

1729
01:28:49,431 --> 01:28:50,264
he turned into an individual who's 
capable of a tremendous level of self 

1730
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:56,750
control and you know,
and he had large daymond's defined with.

1731
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:58,700
Yes,
absolutely.

1732
01:28:58,780 --> 01:28:59,250
And,
and,

1733
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:01,290
and while it turned out well for my 
daughter too,

1734
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:02,010
because she ended

1735
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,750
up being very ill and he ended up being 
extraordinarily levelheaded and reliable

1736
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:08,760
and thank God for that.
Could you,

1737
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:12,360
could you come to my house and do that 
for my little multiport izzy?

1738
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:15,540
Because I can't,
I can't,

1739
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:17,910
I can't train her.
She's nice.

1740
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:19,980
The next book,
the dog.

1741
01:29:19,981 --> 01:29:22,670
I would love to know how to train your 
dog.

1742
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:27,080
You like cats?
That's the one role I have checked.

1743
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:28,283
Like petting the cat.
I wrote about dogs for two pages to 

1744
01:29:30,661 --> 01:29:32,460
begin with,
just to satisfy the dog.

1745
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:36,960
It didn't satisfy satisfied.
You can't satisfy them.

1746
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,943
All right,
well we can't thank you enough for 

1747
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:39,940
coming here.
Um,

1748
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,560
I know the Aei audience is just so 
delighted to have had the chance to hear

1749
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:48,400
you
talk.

1750
01:29:50,300 --> 01:29:55,300
Have once we met in DC,
but I've seen you passed electronics.

1751
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:56,030
Yes.
Yes.

1752
01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:57,900
Oh,
you've swiped past.

1753
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,220
Oh yeah.
Well there was that.

1754
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:00,680
We're not going into that.
Okay.

1755
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:02,180
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.

1756
01:30:02,181 --> 01:30:03,014
Thank you Jordan.

1757
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:09,520
Thanks.
