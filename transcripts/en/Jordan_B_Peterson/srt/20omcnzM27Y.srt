1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,460
This is our first,
uh,

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,403
a hangout google hangout.
I hope the first of many you are Jordan 

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,413
Peterson,
that professor of psychology at the 

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,650
University of Toronto and I'm Wodek 
Szemberg a producer within the agenda,

5
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:20,484
uh,
at Tvo and today we are going to be 

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,590
speaking about a book that you are 
beginning to work on,

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,110
right?
It's your,

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,710
it's your second book.
Um,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,440
and tell us first a bit about,
uh,

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,623
uh,
the first book that you written and how 

11
00:00:39,201 --> 00:00:41,690
long it took you to write that one.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,513
Well,
I wrote a book called maps of meaning 

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,730
the architecture of beliefs back in.
It was published in 1999 and now it took

14
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:50,564
me 15 years to write and I wrote three 
hours a day basically for almost that 

15
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:58,754
whole time.
So it took a long time and it's 

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,260
correspondingly difficult to read.

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,050
Obviously.
Obviously you are not trying to spend 15

18
00:01:09,051 --> 00:01:11,780
years writing a.
The next one,

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,650
the title was the book's title is 42 
wide,

20
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,583
42.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,670
Well,
it was partly,

22
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,810
um,
what would,

23
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:22,830
what do you call that?
Um,

24
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,463
well fluke isn't exactly the right word,
but it's the only one I can think up at 

25
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,454
the moment.
I started experimenting with a website 

26
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:31,784
called Quora.
Quora is a relatively new site where 

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,800
anyone can post any question and anyone 
can post any answer.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,390
Um,
and then the answers are voted on by the

29
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:46,910
target population who's interested in 
the question.

30
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:47,744
And so I wrote 45 or 50 answers to 
different questions and one of them was 

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,450
a list of rules for living.
The question was,

32
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,600
does anyone have a good list of rules 
for living?

33
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,070
And so I thought I'd take a crack at 
that and I wrote 40,

34
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:03,963
turned out that I wrote 41 rules for 
living and it became quite popular on 

35
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:08,884
Quora.
It got something in the neighborhood or 

36
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:13,480
has accrued something in the 
neighborhood of 500 up folds,

37
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:15,040
which puts it in the top.

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,873
One or two percent of all the thousands 
of answers that have been posted on 

39
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:21,004
quora.
And lots of my other answers have 

40
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,520
nowhere near that kind of,
you know,

41
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,713
popular success.
And then I was thinking about the list 

42
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,374
and I remembered that there was a book 
written by Adam so long while back 

43
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:38,530
called hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,
Douglas Adams,

44
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:39,364
and in that book a computer,
a super computer in the future is asked 

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,900
the question,
what's the answer to life,

46
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:47,734
the universe and everything and the 
answer that the computer spits out 

47
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,150
after,
if I remember correctly,

48
00:02:52,151 --> 00:02:56,020
several thousand years of computation 
was 42.

49
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,370
And I believe the computer also comments
that that is the correct answer,

50
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:01,204
but that the people who are going to 
receive at aren't smart enough to 

51
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,730
understand it.
So I thought,

52
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:07,564
well,
one more answer that gives me 42 and 

53
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:14,380
then that would be a funny,
a bit of serendipity.

54
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,950
That's the,
that's the word I was looking for.

55
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,190
You remember which one was the second to
rule that you came up with?

56
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,340
Wait,
remember clones?

57
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,100
No,
I could find out but I don't remember.

58
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,140
Okay.
Okay.

59
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,030
So,
so let me ask you this question.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,210
Why,
why is it that a 10th amendments and not

61
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,840
sufficient for us to live by and why?
Why do we need a,

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,550
a fresh list of rules that will guide 
our life's choices?

63
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,160
Well,
the first thing is,

64
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:53,994
is that if you,
if you actually look in the Old 

65
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,570
Testament where the 10 commandments are 
listed,

66
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,100
you'll find that there are far more than
talent.

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,460
The tanner,
I suppose,

68
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,790
what might be regarded as the most 
crucial rule.

69
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,560
So even back when the 10 commandments 
were formulated,

70
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,710
10 rules wasn't it?
But there's also something about the way

71
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,640
people think that makes them quite happy
about lists,

72
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,840
numbered lists,
you know,

73
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,674
when you see this very frequently,
the seven habits of successful people 

74
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:23,290
and,
and so forth.

75
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,593
Then once the list is numbered,
it sort of tiny and it seems well 

76
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:32,680
organized and it's sort of a,
did.

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,500
It implies that it's comprehensible and 
somewhat comprehensive.

78
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,334
And I mean,
I think that was part of the 

79
00:04:38,451 --> 00:04:40,460
attractiveness of this particular 
answer.

80
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,190
So other than that,
I can't really say,

81
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,230
and I guess people are looking for 
simplicity,

82
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:46,870
right?
And 43 is quite a few,

83
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,713
but

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,753
I must say,
I must say that I was a bit taken aback 

85
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,160
by some of them,
uh,

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,800
by virtue of the fact that they seem to 
rather a lacking in,

87
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,201
in,
in,

88
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,880
in,
in importance,

89
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,350
others say,
seem to naturally possess a,

90
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,960
as in be truthful.
I mean,

91
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:17,961
that's a great role that seems to,
seems to have all the bells and whistles

92
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,150
of,
of,

93
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,983
of truth to live by that here are some 
others which seem to not to be at the 

94
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:26,370
same caliber.
And this is,

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,850
these are the ones I want to talk to you
about today.

96
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,973
Uh,
hopefully we'll get another chance to 

97
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,170
talk about this.
We'll say they're on.

98
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:36,970
So we will talk about the important of 
as quote unquote a.

99
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:40,090
So here's one of them,
uh,

100
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,710
number 14,
uh,

101
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,460
try to make one room in your house as 
beautiful as possible.

102
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,850
Why is that important?
Well,

103
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:53,470
because if you want to improve things on
a medium to large scale,

104
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:55,300
let's say,
so that would be important.

105
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,940
It's really useful to doing so on a 
small scale.

106
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,020
So you actually learn how to do it.
And No,

107
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,540
it isn't that easy to make a single room
beautiful.

108
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,870
It's,
it's hard and it's hard.

109
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:13,871
Plus it's the knowledge you generate 
doing that is also generalizable because

110
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,900
fixing up one thing is a lot like fixing
up another thing.

111
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:18,734
There's a lot of commonality between the
attempts to improve one thing and 

112
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:24,054
another thing and you can start locally 
like with the room and the first thing 

113
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:28,764
you find out is that it's not trivial to
try to make a single room beautiful and 

114
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,114
that you learn an awful lot about beauty
and you learn an awful lot about paying 

115
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,074
attention and you learn an awful lot 
about how you could make what you 

116
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:45,150
already have much better than it is 
merely by paying attention to it.

117
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,013
And you know,
I shouldn't really say merely because 

118
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,830
paying attention to things,
there's almost everything.

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,293
And also you get to practice doing 
something that's hypothetically an 

120
00:06:54,171 --> 00:06:57,360
improvement on something that's actually
your own.

121
00:06:57,361 --> 00:06:59,340
You're not putting anyone else at any 
risk.

122
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,863
And the benefits of that are also are 
also quite remarkable because then you 

123
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:05,874
have a space around you that's beautiful
and you get to benefit from whatever it 

124
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:09,804
is that beauty is.
Beauty is deep and people are afraid of 

125
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:14,064
it too,
which is another thing that makes it 

126
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,490
difficult and challenging is I believe 
the favorite color that Canadians have.

127
00:07:20,491 --> 00:07:25,470
Canadians for decorator purposes is a 
beige and you know,

128
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,304
there's a reason for that.
And the reason is you can't go wrong 

129
00:07:28,831 --> 00:07:29,664
with beige,
but the problem with that is you can go 

130
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,034
right with it either.
And so trying to make something 

131
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:36,814
beautiful demands that you step out of 
the ordinary and that's frightening and 

132
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,170
it's really useful to try to do.
So

133
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,040
I've been,
I've been to your home,

134
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,310
it will not be a secret to those who,
uh,

135
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,720
familiar with you and the frequency with
which you have been on,

136
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,120
on the agenda and big ideas that we know
each other quite well.

137
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,353
Um,
tell me which of your rooms in your 

138
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:05,454
house,
so you deem to be the most beautiful 

139
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:07,584
one?

140
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,890
Well,
I have a front room.

141
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,310
It's a small room.
Um,

142
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,420
because I live in a quite a small place 
because I lived downtown,

143
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,560
I have a front room which is a living 
room I suppose.

144
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,740
Um,
and it,

145
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,320
it,
it's about 12 by 12 and it's,

146
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,520
it has a beautiful fireplace and a 
marble tiled and the cover,

147
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,590
it's a gas fireplace.
The cover is a cover that,

148
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,840
okay.
Was part of the original house before we

149
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,440
redid it and it's made out of like a 
bronze tinted cast iron.

150
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,610
And then in that room there are probably
15 paintings of different sizes.

151
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,940
I'm ranging from like monumental,
could,

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,960
one of them's about seven by nine and 
then there's several others in there,

153
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,910
believe it or not often or approximately
that size.

154
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:00,744
And there's this sculpture and um,
and some paintings by a famous Mexican 

155
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,234
artists.
And,

156
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,860
and you know,
you might think,

157
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,694
well that's,
that's would be prohibitively expensive 

158
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,630
to,
to,

159
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,183
for someone to attempt,
but it's actually not because you can 

160
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:19,290
buy paintings at a very reasonable price
if you learn how to find them.

161
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,600
I find most of them on Ebay as it turns 
out.

162
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,150
And I'd found some unbelievable 
paintings on Ebay.

163
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,910
I've had to look a lot.
I probably looked at,

164
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,573
I tried to calculate it the other day.
I've looked at two or 300 paintings a 

165
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,740
day for 10 years,
so that's about $6,000

166
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:41,610
a months or about 75 to $100,000
a year.

167
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:45,330
So that's a million paintings in a,
in 10 years.

168
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,890
I'm curious,
how long does it take you to know,

169
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,070
to know where the painting is worthy of 
interest?

170
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,470
That's a good question.
It could take as little as,

171
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,893
oh,

172
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,973
it's less than half a second.
It's probably more like a fifth of a 

173
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:07,420
second.
Probably.

174
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,290
Most of them are so bad.
It's just absolutely unbelievable and,

175
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,260
but,
but the,

176
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,150
the ones that aren't,
they kind of pop out and,

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,633
and then I put them in a group a day.
I opened a new tab and look and save it 

178
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:26,170
for later consideration and make a 
small,

179
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,740
you know,
I,

180
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,110
I call,
I told them very,

181
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,500
very radically and so.
But I mean it's really been very,

182
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,320
it's been very interesting to try to do 
this not only to the,

183
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,090
to the room,
but to the whole house.

184
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:37,924
And,
and I mean I have 36 colors in my house 

185
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,120
and I had a friend of mine who's from 
Montreal,

186
00:10:43,121 --> 00:10:45,910
helped me initially.
He's a portrait painter and he helped me

187
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:50,800
initially pick the colors and you know,
one of the questions is,

188
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:51,634
well,
what does that do when you do something 

189
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,080
like that?

190
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,913
And I mean one of the things that's been
quite interesting is it always gives me 

191
00:10:56,801 --> 00:10:57,634
an excuse to invite interesting people 
over to my house because I have 

192
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:05,290
something interesting to show them.
And so it's made it easier for me too.

193
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,813
It's been,
it's made it easier for me to make 

194
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:10,570
certain kinds of social arrangements 
with people.

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,913
I'm also,
and this is something I thought about a 

196
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:17,080
lot when I had my kids,
I mean they're often university now,

197
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:19,270
but when they were little,
you know,

198
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,130
it struck me that it would be useful to 
have them surrounded by

199
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,820
productions of high quality because 
they,

200
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,863
they tell you about production of high 
quality and artistic production tells 

201
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,260
you something like a painting for 
example of something.

202
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,260
Most of the paintings,
I have a relatively representational,

203
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:42,890
although not all of them because there's
lots of different dimensions of beauty,

204
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,280
but a representational painting that's 
beautiful,

205
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,970
have something normal because some of 
the paintings that I have are of working

206
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,110
people.
For example,

207
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,530
what the patient tells you is,
although you don't notice it because you

208
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,364
don't have the time,
you're surrounded by things that are 

209
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,820
worthy of great attention.
And here's an example.

210
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:08,821
Here's a portrait of a working man,
maybe a coal miner that some artists who

211
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:13,990
is talented spent 250 hours on just 
getting the face right.

212
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,123
And so what that reminds you of,
even though you don't know it when you 

213
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,260
look at it,
is that everything that you glance at is

214
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,420
worth 250 hours of study.

215
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,530
It's just you don't have the time and 
you forget about it because you have to,

216
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,460
but the world is full of things that are
absolutely remarkable,

217
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,880
deeply remarkable.
And what an artist does is tell you that

218
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,850
all the time.
And so when you have those things around

219
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,500
you are,
you have beautiful things around you.

220
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,950
It's a constant reminder that behind the
necessary shallowness of your perception

221
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:45,394
is the kind of depth that you need to 
make contact with in order to sustain 

222
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:52,750
your faith in life and in humanity.
It's not a trivial thing.

223
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,840
It's a really important thing and you 
can see this.

224
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,823
Just one more comment on this like 
although it's harder for conservative 

225
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,120
people to appreciate this because by 
temperament they're not as aesthetically

226
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,290
I'm committed,
I would say are interested.

227
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,623
You know,
one of the things we should remember is 

228
00:13:10,661 --> 00:13:15,550
that Europe has become a magnet for 
tourists all over the world and it draws

229
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,533
billions and billions of dollars a year 
of revenue from other countries because 

230
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,470
people come from all over to look at 
impractical,

231
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,810
so to speak.
Beautiful things.

232
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,083
Well,
it turns out they're not practical at 

233
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,670
all.
They're so practical that you just.

234
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,840
The fact that they're beautiful is 
probably an indication that they're more

235
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,674
practical than anything else you could 
possibly imagine because your 

236
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,334
appreciation for beauty,
beauty I think is probably it's a 

237
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:47,941
facility that you have of noting what's 
valuable beyond the mundane.

238
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,050
So John,
let's move on.

239
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Let's continue with talking about things
that are to be appreciated and will.

240
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,660
Number 37 is pat.
Sorry,

241
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:04,750
pat kept when you encountered one on 
this treat,

242
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,740
why?
Why is that an essential

243
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,310
important part of,
of,

244
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,911
of,
of,

245
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:11,980
of a good life?
Well,

246
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,814
you know,
it's,

247
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,863
it's,

248
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,893
I suppose it's in the same category and 
I guess this is rather evident of stop 

249
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:21,334
and smell the roses,
although obviously that's degenerated 

250
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,474
into something of a cliche,
but I mean it's easy to become so 

251
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,253
obsessed with your particular goal that 
you don't notice what's around you when 

252
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,724
it's happening and a catcher,
a good break from that as far as I'm 

253
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:46,390
concerned because they'll poke their 
little heads out and kind of take a look

254
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,224
at you because they're interested in 
maybe having a momentary pleasurable 

255
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:54,991
interaction and there seems to be very 
little harm in doing it and it takes you

256
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,760
out of your.
It takes you out of one timeframe,

257
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,623
which is often a goal oriented and 
practical timeframe which are obviously 

258
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,334
necessary timeframes and helps you 
concentrate on the moment and attending 

259
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,310
to the moment.
Well,

260
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,900
it's,
it's analogous to the same thing.

261
00:15:11,901 --> 00:15:15,200
We just discussed with regards to 
surrounding yourself with beauty,

262
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,053
it's hard for people to pay enough 
attention to the moment and when an 

263
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,243
opportunity presents itself to you where
you could immerse yourself in something 

264
00:15:26,451 --> 00:15:31,451
that's,
that's of high quality for no cost.

265
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,170
No,
there's no,

266
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,370
there's no downside to it.
So well,

267
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,243
a good rule of thumb is like engage in 
every opportunity you possibly have for 

268
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:41,144
peaceful pleasure.
That's that as is of no cost to anyone 

269
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,753
and there's lots of opportunities like 
that around and people start noticing 

270
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:51,224
them like we're wired out.
So we stopped noticing things that are 

271
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:57,200
working and there's a reason for that.
It's practical,

272
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:59,450
but the problem is,
is that you forget about everything that

273
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:02,600
surrounds you that's working really well
in that and that is pleasurable.

274
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,290
Can,
can you give me some other examples of a

275
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,000
pleasurable activities that have that,
uh,

276
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,190
that quality that they take you out of?
Well,

277
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,430
the,
the ordinary humdrum,

278
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,921
the,
uh,

279
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:18,260
the purposeful pursuit of things.

280
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,021
Yeah.
Well,

281
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:20,970
I think hot showers are good example of 
that.

282
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:22,560
I mean,
think about a hot shower.

283
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,394
It's like almost everyone in North 
America is so rich that they have a 

284
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,950
personal hot spring in their house.
It's like,

285
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:34,650
that's a good deal.
That's such a good deal.

286
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,573
It's,
it's so impossible and so unlikely and 

287
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:39,790
people take it for granted.
Although,

288
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,624
well,
yes and no because they sing in the 

289
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:42,594
shower and lots of people say they have 
their best ideas in the shower and it's 

290
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,624
like,
it's really useful to remember when 

291
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:47,844
you're in the shower that hey,
aren't you king of the universe with 

292
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:55,080
your hot spring inside your house and 
what a great deal that is.

293
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,240
And lots of things are like that and we 
forget about them and it's,

294
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,093
it's the curse of human beings to forget
about things because we're kind of 

295
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:06,810
cognitively limited and we're always 
attending to problems and so you have to

296
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,790
sort of stop yourself now and then and 
think,

297
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,163
okay,
well,

298
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,240
wow,
isn't it great that this works?

299
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,410
I also think the same thing about cars 
because I,

300
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,500
I'm firmly convinced that if the 
automobile was invented today,

301
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,230
there's no bloody way it would be 
illegal for people to drive.

302
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,880
I mean,
when we left,

303
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,420
you know,
at the risk of being sexist in ages,

304
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,000
we let little old ladies pilot,
you know,

305
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,013
3,500
pounds of hurdling metal down barrier 

306
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,064
lined highways with thousands and 
hundreds of other people around that 

307
00:17:38,551 --> 00:17:43,551
could be run over and no one even 
notices that that's an absolute miracle,

308
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,461
that that's,
that,

309
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:46,294
that,
that you can do that and that it's not 

310
00:17:48,091 --> 00:17:49,440
illegal.
I just,

311
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,573
every time I think that it just makes my
jaw drop because it violates every 

312
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,280
principle of common sense you could 
possibly imagine.

313
00:17:56,281 --> 00:18:00,750
And plus it's so much fun and cars 
worked so well.

314
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,820
They're so good.
Like I have an old car,

315
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:05,970
it's a,
it's a Hyundai Sonata from 19,

316
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,340
from 2004,
you know,

317
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,840
so it's getting to be an old car.
The bloody thing is perfect,

318
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,823
you know,
it's got a top speed of about 140 miles 

319
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:16,314
an hour.
It's smooth as silk has a great sound 

320
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,331
system and I can zoom around like a mad 
dog and the authorities are,

321
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,380
don't bother themselves with that.

322
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,300
Yeah.
Go on the record here and,

323
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:33,330
and much support you in admiration of 
the fact that we have achieved as a,

324
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:37,470
as a conscious realization,
something,

325
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:42,471
something on parallel which is,
which is to allow individuals to,

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,833
uh,
drive potentially killing machines in a 

327
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,470
way in which in which,
uh,

328
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,050
the killing does not happen for the most
part,

329
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,060
does not happen and it happens.
It's not intentional and that it somehow

330
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,004
it does embody and amazing or that that 
fact of driving a mass suggests that we 

331
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:06,984
have,
will be able to create a cartoon in 

332
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:09,661
which,
uh,

333
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:14,661
the principles of freedom and older able
to exist in an amazing fashion.

334
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,740
It is,
it's amazing.

335
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,030
I mean,
you know,

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,873
that if we invented a new technology 
that killed as many people a year is 

337
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,890
audible,
there's no,

338
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,740
there's no way we disseminated.
There isn't a chance,

339
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,933
but for some reason automobiles have 
have sneaked through that and it even 

340
00:19:31,111 --> 00:19:31,944
more amazing.
They sneak through that so well that 

341
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,230
even totalitarian states can't stop 
them.

342
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,100
And so the first thing your basic 
dictator does is buy a Mercedes.

343
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,113
It's like he's screwed right off the bat
as soon as he buys the Mercedes because 

344
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,480
what he's announcing is that personal 
mobility trumps everything and it's

345
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:58,670
only country in which the leadership has
managed to maintain a,

346
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,150
a control over who's allowed to drive or
not North Korea,

347
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,463
sorry,
Arabia bit too because they're not so 

348
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:09,614
thrilled about having their women drive,
which is a sad commentary on Saudi 

349
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,140
Arabia.

350
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,010
Um,
let us move on and,

351
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,090
and I want to raise another rule that 
really surprised me.

352
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:26,270
Rule number 37,
38 a do not bother children when they're

353
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,313
skateboarding.

354
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,270
It's always been a source of amazement 
to me.

355
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,020
The way that institutions,
businesses,

356
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,890
governments treat skateboarders.
It's like,

357
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,763
first of all,
if you ever sit and watch a group of 

358
00:20:43,151 --> 00:20:45,010
adolescent,
if they're usually boys,

359
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:46,900
not always skateboard,
it's,

360
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,730
you can't help but be struck with 
amazement about how brave they are.

361
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,870
Like outside of the St George Building 
here,

362
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,350
the kids will jump up on the metal 
railing that goes down on the steps,

363
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:02,344
on the cement steps.
They'll jump up on that with your 

364
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,970
skateboard and try to write it down.
It's like they fall off,

365
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,500
they fall off,
right onto the cement and with the sharp

366
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,300
edges and you know,
they all,

367
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,134
their friends laugh and they lay there 
and lose their breath and they gasp and 

368
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:18,100
Moan and then,
you know,

369
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:19,930
two minutes later they're up throwing it
again.

370
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:23,530
It's like,
it's so brave and they're so good at it.

371
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,140
And,
and it's harmless.

372
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:27,160
Yeah,
they might get hurt,

373
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,010
but that's hardly the point,
you know,

374
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean,
you can't be encased in Styrofoam.

375
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,843
It's a pathetic way live.
And those kids are brave and they're 

376
00:21:36,101 --> 00:21:41,101
trying to master something really 
difficult and all they get is grief.

377
00:21:41,231 --> 00:21:44,010
So for example,
outside my,

378
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,000
the building I work in here,
there are some,

379
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,923
some cement containers.
They're quite long and they lined the 

380
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:54,020
street,
there are trees in them and uh,

381
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,300
the skateboarders like to jump up on 
them and,

382
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,440
and of zip along the edge with their 
skateboard.

383
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:00,274
And um,
what the university has done about that 

384
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:04,490
is put all these metal,
um,

385
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,350
they're a little metal strips along the 
edge of the containers.

386
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,303
So the skateboarders can't do that.
And it just irritates me because first 

387
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:14,620
of all,
the metal strips or as ugly as sin,

388
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,460
they looked like they were put up by,
by a totalitarian state.

389
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,660
And second,
it's like,

390
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,840
leave the damn kids alone.
Let them play.

391
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,170
That's what they're doing.
They're playing and kids need to play.

392
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,250
So and that skateboarders,
they're not let them skate board.

393
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,084
They're not drinking.
They're not like they're not doing 

394
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:37,270
anything delinquent.
They're out there trying to master their

395
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,010
bodies and to be brave.
And,

396
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,933
and there's,
I think that irritates people who won't 

397
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,144
do that.
They look at those kids and there's the 

398
00:22:45,181 --> 00:22:47,550
part of them that's,
that's not right.

399
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:48,101
Things.
Oh,

400
00:22:48,101 --> 00:22:49,350
those little rats.
It's like,

401
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,980
no,
they're not a little wrapped.

402
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,690
They're brave.
And what they're doing is remarkable.

403
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:55,524
It's like gymnastics,
except they're not on a nice rubber 

404
00:22:58,561 --> 00:23:00,150
floor.
They're on cement.

405
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,260
They're brave.

406
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,060
What is the principle that the defendant
here as there,

407
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,130
is it important to have a correlation of
bravery,

408
00:23:09,131 --> 00:23:11,620
of physical bravery,
or is that it?

409
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,573
The importance of understanding and 
accepting that that good good life 

410
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,260
involves a certain degree of risk.

411
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,773
I think it's the good life also requires
a certain amount of ability to admire 

412
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:32,591
those people who take risks and plus 
they're not doing any harm.

413
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,431
Now,
you know,

414
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:36,020
someone might object,
well,

415
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,120
what about liability?
But my,

416
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,280
my,
my experience with liability is,

417
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:45,080
is that as soon as someone talks about 
liability,

418
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,603
you better be skeptical of their motives
because they're using their liability 

419
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:50,654
argument to abdicate their 
responsibility for participating in the 

420
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:59,180
necessary dangers of a civilized state.
The whole liability thing that's a,

421
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,000
that's a weasel his way out as far as 
I'm concerned.

422
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,533
So

423
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,800
is this the reason why you have the main
point of this,

424
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:09,150
uh,
uh,

425
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:12,280
and formulated to the rule of the way 
you have is,

426
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,030
is it because you have a sense that,
uh,

427
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,223
that we increasingly subject to a kind 
of the cautionary principle that the 

428
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,470
seminar society is preoccupied with too 
much risk and,

429
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:25,320
and,
and that,

430
00:24:25,321 --> 00:24:28,890
and the counselors asked to be in ways 
which are,

431
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,720
uh,
not too risky.

432
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,870
Yeah,
I think that's part of it.

433
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,713
I also think,
I think the other part of the two is 

434
00:24:35,281 --> 00:24:36,410
that,
you know,

435
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,240
like I said,
most of the time these skateboarders are

436
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:40,074
boys and they're like adolescent boys 
state and I think that admiration for 

437
00:24:44,431 --> 00:24:46,620
the sorts of things they're doing,
which is a kind of,

438
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,780
in a sense,
it's reckless,

439
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,793
reckless,
masculine courage that's sorely lacking 

440
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:53,850
in our society.
And you know,

441
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,430
people might object at,
that's my opinion.

442
00:24:56,431 --> 00:24:57,264
But I'll tell you,
I talk about this a fair bit in my 

443
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,870
classes,
like my class this week.

444
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:05,490
I showed the students a couple of clips 
from the lion king when Simba,

445
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,480
the lion king is growing up and trying 
to become braids.

446
00:25:09,481 --> 00:25:11,130
And um,
you know,

447
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:14,190
I have my students,
the boys in particular,

448
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:16,860
the young men coming up to me constantly
saying that,

449
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,723
you know,
they,

450
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,753
they just see no appreciation whatsoever
for what used to be termed masculine 

451
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:24,210
virtues anywhere in society.

452
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,910
And they're like,
they're,

453
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,850
it's not good for the.
I mean,

454
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:32,490
that one of them wrote me a letter this 
week stating exactly that,

455
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,960
you know,
they're hurt by it and,

456
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,993
and there's a resentment towards it.
And I see it really expressed in that 

457
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,370
attitude towards skateboard.
Is this like,

458
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:43,600
what's wrong with those kids are fine.
They're plus.

459
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,220
Plus.
The other thing I know is that play kids

460
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:51,910
have to play.
It's not playing isn't what,

461
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,960
what do you call it?
It's not of secondary importance.

462
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,040
Human beings have a place circuit.
It's,

463
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:58,874
it's part of being a mammal.
And one of the ways that human beings 

464
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,160
organize themselves at the highest level
of moral virtue is through play.

465
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,680
You know,
when those kids,

466
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,900
the kids that are skateboarding in their
groups,

467
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:12,734
you know,
they're evaluating each other for 

468
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:14,384
courage and bravery and they're watching
each other perform difficult physical 

469
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:18,884
app.
So they're extending their limits and 

470
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,380
it's,
you should be happy about that.

471
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:26,810
And if you just sit down and watch them 
for 10 minutes,

472
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,780
it's,
it's like warranty.

473
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,890
Like I said,
it's like watching gymnastics.

474
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:34,730
It's goal as far as I'm concerned,
goes skateboarders.

475
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,360
Uh,
Jordan,

476
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,733
we have now a half an hour.
I think this went very well for the 

477
00:26:41,071 --> 00:26:45,630
first time out.
I hope to be able to talk to you again.

478
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,290
We have only managed to talk about the 
three other rules.

479
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:54,150
They are 42 on a on an all,
so we've got 39 to go.

480
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,290
Plenty of material to talk about in the 
future,

481
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:01,590
so thank you and until next time,
great.

482
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,483
Nice talking to you.
