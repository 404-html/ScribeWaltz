1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,913
Well
you might as well start by writing down 

2
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,294
that url.
I'll show it to you again at the end of 

3
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,660
class.
That's where the syllabus is.

4
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,693
The syllabus will tell you pretty much 
everything you need to know about the 

5
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:33,680
class.
The,

6
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,140
there's a text,
this is it.

7
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,560
It consists of readings from a larger 
text.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,013
I use it because it's old,
but a lot of the theorists that we're 

9
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:52,400
going to talk about
are also old.

10
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,743
And so I found this particular text 
accurate and many of the people that 

11
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:04,070
we're going to talk about
are very,

12
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,690
uh,
very sophisticated views of personality.

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,633
And I think that it does you a 
disservice unless you read something 

14
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,891
that's sufficiently sophisticated so 
that you actually understand at least to

15
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:25,760
some degree what the people that were 
going to study,

16
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:30,650
we're talking about,
we might as well start,

17
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:34,340
I suppose with a definition of 
personality,

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,320
it's hard to define something that's 
that general because

19
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,753
when you're speaking about human beings,
it's not that simple to figure out what 

20
00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:49,510
constitutes personality and what 
constitutes something else.

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,393
But
so I'm going to hit at it from a couple 

22
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,584
of different perspectives.
And while I'm doing so I would like you 

23
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:02,950
also have to consider

24
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,270
the nature of what you're going to 
learn.

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,360
Human personality is essentially 
unfathomable.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,633
Human beings are unbelievably 
complicated and we're Nastad in systems 

27
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,444
that are also unbelievably complicated.
There are more patterns of connections 

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,233
between neurons in your brain than there
are subatomic particles in the universe 

29
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,043
by a substantial margin.
You can look up Gerald Edelman if you 

30
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:37,561
want to find out about that.
And so it's not unreasonable.

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,393
Could point out that you're the most 
complicated thing we know of by many 

32
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,674
orders of magnitude and the probability 
that you can understand yourself in 

33
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:54,850
anything approaching totality is 
extraordinarily low.

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,130
So this makes the study of personality 
something very

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,260
daring and hopeless and complicated.

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,353
Now we're going to cycle through a very 
large number of theorists and what 

37
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,660
you'll find is that although there are 
commonalities between them,

38
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,850
there are market differences.
And so then you might ask yourself,

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,003
well,
what's the point of studying this 

40
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:33,430
sequence of theorists and ideas?
If there's no point of agreement between

41
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,264
them?
I would say first there are points of 

42
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,674
agreement between them.
Although personality hasn't advanced to 

43
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,864
the point where I would say that we have
a margin theory that's free of internal 

44
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,690
contradictions.
But I would also say that

45
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,450
personality is a hybrid discipline.
It's partly science,

46
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,813
but it's partly engineering.
The clinical element of it I would say 

47
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,424
is more like engineering.
And what engineers do is try to do 

48
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,364
things.
They try to make something happen and 

49
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:15,574
they are informed by theory.
But the point is still to build 

50
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
something.
And when you're working as a clinical 

51
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,894
psychologist and,
and most of the initial theorists that 

52
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,624
we'll discuss for the first little more 
than a third to a half of the course or 

53
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:29,824
clinical theorists,
they're trying to build something and 

54
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,310
they're dealing with very,
very difficult

55
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,640
conceptual problems because

56
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,873
they're either trying to cure mental 
disorders or maybe even unhappiness and 

57
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:51,760
trying to bring about health.
And the problem with that is that

58
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,093
it's not a straight forward thing to 
define a mental disorder from a 

59
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,354
scientific perspective because what's 
healthy mentally and what's not is 

60
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:09,061
partly social judgment.
And it's partly socially constructed and

61
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,734
it partly has to do with norms.
And it partly has to do with ideals 

62
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:20,170
because you might also say that to be 
healthy is to be normal,

63
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,740
but you could also say that to be 
healthy is to be ideal.

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,233
And then of course you run into the 
problem of having to conceptualize an 

65
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:33,721
ideal and it isn't self evident that 
science is capable of conceptualizing an

66
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:41,941
ideal because ideals tend to fall into 
the domain of moral judgments,

67
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,053
say,
or philosophical judgements rather than 

68
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,610
scientific judgements per se.

69
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,263
So what I would say to you is that
it would be worthwhile to approach this 

70
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:02,390
course as if you were an engineer of the
human spirit,

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,590
an engineer of your own spirit to begin 
with,

72
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,630
but also an engineer of the spirits of 
other people.

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Because as you interact with other 
people,

74
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,720
you inevitably tell them what you want 
and what you don't want.

75
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,180
When they give you what you want
and what you admire,

76
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:29,180
you respond positively to them.
You pay attention to them,

77
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,520
you smile at them,
you focus,

78
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,000
you focus your thoughts on them,
you interact with them.

79
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,710
Then you reward them for acting in a 
particular manner.

80
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:42,890
And when they don't respond the way that
you want,

81
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,993
then you punish them with a lock or by 
turning away or by rejecting their 

82
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,220
friendship or when you were a child by 
refusing to play for them,

83
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,440
play with them,
and so

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,870
we're engaged in the co creation of 
personalities,

85
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,320
our own and others and that also brings 
up the same question,

86
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,140
what is it that we are all collectively 
trying to be

87
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,780
and trying to create?

88
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,400
Okay.

89
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,233
I suspect that you all have the 
experience of falling short of the 

90
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,824
ideal,
an ideal that you hold for yourself or 

91
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:30,921
an ideal that other people hold for you.
I suspect that you all feel the negative

92
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:34,560
consequences of falling short of that 
ideal.

93
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,483
Freud would conceptualize that as the 
superego imposing its judgment on the 

94
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,230
ego,
you being ego,

95
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,000
the superego being
a hybrid,

96
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,853
I suppose of
external external forces and also your 

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,330
internalization of those judgments and 
forces.

98
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,210
Now,
personality per se I would say

99
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,473
has these elements of ideal and how 
structural elements in oil as well and 

100
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,970
we're going to talk about those more in 
the second half of the class.

101
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,630
The structural elements can be lined up 
and outlined more scientifically.

102
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,380
The second half of the cow class 
concentrates more on

103
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,953
physiology,
brain physiology and on statistical 

104
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:38,570
approaches to the description of 
personality.

105
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,203
Um,
I suppose you might say that that 

106
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,890
outlines the territory.

107
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,870
The course is called personality and its
transformations because

108
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,100
we have personalities.
That's who you are now.

109
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,700
But our are also capable of 
transformation of change.

110
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,700
I mean obviously we think about that is 
learning.

111
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,143
Um,
some of that might be regarded as 

112
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,230
factual learning and some of it might be
regarded as learning how to perceive and

113
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:14,874
behave.
And I would say that the clinical 

114
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,770
psychologists that will cover to begin 
with

115
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,253
are much more concerned with the nature 
of the implicit structures that shape 

116
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:35,481
your perceptions and also the implicit 
structures that shape your behaviors and

117
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:43,101
how they're integrated in relationship 
to your negative emotion,

118
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,873
health and wellbeing.
Whereas the thinkers in the second half 

119
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,483
are more concerned about laying out the 
structural elements of those features 

120
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:59,010
and relating them to underlying say,
mechanistic phenomena,

121
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,730
making the assumption which seems 
warranted,

122
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,440
that there's some relationship between 
your personality and the manner in which

123
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,400
your brain functions.

124
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,003
I'm going to try
to provide you with a Meta narrative 

125
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,600
that will help you unite these different
theories.

126
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,393
I've often found it useful when I'm 
trying to remember something to have a 

127
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:23,604
story to hang the fact on.
Otherwise you're faced with the 

128
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,550
necessity of doing nothing but 
memorization.

129
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:30,384
And it isn't obvious to me that 
memorization actually constitutes 

130
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,920
knowledge.
Um,

131
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,490
what constitutes knowledge is that 
generation of a cognitive structure that

132
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:45,921
enables you to conduct yourself more 
appropriately in life.

133
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,633
And so I suppose you might say that of 
course in psychology you could argue 

134
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,494
that of course in psychology,
especially in personality is of course 

135
00:10:55,651 --> 00:10:56,484
in applied wisdom as well.
Assuming that wisdom is in part your 

136
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,110
capacity to understand yourselves so 
that you don't,

137
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,720
so that you don't present too much of an
intolerable mystery to yourself.

138
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,170
And also to understand others so that 
you can predict their behavior,

139
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,430
understand their motivations and 
negotiate with them,

140
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,163
listen to them and formulate joint games
with them so that you can integrate 

141
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,860
yourself reasonably well with another 
person,

142
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,920
with a family and in society.

143
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,143
Well the structural elements of 
personality might be regarded as the 

144
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:44,734
implicit structures that govern your 
perception and that tilt you towards 

145
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,174
certain kinds of behaviors.
I can give you some examples can talk 

146
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
about the big five model just briefly.
The big five personality model is a 

147
00:12:00,071 --> 00:12:02,350
statistical model which we'll cover in 
detail,

148
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
trained by trait part,
partly during the second half of the 

149
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,744
course.
The way that the big five was generated 

150
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:15,160
was that it's dread being generated over
about 50 years.

151
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,863
That personality psychologists gathered 
together adjectives within the English 

152
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:26,131
language first that were used to 
describe human beings as many adjectives

153
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:27,904
is they could collect and then subjected
them to a process called factor 

154
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,704
analysis.
And what factor analysis does is enable 

155
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:35,134
you statistically to determine in some 
sense how similar adjectives are to one 

156
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:40,181
another.
So,

157
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:41,014
for example,
if you gave a thousand people a list of 

158
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:48,304
adjectives to describe themselves with 
and one of the adjectives was happy and 

159
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,444
another of the adjectives was social,
you'd find that those who rated 

160
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:01,300
themselves high on happy would also rate
themselves high on social.

161
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,403
And those who rated themselves low on 
happy would also rate themselves low on 

162
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:06,124
social.
And by looking at those patterns of 

163
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,574
Covariation,
you can determine what the essential 

164
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:12,814
dimensions are of human personality.
One of the dimensions is roughly 

165
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,290
happiness.
That's extroversion.

166
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,840
Another dimension is neuroticism.
It's a negative emotion dimension.

167
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:30,841
So if you ask someone if they're anxious
and they score high,

168
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:32,284
say on a scale of one to seven,
they're also likely to score high on 

169
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:36,274
another item that says that they're sad.
And it turns out that negative emotions 

170
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,704
clump together.
And so that people who experience more 

171
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,183
of one negative emotion have a 
propensity to experience more of all of 

172
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,264
them.
There's another dimension called 

173
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,054
agreeableness.
And agreeable people are self 

174
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,570
sacrificing,
compassionate and polite.

175
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,240
If you're dealing with an agreeable 
person,

176
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,050
they don't like conflict,
they care for other people.

177
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,453
Um,
if you're dealing with an agreeable 

178
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:08,644
person,
they're likely to put your concerns 

179
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,100
ahead of theirs.

180
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,653
They're non competitive and cooperative.
It's a dimension where women are women 

181
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:19,604
score more highly than men on 
agreeableness across cultures including 

182
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:23,734
those cultures where the largest steps 
have been taken towards producing an 

183
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,850
egalitarian social circumstance like 
Scandinavia.

184
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:31,684
Actually the gender differences in 
personality there are larger than they 

185
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,760
are anywhere else.
Um,

186
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,403
another trait is conscientiousness.
Conscientiousness is an excellent trait 

187
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:45,940
if you want to do well in school and in 
work,

188
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,040
especially if you're a manager and 
administrator.

189
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,160
I can't say we understand a lot about 
conscientiousness,

190
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:55,400
although it,
it reliably emerges from factor analytic

191
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,920
studies of adjective groups across 
different countries.

192
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,000
Conscientious people are diligent,
industrious and orderly.

193
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,930
Their orderliness tilts them towards 
political conservatism by the way,

194
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,780
because it turns out that your inbuilt 
temperament,

195
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,643
your inbuilt personality,
which constitutes a set of filters 

196
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,814
through which you view the world also 
alters the manner in which you process 

197
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:21,950
information and influences the way that 
you vote.

198
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,900
And so you might say,
and I do believe that this is true,

199
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:27,500
are we've been doing a lot of research 
on this as of late.

200
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,960
The more accurate a measure you take of 
someone's political beliefs,

201
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,530
the more you find that personality is 
what's predicting them.

202
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,430
And I think that's a reasonable thing to
think about because you know,

203
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,750
you have to have to figure out ways of 
simplifying the world,

204
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,550
right?
Because you just can't do everything.

205
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:48,983
And so people are specialized,
they have specialized niches that they 

206
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,434
occupy.
You can think about them as social 

207
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:56,100
niches.
A niche is a place where your particular

208
00:15:56,101 --> 00:16:00,690
skills would serve to maintain you.
And so if you're extroverted,

209
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,590
you're going to look for a social niche 
because you like to be around people.

210
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,663
And if you're introverted,
you're going to spend much more time on 

211
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:09,120
your own.
And so if you're an introverted person,

212
00:16:09,121 --> 00:16:09,954
for example,
you're going to want a job where you're 

213
00:16:12,901 --> 00:16:13,734
not selling and where you're not 
surrounded by groups of people who are 

214
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:18,840
making social demands on you all the 
time because it will wear you out.

215
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,230
Whereas if you're extroverted,
that's just exactly what you want.

216
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,663
And so the extrovert sees the world as a
place of social opportunity and the 

217
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:31,620
introverts sees the world as a place to 
retreat from and spend time alone.

218
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,960
And it turns out that both of those 
modes of being are valid.

219
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,000
The issue,
at least to some degree,

220
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:39,834
is whether or not you're fortunate 
enough to match your temperament with 

221
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,484
the demands of the environment.
And I suppose also whether you're 

222
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:47,274
fortunate enough,
fortunate enough so that you're born in 

223
00:16:49,861 --> 00:16:50,694
an era where there actually is a niche 
for your particular temperament because 

224
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,880
it isn't necessarily the case that that 
will be the case.

225
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,043
Imagine that all of these temperamental 
dimensions very because of evolutionary 

226
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,930
pressure,
right?

227
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:05,880
So there's a distribution of 
extroversion,

228
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,730
a normal distribution.
Most people are somewhere in the middle.

229
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:10,980
And then as you go out towards the 
extremes,

230
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:11,814
there are fewer and fewer people.
And what that means is that on average 

231
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,463
across large spans of time,
there have been environments that match 

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,120
every single position on that 
distribution with most,

233
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,310
most of the environments matching the 
center.

234
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,144
Because otherwise we wouldn't have 
evolved that way and so sometimes being 

235
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:34,110
really extroverted is going to work well
for you in a minority of environments,

236
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:37,380
a minority of niches and sometimes it's 
just going to be a catastrophe.

237
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,000
I suspect for example,
that if you live in a tyrannical society

238
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,610
where any sign of

239
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,010
of,
of,

240
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,963
of

241
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,970
personally oriented activity is likely 
to get you in trouble,

242
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:55,440
that being extroverted and low in 
neuroticism wouldn't be a very good idea

243
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,333
because you're going to be mouthy and 
happy and saying a lot of things unable 

244
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,820
to keep your thoughts to yourself and 
you're going to be relatively fearless.

245
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,713
Now I don't know that for sure because 
we haven't done the studies that 

246
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:10,350
precisely match temperamental proclivity
to environmental demand,

247
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,620
but you get what I mean,
so conscientious people.

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,740
Anyways,
conscientious people are industrious and

249
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,170
orderly.
We knew a little bit about orderliness.

250
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,610
It seems to be associated strangely 
enough with disgust sensitivity,

251
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:28,930
which I suppose isn't that surprising.
You know,

252
00:18:28,931 --> 00:18:32,490
if you take an orderly person,
then you put them in a messy kitchen,

253
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,773
they respond with disgust and want 
nothing more than to straighten it all 

254
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:38,484
out and organize it and clean it.
And there's tremendous variability in 

255
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:44,580
orderliness.
And as I said,

256
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,590
orderliness predicts political 
conservatism.

257
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:48,930
It's not the only thing,
but it's certainly one of the things.

258
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,773
MMM.

259
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,780
The correlation between 
conscientiousness and grades,

260
00:18:56,781 --> 00:19:00,540
it's about 0.4.
It's about 16% of the variance.

261
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,663
It's,
it's the second best predictor of 

262
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:06,590
university grades after intelligence.
And we'll talk about intelligence during

263
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:11,120
this course to intelligence is actually 
a relatively straight forward concept.

264
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,320
I don't think I'll get into it today,
but conscientious people,

265
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,243
their industriousness and their 
orderliness makes them schedule their 

266
00:19:18,501 --> 00:19:20,930
time so they make efficient use of their
time.

267
00:19:20,931 --> 00:19:22,640
They use schedules and that sort of 
thing.

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,050
We haven't been able to figure out 
anything about the underlying biology or

269
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:27,884
psychology of industriousness.
We've tried really dozens and dozens of 

270
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,624
tests attempting to find a laboratory 
measure on which industrious people do 

271
00:19:38,091 --> 00:19:39,920
better.
And we failed completely.

272
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,380
And there's no animal models of 
industriousness either.

273
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,573
And so I would say it's great mystery 
that remains at the heart of trade 

274
00:19:46,281 --> 00:19:47,900
psychology.
Um,

275
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,510
and maybe it's a human specific 
category,

276
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:51,344
you know,
I mean you can think of sled dogs maybe 

277
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:53,863
of being industrious and maybe it may be
sheep dogs and animals that work like 

278
00:19:56,991 --> 00:19:57,824
that,
but of course they've been trained by 

279
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,120
human beings.

280
00:19:59,120 --> 00:19:59,953
So,
but it isn't obvious that animals are 

281
00:20:02,811 --> 00:20:03,644
industrious the same way we are.
I mean industriousness involves 

282
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,910
sacrificing the present for the future,
something like that.

283
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,740
And it seems like you have to be able to
conceptualize time in order to sacrifice

284
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:19,520
the present for the future.
One of the things that I would recommend

285
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,343
that you do as students in this course 
and maybe in every course speaking of 

286
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:26,564
industriousness is come up with a plan 
of attack for the course and use a 

287
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:31,430
scheduler.
You know,

288
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,510
if you treat your university career like
a fulltime job,

289
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,853
you're much more likely to succeed.
And if you keep up on the readings and 

290
00:20:40,221 --> 00:20:43,730
you keep up on the,
on the essays and all of that,

291
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,953
then you're much less likely as well to 
fall into despair when you get too far 

292
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,044
behind.
Using a google calendar or something 

293
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:52,834
like that to organize a schedule for the
entire semester at the beginning of the 

294
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:57,694
semester can be invaluable,
especially if you're not very 

295
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,520
industriousness,
very industrious because it can keep you

296
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:04,150
on track.

297
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:07,630
And one of the things we know about 
industrious people is that they are very

298
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:11,440
good at using schedules and planning the
use of their time.

299
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,100
And so I would like to say that you 
should all be smarter,

300
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:16,960
but I don't know how you could be 
smarter.

301
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,110
We don't know anything about how to 
improve intelligence.

302
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:20,944
And I suppose we don't really know 
anything about how to improve 

303
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:23,974
industriousness either.
But I can tell you that people who are 

304
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,214
industrious come up with a strategy for 
solving the problem that's ahead of 

305
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,224
them.
And then they do whatever they can to 

306
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:35,530
stick to the strategy.
And so for example,

307
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,940
if you sat down today or tomorrow for a 
couple of hours,

308
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:43,120
three hours and you filled in a google 
calendar,

309
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:48,121
whatever you happen to use with a 
strategy for studying and a list of when

310
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:50,380
all your assignments are due and all of 
that,

311
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,930
and when you're going to sit down and 
study,

312
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,633
then you won't be in a position where 
you have to cram for 10 hours a day 

313
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,090
hopelessly right before you know an 
important exam.

314
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,520
It's also a very ineffective way of 
studying.

315
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,750
By the way,
I'm being,

316
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:07,240
first of all,
people who cram for 10 hours say they're

317
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:09,550
studying for 10 hours,
but they rarely are because,

318
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:13,990
well,
I can't study for 10 hours.

319
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,650
I don't have the power of concentration 
that would enable me to do that for that

320
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:18,484
prolonged period of time.
I can manage about three hours of 

321
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:21,604
intense intellectual activity before I'm
pretty done and it's also the case that 

322
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:26,974
if you study and then sleep and then 
study and then sleep and then study and 

323
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:31,060
then sleep,
you space it out,

324
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,340
then you're much more likely to 
remember.

325
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,863
It's also much more likely that you're 
much more likely to remember if you try 

326
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:38,584
to recall the material.
And so highlighting in that sort of 

327
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:43,150
thing isn't very useful.
But reading,

328
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,163
closing the book,
summarizing what you've read without 

329
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,300
opening the damn book,
that's useful.

330
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,673
And the reason for that is that you're 
practicing remembering and that's what 

331
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:56,950
you have to practice.
If you're practicing memorization,

332
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:57,784
you have to practice remembering.
You don't just go over the thing over 

333
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,564
and over.
That'll help you with recognition 

334
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:04,450
memory,
but some,

335
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,040
but it won't help you with recall 
memory.

336
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,950
Anyways,
the last trade is openness.

337
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,383
Openness is a creativity trait.
It's also associated with intelligence 

338
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:16,750
in that intelligent people,
and I'm speaking technically of Iq,

339
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,590
tend to be higher in,
tend to be more creative,

340
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,513
which is hardly surprising.
Creative people are more likely to be 

341
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:27,470
liberal politically by the way.
Um,

342
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,460
they like novelty.
They like aesthetics,

343
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:32,890
they like fiction,
they like movies.

344
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:33,724
They like,
are they like poetry there something 

345
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:40,270
about them that grants them.
Anaesthetic sensitivity and,

346
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,590
and that's,
uh,

347
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,040
that's an inbuilt trait.
And um,

348
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,730
it's not the case by the way,
that everyone's creative.

349
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,870
In fact,
far from it.

350
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,743
Ah,
we've used the creative achievement 

351
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,360
questionnaire to,
to measure people's creativity.

352
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:55,220
I'll talk to you about that later in the
class.

353
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,503
And the creative achievement 
questionnaire takes 13 dimensions of 

354
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:00,770
creativity.
So,

355
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,760
you know,
writing,

356
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:03,500
dancing,
acting,

357
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,650
scientific investigation,
entrepreneurial activity,

358
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,970
architectural activity,
uh,

359
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,540
cooking.
Um,

360
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,370
there's a,
there's a handful of others singing,

361
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,420
et cetera.
You know,

362
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,254
the sorts of things that you would 
assume that people could be creative 

363
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:18,344
about.
And then it asks people to rate 

364
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:21,104
themselves on a scale from one to 10 on 
their level of achievement with regards 

365
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,280
to all those creative domains.
With zero being,

366
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,850
I have no training or proficiency in 
this area,

367
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:32,684
and 70% of people score zero across the 
entire creative achievement 

368
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:40,160
questionnaire.
A tiny proportion of people are outliers

369
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:40,994
way out.
They're creative in many dimensions 

370
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:45,180
simultaneously and exceptionally 
creative.

371
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,990
It turns out,
as you'll find out that that pattern,

372
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:52,010
which is called a pareto distribution,
where most people stack up at zero and a

373
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:55,010
few people are way out on the creative 
end,

374
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,800
characterizes all sorts of 
distributions,

375
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,110
like the distribution of money,
for example,

376
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,290
which is why 1% of the people have the 
overwhelming majority of the money.

377
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,393
It's a different 1% across time.
It he'd like it churns and you're much 

378
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:14,210
more likely to be in the 1% if you're 
older,

379
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,763
logically enough,
because one of the things you do as you 

380
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,040
age is you trade youth for money.
If you're fortunate,

381
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't think the trade is really worth 
it,

382
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:27,740
but that's the best you've got.
So anyways,

383
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,233
those particular traits,
you can think of those as ways that you 

384
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,650
simplify the world,
right?

385
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,813
There's lots of different places that 
you can act in the world and there's 

386
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,640
lots of different ways you can look at 
it and survive.

387
00:25:40,641 --> 00:25:44,120
That's why you can be a plumber and a 
lawyer and an engineer,

388
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,190
and those all work,
right?

389
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,203
Even though they're very different modes
of being and you can have different 

390
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:50,564
personalities and survive as long as 
you're capable of finding the place 

391
00:25:55,761 --> 00:26:00,761
where your particular filters and 
behavioral proclivities match the demand

392
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:01,910
of the environment.

393
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,770
And a huge part I would say of 
successful adaptation is precisely that.

394
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,800
Now there are other elements of 
personality too.

395
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,410
One of the things that I've been struck 
by,

396
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,303
and this is actually one of the 
criticisms I have of the psychoanalysts 

397
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:17,204
and the clinicians in general,
even though I have great admiration for 

398
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,504
them and would say that what they have 
to say is very much worth listening to 

399
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,430
is that it's not obvious that your 
personality is inside you.

400
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,543
You know,
you think you know a human being is a 

401
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:36,320
strange multilevel thing and you might 
ask yourself,

402
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:38,270
well for example,
no,

403
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,510
is your mother more a part of you then 
your arm or maybe even more precisely is

404
00:26:44,191 --> 00:26:47,310
your child more a part of you then your 
arm?

405
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,683
It certainly people will do drastically 
self sacrificing things to maintain the 

406
00:26:53,131 --> 00:26:55,770
lives of their children.
And so you're,

407
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,440
you're a person and you're made out of 
all sub sort of sub components of,

408
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,413
of a person,
none of which you can see when you look 

409
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,040
at a person,
all the complicated machinery inside you

410
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,180
that makes you who you are.

411
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,013
And then outside of that,
of course here nested in all sorts of 

412
00:27:10,351 --> 00:27:13,080
complex systems.
So you're part of a family and,

413
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,840
and you're part of a community and 
that's part of a province.

414
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:16,674
And that's part of the state.
And that's part of an international 

415
00:27:19,261 --> 00:27:21,750
consortium of states.
And that's part of an ecosystem.

416
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:26,751
And how you make a distinction between 
you and the systems that you're embedded

417
00:27:29,311 --> 00:27:32,850
in is also an extraordinary difficulty.
And when it,

418
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,640
and one of the things that you have to 
do as a clinical psychologist,

419
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:36,474
for example,
if you're trying to diagnose someone 

420
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:39,570
with depression,
is that you think,

421
00:27:39,571 --> 00:27:41,850
well,
this person's dreadfully unhappy.

422
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,620
Or you can think about that as a problem
with their psychological adjustment.

423
00:27:46,621 --> 00:27:47,490
You know,
the way that they're,

424
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:48,930
they're learning,
looking at the world.

425
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,370
But if you look at the epidemiological 
literature,

426
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,204
for example,
one of the things that you find is that 

427
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,713
very many people have a first depressive
episode after something genuinely 

428
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,260
terrible has happened to them,
right?

429
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:05,094
They've lost someone or they've become 
injured or or they've become unemployed 

430
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:09,294
because unemployment is a terrible shock
to people and it's not precisely self 

431
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,700
evident that you can consider someone 
who's unhappy and desperate because they

432
00:28:17,701 --> 00:28:20,280
no longer have a job depressed.

433
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,890
They're certainly sad and they're not 
doing very well,

434
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:25,724
but the fact that they no longer have an
income is actually something with 

435
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,883
dramatic practical consequences and 
treating that as if it's a mental 

436
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:39,941
disorder seems to be counter productive.
It's also the case for example,

437
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:44,420
that if you're,
if someone comes into to talk to you and

438
00:28:44,421 --> 00:28:45,254
they're very upset and they may manifest
the signs of say an anxiety disorder or 

439
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:49,934
again,
depression or or other other clinical 

440
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:53,024
features for that matter,
you have to do a careful analysis of 

441
00:28:56,421 --> 00:28:59,120
their manner in which they're embedded 
in their family.

442
00:28:59,121 --> 00:28:59,954
Because,
and this is something that we'll talk 

443
00:29:01,431 --> 00:29:02,264
about quite

444
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,510
thoroughly when we come to discussing 
Freud,

445
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:07,500
is that,
well,

446
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:08,334
you know,
it's not like everybody's families are 

447
00:29:09,401 --> 00:29:11,970
necessarily particularly happy places to
be.

448
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,013
You know,
I mean,

449
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,003
human beings are very dependent.
We have a very long period of 

450
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,980
dependency,
partly because we're so cortically hyper

451
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:20,814
developed.
It takes a very long time to program us 

452
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:23,514
into something that's vaguely capable of
maneuvering on its own and that 

453
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:28,464
produces,
of course the very tight familial bonds 

454
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,104
that we all,
that we all desperately require because 

455
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:36,870
who wants to be alone in the world?
But it also,

456
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,543
it also exposes us to the probability of
becoming entangled into even 

457
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,314
multigenerational family pathology.
And it isn't obvious always and 

458
00:29:48,911 --> 00:29:49,744
certainly hasn't been to me when I've 
seen my clients that the fundamental 

459
00:29:53,021 --> 00:29:58,021
problem with the client is the client.
Sometimes the fundamental problem is

460
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,293
is the family
and and perhaps that person has been 

461
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,244
identified as the problem person.
It's rather convenient for everyone who 

462
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,190
was involved to make that 
presupposition.

463
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,480
It's also the case that this is the 
Friday and idea.

464
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,340
Fundamentally,
this is the depaul idea,

465
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,174
that it's very easy for people to become
over dependent on their parents and for 

466
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,724
the parents to facilitate that.
And then for the primary developmental 

467
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:32,470
problem for the individual,
in fact,

468
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:33,304
to become free of the interfering 
elements of the family so that they can 

469
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,060
exist as independent individuals.
Well,

470
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,613
and then of course there are cultural 
variations in that that make that 

471
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,913
proposition complex,
but that's a fundamental tenant say a 

472
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:56,641
Friday in psychology,
a lot of the clinical psychologists,

473
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,320
all of whom,
yet we're going to study,

474
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,573
have a pronounced Western orientation.
One of the fundamental presuppositions 

475
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:05,554
is that part of the hallmark of positive
psychological development is the 

476
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:14,530
creation of an individual that's capable
of acting independently.

477
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,480
And that's,
I would say,

478
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,314
an implicit ideal that lurks at the 
bottom of the clinical presuppositions 

479
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,690
of all the theorists that are classic 
psychologists.

480
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,800
So
now it's a very old picture.

481
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,490
It's Jonah emerging from the whale.
It's a variant of a,

482
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,660
a myth.
The Myth is the dragon myth.

483
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,553
I suppose the Dragon Myth is that 
there's a dragon that lives under the 

484
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,864
ground that's eternal and now and then 
it rises out of the ground to threaten 

485
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,044
the state and someone within the state 
determines to go confront the dragon 

486
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,693
voluntarily and does so,
and then brings back something of great 

487
00:32:06,481 --> 00:32:07,314
value.
Sometimes if the the hero is generally 

488
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,014
male,
sometimes the thing of great value is a 

489
00:32:14,941 --> 00:32:19,020
female that the dragon has kidnapped.
That's a St George Story.

490
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,110
And sometimes it's gold and other 
treasure,

491
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:23,650
like in the story of the hobbit.

492
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,540
Okay,

493
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,840
story that you all know very well.
It's a classic hero story.

494
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:29,674
And the hero's story is another 
fundamental element of the clinical 

495
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:35,284
theories.
I would say it's predicated on the idea 

496
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:42,631
that you learn through voluntary contact
with that,

497
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,893
that frightens or disgusts you.
And now it's a hallmark of 

498
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:51,770
psychoanalytic theory.
Young Carl Young,

499
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,633
who will discuss in detail said his 
primary dictum was in steer Colinas 

500
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,500
invented tour,
which I'm sure I massacring because it's

501
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:01,334
Latin,
but it meant in filth that will be 

502
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:06,410
found.
And one of the hallmarks of the clinical

503
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:11,180
theories is that within the confines of 
everyone's experience,

504
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,223
and you can think about this as 
experience out in the world or 

505
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:18,620
experience in the unconscious mind,
there are

506
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,240
dirty little secrets let's say,
and skeletons and

507
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:27,813
dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse
and memories of pathological behavior 

508
00:33:34,671 --> 00:33:35,504
and failures of courage that you leave 
you undeveloped perhaps out of 

509
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:42,254
avoidance,
and that the psychoanalytic process is 

510
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:46,394
precisely the careful encounter with 
those forgotten and and repressed 

511
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:58,241
elements of the self in the hope that a 
clear encounter will redeem them,

512
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,123
unite them with the remainder of your 
personality and make you make you 

513
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,130
stronger in consequence.

514
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,623
And I would say that that's just a 
variant of the manner in which human 

515
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,284
beings learn.
And we'll talk about this more in 

516
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:18,560
relationship to piaget because you 
always learn when you're wrong,

517
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,713
which is very annoying.
Now what do you learn when you're 

518
00:34:23,121 --> 00:34:25,400
correct you,
you're walking in the world,

519
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,234
you're operating in the world,
you have a sense of what you want to 

520
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:30,104
have happen.
You're always looking at the world 

521
00:34:32,301 --> 00:34:34,370
through this sense of what you want to 
have happen.

522
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,780
You're acting so that what you want to 
have happen will happen.

523
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,650
And when it happens,
well then you're happy because,

524
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,770
well first of all,
you get what you want and that's good.

525
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,693
Maybe depending on what you want.
But it's also good because if you get 

526
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:53,990
what you want when you act,
then it turns out that your model of how

527
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,700
to act is valid,
right?

528
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,923
The outcome that you get,
what you want indicates no error on the 

529
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,334
part of your model.
But it's very frequently the case that 

530
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,720
when you act to get what you want,
you don't get what you want.

531
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:13,400
And then that's unpleasant because you 
don't get what you want.

532
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,683
But it's even more unpleasant because it
brings with it the hint of a suggestion 

533
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,973
that the manner in which you're 
construing the world is incorrect at 

534
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:26,600
some indeterminant level.
So for example,

535
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:31,490
if you tell a party,
tell a joke at a party,

536
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,930
you presume that people will attend.
And then when they hear the joke,

537
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,033
they will laugh.
And then if you tell the joke and it 

538
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:43,890
goes flat or even worse,
disgusts and offends people,

539
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,690
then you're going to be taken aback.
And that's partly because you didn't get

540
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,910
what you want and that's not so good,
but it's,

541
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,740
but it's more because there's something 
wrong with the way you conceptualize the

542
00:35:55,741 --> 00:36:00,600
situation and then you're faced with a 
problem and the problem is the emergence

543
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:03,090
of a domain of the unknown.

544
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,370
It's like,
well what kind of mistake did you make?

545
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,590
Maybe you're not as funny as you think 
you are.

546
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,020
Not.
That could be a big problem.

547
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,030
Maybe you're not around people that who 
are the way you think they are.

548
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,940
Maybe they don't like you as much as you
thought they liked you.

549
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:18,774
I mean the,
the potential for various paranoid 

550
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:23,274
thoughts of increasing severity to come 
welling up at you in a situation where 

551
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:28,614
you make a,
even a trivial social mistake is quite 

552
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,260
broad.
And when you make an error of that sort,

553
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:35,843
you have to face it and sort through all
the possibilities so that you can find 

554
00:36:39,451 --> 00:36:40,284
out what it was that you did wrong and 
how to retool it so that in the future 

555
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,700
you don't make the same mistake.
And that requires,

556
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,810
well that requires in some sense what 
you might describe as a journey into the

557
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:52,740
belly of the beast.

558
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,603
The beast being that place where things 
have fallen apart and where you're 

559
00:36:56,671 --> 00:37:00,450
overwhelmed with negative emotion and 
chaos and confusion.

560
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,284
And that's a very old story.
That's the story of the journey to the 

561
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:06,780
underworld.
And the hero is the person who makes the

562
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:07,614
voluntary journey to the underworld to 
collect what's been languishing down 

563
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:12,264
there.
And that's the basic motif of 

564
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,240
psychoanalytic theory.
I would say it's the basic motif in some

565
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:23,241
sense of clinical practice because one 
of the things that you do as a clinician

566
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,070
is find out what people are afraid of 
and what they're avoiding.

567
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,790
And that can be in their past or in 
their present or in their future.

568
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,493
Break it down into smaller pieces and 
help them devise strategies of approach 

569
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:40,224
and mastery and that improves the 
quality of their personality and helps 

570
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,180
develop them into people who won't make 
the same mistakes over and over again.

571
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,650
All right,
so well,

572
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,150
why these this plethora of tools?
Well,

573
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:05,151
I said in some sense being a personality
psychologist is like being an engineer.

574
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,393
You're trying to build better people.
And you might say that if you're a 

575
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:12,294
carpenter or a mechanic,
that your ability to fix a vehicle or 

576
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,520
build a house is dependent on your 
proficiency with regards to the use of a

577
00:38:23,521 --> 00:38:26,640
multitude of tools.
And so then you might say,

578
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:27,474
well,
the more tools you have at your 

579
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:28,884
disposal,
the more likely it is that you're going 

580
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:36,861
to manage things properly.
And so what I would like to offer you is

581
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:40,480
the possibility that what you're going 
to encounter in this course

582
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,843
is a series of sophisticated conceptual 
tools that will help you understand 

583
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:52,150
yourself better and therefore better 
orient yourself in the world.

584
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,193
I regard this course as intensely 
practical and that's because I believe 

585
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:02,701
that you have nothing to rely on in your
life that's more crucial to your success

586
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,323
as you move through life,
then your character and your 

587
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,640
personality,
that's what you bring to every situation

588
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,480
and the more sophisticated you are in 
relationship to yourself and others,

589
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:19,923
the more you understand people,
the deeper you understand the nature of 

590
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:24,364
your own being,
the more likely it is that you're going 

591
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:27,964
to proceed through your life in a manner
that will make you pleased to exist 

592
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,400
rather than displeased to exist.

593
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,223
I've collected the writings of people 
that I regard as of in comparable 

594
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,690
brilliant.
They're difficult to understand.

595
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,003
Their concepts are complex,
but it's not surprising because the 

596
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:51,964
subject matter is complex and vital and 
so it requires work and I would say try 

597
00:39:57,641 --> 00:39:58,474
to keep up on the readings if you would.
It's going to make the course much more 

598
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,980
much richer for you.
And I would say because people often ask

599
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:08,110
me,
well how should I read for this course?

600
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:13,230
Cause there's a lot of reading and the 
answer is read as if it matters.

601
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,573
That's the right answer.
Don't be thinking about how it's going 

602
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:18,844
to be tested.
If you do the readings and you come to 

603
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:20,944
the lectures,
then the tests aren't particularly 

604
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,243
difficult.
But you should read the readings as if 

605
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:32,170
the person is writing about you and you 
should try to understand what the person

606
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,810
says because it's another tool for you 
to use.

607
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,110
And I would say,
well with my clients,

608
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,273
you know I use the approaches of one 
theorist for one client and the 

609
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:43,720
approaches of another theorist for 
another client.

610
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,793
It seems to me to depend to some degree 
actually on the temperament of the 

611
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:49,510
client.
I found for example,

612
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:52,060
that people who are very high in 
openness,

613
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,923
which is the creativity dimension,
are quite amenable to a young Ian 

614
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,440
Approach.
Whereas people who are more practical,

615
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:00,274
conscientious,
low and openness are much more amenable 

616
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,453
to a behaviorist approach.
We don't really know enough about 

617
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:10,330
psychology yet to match treatment to 
temperament,

618
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,530
but those are the some of the things 
that I've experienced.

619
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,450
Okay.
Practicalities.

620
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,940
Well,
there's a website I gave you the url,

621
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,530
I'll put it up again at the end of 
class.

622
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,233
The Url lists all the readings that 
aren't in the textbook and so the 

623
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,314
textbook contains the classic readings,
readings from people like young and 

624
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,950
Freud and Piaget and so forth.

625
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,680
Rogers,
and as I said,

626
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,514
I picked that particular textbook 
because I believe that the author did a 

627
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:47,780
very credible job of summarizing what's 
very difficult to summarize.

628
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,153
So and then also on the website there 
are links to papers because much of the 

629
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:55,184
more modern material that pertains say 
to neuroscience and also to trait 

630
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:00,314
personality,
I think it's better just to read the 

631
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:06,230
original papers and all detailed them 
out with you as we go through.

632
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:07,064
And that'll also give you some 
familiarity with original psychological 

633
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:11,120
papers,
which are,

634
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,890
again,
there's a,

635
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,090
there's an idiom that you have to master
in order to understand them,

636
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,373
but you might as well practice it,
especially if you're interested in 

637
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:26,321
continuing with psychology in your 
educational practice or as a career.

638
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,710
It's good to get accustomed to it.
So

639
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:38,880
there again is the url for the class.
If you go to Jordan b peterson.com which

640
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:42,310
isn't too hard to remember,
assuming you can remember my name,

641
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,730
then classes are listed on the left hand
side.

642
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:48,070
You can just find the,
the syllabus there.

643
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,863
Oh,

644
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,730
all right,
so here's what we're going to cover.

645
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:55,183
Well today,
obviously this is the introduction and 

646
00:42:56,661 --> 00:42:57,494
overview class is a little strange this 
year because one day it's an hour and 

647
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:01,034
the next day it's two hours.
So not exactly sure how we're going to 

648
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,020
negotiate our way through that,
but we'll figure it out.

649
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,500
Historical perspectives,
mythological representations.

650
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,334
Well,
I told you that I would try to provide 

651
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:15,194
you with a Meta narrative that might 
enable you to link the theories that 

652
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:23,930
we're going to talk about together.
So I'm going to describe to you what you

653
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:27,900
might regard as a conceptual language.
And as far as I can tell,

654
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:28,734
it's the imagine,
imagine that there are two kinds of 

655
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:35,340
things that you need to know and I 
believe this to be the case.

656
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,190
I believe that you need to know what the
world is made of.

657
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,920
And I suppose that's the proper domain 
of science,

658
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,293
but then you need to know how to act and
that's a whole different thing and you 

659
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:48,300
need to know how to act.
That's the thing.

660
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:49,134
You need to know most of anything of 
anything because of course you're a 

661
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:56,571
living creature and action in 
relationship to desired goals is,

662
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,500
is everything to you.

663
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,260
And you can think about that from a 
Darwinian perspective.

664
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:02,094
You have to act at least so that you can
survive at least so that you can find a 

665
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,400
partner that's,
that's life.

666
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,470
And so part of the question is,
well,

667
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:15,030
how does the world look?
If you think about it as a place to act,

668
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,770
and the answer isn't a place of value.
Free objects,

669
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:20,843
that's not what the world looks like.
And you can't act in a world of value 

670
00:44:24,601 --> 00:44:28,170
free objects because there's no way of 
choosing between them.

671
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,030
If everything has zero value,
why you choose one thing over another.

672
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,073
You live in a world where things present
themselves to you as of different value 

673
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:41,730
and that's partly a consequence of your 
temperament,

674
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,620
although it's a consequence of other 
things.

675
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:49,100
And so what I'm going to try to do is to
provide you with a Schema that describes

676
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:53,190
the world of morality,
roughly speaking,

677
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,024
which is how to act and tell you a 
little bit about what I think the 

678
00:44:57,241 --> 00:45:00,000
languages,
which I think was derived from Darwinian

679
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,080
processes.

680
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,273
And I believe that it's within that 
structure that the clinical theories 

681
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:08,820
logically nest.
And so that'll give you a way of linking

682
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:09,654
one theory to another from a conceptual 
perspective without having to rely so 

683
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:15,174
much on sheer memorization.
Then we'll talk about heroic and 

684
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:21,150
shamanic initiations and the reason 
we're going to do that is because,

685
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,040
well people,
people use shamonic initiations for tens

686
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:26,873
of thousands of years all over the world
and they have a particular kind of 

687
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,530
structure.
The paper by Murcia Ellie Outta which is

688
00:45:31,531 --> 00:45:32,364
linked on the site is a very interesting
one in details out some of these 

689
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:37,060
processes.
Um,

690
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,943
there have been intelligent commentators
like Henri ellenberger or Jay who wrote 

691
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,790
the discovery of the unconscious,
which I think is an outstanding book,

692
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,510
who linked the processes that the 
psychoanalysts,

693
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:49,344
psychoanalysts uncovered in the late 
part of the 19th century and early part 

694
00:45:53,641 --> 00:45:58,140
of the 20th century,
back to these more primordial rituals of

695
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:59,700
personality transformation.

696
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,700
And so we're going to situate ourselves 
in some sense in deep history,

697
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,320
talking first about the underlying 
mythological landscape,

698
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,160
then talking about archaic modes of 
personality,

699
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:14,994
conceptualization and transformation.
And then moving from there into 

700
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:22,050
constructivism and,
and we're going to concentrate mostly on

701
00:46:22,051 --> 00:46:24,600
John Piaget,
who was a developmental psychologist.

702
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,610
Constructivists believe that you make 
yourself out of the information that you

703
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:32,280
gather in the world.
So you're an exploring creature.

704
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:33,383
You explore specifically when the maps 
that you're using in the world are no 

705
00:46:36,631 --> 00:46:39,750
longer orienting yourself properly when 
they're producing errors.

706
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:40,584
You'd go out and gather information and 
assemble yourself from the information 

707
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:46,160
that you discovered.
Then the depths,

708
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:48,120
psychologists,
young and Freud,

709
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,373
I think I am going to with young,
I'm going to walk you through some 

710
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:57,450
films.
I'm not going to use the films per se.

711
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,600
I'm going to use clips stills from the 
film,

712
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,370
but in,
you know the film.

713
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,203
So in chronological order,
and I'm going to try to explain to you 

714
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,490
how you might use union presuppositions 
to understand what the films are about.

715
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:15,690
You know,
if you think about a film,

716
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:16,524
say like the Lion King,
which was an extraordinarily popular 

717
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:19,134
film,
it's a very strange phenomena that you 

718
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,100
go and watch it,
right?

719
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,060
I mean,
think about it,

720
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,600
it's drawings of animated animals that 
in some sense you,

721
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:31,983
they're very low resolution,
but you perceive them immediately as 

722
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:39,160
living things and you attribute to the 
motivation and,

723
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,070
and,
and motive power and understanding.

724
00:47:42,071 --> 00:47:44,080
You do it automatically without even 
thinking about it.

725
00:47:44,081 --> 00:47:48,070
And there's a classic plot that lies 
underneath those stories.

726
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,720
And the plots are very,
very,

727
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:51,190
very,
very old.

728
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,653
And that's why you can understand them.
And the reason you can understand them 

729
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:58,570
is because life has a plot or maybe it 
has a couple of plots,

730
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:01,110
a multitude of plots,
but life has a,

731
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,133
and if it didn't,
we wouldn't be able to understand each 

732
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:03,850
other.

733
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,683
And so I'd like to illustrate that for 
you by an analysis of some of these 

734
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:09,064
films.
I think it's the best way to understand 

735
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:15,760
someone as sophisticated as young who is
very difficult to get a handle on.

736
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:18,250
Freud.
I'm going to do the same thing,

737
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,230
although I am going to show you a film 
with Freud.

738
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,090
I'm going to show you a film called 
Crumb,

739
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,283
which is a documentary and it's about a 
very badly in meshed family and the 

740
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:31,780
attempts of the family members too,
I suppose escape it.

741
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,030
I'll talk to you about Freud.
I'll show you the film.

742
00:48:34,031 --> 00:48:36,460
That should give you a sense of Friday 
and psychopathology,

743
00:48:36,461 --> 00:48:39,190
which is a very difficult thing 
otherwise to understand.

744
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,480
Then there's a midterm.
Midterm is multiple choice.

745
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,880
You'll do it in class.
You'll,

746
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,360
you'll have lots of time to finish it.
It'll cover the material that we took.

747
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:53,560
We studied up to that point.
Then we're going to talk about Rogers.

748
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,450
Carl Rogers,
who was a humanist.

749
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,040
Rogers has a body centered philosophy I 
suppose,

750
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,640
and he's interested as well in optimal 
personal development.

751
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:04,474
And the role that interpersonal 
communication plays in that Rogers 

752
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:10,090
hypothesis fundamentally,
and it's a very interesting one,

753
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:11,463
is that honest communication between two
people can produce personality 

754
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:16,260
transformation.
And you,

755
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:17,710
you know,
you might think,

756
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:18,544
well,
you kind of know that already because 

757
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,780
there's something very engaging about a 
deep,

758
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:23,614
honest conversation where you're able to
say things that you wouldn't normally 

759
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:27,604
say,
where you're being listened to by 

760
00:49:29,321 --> 00:49:30,154
someone who's actually listening to you 
and you're listening to them and in the 

761
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:36,910
conversation you're moving both of you 
further to a different point.

762
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,013
That's different than a conversation 
where you're right and you're trying to 

763
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,970
convince me or I'm right and I'm trying 
to convince you,

764
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:45,100
which I would say is the typical 
conversation.

765
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,100
The,
the healing conversation is more,

766
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,930
well,
what's up with you?

767
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,940
You know,
how are you doing?

768
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,380
How's your life going?
Where,

769
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:55,630
what sort of problems are you facing?
What do you think about those problems?

770
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:58,390
Can you conceptualize what a solution 
might be?

771
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:00,520
Is there a way we could figure out how 
to get there?

772
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,541
You know,
it's so,

773
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:02,374
it's a problem solving conversation and 
it's predicated on the presupposition 

774
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:06,874
that the person that you're conversing 
with has the capacity to grow in a 

775
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:13,210
positive direction if they so choose.
That's the fundamental,

776
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,793
that's the fundamental presupposition of
Rogerian psychology may and frankly are 

777
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:22,350
also humanists
all finished.

778
00:50:22,351 --> 00:50:24,850
Tell you what the rest of the rest of 
the material is.

779
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,920
The next time that we meet,
I should show you,

780
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,660
let you know a little bit more about the
structure of the course.

781
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,943
The second midterm is March 14th,
the and there's a final at the end as 

782
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:37,214
well.

783
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:39,943
So the mid,
the multiple choice tests are graded in 

784
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:42,884
that manner.
25% 25% and 27.5% they're not 

785
00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,134
cumulative.
Each test only covers what you covered 

786
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,880
before.
Since the last test,

787
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:53,714
including the final,
you'll be required to write an essay of 

788
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:58,850
15%.
It's a thousand words,

789
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:00,770
sorry,
not 750 words.

790
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,970
And you'll also do an online exercise,
a personality analysis,

791
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,880
um,
which is pass fail.

792
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:10,700
All you have to do is complete it and 
show proof of completion.

793
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:15,560
It helps you do a modified big five 
analysis of your own personality,

794
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,770
concentrating on your virtues and your 
faults.

795
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,970
So that,
so,

796
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,833
so it's uh,
it's an active exercise in the 

797
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:27,260
application of personality theory to 
personal development.

798
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,800
And so that's the,
that's the structure of the course.

799
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,840
Um,
I can tell you

800
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:39,380
there's a signup sheet on the,
on the syllabus.

801
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,833
We,
I've broken the essays down into 

802
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:45,050
multiple types across the entire 
semester.

803
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,540
I would highly recommend that you go 
there and sign up.

804
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:51,950
There are limited slots for each topic.
And the reason for that is,

805
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,023
well,
I don't want my ta to have to grade 200 

806
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,244
essays the last week of classes.
We have to spread them out across the 

807
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:02,300
year.
So figure out a topic and sign up please

808
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:04,430
and please do that sooner rather than 
later.

809
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:06,650
It's,
it's an industrious thing to do.

810
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,783
It'll help you organize yourself.
I'll post something that's quite useful 

811
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,404
about how to write,
especially a thousand word essay and 

812
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:19,250
I'll close the essays are due one day 
before class.

813
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,413
Oh close by the way,
by telling you who shouldn't take this 

814
00:52:23,961 --> 00:52:25,040
course.
Okay,

815
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:26,563
first of all,
if you didn't like this lecture then 

816
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:32,690
don't take this course because this is 
what the lectures are going to be like.

817
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,450
So and it's,
they're not for everybody.

818
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:36,913
Um,
I use a lot of loose associations and 

819
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:43,370
try to gather them back in and I kind of
wander around that way.

820
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,680
I can talk directly to you,
which I like doing,

821
00:52:45,681 --> 00:52:48,590
but I sacrifice a certain amount of 
organization for that.

822
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,040
But my sense is that it's worth the 
sacrifice.

823
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:57,430
The second thing is there's a lot of 
reading a lot and a lot of it is,

824
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:02,750
I would say a lot of it's hard science,
the last half in particular,

825
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,290
but the first half of a lot of its 
philosophical in nature,

826
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,310
philosophical.
Slash,

827
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:11,210
psychological.
And so if you're not interested in that,

828
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,283
like if you're a pure science type and 
you're not interested in the clinical 

829
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:19,340
elements,
say of personality and in the,

830
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,253
and in investigating the philosophical 
underpinnings of those clinical 

831
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,074
theories,
then I would say this isn't the course 

832
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,153
you.
And so you should take that seriously 

833
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:28,824
because the readings are hard.
There's a lot of work involved in this 

834
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:31,644
course,
and it would be better if you took a 

835
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:36,510
course that you actually wanted to take.
So,

836
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:37,883
well,
welcome to psychology to 30 and we'll 

837
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:40,614
see you in a bit

838
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:45,140
[inaudible].
