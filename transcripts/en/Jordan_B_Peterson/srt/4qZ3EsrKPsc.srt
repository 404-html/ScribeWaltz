1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,423
so we started to talk a little bit about
phenomenology last time and about Carl 

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,743
Rogers and uh,
I mentioned that the phenomenologists 

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,620
were interested in experience in some 
sense as the ultimate reality and that's

5
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,550
it's a very complicated concept to,
to grasp

6
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,770
the existentialists
also adopted that viewpoint.

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,430
They were concerned with the quality of 
subjective experience,

8
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,630
not that they were ignoring the reality 
of object of experience,

9
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,464
but they were concerned with the reality
of subjective experience and they're 

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,190
also more focused on action then on,
on statement or belief.

11
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,930
Here's something to think about.
You can think about this for a very long

12
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:01,764
time.
If you're trying to understand what 

13
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:04,734
someone believes,
even if you're trying to analyze their 

14
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:11,571
representations of the world,
should you pay attention to how they act

15
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,851
or what they say.
And that's a profound question even from

16
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:17,964
a,
from a neurological perspective or a 

17
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,624
neuropsychological perspective because 
the memory system that you use to 

18
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,484
represent what you say that you believe 
is not the same memory system that you 

19
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:34,971
use to embody your,
your knowledge about action.

20
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,470
So it's,
it's a can.

21
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,304
I would say to the distinction between 
telling someone how to ride a bike and 

22
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,180
knowing how to ride a bike,
those are not the same things.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,313
The descriptions don't even really lay 
very well on top of one another because 

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,120
you don't actually know how you ride a 
bike.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,180
You just know how to do it.
It's built into your physiology,

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,470
right?
It's a skill,

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,873
and that's called procedural memory.
Procedural memory is the same kind of 

28
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,210
memory that basically structures your 
perceptions.

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,583
I'm not.
It's not that you can't orient your 

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,323
perceptions consciously because you can,
but once you've oriented them 

31
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,430
consciously,
say towards some goal,

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,533
it's automatic procedures that take over
because you really don't know how it is 

33
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,020
that you organize your senses so that 
you can pay attention.

34
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,780
You just know how to do it.
Now,

35
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:29,781
the existentialists believed that
actions spoke louder than words and that

36
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:36,351
if you were interested in belief and 
even if you were interested in analyzing

37
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:37,644
belief,
that it was better for you to look at 

38
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:42,630
how someone acted than what they said.
Now,

39
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,530
one of the things that you might think 
with regards to rogers

40
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,570
is that his psychotherapeutic practice 
would be predicated on the idea that you

41
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:58,941
should bring how you act into alignment 
with what you say you believe,

42
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,540
so that there was no discontinuity in 
your between your body.

43
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
That's one way of thinking about it and 
your mind and so that there are fewer 

44
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,640
paradoxes in your

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,720
in the way that you manifest yourself in
the world.

46
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,993
So the concentration on auction is one 
of the fundamental characteristics of 

47
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,360
existentialism.
Another one is

48
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,193
the insistence upon trouble and 
suffering as an intrinsic element of 

49
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:37,500
human experience.
So you could say,

50
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,510
we could concentrate on subjective 
experience.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,210
What's your life like to you?
How do you experience it?

52
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,620
And we could say,
well,

53
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:48,621
built into that is trouble built into 
that is chaos built into that is anxiety

54
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:49,524
and pain and disease and and that you 
can fall prey to those things without 

55
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:56,694
there being something wrong with you.
Now you know if you pin down a 

56
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,144
psychoanalyst like younger Freud,
they would of course admit that human 

57
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,663
misery is endemic to human experience,
but Freud in particular tend to look 

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,630
tended to look for adult psychopathology
in childhood,

59
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,680
Miss Adventure in childhood,
in pathological childhood experience,

60
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:20,514
and he at least implicitly claimed that 
if you hadn't experienced childhood 

61
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,300
trauma and you had developed properly,
that what would happen is that you would

62
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:35,301
end up healthy roughly speaking,
certainly mentally sound,

63
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:38,610
but the existentialist centrally by that
perspective,

64
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,330
right from the beginning,
they basically make a different claim,

65
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:46,080
which is that life is so full of 
intrinsic misery,

66
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:46,943
let's say,
but suffering is a better way of 

67
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:49,014
thinking about it.
Suffering that manifests itself as a 

68
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,090
consequence of your intrinsic 
vulnerability,

69
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,500
that psychopathology is built into the 
human experience.

70
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,040
There's no real way of avoiding it or at
least

71
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,230
there's no reason to look for extra 
causes.

72
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:10,140
That might be a better way of thinking 
about it and

73
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,270
you'd be surprised how often that sort 
of observation is useful for.

74
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,130
For clinical clients,
for example,

75
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:20,280
because one of the things that's quite 
characteristic about people,

76
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,800
especially if they're introverted and 
they don't have very many friends,

77
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:25,500
they don't have people to talk to.
If they're suffering,

78
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,363
maybe they're depressed or anxious or 
they have some sets of strange symptoms 

79
00:05:29,821 --> 00:05:32,130
like agoraphobic or obsessive compulsive
disorder.

80
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,653
One of the things they always presume 
that is that the fact that they're 

81
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:38,634
suffering in that manner means that 
there's something not only something 

82
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:46,011
wrong with them but something uniquely 
wrong with them so that it's their fault

83
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,333
and no one else is like them.
And one of the things you do as a 

84
00:05:50,401 --> 00:05:51,480
diagnostician,
you know,

85
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:56,481
you'll hear a lot of rattling about how 
labeling is bad for people and certainly

86
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,564
mislabeling is bad for people and even 
an accurate label can be a box that you 

87
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,490
can't get out of.

88
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,323
But it's very,
very frequently the case that if you 

89
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,500
diagnose someone,
it's a relief to them.

90
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,334
Like you can't believe because they come
in to see you knowing that something 

91
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,520
isn't going properly,
but they think,

92
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:17,354
well,
they're the only person facing it and 

93
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,410
that means they're idiosyncratically 
strange.

94
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,244
In some incomprehensible way that no one
else could possibly understand and 

95
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:26,234
there's no way they could ever get 
better and one of the things you do is 

96
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,624
pointed out to them as like depression 
and anxiety doesn't really require any 

97
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,210
explanation.
Right?

98
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,850
There's plenty of reason.
I don't remember who said it.

99
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,270
Everyone has sufficient justification 
for suicide.

100
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,373
I think that was the claim well,
but the point is is that if you look 

101
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,390
through the experiences of the typical 
person,

102
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:48,224
unless they're very,
very fortunate and they won't be that 

103
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,700
way forever,
that's certainly the case,

104
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,090
that they can point to traumatic 
experiences in their life,

105
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,163
death and loss and illness and and 
humiliation and all those sorts of 

106
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:00,854
things that are sufficient to account 
for existence in the state of quasi 

107
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,220
permanent negative emotion.

108
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,200
Now,
often if you see,

109
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,034
as I said,
if you see people who are depressed and 

110
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:11,924
anxious by nature,
they assume that everyone else is the 

111
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,194
smiling face that you see on facebook 
and so that that alienates them from 

112
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:22,010
other people and themselves.
Even more than that,

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,650
then that certainly far more than 
necessary,

114
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,484
and part of the psychoeducation that 
goes along with therapy is merely 

115
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,793
educating people to understand that a 
fair bit of misery is the norm and that 

116
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:36,734
there's plenty of genuine reason for it.
And so the existentialists basically 

117
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,120
start from that stance.
Um,

118
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,760
it's like a fall of man stance in some 
sense,

119
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,230
you know,
because deeply rooted in,

120
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,610
in,
in,

121
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,940
in the western tradition,
roughly speaking is the idea that people

122
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,323
are divorced from some early paradise 
state and that it was the emergence of 

123
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:04,931
something like self consciousness that 
produced that demolition of humanity and

124
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:06,710
left us in a damaged state.

125
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,690
And um,
I mean,

126
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:12,080
people think they don't believe that,
but they believe it all the time.

127
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,253
Um,
and it's frequently help people 

128
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:19,640
experience themselves as,
as if there's something wrong that needs

129
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,474
to be rectified.
And it seems unique in some sense to 

130
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,094
human beings.
It doesn't seem all that obvious that 

131
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:31,250
animals think that way.
But people definitely think that way.

132
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,940
And so all the existentialists basically
take that as a given and then they,

133
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:40,940
they,
they offer another question which is,

134
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,073
well,
given that that's your lot and that 

135
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,654
there's ample reason for misery,
how is it that you should conduct 

136
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,404
yourself?
Because merely say giving into that 

137
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:54,140
misery or multiplying it doesn't seem to
be.

138
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,900
It doesn't seem to do anything,
but multiply it.

139
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,730
It doesn't seem to do anything but 
increase.

140
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,890
It knows that it's bad to begin with.
You might say,

141
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:08,724
well,
increasing it is definitely going to be 

142
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,780
increasing in is something that you have
to regard as worse.

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,390
So how do you conduct yourself in the 
face of misery?

144
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,260
Okay,
so how do they,

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,450
how did they present that to begin with?
Well,

146
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:23,451
this is from Pascal and and this is an 
existential statement that describes the

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,900
position of the individual in the 
universe.

148
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,561
You might say,
or,

149
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:29,394
or,
or you could say that it explains the 

150
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,000
individ,
the deep,

151
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,390
deep characteristic of individual 
experience or existence.

152
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,253
Hence existentialism.
When I consider the brief span of my 

153
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:45,330
life swallowed up in the eternity before
and behind it,

154
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,183
the small space that I feel or or even 
see engulfed in the infinite immensity 

155
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:55,650
of spaces which I know not in which no,
not me.

156
00:09:55,651 --> 00:09:56,484
I am afraid and wonder to see myself 
here rather than there for there's no 

157
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:05,040
reason why I should be here rather than 
there or now rather than then.

158
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,353
And so that's an element of existential 
thinking that is shared with the 

159
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,170
phenomenologists called thrownness.
And that's a term that heidegger

160
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,220
originated,
if I remember correctly.

161
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,443
And what it means is,
is it's an analysis of a certain 

162
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:24,320
characteristic of human experience,
which is that,

163
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,603
well,
there was an immense span of time in 

164
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:29,510
which you could have been born,
but you weren't born then.

165
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:30,344
You were born 20 years ago and there was
an immense span of time in the future 

166
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,050
that you could have been born and you 
weren't born then.

167
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:36,884
Either you were born when you were born 
and your who you are and you have 

168
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,810
exactly the characteristics that you 
have.

169
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,300
And there's something tremendously 
arbitrary about that.

170
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,283
It says,
if you were thrown into experience and 

171
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:47,894
that's what thrown this means,
it means that you were randomly placed 

172
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:54,380
in a place and time and there's 
something fundamentally irrational about

173
00:10:54,381 --> 00:10:55,214
that,
meaning that there's no real way of 

174
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:59,600
understanding it.
It's something you have to deal with and

175
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:00,201
you might say,
well,

176
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:05,201
why was I born poor?
Or why was I born less attractive than I

177
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:05,831
might be?
Or,

178
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,890
or why was I born less intelligent than 
I might be,

179
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:12,130
or maybe why I was.
Why was I born to these terrible parents

180
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:14,440
at this particular horrible moment in 
time?

181
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,230
And in some sense there's no answer to 
questions like that.

182
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,070
It's just how it is and you have to deal
with it.

183
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,570
So the question is for the 
existentialists,

184
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:26,710
how do you deal with that?

185
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,813
This is Walter Calf Kauffman for Renault
Rollo may rarely has the existential 

186
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:35,460
question we'd put more simply are 
beautifully.

187
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,670
In this passage,
we see first the profound realization of

188
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:39,504
the contingency of human life with the 
which the existentialists call 

189
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,030
thrownness.
Second,

190
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:48,720
we see Pascal Flinch facing 
unflinchingly unflinchingly.

191
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:53,721
The question of being there or more 
accurately being where third,

192
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,743
we see the realization that you cannot 
take refuge in some superficial 

193
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:03,430
explanation of time and space which 
Pascal scientists that he was could well

194
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,264
know and lastly the deep shaking anxiety
arising from this stark awareness of 

195
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,730
existence in such a universe.

196
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,193
There's a

197
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,830
fairly well developed line of social 
psychological theorizing known as terror

198
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,094
management theory and the basic premise 
of terror management theory is that 

199
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,493
human beings have belief systems and 
what the belief systems do is serve to 

200
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:31,444
protect them against death,
anxiety and that now I have that that's 

201
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,650
derived from the work of Ernest Becker,
by the way,

202
00:12:38,651 --> 00:12:39,484
who wrote a great book called the denial
of death and his theories in the denial 

203
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:46,240
of death have been put to the test by 
the terror management theorists with,

204
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,540
I would say some success,
but I think the theory is flawed because

205
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,710
I don't believe that
becker phrase the issue properly.

206
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,723
I think it's deeper than a fear of death
and that's what the existentialists are 

207
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,180
attempting to to to communicate.
It's more like.

208
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,860
It's more like terror at ice.
It's more like terror of isolated being,

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,430
you know,
it's not only that you're a pro,

210
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,560
you're mortal,
you know that you have a border,

211
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,040
a temporal border,
you're born and you die,

212
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,113
but also that during that time you're 
vulnerable to all sorts of things and 

213
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,060
all sorts of contingencies.
One of which of course is death,

214
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:36,700
but it's by no means the only one that 
is horrifying.

215
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,930
I think you can certainly make a case 
like the existentialists do,

216
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,764
that.
The mere fact that you're your limited 

217
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:48,610
in the face of infinite complexity is 
also a primary existential problem.

218
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:54,973
It's a problem that human beings have 
been dealing with ever since they 

219
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:57,704
started to understand.
They started to make sense of concepts 

220
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,700
that were beyond their immediate 
experience.

221
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,493
No

222
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,190
millions of years ago or tens of 
millions of years ago when our ancestors

223
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,024
lived in trees.
You could be sure that they were 

224
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:16,584
frightened of what surrounded them.
They were frightened of when they were 

225
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,120
little.
They were frightened of birds that might

226
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:21,954
pick them out of a tree or they were 
afraid of cats that might climb a tree 

227
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:25,404
and eat them.
They were afraid of snakes that would 

228
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:29,940
come slithering along and bite them,
and

229
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,560
they were.
They existed in the space that was safe,

230
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:37,830
surrounded by a space that wasn't safe,
that was full of predatory,

231
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,473
a predatory entities,
and those were primarily birds of prey 

232
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:48,931
and cats and snakes or other reptiles,
and then what seemed to have happened as

233
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:53,120
we evolved was that the way we construed
the world,

234
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:53,954
you can think of the world as a safe 
place surrounded by the possibility of 

235
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,880
predation,
but you could also think of the world as

236
00:14:58,881 --> 00:14:59,714
the known surrounded by the unknown.
It's the same idea except put up one 

237
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
level of abstraction and the unknown has
the same relationship to us in some 

238
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,444
sense that the territory of predators 
has relationship to us and we use the 

239
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:17,471
same circuitry to represent the absolute
unknown that we used so many millions of

240
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,933
years ago to represent predators.
Now it's called more complicated for 

241
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,970
human beings because first of all,
we're not just prey animals.

242
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:29,720
We're also predators.
And so we're not only targets,

243
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,554
but we're the thing that makes other 
thing targets and we're also something 

244
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:33,674
that isn't only shaking in the face of 
the unknown because of it's predatory 

245
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:38,810
element,
maybe like a rabbit,

246
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,400
but something that can explore the 
unknown and Garner something of value as

247
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,270
a consequence.

248
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,910
And so we have this very paradoxical 
wiring.

249
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,744
You might say that a known is partly 
terror and that's the prepotent element 

250
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:53,864
of the unknown.
So negative emotion for human beings is 

251
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,104
more powerful than positive.
Emotion is sort of dose for dose and 

252
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:04,400
that's I think that's because you can be
completely and utterly dead,

253
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,640
but you can only be so much happier and 
so it makes much more sense to be tilted

254
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:10,604
to some degree towards sensitivity to 
negative emotion than it does to be 

255
00:16:13,941 --> 00:16:16,670
tilted towards sensitivity for positive 
emotion,

256
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,893
but it's also another one of those 
things that makes life rather 

257
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,504
intrinsically dif difficult because
negative emotions are commonplace and 

258
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:26,564
they're powerful and they need to be 
because otherwise you'd wander stupidly 

259
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,573
into something that would kill you and 
it's better to be anxious than to be in 

260
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:35,684
pain or dead.
Even though it's not so good to be 

261
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,414
anxious,
so for the existentialists that the 

262
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,433
fundamental,
the fundamental quality of human 

263
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,933
existence is limitation in the face of 
incomprehensible complexity and all of 

264
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:58,330
the things that stem from that

265
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,660
existentialism is not a comprehensive 
philosophy or a way of life,

266
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:12,661
but it an endeavor to grasp reality.
Existentialism is immersed in and arises

267
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:15,820
directly out of man's anxiety,
estrangement and conflicts.

268
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,830
This was written 60 years ago and it was
written so it was.

269
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,200
It was aimed at western audiences at 
that point,

270
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,420
if you go back 100 years,
you could make the case or or or perhaps

271
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,254
a little longer than that.
You could make the case that the parts 

272
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:35,200
of the world that weren't western,
we're still reasonably well ensconced in

273
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,034
traditional belief systems and so those 
traditional belief systems provided an 

274
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:43,930
overarching canopy of meaning.
That's one way of thinking about it.

275
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,263
That was designed exactly to you could 
say rationalize or you could say cope 

276
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:53,610
with or deal with.
Depending on your perspective.

277
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,630
That existential anxiety it gave,
gave significance to everything.

278
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,060
It gave meaning to everything and there 
was a religious systems.

279
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,893
Let's say,
but they came crashing down in the West 

280
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,523
in the late 18 hundreds and then 
increasingly everywhere else in the 

281
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:07,584
world.
So the point at which we are now in 

282
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:10,584
time,
it isn't reasonable to only consider 

283
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,620
this a pathology of the western 
individual.

284
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,933
It might even be the prime conflict that
exists in the world right now between 

285
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,043
comprehensive and traditional religious 
systems in a modern viewpoint that has 

286
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,920
this existential angst built into it as 
part of its as part of its nature.

287
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:35,754
Maybe it's the price you pay for 
increased technological mastery and 

288
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:39,864
awareness,
but it's a big price to pay and the 

289
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:42,714
existentialists were concerned about 
that because they also believe that 

290
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:50,180
although the scientific method had given
us immense technological power,

291
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,590
the worldview that came along with it,
which you could say in some sense,

292
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,760
is incidental to the method,
but it doesn't matter.

293
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,803
The worldview that came along with it 
was sufficiently powerful and objective 

294
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,663
and reductive to blow gaping holes in 
the meaning systems that protected us 

295
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,124
from our existential anxiety and to open
us up to the possibility number one of 

296
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:17,370
nihilism,
which is really belief and nothing,

297
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:18,204
and we'll talk about that more as we 
progress or a proclivity towards 

298
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:23,580
rational totalitarianism,
which would be,

299
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,560
you might say,
the,

300
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,660
the,
uh,

301
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,653
extreme reaction to the threat of 
nihilism and the abandonment of classic 

302
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,380
belief systems.
I,

303
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,110
I think you still see that playing out 
everywhere.

304
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,840
You certainly see it playing out in the 
universities right now because the,

305
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,270
there's huge ideological conflicts at 
the,

306
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:45,540
in the substructure of Western 
intellectual thinking.

307
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:50,280
And people are,
and this is very hard on young people,

308
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,114
they're caught in part B,
be between an emergent nihilism that 

309
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:56,760
seems to be implicit in a materialist 
worldview.

310
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,430
And the temptation of radical 
ideologies.

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
And neither of those options I would say
is tenable.

312
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,493
I mean,
the nihilistic option leaves you with 

313
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,410
nothing.
And that's not good.

314
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,110
And that's an existential realization in
some sense too,

315
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,680
because if your life is fundamentally 
problematic,

316
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,250
without you being pathological,
just as the the essence of your life,

317
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,420
then you need something to defend 
yourself,

318
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,453
to defend against that.
You can't just have nothing because all 

319
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:27,750
it does is leave you with the suffering 
that's implicit in your experience.

320
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,050
And then to swing to a totalitarianism 
totalitarian system means that you don't

321
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:35,460
even exist to.
Once you've done that,

322
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,563
everything you say can be predicted.
You're just the puppet of a of a 

323
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,780
rational scheme that has an explanation 
for everything.

324
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,614
But that's really good for nothing 
except destruction because it's too 

325
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,780
vague and abstract it to be used to 
actually solve any concrete problems.

326
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,493
So this is,
this is the situation of modern people 

327
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:57,544
as far as the existentialists were 
concerned and the people that I'm 

328
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:02,560
talking to you about specifically,
I'm going to talk to you about Nietzsche

329
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:03,394
and Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard and I 
picked those people who aren't 

330
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,964
psychologists,
except in the broader sense because I 

331
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,054
don't think there is anybody who there 
were and are existential 

332
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,850
psychotherapist,
but I don't think that any of them do as

333
00:21:15,851 --> 00:21:18,640
good a job of explaining the problem as 
those people do.

334
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:19,474
So you might as well get right.
You might as well get the information 

335
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:23,740
right from the source.

336
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,963
Like psychoanalysis.
Existentialism seeks to utilize these 

337
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:35,020
very conflicts as avenues to the more 
profound self understanding of man.

338
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,160
Well,
so what does that mean?

339
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,260
Well,
it means at least in part,

340
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:39,094
that the theorists that we're going to 
talk about had an idea that was akin to 

341
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:46,000
the psychoanalytic idea of facing what 
you're afraid of,

342
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,400
and that's a key concept in 
psychotherapy.

343
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,293
There's,
there's not that many key concepts in 

344
00:21:50,801 --> 00:21:51,634
psychotherapy.
One might be that you enter into an 

345
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:54,544
honest relationship with your client.
The second is that exposure to the 

346
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:03,820
things that you don't want to be exposed
to is curative.

347
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,893
If it's voluntary,
that's a big deal and it has to be 

348
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:08,434
voluntary.
It can't be involuntary because that'll 

349
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,320
just make it worse because you might 
ask,

350
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,300
well,
you know,

351
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,143
if a kid has a fear of rats or mice,
they got that fear because often they 

352
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:18,754
were exposed to rats or mice and then 
you use exposure to rats and mice to 

353
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:22,660
cure them.

354
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,493
Well,
that makes the precipitator of the 

355
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:27,370
illness,
the carer,

356
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,990
which makes no sense.
Well,

357
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,610
what's the distinction?
Well,

358
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:31,444
it's,
it's one thing to have something pop up 

359
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:33,724
at you when you're not expecting it.
That puts you in a state of of 

360
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,833
apprehension and preparation for action 
in the state of even a state of terror 

361
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,293
estate of a reflex of shock and then 
perhaps terror and maybe something you 

362
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:46,954
don't recover from that's completely 
different than facing something 

363
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:50,854
voluntarily.
The psychophysiology isn't even the 

364
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:53,494
same,
so if you're faced with a stressor of a 

365
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:56,254
certain magnitude and it's involuntary,
your body produces a lot of the stress 

366
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:02,260
hormone cortisol and in large doses,
cortisol is toxic,

367
00:23:02,261 --> 00:23:05,740
especially if it's produced over long 
periods of time,

368
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,860
but if you face it voluntarily,
then that doesn't happen.

369
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:12,220
You use a completely different set of 
circuits to do something voluntarily and

370
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,293
it's the utilization of the voluntary 
circuits that indicates your mastery 

371
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:18,124
over the thing that you're afraid of and
that mastery over the thing that you're 

372
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,024
afraid of and can't cope with.
That actually constitutes your adaptive 

373
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,444
personality.
And so part of what the existentialists 

374
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,700
were suggesting is that precisely and 
you see this,

375
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
you see this in Freud with his 
insistence that you go into your messy 

376
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,374
past and dig up the corpses in the 
skeletons and sort them out and young's 

377
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:40,354
insistence that what you want most is to
be found where you least want to look 

378
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,040
and Roger's insistence that people

379
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,140
communicate honestly about difficult 
things.

380
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:48,974
It's all predicated on the same idea in 
some sense that voluntary exposure is 

381
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:53,684
one of the prime things that cures 
people and one of the things that you 

382
00:23:56,121 --> 00:23:57,170
should think about,
you think,

383
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,400
well,
is that a valid claim?

384
00:23:58,401 --> 00:23:59,234
Well,
you have the psychophysiological 

385
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:01,034
evidence,
but it's also the case that that is how 

386
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,280
people learn,
right?

387
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:07,400
If you're a child and you're learning to
master the world,

388
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:08,563
you actually exist in a state of 
existential anxiety unless you're near 

389
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:14,810
someone that will take care of you.
So for example,

390
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:17,750
if you take the typical child and you'd 
go to a mall,

391
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,020
say a three year old and then you have 
the three year old Stan and you leave,

392
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,793
it's going to be very long until you're 
far enough away so that most of most 

393
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,880
children in that situation will 
immediately start to cry.

394
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,820
They'll get worried and they'll start to
cry and then they'll break down because,

395
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,193
well,
because that's the existential anxiety 

396
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,041
like you think,
well,

397
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,470
a normal child is calm.
It's like wrong.

398
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,700
A normal child close to someone who will
take care of them is calm,

399
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,720
but that is by no means the same thing.
It's not even close to the same thing,

400
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:54,230
and so if you get backwards in your 
psychological thinking,

401
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,760
if you don't notice that because you 
think,

402
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:56,594
well,
the normal human being is calm and well 

403
00:24:57,981 --> 00:25:00,200
put together,
it's like no wrong.

404
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,520
The normal human being in a place of 
safety is calm and well put together,

405
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:09,410
but why you would ever think that a 
normal place is a place of safety.

406
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,020
You know,
assuming that that's the standard or the

407
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:14,240
norm,
there's absolutely no reason for that.

408
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,470
You see this with rats too because the 
behaviorist,

409
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,333
for example,
made the presumption that you had to 

410
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,560
teach rats to be afraid.

411
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,870
But let me tell you how that actually 
worked.

412
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,710
It's really interesting and it shows you
how carefully you have to analyze,

413
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,633
say,
psychological experiments to understand 

414
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:33,170
what's going on.
So let's say you take a lab rat,

415
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,070
okay?
Like,

416
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,220
and let's say it's a lab rat.
The rat that skinner used,

417
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:39,400
bf skinner,
who is the most famous of the behaviors,

418
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:43,550
and he could get rats to do anything.
He taught pigeons to play ping pong.

419
00:25:43,551 --> 00:25:47,600
He taught pigeons to guide guided 
missiles by photographs,

420
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,130
and he did that with behavioral 
training.

421
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,540
They were never used for guided missiles
because they got the electronics working

422
00:25:53,541 --> 00:25:55,340
before the program was set into 
operation,

423
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,383
but he could get them to peck at photos 
to guide something that was flying 

424
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,523
accurately.
And he did that with behavioral 

425
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:03,200
training.
So skinner,

426
00:26:03,201 --> 00:26:03,731
I mean,
he,

427
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:04,850
he was no joke.
He could.

428
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,810
He really knew how to train animals and 
it's very useful material to know.

429
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,510
We'll talk about it to some degree if 
you want to train children,

430
00:26:11,511 --> 00:26:12,201
for example,
or,

431
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,034
or pets.
So because the learning mechanisms are 

432
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,880
very similar,
which is why,

433
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,530
of course we can get along with pets,
right?

434
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,364
We understand them,
like we understand children roughly 

435
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:23,570
speaking.
So anyways,

436
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,003
so let's say you've got your rat and 
he's sitting there and he's pretty calm 

437
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:28,483
and he's in his cage.
And so he's already a weird rat because 

438
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,670
he's been genetically altered.
He's not a wild Norway rat,

439
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:36,920
so he's a little tamer than a normal 
rat.

440
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,200
Maybe he's a little more fearful,
although perhaps not,

441
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,453
and he's also a solitary rat in his cage
and there's no such thing as a solitary 

442
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,530
rat.
It's like a solitary zebra or a solitary

443
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:51,531
carp or a car.
Cod Cod existed.

444
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:54,720
Huge schools.
There's no such thing as at cod,

445
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,330
which is why they will never come back 
as far as I can tell,

446
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,164
because once you wipe out the school,
it's like you wipe out a beehive and 

447
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:02,610
you're going to have six bees.

448
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,350
What the hell are you going to do with 
six bees?

449
00:27:04,351 --> 00:27:07,070
What are they going to do?
They don't exist on their own and,

450
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,780
and,
and hurt animals are like that too.

451
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,623
And caught her like that.
So they organized their mating behavior 

452
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,020
in their huge schools.
So without the schools,

453
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,460
like what the hell is the cod going to 
do?

454
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,560
Nothing.
And that is what they're doing.

455
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,760
But anyways,
back to the,

456
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,070
back to the rat.
So you've got this rat,

457
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:23,904
he's in a cage,
he's alone and he's hungry because one 

458
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:28,074
of the things that skinner did was 
starve his rats down to 75 percent of 

459
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,050
their normal body weight so that they 
would respond to a lot more to food.

460
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,363
So,
so that's the model and that you've got 

461
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:39,000
to keep in mind that the nature of the 
model,

462
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,834
because the model is like the way the 
model is constituted is equivalent to 

463
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:44,754
your implicit assumptions about your 
experiment and people don't take that 

464
00:27:48,421 --> 00:27:49,350
into consideration.

465
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,730
Okay?
So the rats come.

466
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:51,564
So then what you do is you take the ride
out of his cage and you put them in the 

467
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:54,744
testing chamber.
And so maybe what you're going to do is 

468
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,953
you're going to have set the rat up so 
that a light goes on and then he gets a 

469
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,530
little electric shock.
Okay?

470
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,870
But,
and now you're going to teach them to be

471
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:04,704
afraid of the light.
So after you pair the light with the 

472
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:07,104
shock,
six or seven times when the light comes 

473
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:10,020
on,
the rats going to freeze.

474
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,693
So.
And he freezes because he's using 

475
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:15,600
Predator avoidance strategy.
Basically to deal with the threat,

476
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,800
but,
but,

477
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
and so you think,
well,

478
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,160
calm rat learns to be afraid,
but no,

479
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,800
because when you put the rat in the 
cage,

480
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,230
the new cage,
what does it do?

481
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:26,890
Well,
it doesn't just,

482
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,950
you know,
find the sofa and have a nap.

483
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,740
It's terrified when he put it in the new
situation,

484
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,933
that's the normal rat.
It's the one that's like this and it 

485
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:36,644
doesn't move because if it moved,
maybe a Predator would pick it out like 

486
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:40,860
a cat because cats can see lateral 
movement.

487
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,600
That's why they have slit eyes by the 
way,

488
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,583
so they can detect lateral movement and 
you know that because if you play with 

489
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:47,970
your cat like this,
it'll chase your hand.

490
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:49,110
But if you do this,
it won't.

491
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,290
It is because it doesn't chase things 
that do.

492
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,420
This doesn't chase kangaroos,
you know,

493
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,140
chase's things that move like this.
So it has eyes for that.

494
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,633
Anyways,
the rats frozen and then it starts to 

495
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:06,120
sniff because Erad is all smell.
Most animals,

496
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:09,150
most the brains of most animals are 
organized around smell.

497
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,720
Human beings are very weird because our 
brains are organized around vision.

498
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,640
But that's just not the case for most.

499
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,150
Well,
you know,

500
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,250
dogs,
they're the weirdest things.

501
00:29:17,251 --> 00:29:18,600
A because they can,
they,

502
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,434
they can smell like way better than you.
That can detect odors way better than 

503
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,330
you.
Probably most of you smell better than a

504
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:26,310
dog,
but they,

505
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,000
they can detect odors better than you.
But everything seems to smell good too.

506
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,010
A dog,
which is the strangest damn thing,

507
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,350
you know,
with a nose like that,

508
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,090
you'd think they'd never even want to go
outside.

509
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:39,280
But anyways.
Oh,

510
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:43,060
now I probably lost my place.
All right.

511
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,330
Dogs smell.
Where were we going with that?

512
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,090
Rats.
Yes.

513
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,030
And what's that?
Frozen?

514
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,601
Yes.
Okay.

515
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:53,860
So the rat,
that's the one,

516
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,143
that's the one.
So the rod is in its cage and it's 

517
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,900
frozen so that nothing can see it and 
eat it.

518
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:04,030
And so it starts to sniff because it 
uses smell to see what's going on.

519
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:04,923
And so if you take rats that have never 
been exposed to a cat and you like blow 

520
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,640
cat odor over them,
they do not like that at all.

521
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,210
They didn't not like cat odor.
So it's built right into,

522
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:18,580
it's an archetype.
The Predator cat is an archetype for the

523
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,414
rat and it doesn't need any,
any pre-training to respond to it and 

524
00:30:22,631 --> 00:30:23,464
it's probably also the case with human 
beings and things like snakes and 

525
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,913
looming objects.
We've got some archetipal predators as 

526
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,100
well,
but all right,

527
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:34,210
so the rat sniffs and then if nothing 
happens that thinks okay,

528
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,363
a rad can sniff here without dying.
And so then it starts to relax a little 

529
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:41,020
bit.
Maybe it starts to move around a bit and

530
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:41,883
it thanks.
Okay.

531
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,880
A sniffing wrap that's moving a little 
bit can live here without dying and then

532
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:46,714
nothing else happens and so it relaxes a
bit more and then it starts to sniff 

533
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:50,314
it's way around and it'll sniff all 
around the cage and check out all the 

534
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:53,854
corners and make sure that there isn't 
anything there that can eat it because 

535
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,000
the rat actually cares about that.

536
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:03,180
And then when it's completely explored 
the cage and decided that it's safe,

537
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,050
then it turns into a normal calm rat.
But that's post exploration.

538
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:09,310
So you have to say,
well,

539
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:12,880
a rat that has thoroughly explored it's 
territory is a calm rat.

540
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,460
That's a whole different way of looking 
about fear.

541
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:20,020
Then you turn the light on and shock it 
and the rat thinks you're wrong.

542
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,183
It's not safe here in that light 
indicates so indicates that it's not 

543
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:24,544
safe.
So basically what you've done is 

544
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,300
reminded the rack that life is 
dangerous.

545
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,140
You have not taught it fear.
It's not the same thing.

546
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,093
The rat knows everything about fear.
It learned that it was safe and it was 

547
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:39,550
wrong.
And that's a really,

548
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,803
really important thing to understand 
also about what you're like because you 

549
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:48,970
know per like anxiety that needs no 
explanation,

550
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,370
depression that needs no explanation.

551
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,050
What needs explanation is,
how the hell do you ever feel secure and

552
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:59,890
together ever because that's the 
mystery.

553
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,160
And partly the way you do that is by 
never going anywhere where you're upset,

554
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,923
you stay in your territory.
And so like this is your territory and 

555
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,180
everyone knows how to act here,
right?

556
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:11,014
So you look around it and everyone's 
sitting and doing exactly the same 

557
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,250
thing.
So you can ignore them.

558
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,340
You can pretend that they're not 
dangerous and most of the time that will

559
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:23,530
be correct and some of the time it won't
be,

560
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,143
and so you maintain your emotional 
stability by staying where you belong 

561
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,850
and that's quite different than the 
psychoanalytic view.

562
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,390
Psychoanalytic view.
You know that you're.

563
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:40,310
You're calm and well put together.
If your psyche is properly organized.

564
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:43,190
It's like,
this is partly why I introduced you guys

565
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,680
to piaget because Piaget adds this other
element,

566
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:46,970
you know,
he says something like,

567
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,073
yeah,
well your psyche has to be organized 

568
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,990
properly so you have to turn.

569
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,883
You have to have turned everything that 
is a constituent element of you into a 

570
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:58,310
functional being,
but that being has to be integrated in a

571
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,144
functional game like landscape made of 
other people who are doing the same 

572
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:03,884
thing.
And then it's the concordance between 

573
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:09,500
your structure and that landscape that 
makes you emotionally regulated.

574
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,190
That's a way different theory.
It's a much more sophisticated theory.

575
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:16,130
So you could say in some sense the 
psychoanalysts had it half right.

576
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,633
You know,
and also you can be individually 

577
00:33:19,191 --> 00:33:22,040
pathological in a way that doesn't let 
you fit into society.

578
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,113
But you have to understand the 
concordance between the social 

579
00:33:24,981 --> 00:33:27,920
organization and the Individual 
Organization to get the.

580
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,240
To get the picture right.
Well,

581
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:34,220
so what are the existentialists say?
Well,

582
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,550
it's something like in the depths of 
your existential terror,

583
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,430
the wisdom to cope with that terror will
be found.

584
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,850
So that's the fundamental idea.
And then there's a.

585
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,953
there's a,
a more profound idea in that which I 

586
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:52,850
would also say is implicit in,
in psychotherapy,

587
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,420
the more behavioral the psychotherapy,
the more implicit it is.

588
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,980
But the idea is that

589
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,310
despite the fact that you are 
mismatched,

590
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:07,060
that you're outmatched by,
let's call it existential complexity.

591
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,720
There's something in you that's far more
complex than you know,

592
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,333
and if you challenge it,
it will respond by growing and 

593
00:34:14,381 --> 00:34:15,214
developing.
And that will not protect you against 

594
00:34:17,471 --> 00:34:18,304
the existential anxiety.
It's not like a shield or a guard that 

595
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,930
you're,
that you're hiding behind.

596
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:23,913
It's not a defense.
What happens instead is that you 

597
00:34:25,871 --> 00:34:27,820
actually learn how to deal with it.
You know,

598
00:34:27,821 --> 00:34:28,654
so you think about it this way.
One of the things that human beings are 

599
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,223
archetipal,
he related to his fire and of course 

600
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,140
fire is something to be afraid of 
because it,

601
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,290
it will burn you and it will burn 
everything down,

602
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,740
but by the same token,
when we mastered fire,

603
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:45,574
which may have been 2 million years ago,
something like that because it looks 

604
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:49,600
like it was about then that we learned 
how to cook,

605
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,160
which made a big difference.

606
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,190
So you know how chimps,
I haven't totally the chimps story,

607
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,120
I don't think,
you know,

608
00:34:55,121 --> 00:34:55,954
chimps are sort of shaped like this.
They've got this huge barrel shaped 

609
00:34:58,691 --> 00:34:59,890
body.
Well yeah,

610
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,740
they spend like 12 hours a day chewing 
leaves.

611
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,760
And why is that?
Because you go out in the forest and eat

612
00:35:06,761 --> 00:35:09,790
leaves and see how much you have to 
choose so you don't starve to death.

613
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:13,360
It's like leaves aren't edible.
They hardly have any nourishment at all.

614
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:16,480
And so if you're a chimp,
all you do is sit around and chew leaves

615
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,920
and then you need to have an intestinal 
track that could wrap two or three times

616
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,980
around this room so that you can digest 
the damn things right.

617
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:26,500
So that's chimp life.
While human beings,

618
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:31,390
we decided to trade intestinal length 
for brain and the way we did that was by

619
00:35:31,391 --> 00:35:34,060
learning how to cook and we mastered 
fire.

620
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,320
And so you might say,
well,

621
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,680
is fire dangerous?
And the to that is.

622
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,840
Well,
it depends on how you react to it.

623
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,250
It's exactly that,
right?

624
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,560
You say,
well fire is intrinsically dangerous.

625
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:46,830
It's like no,
fire is multi valence.

626
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,693
It has all sorts of possibilities and 
some of them are extraordinarily 

627
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:51,174
destructive.
But if you match your behavior properly 

628
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:56,430
to the phenomena,
then you can master something like fire.

629
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,773
Well.
So the idea is that there's a potential 

630
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:00,264
inside you.
Whatever inside means there's a 

631
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:05,430
potential that's part of you,
some of it's genetic potential,

632
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,520
and we know that because if we move you 
into a new environment,

633
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:12,480
new genes will turn on inside of you and
manufacturer new parts of you.

634
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,750
So if you stress yourself optimally,
if you push yourself out into the world,

635
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,420
you can incorporate information from 
that journey.

636
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,210
You're the exploration.
That's a Piagetian idea,

637
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:24,480
right?

638
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,440
You,
you go out,

639
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,630
you learn something new.
When you adjust your behavior to it.

640
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:30,060
And you adjust your concepts to it and 
then you can master it.

641
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,253
But what piaget didn't realize was that 
it also transforms your biological 

642
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:39,150
structure at a microscopic level merely 
as a consequence of being put in the new

643
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:39,984
situation.
So the idea is that there's more to you 

644
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,074
than you know,
and the way you call it out is by 

645
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:48,840
challenging yourself voluntarily in as 
many directions as you can manage.

646
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,740
And that's a real thing.
It isn't the construction of defenses.

647
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,770
It's not something artificial like 
defense against death,

648
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:56,604
anxiety.
It's actually how you learn to cope in 

649
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,634
the world.
And the existentialists I would say 

650
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,274
despite their exceptional pessimism were
in some sense unbelievably optimistic 

651
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,674
because what they would say,
it's the opposite of a straw man 

652
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:10,650
argument.
They would say,

653
00:37:10,651 --> 00:37:11,340
well,
how?

654
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,320
How weaker human beings ultimately week 
we're,

655
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,830
we're up against an opponent,
so to speak,

656
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,300
social opponents say which would be the 
crushing weight of society and a natural

657
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,230
opponent that is nature,
which overwhelms you were up against the

658
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:27,270
ultimate opponent.
But.

659
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,940
And so in that sense we're 
extraordinarily weak.

660
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:33,750
But it turns out that if we face that 
opponent or that series of opponents,

661
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,853
then all sorts of possibilities manifest
themselves inside of us and it isn't 

662
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:39,414
clear what the upper limits are to that.
So it's so interesting that it's a good 

663
00:37:44,101 --> 00:37:46,440
example of how if you face what you're 
afraid of,

664
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:47,780
you can find what you need.
He said,

665
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:48,614
well,
the existentialist make the strongest 

666
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:53,070
case possible for,
for the vulnerability of human beings.

667
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,083
And out of that,
the extract out the strongest case 

668
00:37:55,951 --> 00:37:56,784
possible.
Why human beings are strong and 

669
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,530
powerful.
It's very interesting paradox.

670
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,573
And again,
I would say that that's central to 

671
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:05,610
psychotherapy.
One of the things you,

672
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,050
one of the things that's been learned 
about agoraphobic,

673
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,920
for example,
agoraphobic,

674
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,110
they're usually women.
They're usually in their forties.

675
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:13,944
They've usually been dependent,
often someone close to them as divorced 

676
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:20,340
or died or they're having heart 
palpitations or something like that.

677
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,300
Sometimes as a consequence of menopause 
and they've,

678
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,970
they've accustomed themselves to seeking
authority when challenged.

679
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,930
But the problem with having heart 
palpitations is like,

680
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,040
who's going to help you with that?
Well,

681
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:35,490
maybe you go to the emergency room and 
that is what agoraphobic do.

682
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,483
Most agoraphobic,
so have been to the emergency room like 

683
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:41,080
a dozen times because they have heart 
palpitations and then they feel them.

684
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,123
Then they get afraid and panic.
Then their heart rate goes way up and 

685
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:46,450
then they think,
oh my God,

686
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm going to die and while I do it while
I die,

687
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,474
I'm going to make an absolute fool of 
myself and everyone's going to laugh at 

688
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:52,060
me.

689
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,870
So that's social rejection and 
biological mortality.

690
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:58,840
Staring them right in the face.
Well,

691
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,674
so then you take an agoraphobic and you 
find out her background because as I 

692
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:06,910
said,
it's usually women and then you start to

693
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:09,850
expose that person to the things that 
she's afraid of.

694
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,950
Elevators,
maybe subways,

695
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,023
taxis actually agoraphobic.
Really what happens is they're not 

696
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,120
really so much afraid of of places or 
things.

697
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,343
What they're afraid of is being trapped 
in a place or a situation where they 

698
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,880
can't get away and then if they had a 
heart attack,

699
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:29,710
they wouldn't be able to get to an 
emergency ward.

700
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,440
So that's really at the basis of the 
fear and so on.

701
00:39:33,441 --> 00:39:34,274
The emergency roared reward thing only 
helps to a limited degree because if 

702
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,490
you're having a heart attack and it's a 
really good one,

703
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,653
your dad and so the.
So that's a place where recourse to 

704
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:45,850
authority is only going to take you so 
far.

705
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:46,721
Right?
So it's a,

706
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:49,360
it's a,
it's not a good solution to the problem.

707
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,770
Well,
so what do you do?

708
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,473
Well,
you expose the person maybe to an 

709
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:58,600
elevator and you know,
maybe the elevator is there and you tell

710
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:01,810
them,
well can you get on an elevator?

711
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:02,644
And they say no.
Say Well can you look at an elevator 

712
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:04,930
while?
I don't think so.

713
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,670
Well,
how about some pictures of an elevator?

714
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,504
So you show them some pictures of an 
elevator on Google and maybe one with 

715
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:11,734
closed doors and one with open doors and
you have them look at the damn thing 

716
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:18,250
because they won't want to look.
They'll want to look away,

717
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,430
but you can't look away.
You have to investigate it.

718
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:24,400
And then what your brain learns is that 
you're afraid of that thing,

719
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:27,460
but you can scan it with your eyes and 
nothing happens.

720
00:40:27,461 --> 00:40:31,060
It's like the rat in the cage sniffing 
and realizing,

721
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,650
well,
he can sniff it and he doesn't die.

722
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,560
It's like you can look at the picture of
an elevator and you don't die.

723
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,350
Well,
you do that until you're bored and not.

724
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:43,330
That's then you've learned that you can 
look at that elevator without dying.

725
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,553
It's built right into you.
Well then maybe I can take you out and 

726
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,770
we'll look at a real elevator.
And so you.

727
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,411
I say,
well,

728
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:52,840
let's walk as close to that elevator is 
you can manage.

729
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,600
I want you right on the edge between 
order and chaos.

730
00:40:55,601 --> 00:40:57,610
Let's say.
I want you to find that edge.

731
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,230
Can you.
Can you stand here?

732
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,790
Yes.
How about here?

733
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,710
Yes.
How about that's good enough.

734
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,870
Okay.
You're standing here,

735
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,500
order chaos.
That's where you're at.

736
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,490
So what happens?
You stand there and you notice you don't

737
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:15,430
die and you do that long enough so 
you're bored with it.

738
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,091
And then you think,
well,

739
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:18,280
can you step three feet closer?

740
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:19,900
Yes,
you can.

741
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,300
Well,
and maybe after three weeks you say,

742
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,620
well,
we're by the door,

743
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:24,454
so here's the deal.
I'm going to open that door and I'm 

744
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,590
going to hold it open and I'm not going 
to play a trick on you,

745
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:33,470
and so what you're going to do is just 
poke your head in and take a around,

746
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:36,140
and so imagine doing that.
Okay,

747
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,190
so you imagine it.
Okay,

748
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:40,340
now actually do it.
Then I know I don't let go of the door.

749
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,510
That's what evil psychotherapists do 
anyways.

750
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,733
Then you get the person inside and what 
you see is they're looking at their 

751
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,100
shoes.
They're in there,

752
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:50,390
but they're not really in there.
He say,

753
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,691
no,
no,

754
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,200
no.
You gotta.

755
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,690
Look,
you gotta.

756
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,990
Look in the corners.
You've got to look at the numbers.

757
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,110
You've got to see that you're in this 
thing that you're afraid of,

758
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,290
and so you have them look around and 
look around and look around.

759
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,860
They're like the rat coming,
relaxing and starting to move.

760
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:04,611
Then you say,
well,

761
00:42:04,611 --> 00:42:07,040
that's good enough.
You can get out of the elevator slowly.

762
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:09,680
Don't rush out.
Just go out Carmley.

763
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,600
Good enough.
Go home,

764
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,390
sleep for a week and then come back and 
we'll do it again.

765
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:15,224
And then if you do that for it depends 
on how fast the person is capable of 

766
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,253
advancing,
but you can move people through phobias 

767
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,873
pretty fast if they trust you and they 
have to trust you and you have to be 

768
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,750
careful.
You say you say to them,

769
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:27,584
look,
we will stop doing this whenever you 

770
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:31,220
want.
As soon as you say so.

771
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,770
So this is,
this is completely up to you.

772
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,130
I'm not pushing you.
I've got no demands on you.

773
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,920
You want to be able to go outside again,
we're gonna.

774
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,220
Walk through that,
but you're not performing for me.

775
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,320
This isn't a test,
this isn't a contest,

776
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,540
it's none of that.
And when you're done,

777
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,080
we're done.
And you know,

778
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,820
you can also have help people like step 
through that.

779
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:53,654
So I was treating someone who had a 
needle phobia recently and this person 

780
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,463
really felt trapped by authority figures
that were medical and this person had 

781
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:02,804
their reasons for it.
And so the first thing I did because we 

782
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,014
were working with this needle was say 
you're going to practice getting the 

783
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:11,270
hell out of here.
So I'll come at you.

784
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,880
I'll come at you with this needle,
you know,

785
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,830
I don't have a needle,
but we'll pretend I do.

786
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:16,664
Okay.
So I'm going to move it towards you and 

787
00:43:17,601 --> 00:43:18,434
you're going to tell me to stop and 
you're going to leave the room because 

788
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:22,730
you want to see that you can't,
you know,

789
00:43:22,731 --> 00:43:23,541
and the person will think,
well,

790
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,200
I know I can.

791
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,651
It's like,
no,

792
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:25,484
you don't.
No,

793
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,473
you don't know.
And so we're going to practice it just 

794
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:29,504
like a kid pretending.
And so I moved forward with the 

795
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:36,500
nonexistent needle and they say stop.
And I stopped and they say I'm leaving.

796
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:40,130
And they leave and they come back and 
they're smiling because they didn't know

797
00:43:40,131 --> 00:43:41,750
they could do that.
You know,

798
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:44,450
in part of them is still thinking,
well I'm a four year old kid and there's

799
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:45,960
no way I can get out of here.
No one's gonna.

800
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:48,020
Listen to me.
It's built right into them.

801
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:51,050
That's like Freud and regression or 
fixation.

802
00:43:51,051 --> 00:43:54,340
At an earlier developmental stages,
if you watch that with you,

803
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,410
watch for that in people.
Sometimes you can see how old they are,

804
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,370
you know,
if you.

805
00:43:58,371 --> 00:44:01,040
If you tap into something that they were
afraid of very young,

806
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,580
their whole facial expression will turn 
into that person their body language and

807
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:05,210
everything.

808
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,730
It's very interesting to watch very 
carefully to see it,

809
00:44:07,731 --> 00:44:11,390
but you can definitely see it.
So okay.

810
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,750
So with the agoraphobic you think,
well you treat the Agora phobic,

811
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,530
you know,
and then she can go take taxis and she'd

812
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:21,380
go on the subway and then she goes and 
has a big fight with her husband because

813
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:22,214
she showed it had 1:20 years ago.
But she was dependent and authority 

814
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:26,594
seeking so she never would risk it 
because if she upset the relationship 

815
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,950
with authority that it would expose her 
to the world.

816
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
And so she was always in a subordinate 
and inferior position and a bit of a 

817
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,400
slave.
And one of the things that often happens

818
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:40,240
when you treat someone with Agora 
Phobias,

819
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,300
they get a lot more assertive and you 
think,

820
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:43,134
well,
one of the things the psychoanalysts 

821
00:44:45,691 --> 00:44:46,524
objected to when the behaviors started 
to use exposure therapy as a treatment 

822
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:50,904
was the idea that there would be 
substitution because the psychoanalyst 

823
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,950
would say,
you're not really afraid of an elevator.

824
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,413
So if I just treat your elevator fear 
because that's really not what you're 

825
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:00,954
afraid of,
the fear is just going to pop up 

826
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:04,470
somewhere else.
That'd be symbolic substitution.

827
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:05,543
But that isn't what happened.
What happened was is that if they learn 

828
00:45:07,981 --> 00:45:08,814
to get on the elevator,
they are much more likely to take a 

829
00:45:10,171 --> 00:45:11,700
taxi.
You think,

830
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:12,690
well,
why is that?

831
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,380
It's because they weren't learning.
The things were less frightening.

832
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,214
That was the original idea.
The original idea was counter 

833
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,153
conditioning that basically the person 
had been conditioned to be afraid of 

834
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,353
whatever it was and then what you did 
was you put them in an encounter with 

835
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:29,514
that and you let them breathe and relax 
and then the relaxation they learned 

836
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,330
would counteract the panic.
And that's why exposure therapy work.

837
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:38,370
But it turned out you didn't need to do 
any of that.

838
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,530
It wasn't counter conditioning at all.

839
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,700
And so then you think,
well,

840
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:44,520
it's fear reduction or habituation.
That was the next theory.

841
00:45:44,521 --> 00:45:48,810
Habituation is just take a snail.
He comes out of his shell,

842
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:49,823
you poke them,
he goes into his shell and he comes out 

843
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,830
to get poke sell.
You tease a snail if you,

844
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,713
if you,
you know,

845
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,770
if you ever need to know that.
So he comes out and you tap them and you

846
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:01,570
do that 10 or 15 times the snail gets 
bored and you tap him.

847
00:46:01,571 --> 00:46:02,404
He just sits there.
Now he doesn't get bored because snails 

848
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,550
are probably always,
always board.

849
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:09,300
But what's happened is that you've,
in some sense,

850
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,880
you've exhausted the nervous system 
representation.

851
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,193
That's one way of thinking about it.
Or you can think about it as a very 

852
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,100
simple form of learning.
That's habituation.

853
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,710
It's learn,
you learn to ignore.

854
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,330
And the idea then for a while was that 
you were teaching people to habituate to

855
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:27,630
these things they were afraid of,
but that also turned out not to be true.

856
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:28,703
What you're actually doing is teaching 
the person to be brave and that 

857
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,024
generalizes,
so what happens is they think they're 

858
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:36,830
all pathetic and and,
and,

859
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,693
and fear ridden and tiny and vulnerable 
and useless and and so they're acting 

860
00:46:42,961 --> 00:46:44,430
like that and then you say,
well look,

861
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,170
this is a horrible thing you've got 
here.

862
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,663
Why don't we see if you can manage it?
And so they go through it and they 

863
00:46:49,621 --> 00:46:50,101
think,
wow,

864
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:51,440
I could do that.
Hi,

865
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,463
I'm not as useless as I thought,
and then maybe they try 20 things like 

866
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:55,620
that and they think,
wow,

867
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:56,454
I'm a lot tougher than I knew I was.
Maybe they stand up a little bit 

868
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:01,750
straighter because they're a little more
dominant in their serotonin system.

869
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:02,584
Start to work again,
and then they're ready to take on the 

870
00:47:04,381 --> 00:47:06,360
world more.
And so maybe that's why they go home and

871
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:07,194
have a fight with their stupid husband 
and that doesn't necessarily make him 

872
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:10,710
very happy either.

873
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,040
And that would be a,
an example of psychotherapy,

874
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:14,913
pubic resistance from a family member.
Do you really want your person to be 

875
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:19,350
better?
Right.

876
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,510
If they are a little more assertive and 
little less fearful,

877
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:22,344
you might not be able to tyrannize over 
them so easily and so it's not 

878
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:27,210
necessarily the case at all that you 
would be happy about that,

879
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:29,200
so you've got to watch that sort of 
thing too,

880
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:30,034
and maybe the person wouldn't even be 
that happy about it because they're 

881
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:36,940
getting all sorts of secondary benefits 
from being neurotic and martyred because

882
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,000
that's how vicious weapon to be weak and
useless.

883
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:43,600
If you can wield that as a weapon,
it's extraordinarily effective.

884
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,793
So you gotta watch for that sort of 
thing to be working against your 

885
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:51,601
psychotherapeutic aims as well.
Like Psychoanalysis,

886
00:47:52,171 --> 00:47:53,004
existentialism seeks to utilize these 
very conflicts as avenues to the more 

887
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:59,610
profound self understanding of mat.
In many ways,

888
00:47:59,611 --> 00:48:03,570
existential invisible existentialism is 
the unique and specific portrayal of the

889
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:05,940
psychological predicament of 
Contemporary Matt.

890
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,600
Okay,
so that relates back to the idea that

891
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,263
modern people have been stripped of 
their archaic belief systems that are 

892
00:48:15,031 --> 00:48:20,031
exposed more completely to to the 
possibility of a meaningless and painful

893
00:48:23,461 --> 00:48:25,920
existence with no superordinate,
meaning.

894
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:29,783
Existentialism is not a school of 
thought nor reduceable to one set of 

895
00:48:32,281 --> 00:48:33,114
tenants.
The three writers who appear invariably 

896
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,200
on every list of existentialists,
existentialist,

897
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,363
Heidegger,
and Sartre are not in agreement on 

898
00:48:40,141 --> 00:48:40,974
essentials,
such a legend precursors as Pascal and 

899
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:47,310
kierkegaard differed from all three men 
by being dedicated Christians and Pascal

900
00:48:47,311 --> 00:48:51,090
was a catholic of sorts while 
Kierkegaard was a Protestant Protestant.

901
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:55,110
If there's often done Nietzsche and 
Dostoevsky or included in the fold,

902
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,590
then we must make room for an 
impassioned Antichristian,

903
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:03,270
Nicha and an even more fanatical Greek 
Orthodox Russian imperialist.

904
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,550
That's a little hard on Dostoevsky I 
would say,

905
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,384
but by the time we consider adding real 
key CAFCA Ortega and come to it became 

906
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,843
plain that one essential features shared
by all these men is their preferred 

907
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,420
individualism.
Well,

908
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:18,000
so that's another element of 
existentialism.

909
00:49:18,001 --> 00:49:23,001
The locale of action is in the 
individual and the idea is that well,

910
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,670
you're faded in some sense to suffer and
to be vulnerable as an individual.

911
00:49:28,861 --> 00:49:33,750
And so the right unit of analysis for 
people is as individuals,

912
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,643
and again,
I would say that's a primary tenant of 

913
00:49:36,001 --> 00:49:38,820
psychotherapy.
There are family psychotherapy schools.

914
00:49:38,821 --> 00:49:39,654
For example,
but individual psychotherapy is 

915
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,354
predicated on the idea that the 
individual is the right level of 

916
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:47,490
analysis,
the correct level of analysis,

917
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,060
intense,
intense,

918
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,043
committed.

919
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,480
I can give you an interesting example of
this.

920
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,733
One of the things that you guys are 
going to do is you're going to do the 

921
00:49:59,111 --> 00:49:59,944
personality analysis,
which is part of this self authoring 

922
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:04,980
suite that my colleagues and I have have
developed.

923
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,273
If you take maps of meaning,
you would also do the future authoring 

924
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,124
exercise and we've done that for people,
mostly university students mostly in 

925
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,124
Europe.
So I want to tell you an interesting 

926
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,700
story and this has been replicated a 
couple of times.

927
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:22,720
So in the business school at at the 
Rotterdam School of Management,

928
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:23,554
we've tested.
We've put about 4,000 students through 

929
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:26,434
this future authoring program.
That helps you make a plan for three to 

930
00:50:29,091 --> 00:50:31,550
five years into the future.
A plan and a counter plan.

931
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,413
The plan is what you want to have happen
and the counter plan is what you really 

932
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,074
do not want to have happen,
and then you make a plan to avoid the 

933
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:40,280
ladder and to move towards the former.

934
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,653
And we compared their performance three 
years per students performance to the 

935
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:48,110
performance of students three years 
before that.

936
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:48,944
So it wasn't a perfect design,
although we also did a controlled study 

937
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:54,940
that had the same results.
So when,

938
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,853
when we started,
before we started having people do this 

939
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:00,470
plan here was the ranking of 
performance.

940
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,570
So we looked at ethnicity,
ethnicity,

941
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:03,404
and gender.
So the top performing people were Dutch 

942
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:10,550
national women and they were a minority 
among the business students and probably

943
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:13,280
a fairly selected minority.
So maybe that's what accounted for their

944
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:14,114
higher performance.
Although women tend to be outperforming 

945
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,773
men in academic institutions pretty much
all the way from elementary school 

946
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:22,370
through university now.
Just an absolute catastrophe.

947
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,160
But we won't talk about that now.
So.

948
00:51:25,161 --> 00:51:25,994
And then the next highest performing 
group were Dutch nationals and then the 

949
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:33,620
next highest performing group were 
nonwestern ethnic minority women and the

950
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:36,020
lowest performing group or West 
nonwestern,

951
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:38,300
west non ethnic minority men.

952
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:40,430
And there were quite a few people in all
those categories.

953
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:44,000
So it wasn't just even a couple dozen.
It was a couple of hundred solid study.

954
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,750
And within two years after doing the 
future authoring program,

955
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:51,590
the nonwestern ethnic minority men were 
outperforming the Dutch women.

956
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,833
They're their academic performance,
went up 70 percent and their dropout 

957
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,120
rate plummeted and it really looks good 
for decreasing dropout rate.

958
00:51:59,121 --> 00:51:59,954
And the reason I'm telling you about 
that is because people make the 

959
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:03,284
automatic assumption that ethnic 
disparities and ethnic performance are 

960
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,740
necessarily a consequence of 
sociological inequality,

961
00:52:09,741 --> 00:52:12,830
let's say,
or sociological or political or economic

962
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,653
disparity.
Let's say this was a pure psychological 

963
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:17,743
intervention.
It wiped out the difference completely 

964
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,873
and the Dutch women had actually 
improved slightly over that two year 

965
00:52:22,461 --> 00:52:24,830
period as a consequence of doing the 
program as well.

966
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,670
So the man not only caught up to the 
women the way they were performing,

967
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:33,671
but the way they were performing even 
better in the in the aftermath of having

968
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:34,874
a plant.

969
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:35,833
So our provisional theory,
we've replicated that at a couple of 

970
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:39,590
places.
It works better for men.

971
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,750
Now that's partly because women are 
already doing well,

972
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:45,380
but we have a hypothesis that men are 
ordinary enough so that unless they have

973
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:47,630
their own plan and they just won't 
perform.

974
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:49,423
I think it's associated with 
disagreeableness now we don't know that 

975
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,780
for sure because we haven't been able to
disentangle that,

976
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:57,600
but it's been a very striking finding.
So anyway,

977
00:52:57,601 --> 00:52:58,580
so you can say,
well,

978
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,414
what's the right level of analysis when 
you're trying to to improve human 

979
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,570
adaptation?
Terrible word,

980
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:06,404
but,
but,

981
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,053
but,
but it'll do for now because I can't 

982
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:12,800
think of another one.
So

983
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,370
the refusal to belong to any school of 
thought,

984
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:19,580
the repudiation of the adequacy of any 
body of beliefs,

985
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:20,683
whatever and especially of systems and a
market dissatisfaction with traditional 

986
00:53:24,141 --> 00:53:27,120
philosophy as academic and remote from 
life.

987
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,163
That's the heart of existentialism and I
think that if you're a good 

988
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:35,970
psychotherapist,
you take an existential approach to your

989
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:36,804
clients and that's why listening is so 
important as well because it's really 

990
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:41,094
useful to have a body of theories about 
what might be up with a person and how 

991
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:46,674
you might approach the problem and to 
have a whole array of psychotherapeutic 

992
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:53,760
tools.
So those would be the.

993
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,300
The theories that we've been discussing 
opens up your,

994
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,580
your.
It makes you more skilled,

995
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,140
it gives you more,
more to offer,

996
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,213
but you've got to be careful not to 
hammer the person into one of those 

997
00:54:04,411 --> 00:54:05,244
schools.
Now,

998
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:06,293
sometimes that's useful because if 
someone comes to you and they're just 

999
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:10,410
chaotic,
they've got no structure at all.

1000
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:11,453
If you approach them as if their 
problems were Friday and at least it's 

1001
00:54:14,281 --> 00:54:15,114
systematic and they can come out with a 
systematic understanding of their 

1002
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:20,250
problem and it might match to some 
degree,

1003
00:54:20,251 --> 00:54:21,084
like you know,
if you're having all sorts of anxiety 

1004
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:23,454
and depression problems,
we could probably look into your family 

1005
00:54:25,711 --> 00:54:30,150
history and identify reasons why that 
might be at least partly the case and so

1006
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,040
at at least a reasonable.

1007
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,933
Maybe there's multiple reasons,
but at least nailing one of them would 

1008
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:37,140
be useful.
More useful than nailing none of them.

1009
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,950
So.
But what's better is to treat the person

1010
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,793
as someone you don't know.
You have no idea what's up with this 

1011
00:54:43,621 --> 00:54:44,454
person,
but you have a bunch of potential tools 

1012
00:54:46,471 --> 00:54:47,304
to use and then you talk to them and you
treat them as if they're unique and 

1013
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:53,940
you've figured out what is up with them.
Specifically,

1014
00:54:53,941 --> 00:54:55,690
and they tell you what's up with him,
you know,

1015
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,543
they've got all sorts of cockeyed 
theories about who they are and what 

1016
00:54:58,381 --> 00:54:59,214
they're doing and it's scattered and 
paradoxical and it doesn't make much 

1017
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:05,310
sense and it's like a bad undergraduate 
essay.

1018
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:06,570
Roughly speaking.
It's full.

1019
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:09,750
Well really it's full of internal 
contradictions and it's incoherent,

1020
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,050
but if you listen long enough,
that stops being the case.

1021
00:55:13,051 --> 00:55:13,884
The person starts to pull themselves 
together with their representation and 

1022
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:19,860
they start to act that out properly and 
that's great,

1023
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,753
so that that's.
That's you could consider that applied 

1024
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:24,690
existentialism.

1025
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,730
Now
the other thing,

1026
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:31,740
the existentialists,
that kind of romantic,

1027
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:32,574
I would say even the Romantics are are 
thinkers who who deny the overarching 

1028
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,100
supremacy of rationality and the 
intellect.

1029
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,233
They would say that to think about life 
as a problem that is to be solved 

1030
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,284
rationally is insufficient because 
you're not a rational being or you're 

1031
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,824
only partly a rational being.
You're also an emotional being and 

1032
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:53,034
you're a motivated being and you're an 
embodied being and that's a lot 

1033
00:55:55,471 --> 00:55:56,304
different than being purely rational and
I would say there's actually not even 

1034
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:01,940
debate about that anymore because it,
it,

1035
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:02,823
it's pretty damn clear that rationality 
cannot really operate unless it's 

1036
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:09,540
embodied.
So it has a,

1037
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:10,763
it has a set of operations that it can 
undertake that it's motivated so that 

1038
00:56:14,941 --> 00:56:17,200
there's certain things it's doing and 
other things that aren't,

1039
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,240
that it isn't,
that it's emotional because emotions are

1040
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,793
low resolution,
quick solutions to problems that can't 

1041
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:26,860
be computed.

1042
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,933
So for example,
we get in an argument and we just can't 

1043
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,290
go anywhere and at some point you say,
well to hell with you,

1044
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:34,820
I'm going home.
You're angry when.

1045
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:35,411
Well,
no,

1046
00:56:35,411 --> 00:56:37,660
but you don't have to have the stupid 
argument anymore.

1047
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,494
So the anger is actually,
it's a way of popping you out of a 

1048
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:43,930
rational framework that there's no 
escaping from.

1049
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,741
You just say,
well,

1050
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:48,760
this is stupid and you leave.
It's like there's nothing rational about

1051
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:49,594
that except that you don't want to stand
there and argue till you starve to 

1052
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,020
death.
So.

1053
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:54,993
So we need the emotions to give you 
guides in situations that you can't 

1054
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:00,244
really compute your way through,
so and only inside of that does 

1055
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:04,323
rationality operate with all of those 
underlying predicates and the 

1056
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,314
rationality has to be informed by the 
body and by the motivations and by the 

1057
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,790
emotions for it to even operate.

1058
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,150
So the existentialists are correct about
that too.

1059
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:20,740
To deny rationality as the fundamental 
principle of orientation.

1060
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,440
That doesn't mean that irrationality is 
the right approach.

1061
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,540
It means that rationality has to be 
augmented by other elements of being.

1062
00:57:28,541 --> 00:57:29,374
I'll almost have subjective big,
and that's akin to the psychoanalytic 

1063
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,614
viewpoint too,
that you have to integrate your drives 

1064
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,930
and emotions,
especially anger and sexuality into your

1065
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,580
personality.
And also akin to Piaget's idea that this

1066
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:45,130
subpersonalities,
the reflexes and so forth have to be,

1067
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,340
you know,
jen have to be organized into a playable

1068
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,530
game so that everything is working in 
harmony.

1069
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:51,723
So it's a similar idea.
Now the existentialists regard the 

1070
00:57:55,691 --> 00:57:56,524
division between object and subject as 
part of what specifically torturing 

1071
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:04,090
people who are outside of say,
traditional systems of belief.

1072
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,010
Because,
and this is a tricky one,

1073
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,373
you know,
scientists might claim that while the 

1074
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:10,473
world has material and matter is spent 
essentially dead and without spirit or 

1075
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,030
or,
or psyche,

1076
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,493
but,
and it's easy as a consequence of 

1077
00:58:19,661 --> 00:58:22,450
adopting that viewpoint to think the 
same thing about you,

1078
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:23,284
that you're ultimately a shortlived 
material entity in a meaningless 

1079
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:28,060
material world.

1080
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,240
But the weird thing about that,
and this is where thinking about is that

1081
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,220
if you're a scientist,
you throw away this objective as soon as

1082
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:39,490
you start operating the science because 
the idea is,

1083
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:40,324
well,
you'll watch something according to a 

1084
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:42,544
procedure and you'll watch it and you'll
watch it and you'll watch it and we're 

1085
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:45,754
only going to allow what all have you 
experienced the same way to be real 

1086
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:53,690
while you throw out the subjective right
at the beginning and then you.

1087
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,880
So you can't say,
well,

1088
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:55,714
there's no subject left in what results.
It's the reason there's nothing left in 

1089
00:58:59,741 --> 00:59:02,080
what results is because you throw it out
to begin with.

1090
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,600
Now the question is,
what should you do with it?

1091
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:05,980
When the existentialists say,
well,

1092
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:09,100
you're alive.
You can't just dispense with it.

1093
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,113
The fact that you're alive is the 
critical issue and so you can use 

1094
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:18,331
science as a tool which is proper,
but if you use it as a way of describing

1095
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:20,104
being well,
then you fall into this subject object 

1096
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:22,694
dichotomy and underneath that is 
nihilism or the proclivity for 

1097
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:28,220
totalitarianism,
so they don't like that idea.

1098
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,350
They don't like the idea of 
compartmentalization for people either,

1099
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,930
but we won't go into that to any great 
degree.

1100
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,153
Okay.
Now I'm going to read you some things 

1101
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:45,970
from some of the people that I described
and we'll take them apart a little bit.

1102
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,120
Things I've been collecting for a long 
period of time.

1103
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,523
So this is Nietzsche,
Dostoevsky and Kierkegaard and I called 

1104
00:59:54,641 --> 00:59:57,400
them prophets of the dawning age care.
Kguard.

1105
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:58,323
The Danish philosopher and writer was 
really the first person who wrote about 

1106
01:00:02,981 --> 01:00:05,810
phenomena like anxiety,
dread and,

1107
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:06,311
and,
and,

1108
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,144
and more particularly.
So he was the first person to sort of 

1109
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:11,074
conceptualized it as a,
as even as something akin to a 

1110
01:00:13,721 --> 01:00:16,330
scientific phenomena.
Something that had existence.

1111
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,710
And he wrote very much about that.

1112
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:20,613
Nature,
of course was the great prophet of the 

1113
01:00:22,331 --> 01:00:23,164
death of God.
And and a prognosticator of what the 

1114
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:27,364
psychological consequences of the demise
of this classic meaning structure that 

1115
01:00:32,831 --> 01:00:33,664
was unbelievably ancient.
What what the collapse of that actually 

1116
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,684
meant to meet you meet you can think 
about Christianity and then maybe you 

1117
01:00:39,731 --> 01:00:43,600
could think about the Judaism that was 
embedded in as it even an older system,

1118
01:00:43,870 --> 01:00:46,810
but that judy is an emerged out of the 
Middle East,

1119
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:47,644
partly out of Egypt,
which was it immeshed and even an older 

1120
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:51,303
belief system and that was in meshed in 
something absolutely prehistoric that 

1121
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,913
and so it was a continuum in some sense 
of adaptive structures that reigned 

1122
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:06,730
supreme essentially right until while 
right until the scientific revolution,

1123
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,773
and so we're outside of that now we're 
in a different paradigm and there are 

1124
01:01:10,061 --> 01:01:10,894
consequences to that and that was the 
sort of thing that Nisha was 

1125
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:14,560
concentrating on it.

1126
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,603
He actually in some ways made it worse 
because Nisha was an incredible critic 

1127
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:19,810
of Christianity.
I mean,

1128
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,033
he wrote a book called the antichrist 
and all he did in that book brilliantly 

1129
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:27,670
was take dogmatic Christianity to task.
Now,

1130
01:01:27,671 --> 01:01:28,504
one of the things he did say,
which was very interesting was that 

1131
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:31,833
Christianity died at its own hand,
so his notion was that because 

1132
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:36,694
Christianity say Judaeo,
Christianity had elevated truth to the 

1133
01:01:40,511 --> 01:01:44,770
highest virtue,
that that search for truth then ended up

1134
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:47,470
undermining the axioms of Christianity 
itself.

1135
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:52,710
So it developed a tool,
an unbelievably powerful analytic tool,

1136
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,610
and then used it to.
Well,

1137
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,970
it's like we were sitting on a branch 
and started off with the saw that we had

1138
01:01:57,971 --> 01:02:01,690
invented and then everyone fell and 
Dostoevsky.

1139
01:02:01,691 --> 01:02:04,720
Well,
Dostoevsky was a orthodox Christian and,

1140
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:05,630
and,
but,

1141
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,880
and also an extraordinarily brilliant 
man and he was absolutely terrified at,

1142
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,723
uh,
at what the consequences of the 

1143
01:02:11,951 --> 01:02:16,120
dissolution of that belief system was 
going to mean for Russia in particular.

1144
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:21,180
And Dostoevsky explored nihilism,
great unit to great degree in notes from

1145
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,014
underground and in crime and punishment 
because the murderer and crime and 

1146
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:28,800
punishment is essentially nihilistic.
He's a nihilistic narcissist,

1147
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:29,634
roughly speaking,
and that's what compels them to commit 

1148
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:32,064
murder.
But Dostoevsky also wrote a book called 

1149
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:35,394
the Devil's,
which is an amazing book where he 

1150
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:37,734
predicted that the death of the sudden 
death of Christianity in the Soviet in 

1151
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:46,860
Russia was going to produce the 
catastrophic totalitarian horrors of the

1152
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,990
Soviet Union,
and he predicted that in like 18,

1153
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:49,980
80,
1890,

1154
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,900
which was 30 years before the 
revolution,

1155
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:53,520
absolutely remarkable

1156
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,913
nature,
a genius nature was a full professor 

1157
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:00,024
when that was impossible,
I think when he was 24 and that just 

1158
01:03:02,761 --> 01:03:05,580
never happened.
And so his.

1159
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:06,443
His extraordinary genius was recognized 
very early and but he was also 

1160
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:13,560
extraordinarily ill,
sick physically.

1161
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,540
His Dad died at about 40 something they 
called a softening of the brain,

1162
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,900
which was actually a fairly common 
diagnostic category back then.

1163
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,913
No one really knows what it was.
Some people have suggested that he had 

1164
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:30,270
syphilis from one sexual encounter or 
that it was hereditary,

1165
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,250
but nobody really knows.
But anyways,

1166
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:33,084
his father died.
Young and nature died very young as 

1167
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:35,544
well.
He went,

1168
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:36,443
he was very.
He was mentally incapacitated for the 

1169
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,040
last few years of his life and died and 
died after that.

1170
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:45,413
And so he could only serve as a 
professor for a while because he 

1171
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:48,684
couldn't see very well and he was always
sick and he ended up living in this 

1172
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:52,404
little village,
I believe in Switzerland where he wrote 

1173
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:54,984
his books and he could only write a 
paragraph or two at a time without 

1174
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,190
before he became very ill.

1175
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:03,210
And so his writing is extraordinary.
Condensed in dance and brilliant,

1176
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,010
brilliant.
And he's,

1177
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,780
I think he gave away,
I think,

1178
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:09,390
beyond good and evil,
which is his masterpiece,

1179
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:10,643
although we had many,
I think it only sold 500 copies in his 

1180
01:04:12,871 --> 01:04:14,550
lifetime.
So he,

1181
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,830
he also believed that he was only 
writing for himself.

1182
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:17,664
He didn't really know if anybody was 
ever going to pay any attention to what 

1183
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:21,270
he said,
but they certainly did.

1184
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,523
So I would say he was.
He ended up being certainly one of the 

1185
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:30,210
10 most influential people of the late 
19th and early 20th century.

1186
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:35,900
This is an example of his writing of 
what is great.

1187
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,840
One must either be silent or speak with 
greatness,

1188
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:43,810
with greatness.
That means cynically and with innocence.

1189
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,080
What I relate is the history of the next
two centuries.

1190
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,040
I described what is coming,
what can no longer come differently,

1191
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:55,740
the advent of nihilism,
our whole European culture

1192
01:04:57,630 --> 01:05:01,200
is moving from some time now,
moving for some time now with a tortured

1193
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,063
tension that is growing from decade to 
decade as towards a catastrophe 

1194
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,833
restlessly violently headlong like a 
river that wants to reach the end that 

1195
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:14,550
no longer reflects,
that's afraid to reflect.

1196
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:15,803
He that speaks here has conversely 
nothing so far but to reflect as a 

1197
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:24,340
philosopher and solitary by instinct who
has found his advantage in standing,

1198
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,174
aside outside.
Why has the advent of nihilism become 

1199
01:05:31,121 --> 01:05:31,954
necessary?
Sorry about that because the values we 

1200
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:36,424
have had hitherto thus draw their final 
consequence because nihilism represents 

1201
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:47,170
the ultimate logical conclusion of our 
great values and ideals.

1202
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,083
Because we must experience nihilism 
before we can find out what value those 

1203
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:56,920
values really had.
We require at some time,

1204
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:59,350
new values.
Nihilism stands at the door.

1205
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:05,500
Whence comes this uncanny of all guests.
Point of departure.

1206
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,113
This is a good example of how Nisha.
Nisha said he philosophized with a 

1207
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:13,700
hammer and and it's,
it's,

1208
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:17,640
it means that he spent hours,
days,

1209
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:18,474
weeks,
months concentrating on how to make a 

1210
01:06:20,611 --> 01:06:21,444
single sentence as packed with 
significance as he could possibly 

1211
01:06:24,571 --> 01:06:25,404
manage.
And so nature said it's the best 

1212
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,940
arrogant statement I've ever read.
He said,

1213
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,090
I can say in a sentence

1214
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,200
what it takes other people,
a whole book to say,

1215
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:41,980
and then he said what?
What they can't say in a whole book.

1216
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,330
That's pretty good day.
It's like the first one's a real blow to

1217
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:49,450
the solar plexus and the second one is 
like,

1218
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:52,480
I can top that with no problem.
Point of departure.

1219
01:06:52,481 --> 01:06:53,314
It is an error to consider social 
distress or physiological degeneration 

1220
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:59,260
or the corruption of all things as the 
cause of nihilism.

1221
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:01,623
That's a critique of the later Freudian 
ideas right there and then because what 

1222
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:05,263
niches says would look if things are 
going wrong for you or if they're going 

1223
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:08,944
wrong.
In general,

1224
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,740
it's really straightforward to say that,
well,

1225
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:15,520
there's something wrong with society 
that would be social distress or there's

1226
01:07:15,521 --> 01:07:16,354
some physiological degeneration.
There's some thing wrong with you 

1227
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,910
physically or everything is just 
corrupted.

1228
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:25,960
Being itself is corrupt,
which is a classic explanation,

1229
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:26,140
right?

1230
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:27,490
You hear that all the time.
You think,

1231
01:07:27,491 --> 01:07:28,324
well,
people are suffering for one reason or 

1232
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:29,711
another.
Well,

1233
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:30,580
why?
Well,

1234
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:31,414
there's something wrong biologically,
or society is corrupted and everything 

1235
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:35,710
is unfair.
Nietzsche says,

1236
01:07:35,711 --> 01:07:36,370
no,
no,

1237
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,050
you're not going to get away with that.
First.

1238
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:38,884
He says,
ours is the most honest and 

1239
01:07:39,671 --> 01:07:43,450
compassionate age comparing modern 
civilization.

1240
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,820
Let's say to everything that that has 
come before it,

1241
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:48,730
so speaking of corruption is not 
something you can do lightly,

1242
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,360
and then he says,
and this is remarkable distress,

1243
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:53,830
whether psychic,
physical,

1244
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:56,590
or intellectual,
need not at all produced nihilism.

1245
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:59,770
That is the radical rejection of value,
meaning and desirability.

1246
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:03,670
Such distress always permits a variety 
of interpretations.

1247
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:05,860
Well,
that's a rough one.

1248
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:06,821
It's like,
well,

1249
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:09,430
you had a rough childhood.
Well,

1250
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,520
someone else who had your childhood 
might not have drawn those conclusions.

1251
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:13,354
So here's an example.
You know that most people who abuse 

1252
01:08:15,501 --> 01:08:18,230
children were abused by chilled with as 
children,

1253
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,490
right?

1254
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:20,323
But most people who were abused as 
children do not grow up to abuse 

1255
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,750
children,
and you can figure that out,

1256
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,370
arithmetically,
because if it was,

1257
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:29,263
if it was the case that everyone abused 
grew up to abuse in about four 

1258
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:35,300
generations,
everyone would be being beat to death in

1259
01:08:35,301 --> 01:08:38,300
childhood as a matter of course,
because it would spread exponentially.

1260
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:40,370
That isn't what happens.
It dampens.

1261
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,810
And why is that?
Well,

1262
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:43,610
if you're bullied as a child,
we could say,

1263
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:45,050
well,
you could draw to conclusions.

1264
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,470
Causal Conclusions being bullied caused 
me to be a bully.

1265
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,580
Fair enough,
man.

1266
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,414
That's an understandable story.
How about being bullied caused me not 

1267
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:55,520
ever to be a bully?
Well,

1268
01:08:55,521 --> 01:08:58,160
why is that any less reasonable 
conclusion?

1269
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,473
It's frequently one that people draw,
and since the two opposite conclusions 

1270
01:09:02,451 --> 01:09:04,610
can be drawn from the same set of 
experiences,

1271
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,700
you cannot say that the experience has 
caused the conclusions.

1272
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,013
And that's Nietzsche's critique of say,
sociological or psychological 

1273
01:09:12,141 --> 01:09:16,310
determinism with regards to the optimism
or pessimism.

1274
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:17,173
Pessimism of your worldview.
Such distress always permits a variety 

1275
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,030
of interpretations,
right?

1276
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:26,000
Rather it isn't one particular 
interpretation.

1277
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:26,834
The Christian moral one,
that nihilism is rooted the end of 

1278
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:33,650
Christianity at the hands of its own 
morality that was the development of the

1279
01:09:33,651 --> 01:09:37,700
sense of truth which cannot be replaced,
which turns against the Christian God.

1280
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:42,380
The sense of truthfulness highly 
developed I Christianity is nauseated by

1281
01:09:42,381 --> 01:09:43,214
the falseness and mendacious ness of all
Christian interpretations of the world 

1282
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,980
and of history.
A remarkable claim,

1283
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:51,860
and then this one's even worse.
It's absolutely brilliant.

1284
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:56,840
I think rebound from God is truth to the
fanatical faith.

1285
01:09:56,841 --> 01:10:01,070
All his false that's nihilism and active
Buddhism and Nietzsche.

1286
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,590
Nietzsche explains that,
and this is,

1287
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,083
you know,
I talked to you guys a little bit about 

1288
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:06,974
the idea of the game and the metagame,
the metagame being the set of all games 

1289
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:11,220
niche.

1290
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:15,020
It draws on a conception like that for 
this criticism because he says,

1291
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,063
when you lose faith in something,
and that happens to people very 

1292
01:10:18,471 --> 01:10:22,280
frequently,
when you lose faith in something because

1293
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,020
you're human and because you can 
abstract,

1294
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:27,260
it's not only that you lose faith in 
that thing,

1295
01:10:27,261 --> 01:10:28,460
that person,
that system,

1296
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:29,863
the fact that you've lost faith in that 
indicates to you that it's possible to 

1297
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:37,991
lose faith in anything in every system 
and every person once burnt,

1298
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,080
forever shy,
and that's nihilism.

1299
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,910
The fact that one thing can collapse on 
you can make you completely unwilling to

1300
01:10:46,911 --> 01:10:49,550
manifest any faith in anything 
whatsoever,

1301
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:50,563
and that's the emergence of nihilism.
The end of the moral interpretation of 

1302
01:10:54,921 --> 01:10:55,754
the world which no longer has any 
sanction after it has tried to escape 

1303
01:10:58,611 --> 01:10:59,444
into beyond lie leads to nihilism.
Another critique of Christianity 

1304
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,490
embedded in that sentence,
he said,

1305
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:05,750
well,
Christiana needed,

1306
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,613
needed to be destroyed even by itself 
because it puts so much emphasis on the 

1307
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,293
afterworld on heaven that it forgot 
completely about life now and here and 

1308
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:16,464
because of that needed to be destroyed 
because life here is sufficiently rife 

1309
01:11:20,461 --> 01:11:21,294
with suffering.

1310
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,100
So it needs to be addressed and people,
it's,

1311
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,943
it's wrong,
it's incorrect to inform people that 

1312
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:32,520
they should wait for some hereafter and 
justify their suffering in that manner,

1313
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,990
and so he would say in some sense that 
even the idea of compassion,

1314
01:11:36,991 --> 01:11:37,824
which is central to Christianity,
is also one of the reasons why 

1315
01:11:40,290 --> 01:11:42,690
Christianity collapsed under its own 
weight,

1316
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:46,650
the untenable realty of one 
interpretation of the world upon which a

1317
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,900
tremendous amount of energy has been 
lavished,

1318
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,700
awakens the suspicion that all 
interpretations of the world or false.

1319
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:55,740
Well,
so what you might say,

1320
01:11:55,741 --> 01:11:56,574
well,
so what if you don't believe in 

1321
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:58,344
anything?
Well,

1322
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,430
I would take a neuro psychological 
approach to that.

1323
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,250
Most of the positive emotions,
positive emotions,

1324
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:06,084
dopaminergic.
It's a consequence of the manifestation 

1325
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:11,370
of the exploratory system that has its 
roots in the Hypothalamus,

1326
01:12:11,371 --> 01:12:12,204
a very ancient part of the brain.
It's the same part of the brain that 

1327
01:12:14,281 --> 01:12:17,760
cocaine and heroin and all the drugs 
that people like to abuse,

1328
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:21,270
the drugs that are exciting,
not the drugs that are calming.

1329
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,673
It activates that system.
It's the system that's activated when 

1330
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,900
something exciting happens to you or 
when something novel happens to you,

1331
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,003
but more importantly,
it's the system that's activated when 

1332
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:36,060
you're pursuing a goal and you see that 
you're moving towards the goal,

1333
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,000
so what does that mean?
No goal,

1334
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:42,420
no positive emotion,
so we say,

1335
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:43,980
well,
if you have nothing to believe in,

1336
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:44,814
if you have no value structure,
laugh because value structure says this 

1337
01:12:47,461 --> 01:12:50,280
is better than this.
No value structure,

1338
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:54,390
no positive emotion while on.
So what's the problem with that?

1339
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:57,420
It's easy to get rid of your positive 
emotion.

1340
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,330
That's not a problem because it's rather
fragile and tenuous.

1341
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,250
Try getting rid of your negative 
emotion.

1342
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,070
Good luck.
That is not going to happen.

1343
01:13:05,071 --> 01:13:08,010
So what happens is that if your value 
system collapses,

1344
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:12,510
then all you're left with is negative 
emotion and that is not a good thing.

1345
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:12,981
Well,
so neat.

1346
01:13:12,981 --> 01:13:13,621
You would say,
well,

1347
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,454
why do people flee into the arms of 
totalitarians from the specter of 

1348
01:13:17,551 --> 01:13:20,850
nihilism?
It's because totalitarian certainty,

1349
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,743
even though it involves slavery and the 
sacrifice of the of reason and 

1350
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:25,284
intellect,
totalitarian certainty might be 

1351
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:31,170
preferable to nihilistic chaos.
Well,

1352
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:32,970
it's a big problem,
it's a,

1353
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,230
it's a,
and he said,

1354
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:35,064
well,
I'm telling the story of the next 200 

1355
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:36,781
years.
It's like,

1356
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:37,770
well,
ever since then,

1357
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,013
for the entire 20th century,
we bounced between nihilism and 

1358
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:45,540
totalitarianism with deaths on both 
sides,

1359
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:48,150
constant and we're still doing exactly 
the same thing.

1360
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:50,693
Dostoevsky Dostoevsky was a big 
influence on nature and it's very 

1361
01:13:54,541 --> 01:13:58,860
interesting to read them in parallel 
because nature Dostoevsky is of course a

1362
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:00,750
dramatist and Nietzsche as a 
philosopher,

1363
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:05,250
and it's almost as if Dostoevsky wrote,
the drama and nature provided.

1364
01:14:05,251 --> 01:14:09,210
The philosophical commentary are very,
very powerful to read together.

1365
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,883
This is from notes from underground.
It was a very short book about this 

1366
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:17,890
character who was a bureaucrat,
nasty sort of bureaucrat.

1367
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,840
He knows he's a nasty sort of 
bureaucrat.

1368
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:20,793
All he does is he spends his whole life 
trying to make life more miserable for 

1369
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:27,460
people because he's so resentful and and
crushed and weak,

1370
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,533
and so he.
He just not did nothing but abuse is 

1371
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:31,354
bureaucratic position and used his 
trivial bit of power to Lord it over 

1372
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:34,744
people.
He gets a little bit of an inheritance 

1373
01:14:36,011 --> 01:14:39,670
and quits and this is his confession 
notes from underground.

1374
01:14:39,671 --> 01:14:40,900
He's the underground.
Matt.

1375
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,033
It's brilliant book.
It's viciously funny and it's so 

1376
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:47,590
psychologically alive if you're.
If you're interested in psychology.

1377
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:51,070
It's a spectacular book and it's only 
about 100 pages long.

1378
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,353
Anyways,
he's arrogant and nihilistic and 

1379
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:54,574
resentful and what he does is he tries 
to justify his life to himself and does 

1380
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:00,550
a very poor job of it even though he's 
trying to be honest.

1381
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,740
There's a lot of honesty in it.
At one point,

1382
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:03,574
he meets a woman who's been forced out 
onto the streets because there weren't 

1383
01:15:06,851 --> 01:15:09,850
very many options for women in the 
Victorian period who,

1384
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:11,283
who had fallen afoul of economic 
necessity and he basically in a fit of 

1385
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:16,413
false messianism offers to save her,
which he can't because he's completely 

1386
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:22,130
useless.
He can't save himself even,

1387
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:25,390
but he offers to save her and she more 
or less accepts.

1388
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:29,800
And then when she shows up,
having sacrificed a tremendous amount to

1389
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:30,634
do so,
he basically tells her that he was 

1390
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:35,190
toying with her and joking and,
and,

1391
01:15:35,191 --> 01:15:36,024
and,
and makes her situation far worse than 

1392
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:41,980
it was to begin with.
It's a brilliant book because you see,

1393
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,840
he repents.
He says what he's like,

1394
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:47,050
he's this horrible person.
He knows that we can resentful.

1395
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:48,880
And then he confesses and then he says,
well,

1396
01:15:48,881 --> 01:15:51,100
now I've confessed I'm a better person.

1397
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,920
Then he tries to do something good,
but he hasn't changed a bloody bit,

1398
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:54,963
not a bit.
The confession was just to make himself 

1399
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:57,604
feel better.
And so he offers to help someone and 

1400
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:03,130
pulls them right into the right under 
the water where they drown.

1401
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:06,610
It's an amazing book,
and this is from notes from underground.

1402
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,593
In short,
one may say anything about the history 

1403
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,264
of the world,
anything that might enter the most 

1404
01:16:12,431 --> 01:16:13,264
disordered imagination.
The only thing one can't say is that 

1405
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:19,120
it's rational.
The very word sticks in one's throat.

1406
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:20,133
This is a good example of the 
existential criticism of the idea of 

1407
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,100
rationality.
Dostoevsky says,

1408
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:24,934
well,
lots of things operate according to 

1409
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:27,034
rational principles,
but let's think about history for a 

1410
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:30,094
minute,
especially from the perspective of a 

1411
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:35,080
thinking and feeling bid.
Being history is,

1412
01:16:35,081 --> 01:16:36,760
uh,
is a slaughterhouse.

1413
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:37,594
It's a catastrophe.
And how would you ever consider that 

1414
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:41,644
something rational Dostoevsky's pointed 
is rationality fails in its analysis of 

1415
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:48,310
something as complex and terrible,
his history,

1416
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,600
the only thing one can't say is that 
it's rational.

1417
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:55,480
The very word sticks in one's throat in 
short,

1418
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,360
one may,
sorry,

1419
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,680
and indeed this is the odd thing that is
continually happening.

1420
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,890
There are continually turning up in 
life,

1421
01:17:05,891 --> 01:17:08,980
moral and rational persons,
sages,

1422
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,913
lovers of humanity who make it their 
object to live all their lives as 

1423
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:16,670
morally and rationally as possible.
So to be,

1424
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,600
to me,
so to speak,

1425
01:17:17,601 --> 01:17:18,434
a light to their neighbors simply in 
order to show them that it is possible 

1426
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,200
to live morally and rationally in this 
world.

1427
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:27,110
And you have to.
We all know that those very people,

1428
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:27,944
sooner or later have been false to 
themselves playing some queer trick 

1429
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:31,990
often,
uh,

1430
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:32,823
most unseemly one net.
Now I asked you what can be expected of 

1431
01:17:37,161 --> 01:17:41,420
man since he is a being endowed with 
such strange qualities.

1432
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:47,240
This is a criticism of utopianism.
That's what he's trying to do,

1433
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,103
right?
Because the Utopian ideas were starting 

1434
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,620
to emerge in Russia at about this point 
in the 18 eighties.

1435
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,880
The idea that you could reorganize 
society so that material privation would

1436
01:17:55,881 --> 01:18:00,500
disappear and that as a consequence,
the paradise would be ushered in.

1437
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:02,300
Well,
Dostoevsky was no fool.

1438
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:04,910
He knew perfectly well a that that was 
never going to happen,

1439
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:09,290
but even more importantly that if you 
gave people exactly what they wanted,

1440
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:11,023
even what they needed,
there's no reason whatsoever to presume 

1441
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,360
that that would make them any more sane 
than than they already are now.

1442
01:18:20,361 --> 01:18:22,100
And then he takes that further because 
he says,

1443
01:18:22,101 --> 01:18:22,934
well,
you can give people cake and and 

1444
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,253
material goods until they're satiated 
and they'll still be ungrateful and 

1445
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:31,250
insane,
and you might think,

1446
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:32,210
well,
that's pessimistic,

1447
01:18:32,211 --> 01:18:32,961
but then he says,
well,

1448
01:18:32,961 --> 01:18:33,794
wait a minute.
What makes you think that that insanity 

1449
01:18:35,571 --> 01:18:38,180
isn't exactly what's valuable about 
people?

1450
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:40,310
What makes you think you would ever want
to take that away?

1451
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:43,430
And that's the case that he makes shower
upon him,

1452
01:18:43,431 --> 01:18:44,264
every earthly blessing,
drowning in a sea of happiness so that 

1453
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:50,360
nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen
on the surface,

1454
01:18:50,570 --> 01:18:55,100
give them economic prosperity,
such that he should have nothing else to

1455
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:56,060
do,
but sleep,

1456
01:18:56,240 --> 01:19:00,620
eat cakes and busy himself with the 
continuation of his species.

1457
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,760
And even then out of sheer in gratitude,
man would play you some nasty trick.

1458
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:08,953
He would even.
Risk is cakes and we're deliberately 

1459
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:11,714
desire the most faithful rubbish,
the most uneconomical absurdity simply 

1460
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:18,470
to introduce into all this positive,
good sense,

1461
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,200
his faithful,
fantastic element.

1462
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:24,560
It is just as fantastic dreams is 
vulgar.

1463
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:25,394
Folly that he will desire to retain 
simply in order to prove to himself as 

1464
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,014
though that were so necessary that men 
are still men and not the keys of a 

1465
01:19:33,951 --> 01:19:34,784
piano,
which the laws of nature threatened to 

1466
01:19:36,531 --> 01:19:37,364
control so completely that soon one will
be able to desire nothing but by the 

1467
01:19:41,391 --> 01:19:43,970
calendar.
And that is not all.

1468
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:47,900
If even if men really were nothing but a
piano key,

1469
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,290
even if this was proved to him by 
natural science and mathematics,

1470
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:52,273
even then he would not become reasonable
but would purposely do something 

1471
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:59,360
perverse out of simply in gratitude 
simply to gain his point,

1472
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:01,363
and if he does not find means he will 
contrive destruction and chaos will 

1473
01:20:04,551 --> 01:20:08,190
contrive suffering of all sorts just to 
gain his point.

1474
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:10,103
He will launch a curse upon the world 
and this as men is the only animal that 

1475
01:20:14,071 --> 01:20:15,570
can curse.
It's his privilege.

1476
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,240
The primary distinction between him and 
other animals,

1477
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,553
maybe various curse alone he will attain
is object that is to convince himself 

1478
01:20:24,181 --> 01:20:25,014
that he's a man and not a piano key,
and if you say that all of this too can 

1479
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:29,094
be calculated and tabulated chaos and 
darkness and curses so that the mere 

1480
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:36,210
possibility of calculating it all 
beforehand would stop.

1481
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:40,710
It all and reason would reassert itself 
than man would purposely go bad.

1482
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,170
In order to be rid of reason and gain 
his point.

1483
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,630
I believe in it.
I answer for it.

1484
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,153
For the whole work of man really seems 
to consist in nothing but proving to 

1485
01:20:49,831 --> 01:20:52,350
himself every minute that he's a man and
not a piano key.

1486
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,393
It might be at the cost of his skin,
it might be by cannibalism and this 

1487
01:20:57,871 --> 01:20:58,704
being so can can one help being tempted 
to rejoice that it has not yet come off 

1488
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:03,623
and that desire is still depends on 
something we don't know are you will 

1489
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:10,260
scream at me.
That is if you condescend to do so,

1490
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:11,213
that no one is touching my freewill,
that all they're concerned with is that 

1491
01:21:13,561 --> 01:21:14,394
my will should have of itself of its own
free will coincide with my own normal 

1492
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:21,090
interests,
with the laws of nature and arithmetic.

1493
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,980
Good Heavens.
Gentlemen,

1494
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,293
what sort of free will is left when we 
come to tabulation and arithmetic when 

1495
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,930
it will all be a matter of twice two,
makes four,

1496
01:21:31,050 --> 01:21:33,300
twice.
Two makes four without my will,

1497
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,580
as if freewill meant that.

1498
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:39,973
It's brilliant.
I think it's one of the most remarkable 

1499
01:21:42,801 --> 01:21:45,710
criticisms of utopianism I've ever read.
It's like,

1500
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:47,540
and it's so.
It's so intelligent.

1501
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:48,374
It's like what makes you think that if 
you had everything you asked for that 

1502
01:21:50,361 --> 01:21:53,230
that would satisfy you?
What?

1503
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:56,360
What if being dissatisfied is part of 
what satisfies you?

1504
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,990
What if the fact that you have to have 
limits and need them and that there's an

1505
01:21:59,991 --> 01:22:00,824
element of insanity in the world and if 
there's an element of insecurity and 

1506
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:05,960
vulnerability,
what if that's what you need?

1507
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:06,853
What if it's what you want?
It's what if that's what gives your 

1508
01:22:08,901 --> 01:22:09,734
life,
meaning you're going to be like a lion 

1509
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,193
after it's eaten a zebra and do nothing 
but sleep that hardly constitutes the 

1510
01:22:15,321 --> 01:22:16,154
appropriate human paradise.
What makes people think that merely 

1511
01:22:19,011 --> 01:22:21,890
providing economic security would be 
sufficient?

1512
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,170
Who wants that?
It's what you.

1513
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:29,500
It's what you offer a cow in its pen so 
that it remains calm and fat.

1514
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:32,800
It's not something for human beings and 
that's niches.

1515
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:33,673
Fundamental point,
and he formulated that what 40 years 

1516
01:22:36,321 --> 01:22:37,154
before the dam Soviet revolution,
when that sort of utopianism was put 

1517
01:22:40,191 --> 01:22:43,940
into practice without absolutely 
catastrophic consequences.

1518
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:45,783
Kierkegaard,

1519
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,290
it is now about four years ago that I 
got the notion

1520
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,860
of wanting to try my luck as an author.
I remember it quite clearly.

1521
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,160
It was on a Sunday.
Yeah,

1522
01:23:00,161 --> 01:23:01,420
that's it.
A Sunday afternoon,

1523
01:23:01,421 --> 01:23:05,170
I was seated at usual out of doors at 
the cafe in the Fredericksburg.

1524
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:08,110
I had been a student for half a score of
years,

1525
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,293
although never lazy.
All my activity nevertheless was like a 

1526
01:23:13,871 --> 01:23:14,704
glittering inactivity,
a kind of occupation for which I still 

1527
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:21,400
have a great partiality and for which 
perhaps are even have a little genius.

1528
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:27,070
I read much spending the remainder of 
the day idling and thinking

1529
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,520
or thinking an idling,
but that was all it came to,

1530
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,473
so I sat there and smoke my cigar until 
I lapsed into thought among other 

1531
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,480
thoughts.
I remember these you are going on.

1532
01:23:38,481 --> 01:23:39,314
I said to myself to become an old man 
without being anything and without 

1533
01:23:42,711 --> 01:23:46,550
really undertaking to do anything.
On the other hand,

1534
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,400
wherever you look about you in 
literature and in life,

1535
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,620
you see the celebrated names and 
figures.

1536
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:52,454
The precious had much heralded man who 
are coming into prominence center much 

1537
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:56,114
talked about the many benefactors of the
age who know how to benefit mankind by 

1538
01:24:00,171 --> 01:24:04,040
making life easier and easier.
Some by railways,

1539
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:07,460
somebody omnibuses and steamboats,
others by the telegraph,

1540
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,473
others by easily apprehended compendiums
and short recitals of everything worth 

1541
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:12,374
knowing,
and finally the true benefactors of the 

1542
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:19,100
age you make spiritual existence in 
virtue of thought easier and easier,

1543
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:20,900
yet more and more significant.

1544
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:25,610
And what are you doing here?
My soliloquy boy was interrupted because

1545
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:28,910
my cigarette was smoked out in a new one
had to be lit so I smoked again,

1546
01:24:28,911 --> 01:24:31,190
and then suddenly this thought flashed 
through my mind.

1547
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:36,620
You must do something about it as much 
as with your limited capacities,

1548
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:41,540
it will be impossible to make anything 
easier than it has already become.

1549
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:42,583
You must with the same humanitarian 
enthusiasm as the others undertake to 

1550
01:24:46,611 --> 01:24:47,444
make something harder.
This notion pleased me immensely and at 

1551
01:24:50,991 --> 01:24:51,824
the same time it flattered me to think 
that I like the rest of them would be 

1552
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:56,300
loved and esteemed by the whole 
community,

1553
01:24:56,570 --> 01:25:00,200
for when all combined in every way to 
make everything easier,

1554
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:05,830
there remains only one possible danger,
namely at the east becomes so great that

1555
01:25:07,461 --> 01:25:08,294
it becomes altogether too great.
Then there's only one left though it is 

1556
01:25:11,961 --> 01:25:12,794
not yet a felt.
Want when people will want difficulty 

1557
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:19,250
out of love for mankind and how to 
despair it.

1558
01:25:19,251 --> 01:25:20,084
My embarrassing situation,
seeing that I had accomplished nothing 

1559
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:23,893
and was unable to make anything easier 
than it had already been made and moved 

1560
01:25:27,471 --> 01:25:30,320
by a genuine interest in those who make 
everything easy.

1561
01:25:30,321 --> 01:25:35,060
I conceived it as my task to create 
difficulties everywhere.

1562
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:39,823
Kierkegaard again,
there is a view of life which conceives 

1563
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:50,010
that where the crowd is there is also 
the truth and that in truth itself,

1564
01:25:50,531 --> 01:25:52,600
there is need of having the crowd on its
side.

1565
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,123
There's another view of life which 
conceives that wherever there is a 

1566
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:57,854
crowd,
there is immediately untruth so that to 

1567
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:06,041
consider for a moment the example,
even if every individual,

1568
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:10,280
each for himself in private were to be 
in possession of the truth.

1569
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,610
Yet in the case they were all to get 
together in a crowd.

1570
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:17,660
A crowd to which any sort of decisive 
significance is attributed to voting,

1571
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:18,494
noisy,
audible crowd untruth would add once be 

1572
01:26:21,631 --> 01:26:26,631
in evidence for a crowd is the untruth 
in a godly sense.

1573
01:26:28,191 --> 01:26:31,700
It is true eternally Christianly as St 
Paul says,

1574
01:26:31,701 --> 01:26:36,440
that only one attains the goal which is 
not meant in a comparative sense because

1575
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:37,274
a comparison takes others into account.
It means that every man can be that one 

1576
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:42,290
God helping him,
they're in,

1577
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:46,850
but only one attains the goal,
and again,

1578
01:26:46,851 --> 01:26:47,684
this means that every band should be 
careful about having to do with the 

1579
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:51,314
others and essentially should talk only 
with God and with himself for only one 

1580
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:58,100
attains the goal,
and again this means that man or to be a

1581
01:26:58,101 --> 01:26:58,934
man is akin to daddy
in a world in a worldly and temporal 

1582
01:27:04,681 --> 01:27:07,530
sense.
It will be said by the man of bustle,

1583
01:27:07,531 --> 01:27:09,360
sociability and amicable.
Nis,

1584
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,313
how unreasonable than only one attains 
the goal for it is far more likely that 

1585
01:27:13,861 --> 01:27:14,694
many by the strength of united effort 
should attain the goal and when we are 

1586
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:18,534
many success is more certain and it is 
easy and it is easier for each man 

1587
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:26,310
severally true enough.
It is far more likely

1588
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:28,793
I.
it's true also with respect to all 

1589
01:27:29,761 --> 01:27:32,850
earthly and material goods.
If it is allowed to have its way,

1590
01:27:32,851 --> 01:27:33,684
this becomes the only true point of view
and it does away with God and eternity 

1591
01:27:36,991 --> 01:27:38,720
and with man's kinship,
with dod.

1592
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,503
It does away with it,
transforms it into a fable and puts in 

1593
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:45,714
its place the modern or or we might 
rather to say the old pagan notion that 

1594
01:27:49,291 --> 01:27:53,040
to be a man is to belong to a race,
endowed with reason to belong to it as a

1595
01:27:53,041 --> 01:27:58,041
specimen so that the race or species is 
higher than the individual.

1596
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,573
Which is to say that there are no 
individuals but only specimens but 

1597
01:28:04,171 --> 01:28:09,171
eternity which arches over and high 
above the temporal tranquil as the story

1598
01:28:09,241 --> 01:28:10,074
vault at night and God in heaven.
Who in the bliss of that sublime 

1599
01:28:12,781 --> 01:28:16,920
tranquility holds in survey without the 
least sense of dizziness,

1600
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:17,754
etc. Height those countless multitudes 
of men and knows each single individual 

1601
01:28:21,301 --> 01:28:25,560
by name.
He the great examiner says that only one

1602
01:28:25,561 --> 01:28:30,561
attains the goal.
Nisha a similar comment,

1603
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:33,123
the traveler,
a traveler who had seen many countries 

1604
01:28:37,161 --> 01:28:40,790
and peoples in several continents,
was asked what human traits he had found

1605
01:28:40,791 --> 01:28:45,770
everywhere and he answered,
men are inclined to laziness,

1606
01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:49,580
some will feel he might've said with 
greater justice.

1607
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:53,990
They're all timid.
They hide behind customs and opinions

1608
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:56,973
at bottom.
Every human being knows very well that 

1609
01:28:58,241 --> 01:29:00,670
he is in this world just once as 
something

1610
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,203
and that no accident,
however strange we'll throw together a 

1611
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:09,520
second time into a unity,
such a curious undiffuse,

1612
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,750
plurality.
He knows that,

1613
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,080
but he hides it like a bad conscience.
Why?

1614
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:21,660
From fear of his neighbor who insists on
convention and avails himself with it,

1615
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:23,333
but what is it that compels the 
individual human being to fear his 

1616
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:26,244
neighbor,
to think and act heard fashion and not 

1617
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:32,760
to be glad of himself.
A sense of shame.

1618
01:29:32,761 --> 01:29:37,320
Perhaps in a few rare cases,
in the vast majority,

1619
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:40,560
it is the desire for comfort,
inertia in short,

1620
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:43,260
that inclination to laziness of which 
the traveler spoke.

1621
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:46,770
He is right.
Men are even lazier than they are timid,

1622
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:52,140
and what they fear most is the troubles 
with which any unconditional honesty and

1623
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:53,790
nudity with burden them.

1624
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,383
Only artists hate this slovenly life and
borrowed manners and loosely fitting or 

1625
01:30:01,531 --> 01:30:05,350
opinions and unveil the secret.
Everyone's bad conscience.

1626
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,500
The principle that every human being is 
a unique wonder.

1627
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:10,963
They dare to show us the human being as 
he is down to the last muscle himself 

1628
01:30:15,191 --> 01:30:17,440
and himself alone.
Even more.

1629
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:20,530
That in this rigorous consistency of his
uniqueness,

1630
01:30:20,531 --> 01:30:25,531
he is beautiful and worth contemplating 
as novel and incredible as every work of

1631
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:30,571
nature and by no means dull.
When a great thinker despises men,

1632
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,430
it's their laziness that he despises for
days on account of this,

1633
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:37,683
that they have the appearance of factory
products and seem indifferent and 

1634
01:30:40,751 --> 01:30:43,000
unworthy of companionship or 
instruction.

1635
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,583
The human being who does not wish to 
belong to the mass must merely cease 

1636
01:30:47,831 --> 01:30:48,664
being comfortable with himself.
Let Him follow his conscience which 

1637
01:30:52,481 --> 01:30:55,000
shouts at him.
Be yourself,

1638
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,480
what you are at present,
doing,

1639
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:02,030
opining,
and desiring.

1640
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,273
That's not really you.
Why are you so firmly and triumphantly 

1641
01:31:10,111 --> 01:31:12,870
convinced that only the normal and the 
positive?

1642
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:17,100
In other words,
only what is conducive to welfare is for

1643
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:22,020
the advantage of man is not reasoning in
error as regards in vantage does not man

1644
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:25,350
perhaps loves something besides 
wellbeing.

1645
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:27,943
Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering.
Perhaps suffering is just as great a 

1646
01:31:31,911 --> 01:31:32,744
benefit to him as well.
Being man is sometimes extraordinarily 

1647
01:31:36,051 --> 01:31:39,500
passionately in love with suffering and 
that is a fact.

1648
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:42,680
There is no need to appeal to universal 
history to prove that.

1649
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:45,500
Ask yourself if you're a man and have 
lived at all.

1650
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,970
As far as my personal opinion is 
concerned to care only for wellbeing.

1651
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:55,120
seems to me how positively ill bread,
whether it's good or bad,

1652
01:31:56,460 --> 01:31:59,120
it's sometimes very pleasant to to smash
things.

1653
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,160
I hold no brooke brief for suffering nor
for wellbeing.

1654
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:03,994
Either I'm standing for my caprice and 
for its being guaranteed to me when 

1655
01:32:07,951 --> 01:32:10,390
necessary suffering would be out of 
place.

1656
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,760
At amusement parks,
for instance,

1657
01:32:12,761 --> 01:32:13,600
I know that

1658
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:17,423
in the palace of crystal,
it is unthinkable now in the late 18 

1659
01:32:21,571 --> 01:32:22,404
hundreds,
there was a world exhibition in london 

1660
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:25,823
and they've corrected a palace of 
crystal at the world exhibition and it 

1661
01:32:28,471 --> 01:32:30,870
was the first building made out of glass
and steel,

1662
01:32:31,290 --> 01:32:35,040
and so it was a representation of the 
dawning materialist utopia,

1663
01:32:35,190 --> 01:32:38,940
and that's the palace of crystal that 
dostoevsky is referring to in the palace

1664
01:32:38,941 --> 01:32:41,610
of crystal.
Crystal sufferiNg is unthinkable.

1665
01:32:41,611 --> 01:32:43,590
Suffering means doubt,
negation,

1666
01:32:44,010 --> 01:32:44,843
and what would be the good of a palace 
of crystal if there could be any doubt 

1667
01:32:47,431 --> 01:32:50,240
about it,
and yet I think man will never renounced

1668
01:32:50,241 --> 01:32:53,190
real suffering.
That is destruction and chaos.

1669
01:32:54,270 --> 01:32:55,103
Why?
Suffering is the sole origin of 

1670
01:32:57,511 --> 01:32:58,344
consciousness.
Though I did lay it down at the 

1671
01:33:01,901 --> 01:33:02,734
beginning,
that consciousness is the greatest 

1672
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:04,624
misfortune for man,
yet I know man prizes it and would not 

1673
01:33:07,781 --> 01:33:10,090
give it up for any satisfaction.

1674
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:14,073
We're now in a position to see the 
crucial significance of the existential 

1675
01:33:16,421 --> 01:33:17,254
psychotherapy movement.
It is precisely the movement that 

1676
01:33:19,481 --> 01:33:20,314
protests against the tendency to 
identify psychotherapy with technical 

1677
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:24,574
reason.
We have seen that character garden 

1678
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:26,753
nature as well as the representatives of
the existential cultural movement 

1679
01:33:29,711 --> 01:33:32,080
following them.
We have seen that yes,

1680
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:36,550
not only contributed far reaching and 
penetrating psychological insights which

1681
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:37,384
in themselves form a significant 
contribution to anyone seeking 

1682
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:43,180
scientifically to understand modern 
psychological problems,

1683
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,433
but also did something else.
They placed these insights on an 

1684
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:47,854
ontological basis,
namely the study of the individual as 

1685
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:55,540
the being who has these particular 
problems.

1686
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,303
They believed that it was absolutely 
necessary that this be done and that 

1687
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:01,084
they feared that the subordination of 
reason to technical problems would all 

1688
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:08,380
to bluntly mean the making of man over 
in the image of the machine.

1689
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:11,653
That's it.

1690
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,580
We'll see you on thursday.

1691
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:20,990
Thank you.

1692
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,800
You're going to have to stop doing that.
Someone accused me of youtube on youtube

1693
01:34:24,801 --> 01:34:29,120
of of a dubbing in applause at the end 
of my lecturers.
