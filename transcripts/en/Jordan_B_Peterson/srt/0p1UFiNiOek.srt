1
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:45,780
Okay.

2
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,770
Hey,
so as some of you may know,

3
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,920
I went to give a talk at mcmaster 
university on Friday.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,303
Yes.

5
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,913
And,
uh,

6
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,853
it was originally supposed to be a panel
with three other people and also a 

7
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:07,381
moderator and the panelists and the 
moderator either chose to or were forced

8
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:12,391
to buy wild as a consequence of public 
pressure being applied to them for being

9
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:15,250
willing to appear with me on the same 
stage.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,433
And so anyways,
I went there and talked and there was a 

11
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:18,640
lot of protesting,

12
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,613
um,
a lot of disruption and that's fine 

13
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,960
because people can say what they want 
and I suppose they can do what they want

14
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,970
to and I'm not complaining about that.
But,

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,730
um,
when I got home tonight,

16
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,660
I found this other,
uh,

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,100
missive from mcmaster university,
uh,

18
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,080
this organization called,
uh,

19
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,973
pack vic.
And I want to read it to you because it 

20
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:55,930
actually does,
it irritates me half to death.

21
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,400
And so,
um,

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,690
I'll,
I'll read,

23
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,730
I'll read it to you and you can make up 
your own mind.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,833
March 16th,
2017 statement re mcmaster event 

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,930
featuring Dr. Jordan Peterson,
professor of psychology,

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:13,660
University of Toronto.
We are deeply troubled.

27
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,853
The Dr. Jordan Peterson has been invited
to speak at mcmaster at an upcoming 

28
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,264
event about quote,
freedom of speech and quote and 

29
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,270
political correctness.
Most recently,

30
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,104
Dr. Peterson has gained notoriety for 
his refusal to use the preferred 

31
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,560
pronouns of trans and gender 
nonconforming colleagues.

32
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,394
The students at u of t defending his 
callous disregard for their personhood 

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,433
through a misguided deference to his 
freedom of speech and his distaste for 

34
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:41,974
political correctness,
but freedom of speech doesn't now it 

35
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:45,574
hasn't ever meant that we can or should 
be able to say whatever we like in 

36
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:52,600
public spaces regardless of the impact 
of our speech on others.

37
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,853
Instead,
the concept of freedom of speech has 

38
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:00,571
most often been mobilized to protect 
specifically counter mnemonic ideas,

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,050
ideas that actually challenge rather 
than reiterate the status quo.

40
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,143
Freedom of speech was also not conceived
as a means to protect normative ideas 

41
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,600
from contact station by marginalized 
communities,

42
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
but to protect those who speech might 
actually contest normative or 

43
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,604
nationalist ideals from sensor 
punishment or retaliation by state 

44
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,224
forces.
There's nothing rebellious or 

45
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,224
revolutionary about insisting on the 
naturalness of the now long debunked 

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,970
gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson 
describes as quote,

47
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,720
the biological fact and quote of sexual 
difference.

48
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:40,840
Neatly categorizable as quote,
male quote,

49
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,890
end quote and quote female and quote a 
quote,

50
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,140
God,
you can hardly read this.

51
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,903
There is nothing rebellious or 
revolutionary about insisting on the 

52
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:57,610
naturalness of the open parentheses.
Now long debunked,

53
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,683
closed parentheses,
gender binary or of what Dr. Peterson 

54
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,454
describes as the open quote,
biological fact closed quote of sexual 

55
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,320
difference,
neatly categorizable as open quote,

56
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,730
male and quote and open quote,
female end quote,

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,060
open parentheses,
open quote,

58
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:22,960
fact closed quote,
subjected to intense critique,

59
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,220
questioning and reconsideration by 
numerous scholars in the humanities,

60
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,143
social sciences,
and even the biological sciences for 

61
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:34,270
several decades now,
which demonstrates the limited extent of

62
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:35,104
Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject 
since he seems either an entirely 

63
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:39,874
unaware of this body of literature or 
else unwilling to engage with the 

64
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,670
challenge it poses for his own 
arguments,

65
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,020
close parentheses.

66
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,543
There is nothing subversive or radical 
about suggesting that one ought to be 

67
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,624
entitled to read the complexities of 
gender identification on the basis of a 

68
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:00,070
quick and unwanted scrutiny of others 
bodies and appearance.

69
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,130
This is not a freedom that needs to be 
defended,

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,113
but rather than simplistic reassertion 
of the status quo of ideas about gender 

71
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,434
and sexual difference that have become 
and stubbornly remained very widespread 

72
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:12,694
and common sensical,
even in the face of mountains of 

73
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,024
academic evidence to the contrary and 
legislative changes made to protect the 

74
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:22,300
human rights of trans and gender 
nonconforming persons.

75
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,463
So let us not pretend the Dr. Peterson 
is a staunch defender of any sort of 

76
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,070
open quote,
freedom close quote.

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,083
What he is defending instead appears to 
be his misguided presumption that is 

78
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:35,554
right to uphold the status quo.
Trump's the right of others to exist in 

79
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,350
public spaces and be treated with 
respect and dignity,

80
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,410
free from hatred and discrimination and 
in a world where hate and discrimination

81
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:49,330
continued to flourish and appear to be 
on the rise,

82
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,980
his way of expressing his right amounts 
to a presumptive sense of entitlement to

83
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:57,160
deny others their status as fully and 
complex Lee human.

84
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,500
There was nothing new about Dr 
Peterson's position.

85
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,370
Then it is a position taken by 
multitudes of others before him.

86
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,773
There was also little to be gained by 
debating Dr. Peterson because he 

87
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,314
presents no argument founded on evidence
that would actually be worthy of debate 

88
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,150
unless one is of the view that certain 
people are less than fully and calm,

89
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,483
flex a human of course,
and are deserving of being treated with 

90
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:24,110
callous disregard for their personhood 
in public spaces,

91
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,910
in which case such views because they 
rest on faulty evidence and because they

92
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,744
stand directly in the way of the 
substantive inclusion of marginalized 

93
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:33,254
communities in our public institutions 
are deeply unsettling and required 

94
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:41,240
critical questioning and contestation 
whenever and wherever they articulated.

95
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,973
We stand in solidarity with Trans and 
gender nonconforming members of our 

96
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,210
communities who have been called upon 
repeatedly in the last several months to

97
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:54,800
publicly respond to and challenge Dr 
Peterson's views and to articulate again

98
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:55,634
and again why are they should be able to
participate fully and meaningfully and 

99
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:02,030
public institutions in ways that reflect
their humanity.

100
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,553
We anticipate that Dr Peterson's talk 
will and should result in public 

101
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:08,414
critical opposition to his ideas,
including public opposition to how he's 

102
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,970
treated trans and gender nonconforming 
people,

103
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,220
which may take the form of public 
protest

104
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,343
in the present climate.
Proponents of free speech may try to 

105
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,374
paint such opposition.
That's just another indicator that Dr 

106
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:46,420
Peterson's freedom of speech is in fact 
under threat.

107
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,660
In fact,
we suggest that were ever free speech is

108
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:53,830
valued protest to must be valued as a 
legitimate exercise of that freedom,

109
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,113
but protest does more than this.
It also leads to articulate and demand 

110
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:58,894
the kind of university and the kind of 
society many of us are fighting for one 

111
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:02,884
in which we recognize that speech or 
action that reduces the humanity of any 

112
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,770
group or people is not an exercise of 
freedom,

113
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,753
but instead poses a threat to us all.
Statement issued by the President's 

114
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:14,404
advisory committee on building an 
inclusive community's priority and 

115
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:22,351
planning committee and Lgbtq plus 
working group that mcmaster students,

116
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:26,380
union diversity services director,
the McMaster students,

117
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,214
union queer students,
community central coordinator and the 

118
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:34,090
mcmaster students union women and Gender
Equity Neck network coordinator.

119
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,770
Okay,
fine.

120
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:36,933
So here's the point.
This letter states there is nothing 

121
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,224
rebellious or revolutionary about 
insisting on the naturalness of the now 

122
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:50,281
long debunked gender binary or of what 
Dr. Peterson describes as the biological

123
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:54,430
fact of sexual difference,
neatly categorizable as male and female,

124
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,653
a fact subjected to intense critique,
questioning and reconsideration by 

125
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,320
numerous scholars in the humanities,
social sciences,

126
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:04,770
and even the biological sciences for 
several decades now,

127
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,963
which demonstrates the limited extent of
Dr Peterson's knowledge on this subject 

128
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,223
since he seems either leak,
either an entirely unaware of this body 

129
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,274
of literature or else unwilling to 
engage with the challenge it poses for 

130
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,040
his own arguments.
Okay,

131
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,143
no problem.
So this is what I'll say about that to 

132
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,944
the members of the PAC buik president 
advisory committee on building an 

133
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,264
inclusive community.
If you would like to debate with me 

134
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,043
about the issue of gender and sexuality,
I'm willing to do that with as many 

135
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,130
people as you want to put forward at any
time you want,

136
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:42,870
at any place of your choosing.

137
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,890
Hopefully sooner rather than later.
And if you're not willing to do that,

138
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:47,724
and you're going to write cowardly 
little letters like this and make them 

139
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:52,860
make them public instead,
I might suggest that if you're unwilling

140
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:53,694
to defend your ideas of public,
that you should just shut up and go 

141
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,530
away.
And I might also suggest that you should

142
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,364
stop teaching students to kind of 
nonsense that you are teaching them 

143
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,940
anyways.
I don't have much more to say than that,

144
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:04,774
except I'll just repeat it.
I have no problem defending my ideas 

145
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:13,410
about gender and sexual difference.
And if you guys think that you know what

146
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,244
the hell you're talking about,
then why don't you come out and face me 

147
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:21,000
instead of sending your student proxies 
to complain about me when I come to your

148
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,560
university to try to make a case.
I think you're a polling Lee cowardly.

149
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,340
And so I'm calling you out.
