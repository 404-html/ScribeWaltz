1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,233
Since the scientific age began,
we've lived in a universe where the 

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,530
bottom strata of reality is considered 
to be something that's dead like dirt.

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,570
It's like it's matter,
it's objective,

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,613
it's external and there isn't any 
element of it that lens any reality to 

5
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,253
phenomena like meaning or purpose.
That's all been relegated to this 

6
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,860
objective and in some ways to the 
illusory,

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,683
but it's by no means self evident that 
that set of presuppositions is correct 

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,033
because we lack infinite knowledge and 
there's many things about the structure 

9
00:00:56,851 --> 00:01:01,170
of being that we don't understand the 
main one being consciousness.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,770
We can't account for it at all and we 
can't account for the role it appears to

11
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:08,400
play in the transformation of potential 
into actuality,

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,320
which is a role that's been recognized 
by physicists for almost a hundred years

13
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:17,970
now and which remains one of the biggest
unsolved mysteries in science.

14
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,243
There are other ways of looking at 
what's real and these other ways have 

15
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,594
some advantages and one of the 
advantages they have is that they 

16
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:30,540
protect us knowing these other ways of 
of operating within reality,

17
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,374
defining reality,
protect us from certain kinds of 

18
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,150
pathologies.

19
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,150
And modern people are prone to a fair 
number of pathologies that stem from the

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,830
assumptions of their,
of their,

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,780
of the systems they use to define 
reality.

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,300
And one of those pathologies is,
uh,

23
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,243
a kind of a nihilistic hopelessness,
which is a consequence of the 

24
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:53,460
recognition that in the final analysis,
nothing really has any meaning.

25
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,583
And because life is difficult,
and that's a meaning that you can't 

26
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,224
escape being forced to abandon your 
belief in a positive or a transcendent 

27
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,624
meaning can leave you week.
The Times when you really can least 

28
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:07,434
afford to be weak.
And there's more important pathologies 

29
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:12,750
that it's opened us up to two.
And those are pathologies that belief.

30
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,290
And I think we saw the most horrifying 
examples of that.

31
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
Hopefully the most horrifying examples 
in the 20th century where people whose 

32
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:20,814
belief systems were shattered,
at least in part by the competition 

33
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,564
between religious and scientific 
viewpoints turned in large numbers to 

34
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,310
mass movements that were in error in 
every way a substitute,

35
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,144
a moral rational in some sense 
substitute for religious beliefs that 

36
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:37,524
appeared no longer tenable.
And the consequence of that was it was 

37
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:44,370
just about annihilation because we came 
close to an isolation twice,

38
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,204
once in the 60s and once in the 80s and 
even without the totality of 

39
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:49,974
annihilation,
we lost hundreds of millions of people 

40
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:56,280
as a consequence of pathological belief 
systems and the 20th century.
