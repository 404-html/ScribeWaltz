1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,600
I'd like to welcome you all to this
important event.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,290
I would also like to apologize to those
among your friends,

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,900
relatives,
and colleagues who could not be here

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:13,260
today as the auditorium sold out in a
matter of hours.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,170
My name is Joffrey Clarfield.
It is my privilege to be the executive

6
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,210
director of the speaker,
this action group,

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,240
and I would like to thank founding
president,

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,810
surely an haber and our new president
irving.

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:32,250
Why store and all the volunteers who've
worked so hard to make this event

10
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:35,850
happen.
I would also like to thank our partner

11
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,060
organization,
the Masood Freedom Foundation and the

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:44,061
council for Muslims facing tomorrow who
are the a joint sponsors of this event.

13
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,140
The speakers action group in particular
and it's supporting groups is dedicated

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,020
to the fight against antisemitism and
racism.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,130
But without freedom of speech there
could be no fight against antisemitism

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,910
or racism for we need freedom of speech
to defend our rights

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,000
and as we will hear today,
freedom of speech is most threatened

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,450
where ironically it should be most tree
in the media and the colleges and the

19
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:25,500
universities of this country as well as
an other democracies.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,400
I would like to introduce the emcee for
this afternoon.

21
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Faith Goldie from the rebel media,
an organization that is at the forefront

22
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,890
of the fight for free speech in this
country.

23
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,460
I'd like her to introduce our two
distinguished speakers,

24
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,630
professor Jordan Peterson and Dr. Norman
doidge faith.

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,220
Thank you so much for being here today.

26
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,970
[inaudible]

27
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,780
been a dishwasher,
a gas shockey,

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,000
a bartender,
a short order cook,

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,180
a beekeeper apply wood mill laborer and
a railway line up worker.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,230
But today professor Jordan B.
Peterson is best known for his work in

31
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:10,800
the academic world.
He has published more than 100

32
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,210
scientific papers transforming the
modern understanding of personality and

33
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,030
revolutionizing this psychology of
religion.

34
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:22,680
With his now classic book maps of
meaning the architecture of belief as a

35
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,230
Harvard professor,
he was nominated for the prestigious

36
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,650
Levinson teaching prize now at the
University of Toronto.

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,860
He is regarded by students as one of
their truly life changing teachers and I

38
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,740
think that I speak for a great deal of
people in this room and frankly across

39
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,720
the country when I say you need to be
one of Professor Peterson students to

40
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,630
have been enlightened and inspired by
that eight pound universe between his

41
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:47,790
ears as well as his bravery.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,633
Yeah.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,900
Most recently Dr. Peterson became the
center of an ongoing national

44
00:02:55,901 --> 00:03:00,820
controversy for refusing to abide by the
University of attempt to put very

45
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,840
specific words into his mouth when they
ordered professors comply with the

46
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,290
gender pronouns policy,
Dr Peterson's vivid descent over

47
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,190
language politics and the political
agenda behind it has seen him threatened

48
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,220
and showed it down by snowflake students
and the academic hierarchy alike as a

49
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:21,190
result of his public views on how
political correct nate's correctness

50
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,530
rather violates freedom of speech and
academic freedom.

51
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:27,610
And the west Professor Peterson has
become a cultural icon for liberty

52
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:32,440
lovers and a long awaited obstruction to
the wayfairs on the long march of the

53
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,350
institution's.
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Jordan

54
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,030
bpt

55
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,030
[inaudible].

56
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,770
So about
three months ago

57
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,250
I sat in my office at night.
I wasn't really sleeping very well and

58
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,570
because my mind was running and it was
running because I had just read some

59
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:13,500
policy documents on the Ontario Human
Rights Commission website in

60
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:18,501
relationship to build see 16 and at the
same time I had heard that the

61
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,580
University of Toronto hr and equity

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,260
vice president had decided to make anti
unconscious bias training mandatory for

63
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,100
her staff,
which I find appalling

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,430
and still find a polling.
And I would recommend that if any of you

65
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:45,170
are asked or required to have your
unconscious biases adjusted,

66
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,980
that you might see some,
you might note to yourself that by

67
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:53,540
agreeing to do so,
you have agreed that you're guilty and I

68
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:56,780
wouldn't recommend that.
Anyways,

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,870
I was mostly trying to straighten up my
thoughts on these issues,

70
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,190
you know?
And,

71
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,170
and that's usually what I do when I
speak,

72
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:03,861
you know,
you know,

73
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:06,530
because,
and I have a good reputation as a

74
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:09,320
speaker and I think there's two reasons
for that.

75
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:11,240
And one is I don't ever speak to a
group.

76
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,850
I always speak to individuals,
you know,

77
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,070
I'm not speaking to the group,
I'm speaking to individual people and

78
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:22,100
I'm not telling you what's right because
I don't know what's right.

79
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,710
What I'm trying to do is to formulate my
thoughts more clearly.

80
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,490
And it's helpful to do that in speech,
even in front of an audience because

81
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:33,230
it's a dialogue with an audience.
You know,

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,900
if you watched the individuals,
then they,

83
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,860
you can tell if they're following you or
whether mostly whether they're following

84
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:41,570
you,
if they can understand the line of the

85
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:43,970
argumentation.
And some of them will be shaking their

86
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:46,700
heads and some of them will be nodding.
And you know,

87
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:49,310
some of it will be looking puzzled in
which case you have to kind of

88
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:51,320
reformulate.
And so,

89
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,000
and that's,
that's how I,

90
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,950
that's how to think,
you know,

91
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:57,080
and,
and when you're speaking to people,

92
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,310
it's okay to tell them what you know,
but better to show them how you think.

93
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,400
And that means you're going to stumble
around like an idiot some of the time

94
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,650
because you're trying to grapple with
things.

95
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,320
And what I tried to do for my students
is to,

96
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,940
to model the process of grappling with
things.

97
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,670
Because that's what you do when you
think,

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,840
and you know,
Norman pointed out that you can be right

99
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:24,140
or you can try to get smarter and to be
right.

100
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,760
Then you convince people that you're
right,

101
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,580
but to try to get smarter,
you find out why you're wrong.

102
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,200
And so I decided a long time ago,
one of the ways to deal with Maya

103
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:35,510
authoritarian tendencies,
let's say,

104
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,410
was to make friends with what I don't
know instead of what I do know.

105
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,020
And that's a whole different way of
looking at the world,

106
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:42,820
you know,
and it's,

107
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,610
it's got its pain because you know,
you're always trying to figure out more

108
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:51,611
or less wire an abayas moron.
And that's a very long list of,

109
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,830
that's a very,
you have a very long list of reasons for

110
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,280
that.

111
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,320
And then you have to find out why you're
wrong.

112
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,030
And as a short term mechanism for
attaining psychological stability,

113
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:06,890
I wouldn't recommend it.
But as a long term process where you're

114
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:09,480
trying to make things work better in the
medium to longterm,

115
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,480
then it's the only way.
But,

116
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,880
but you know,
it's easy to sacrifice the future for

117
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:19,340
the present,
although it's kind of the reverse of the

118
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,320
way you should do things.
So anyways,

119
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:25,520
I made these videos,
pretty amateur videos and you know,

120
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:28,670
the lighting wasn't very good and
there's a bunch of things wrong with

121
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:32,300
them and a buck.

122
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,600
One of the things I've been wondering
about for the last three months,

123
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,980
it's just what,
what happened?

124
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,690
Like,
what's going on here?

125
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:43,760
This is crazy.
And,

126
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,000
you know,
I've been accused of a lot of things,

127
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,240
some of which are no doubt true.
But you know,

128
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:53,550
I've been accused of being a racist and
being a trans fold.

129
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,230
But what else?
Profiteering and uh,

130
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,590
I guess the other one was
scaremongering.

131
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah,
that's the other one.

132
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:05,380
Scaremongering and so of course I'd been
wondering if that,

133
00:08:05,381 --> 00:08:07,580
if those things are true because it's
not like,

134
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,550
you know,
my heart is as pure as the driven snow

135
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,850
hardly and everyone has biases and all
of that.

136
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,370
So,
and I also,

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,530
well this unfolded had a group of
friends who were definitely critics who

138
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,470
were watching everything I was doing and
you know,

139
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:28,130
letting me know pretty forthrightly when
I was being arrogant and when I was,

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,430
you know,
look kind of disheveled and when my

141
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,400
arguments were just clear as they could
be and you know,

142
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,220
and so on.

143
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,940
These were smart people and their
comments were very incisive.

144
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,080
And then of course I had all the blow
back and I was paying attention to it,

145
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:44,540
you know,
because well,

146
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,670
you should pay attention to such things.
And so,

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,560
and I do pay attention to things.
You know,

148
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,130
that's the thing.
I actually pay attention to things and

149
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,490
if I'm embroiled in a controversy,
even if it's a like problem in my home,

150
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,380
I tried to get to the damn bottom of it.
And you know,

151
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:04,260
the bottom of things is not a pretty
place to look.

152
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,830
And so you know,
when you're arguing with someone at

153
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,290
home,
even someone you love,

154
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,980
you'll notice that your argument can get
out of hand a pretty quick.

155
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,350
So if you're arguing with your wife or
your husband,

156
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,740
you know,
it depends on how volatile you are of

157
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,980
course.
But you know,

158
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:23,814
you start

159
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,010
arguing about some little thing and then
you come to understand pretty quick that

160
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,800
it's actually not about that little
thing at all.

161
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:37,380
That little thing is associated with,
you know,

162
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,310
a little bigger thing underneath that.
And maybe that's associated with even a

163
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:42,960
bigger thing under that.
And you know,

164
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,980
soon you're taking each other apart for
assuming you've been married for 20

165
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,780
years,
for all the stupid things you've done to

166
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:52,030
each other over the last 20 years.
And it doesn't have to end there.

167
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:55,590
And how it's not pleasant,
it's really hard to bind a conversation

168
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,180
so it doesn't go everywhere,
you know?

169
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,870
So one thing you can do if you're
talking to someone about something you

170
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:03,570
disagree with someone you love,
you can tell them a bunch of good things

171
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,210
about what they've been doing,
which you actually believe.

172
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:07,110
And then just say,
well,

173
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,460
but there's this little problem here.
And I just like it adjusted in a minor

174
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,500
way.
And maybe that'll,

175
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,310
you know,
we'll sort things out a bit between us

176
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:16,980
and then maybe you don't fall into that
stupid pit,

177
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,020
which is really easy to fall into.
And you know,

178
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:22,800
which certainly can lead to divorce
among other things.

179
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:27,510
And so a huge part of the issue always
is just exactly what is this about?

180
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,840
Well,
I'd been asking myself that question for

181
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:34,360
a long,
long time because I'd been interested in

182
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,550
authoritarian conflict and atrocity and
totalitarianism for way longer than

183
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:42,160
anyone with any sanity should ever be
interested in it.

184
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,800
And you know,
and then this,

185
00:10:44,801 --> 00:10:46,720
and then this all came up and I thought,
okay,

186
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:47,411
okay,
okay.

187
00:10:47,411 --> 00:10:48,191
It's like,
all right,

188
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,420
well,
you know,

189
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,600
am I a bigot and a transformed?
Well,

190
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,070
I probably have my biases because people
tend to have in group biases,

191
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:59,320
you know,
and that's associated by the way with

192
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,470
compassion.
Just so you know it because one of the

193
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:05,380
things compassion does is make you much,
strongly,

194
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,580
much more strongly bound to your
ingroup.

195
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,430
You know,
it's like a mother as compassionate

196
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:13,510
cause she loves her baby and she loves
the baby more than other things that

197
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:17,560
aren't the baby obviously.
And so actually compassion is one of the

198
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:21,490
main sources of Ingroup bias,
which is something for the compassion

199
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,790
warriors to think about for like three
fifths of a second.

200
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,060
There's,
there's nothing less compassionate to

201
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:31,090
you than a mother.
Grizzly bear protecting her cubs.

202
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,510
And so you should think about that when
you think about empathy for a minute,

203
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:38,290
because empathy is by no means an
untrammeled moral virtue.

204
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,170
In fact,
it's responsible and can be responsible

205
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:45,460
for absolutely atrocious actions.
It depends on who you're empathizing

206
00:11:45,461 --> 00:11:46,690
with,
you know,

207
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:51,400
and if you are empathizing with someone
that you regard as an infant dialyzed

208
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:55,270
victim,
then you snap into a frame of mind where

209
00:11:55,271 --> 00:12:00,271
everyone who might be oppressing that
infant dialyzed victim is a predatory

210
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,730
parasite and you're not very bloody
empathetic to them.

211
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:08,731
I can tell you.
So now it's a big problem anyways with

212
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:12,400
regards to this scaremongering issue.
So yeah.

213
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:13,720
Yeah.
Biased.

214
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,750
Yeah,
probably and blind definitely.

215
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,360
Um,
like more than,

216
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,940
more than you might expect.
No,

217
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,760
I don't think so.
And one of the things that actually

218
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,590
protected me through all of this was
that,

219
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,480
you know,
I've actually tried to come to terms

220
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,820
with the evil that lurks in human
hearts,

221
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,080
particularly my own.

222
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,100
And I have 500 hours of lectures on that
online.

223
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:41,101
If anybody has the bizarre desire to
pound their way through them,

224
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:47,530
they can more or less think,
figure out what I think because I said

225
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:52,531
500 of hours of it publicly and so I
didn't feel too bad about my level of

226
00:12:53,261 --> 00:12:55,210
bigotry or hatred,
you know,

227
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:57,850
I think you could probably infer that by
watching the video.

228
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:02,470
So it's kind of protected on that front.
And then there was this scaremongering

229
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:05,080
issue and that's a good one.
That's a tough one man.

230
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,720
Because you know,
if you look at bill [inaudible] 16 it

231
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:11,170
just kind of looks like,
well we're extending protection to

232
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:14,950
another oppressed group,
which isn't actually true because gender

233
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,150
identity,
by the way,

234
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:20,140
no gender expression,
that's not a group I'd like just like to

235
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:23,860
point that out because terminological
accuracy actually matters.

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,810
So we've extended legal protection to
fashion essentially.

237
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,590
And you can say,
well maybe I'm being a bit intransigent

238
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,930
about that,
but I read the Dat and policies and I

239
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:37,870
don't think I am.
And that's not a group.

240
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,070
So that's an indication of the muddle
headedness behind the legislation.

241
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,120
And then the federal government,
the Department of Justice did say on

242
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,450
their own website that they were going
to interpret that law in light of the

243
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:51,670
policies of the Ontario Human Rights
Commission.

244
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:54,970
And so fine man,
go to the Ontario Human Rights

245
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,480
Commission if they haven't taken the
policies off yet and read what they're

246
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,590
up to.
And if that,

247
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,410
if you agree with that,
well good green with it.

248
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,020
But I would suspect that if you agree
with it,

249
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,910
you didn't,
you didn't understand it or,

250
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,100
or,
or you're up to something and now it

251
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,650
comes to the next part.
What are,

252
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,140
what are we really talking about here?
Well,

253
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,210
so we could be talking about my biases
is my proclivity to scaremonger and you

254
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,080
know,
fair enough,

255
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:22,360
but here's some reasons we're not.

256
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,080
And one is that I have all those
lectures online and you know,

257
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:28,570
believe me,
if there would've been a phrase in any

258
00:14:28,571 --> 00:14:33,280
of them that indicated that there was
something even vaguely morally corrupt

259
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:35,650
about me,
it would have been paraded around as

260
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:37,390
evidence.
You can be sure of that.

261
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,610
So that's kind of a relief.
You know,

262
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,790
I did a lot of soul searching in the
last couple of months and it's not like

263
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm without my problems.
But anyways.

264
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,040
So what is this about?
Well we'll say,

265
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,020
hopefully it's not about me because
that'd be stupid.

266
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,630
And so what,
what's going on?

267
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,570
Why are all these people watching these
videos,

268
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,200
these things I made just to figure out
what it was that I was thinking.

269
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,930
You know,
cause I couldn't sleep one night and

270
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:09,620
because I'm not very damn happy about
that unconscious bias stuff,

271
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:13,430
which I regard as absolutely
reprehensible,

272
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,630
that you could be held guilty for your
implicit perceptions.

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,260
Think about that.
God,

274
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,260
they use that test as a diagnostic test.
You know,

275
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:27,800
it doesn't meet the criteria for
reliability and validity that you'd use

276
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,130
for a diagnostic test.
It doesn't produce the same results one

277
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,340
time after another.
And you can use it to target anybody.

278
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,030
And so go along with it if you want and
just see what happens.

279
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,553
Anyways.

280
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,260
Yeah,

281
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,140
so I've been thinking about this like
what's going on?

282
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,730
Why the outcry,
you know,

283
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,070
you think,
well Professor Peterson,

284
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:50,260
God is 15 minutes of fame.
It's like,

285
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,960
well I had my 15 minutes of,
you know,

286
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:57,640
trivial fame several times in my life
and there's some good things about it,

287
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:01,710
but I am despite what you might think or
rather private person.

288
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,950
And so it's not like I'm particularly
enjoying it,

289
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:07,180
but I thought something,
you know,

290
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:10,870
when I made those videos I thought this
is something I learned from reading

291
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,000
mythology.
If you have to fight a dragon,

292
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,930
you should go to it slayer before it
comes to your village.

293
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,640
And so people think of what I did is
courageous and I don't think that's

294
00:16:21,641 --> 00:16:24,460
right.
I just think that I can see danger

295
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:28,690
coming and you get to pick,
you get to pick your anxiety.

296
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,520
I could either be anxious about speaking
or I could be anxious about not

297
00:16:33,521 --> 00:16:36,910
speaking.
And so I chose to be anxious about

298
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:39,910
speaking.
And that's not exactly courage.

299
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,870
It's more like common sense without
assumes that you're looking into the

300
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:44,704
future.

301
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,820
So are you might say,
well,

302
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,410
what gives me any special power to look
into the future and hey,

303
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:57,700
that's a good question and my God only
knows what's going to happen in the next

304
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:57,911
few years.
You know,

305
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:59,890
I did read today,
this is cool.

306
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,130
250,000 people will be lifted out of
absolute poverty today and 300,000 more

307
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,940
will be connected to electricity and
we're knocking poverty rates around the

308
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:14,941
world down faster by a huge margin than
we ever have in human history.

309
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,650
There was an article in New York Times
today called y 2016 was the best year

310
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,850
ever.
It's really worth reading.

311
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,870
I concluded the same thing.
I worked for a UN committee a couple of

312
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,130
years ago when I was looking at,
you know,

313
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:29,410
what was going to happen down the road
and everything.

314
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:31,210
I kept reading less while,
wow,

315
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,420
we're getting rid of polio.
We're getting rid of LFA elephantiasis,

316
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,590
which you really don't want to have.

317
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,780
We're getting rid of Guinea worm.
We're getting rid of polio,

318
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,410
knock and malaria back into the swamps
from where it comes.

319
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,960
We're lifting people out of poverty.
It's like,

320
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,820
man,
we're doing a lot of good things.

321
00:17:45,821 --> 00:17:48,550
You'd sure never guessed that by the way
we treat ourselves.

322
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,930
So anyways,
so what's going on?

323
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,100
Okay,
so I thought,

324
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:55,980
well I better think about this.
I've been thinking about a long time.

325
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:58,200
So
you know,

326
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,720
the,
the right wing is really hard on the

327
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,240
Frankfurt school,
you know,

328
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:06,090
and the Frankfurt school where these
kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined

329
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,920
Marxism with
Friday and Islam in the 1940s and,

330
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,950
and they were avowed neo Marxists,
you know,

331
00:18:13,951 --> 00:18:18,030
so it's not like I'm making an
accusation and they were kind of anti

332
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,820
system type people and,
and all of that.

333
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:25,080
But I think to lay what's happening at
the universities and in brought in the

334
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:29,190
broader culture itself at the feet of
the Frankfurt school is insufficient.

335
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,930
I really think that it's primarily a
consequence of the French intellectuals

336
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:35,910
who,
and this is obviously an

337
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:40,830
oversimplification who emerged out of
Marxism in the early 1970s and produce

338
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,180
postmodernism.
Now,

339
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,600
the thing about the postmodernist types
is there nested inside mark's is they

340
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,340
say that straight out,
I'm not inventing this.

341
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,540
You read Derrida,
who's like the,

342
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,670
the joker at the,
at the head of the postmodernist

343
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,750
movement.
And I,

344
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,580
I mean joker because he's,
he's,

345
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,150
he's an intellectual clown and not,
doesn't mean he's stupid because he is

346
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,370
not stupid.
Not at all.

347
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,430
These people are not stupid.
They know exactly what they're doing.

348
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:11,520
They know precisely what they're doing.
They're a hell of a lot more educated

349
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:13,470
about what they're doing.
Then you are less,

350
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,800
you happen to be one of them.
And they mean exactly what they say.

351
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,980
Just like people always do when they
tell you what they're going to do or

352
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:24,720
they write it down and they say straight
out on their websites say that women's

353
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:28,110
studies websites,
we think the patriarchy is an oppressive

354
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,130
structure that should be broken down to
its core.

355
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,120
And they meet core conceptions.
It's not just social,

356
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:39,210
it's linguistic,
philosophical and attitudinal.

357
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:44,220
It should be broken down.
What wiped out and restructured from the

358
00:19:44,221 --> 00:19:47,070
bottom up.
And they mean that.

359
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,000
So when it's not accidental.
Any of this,

360
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:54,000
and I know it sounds like a bloody
paranoid conspiracy theory,

361
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,850
but you know I've,
I've always been of the idea,

362
00:19:56,851 --> 00:20:01,500
especially from reading young,
that ideas people don't have ideas,

363
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,280
ideas have people and these are powerful
ideas.

364
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:08,790
There's a good book called explaining
postmodernism that I might recommend by

365
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:13,200
a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and
his first chapter,

366
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:16,590
which isn't very long.
It's a good introduction to political

367
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,170
correctness,
but so while,

368
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,590
so why do I think this is about,
about that?

369
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,630
Well her,
here's my reasons.

370
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:28,200
I mean it doesn't seem to be about me.
I think all idea to actually was

371
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:30,870
actually,
I made the general specific k,

372
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:33,450
which is kind of what you have to do if
you really want to make a point,

373
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,490
a point,
right?

374
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:37,890
That's one place.
If you want to make a point.

375
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,120
And my point was,
I'm not saying made up words generated

376
00:20:42,121 --> 00:20:47,121
by postmodern neo Marxists because I
despise everything they stand for.

377
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,490
And so I'm not using those damn words
and that's okay.

378
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,143
No,
I'd like,

379
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,700
I have something against transgender
people.

380
00:21:00,701 --> 00:21:03,400
I'm sure some of them are lovely people
and some of them aren't,

381
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,460
you know,
and so they can do whatever they want as

382
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,290
far as I'm concerned,
as long as they don't,

383
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,400
they can do whatever they want as far as
I'm concerned,

384
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
as long as I'm not forced to go along
with the most radical representatives of

385
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:21,820
them who don't even speak for them
anyways.

386
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,320
I've got like 20 letters from
transsexual people supporting what I've

387
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:29,470
done and like none opposing it.
You know,

388
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:32,890
one of the things that's kind of cool is
I've only got three hate letters.

389
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,350
I thought three,
Jesus,

390
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:36,184
you guys,

391
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,363
you guys are,

392
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:44,470
you guys aren't trying very hard.
And I got like a thousand letters of

393
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:50,531
support and if you go on youtube where
I'm radically overrepresented,

394
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,970
um,
and you look at the comments and the

395
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:55,490
likes and the dislikes,
it's about the same ratio.

396
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:59,210
It's like likes to dislikes is like
about a hundred to one and almost all

397
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,460
the comments are positive,
which you know,

398
00:22:01,461 --> 00:22:04,190
could easily be a selection bias and
probably is,

399
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:06,560
but you know,
it still means that there's quite a few

400
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:11,450
people who think that what I'm doing is
sort of okay as far as they're

401
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,280
concerned.
And so that's important.

402
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,420
So anyways,
we need to talk a little bit about

403
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,130
postmodernism.
Okay.

404
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,010
So let's go back to France in the 19 end
of the 1960.

405
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:24,500
So,
and this is of course an

406
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:28,220
oversimplification and I'm sure I'm
wrong about some of it because you know,

407
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,970
it's not exactly my field of speciality,
this sort of sociology.

408
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,700
Um,
I'm more of the scientist tight,

409
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,750
but,
and I,

410
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:38,630
and if I read philosophy,
I tend not to read second rate

411
00:22:38,631 --> 00:22:41,660
philosophy.
And so I've tried to avoid the

412
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,970
postmodernists to some degree because
there are,

413
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,700
there any coherency is one of the least
of their sins.

414
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,060
But they don't care about that.
No,

415
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,390
no.
You've got to understand,

416
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:53,690
man,
it's modernists 10 enlightenment people

417
00:22:53,691 --> 00:22:56,000
and even traditionalist who care about
coherency,

418
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,280
the postmodernists don't believe in
coherency.

419
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,500
They don't believe in,
and I'm not making this up,

420
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:03,500
this is part of their philosophy.
They don't believe in logic.

421
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
You know,
debt does says straight out that Western

422
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:12,281
society has fellow logo centric by which
he means male centered and privileging

423
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,330
the idea of logic.
Well,

424
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:16,910
he doesn't buy any of that.
He doesn't think that there's a truth

425
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:20,120
that is out there.
He doesn't believe that individuals can

426
00:23:20,121 --> 00:23:21,830
reach any sort of truth by thinking.

427
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,180
He certainly doesn't believe that we can
move towards truth in dialogue because

428
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:27,470
that's dialogic,
right?

429
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,940
There's none of that.
You wonder,

430
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:32,090
well why don't,
why did the postmodern types keep other

431
00:23:32,091 --> 00:23:34,220
thinkers off the campus?
Well,

432
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:37,700
it's not because they're afraid.
Well also some of the market,

433
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,310
but they use their fragility as a mask
for their,

434
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,200
you know,
the underlying philosophical,

435
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,960
their underlying philosophical and
political interests.

436
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,100
They do that Freidman terribly.
It's not like every social justice

437
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:49,934
warrior is,
uh,

438
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,270
you know,
soared carrie and pork postmodernists

439
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,510
but the idea are fragmented and
distributed among them.

440
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,530
Like they're distributed among a mob.
And if you put the whole mob together,

441
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,920
you get the whole post modernists thing
happening at the same time.

442
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,400
And that's how ideas have people instead
of the other way around.

443
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:11,000
Anyways,
forget about logic.

444
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,940
That's out the window.
That's just a construct of Western

445
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:16,940
society and,
and the whole point of the construct was

446
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:21,170
to oppress other people and to take
their wealth and to privilege the people

447
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:25,850
who live within that so called logic
system so that they can justify to

448
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:30,851
themselves and other people their prey
Predator rapaciousness straight and

449
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:32,054
simple.

450
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,450
And that's partly because postmodernism
was influenced by Marxism.

451
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,390
And of course that's what the Marxists,
think about any situation where there's

452
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,300
a,
let's call it a power status

453
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:43,790
differential.
The people at the top are only there

454
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,370
because they've stole everything from
the people at the bottom.

455
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,110
And so the knee,
the Marxists in France realized by the

456
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:56,111
end of 1960s there abouts when even John
Paul Sartre finally figured out that to

457
00:24:56,391 --> 00:25:01,340
be a communist probably wasn't
acceptable given that the bloody Soviet

458
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,350
had killed like 30 million people
between 1919 and 1959 and the Maoists

459
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,890
done the same thing on a greater scale
in China.

460
00:25:09,891 --> 00:25:12,560
And then we talk about North Korea and
we can talk about,

461
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,990
you know,
by whatever,

462
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:15,710
you know,
we don't,

463
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,710
students don't learn any of that in
school anymore.

464
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,930
And even if they did,
they wouldn't want to listen to it.

465
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,210
When I tell my students in my second
year psychology class about the Gulag

466
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:28,280
archipelago,
hardly any of them know,

467
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,510
well why is that?

468
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,510
Well,
it's because they haven't been taught

469
00:25:32,511 --> 00:25:34,400
it.
Why is that?

470
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,560
Well,
see if you can figure it out.

471
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,360
All right,
so,

472
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,880
so anyways,
back to the postmodern types.

473
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:45,770
So you know,
it got to the point where there's just

474
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:49,040
no way you could be a Marxist,
especially after social knits.

475
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:51,080
And because Solzhenitsyn wrote this
great book,

476
00:25:51,081 --> 00:25:54,290
which is actually out of print for
crying out loud,

477
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,830
which I've actually been able to
popularize like mad over the last three

478
00:25:57,831 --> 00:25:58,491
months,
which is,

479
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:01,510
you know,
really mind boggling and what soldier

480
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:05,480
Nitsa did in his genius manner because
he's up there with Dostoevsky and

481
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,650
tolstoy like,
man,

482
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,440
that guy,
he's a towering intellect and a person

483
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:12,410
of tack can or moral force,
you know,

484
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,690
like he put himself on the line for that
book.

485
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:17,780
He memorized it when he was in the,
in the prison camps.

486
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:20,960
It's about,
it's three volumes that fic,

487
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,140
you know,
it's like 2000 pages of someone's

488
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,650
screaming.
The smartest person you've ever met,

489
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,130
the wisest person you've ever met,
screaming and outrage for 2000 pages.

490
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,900
It's no bloody wonder.
It's out of print.

491
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,340
Anyways,
what soldier in its did was

492
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,230
take on this claim.
You often hear the radical leftists make

493
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,210
about communism,
about Marxism.

494
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,070
They say,
well,

495
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,990
that wasn't real Marxism.
It's like,

496
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,440
okay,
well how many countries do you need to

497
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:59,280
disprove your thesis?
How many millions of people have to die

498
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:02,100
before you might admit that you're
wrong.

499
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,470
Well,
obviously more than a hundred million

500
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:08,700
because that's the approximate total of,
that's probably an underestimate,

501
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:11,970
but we'll be conservative because I had
to get another 10 million.

502
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,310
Doesn't really make that much
difference.

503
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,930
So soldier Nansen took that argument
apart partly in his book lending in

504
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,250
Zurich,
and then partly in the Gulag

505
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:24,290
archipelago.
Buck groundwork had already been laid

506
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:27,080
for all of that by nature,
who knew exactly what was coming in the

507
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:30,740
20th century and by Dostoyevsky who
wrote a book called the possess back in

508
00:27:30,741 --> 00:27:35,741
like 1880 where he outlined in painful
detail the precise mindset that would

509
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,690
produce the Russian revolution like 30
years later.

510
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,090
Amazing and Tolstoy as well.
He's,

511
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,610
he knew what was coming and made him
suicidal.

512
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,800
He wrote in his confession that win

513
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,710
the conflict between the ideas of
Russia,

514
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,490
the traditional ideas and the
enlightenment ideas sweeping in from the

515
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:54,324
west,
they,

516
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,200
they blew his worldview apart,
which was traditional religious blew his

517
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:01,860
worldview apart so badly that he was
suicidal at the height of his fame.

518
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:06,150
Tolstoy knew what was going to come to.
And so it's not like soldier Mitson was

519
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,340
the only person who could see this or
are we all knew it.

520
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,140
Uh,
Malcolm Muggeridge knew it in the 1930s

521
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:16,190
what he was noting that the Soviets,
given their idea of class guilt,

522
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:20,760
which sounds a lot like white privilege
to me or any other form of racism,

523
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,610
they use that doctrine to just round up
all the Kulaks they were the productive

524
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:31,810
farmers and ship them off to Siberia and
then 6 million Ukrainian starve to

525
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,644
death.
But you know,

526
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,650
they had too many Ukrainians anyway,
so it didn't really matter.

527
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,730
So anyways,
back to the postmodern types.

528
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:40,720
Well,
you know,

529
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:45,721
this all came was revealed in such
painful detail that even the kind of

530
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:49,600
closed minded India log that Norman
referred to just quite,

531
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:52,570
couldn't,
couldn't quite muster up the moral

532
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:55,720
courage to keep beating the same damn
drum.

533
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:00,160
So what they did instead being highly
intelligent individuals was play a game

534
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:03,110
of sleight of hand and transformed these
marks,

535
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:06,490
his presuppositions into postmodernism
in the 1970s.

536
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,500
And the idea basically was,
well,

537
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,260
the working class isn't going to rise up
and crush the burrs,

538
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,120
waze,
because first of all they're getting

539
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:14,870
rich and that wasn't supposed to happen.

540
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:15,850
And second,
well,

541
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:18,310
it's sorted seemed to be a catastrophe
when that occurred,

542
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:21,310
let's say in Russia.
And so maybe we won't do that anymore

543
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:24,040
because the working class actually isn't
buying into this either,

544
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:25,910
which is also a problem,
you know,

545
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,030
having internalized their own
oppression,

546
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,780
they wouldn't buy into this,
to the global myth of Utopia.

547
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,420
So maybe it's because they had some
sense.

548
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:36,310
It's certainly possible.
But anyways,

549
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,080
the slight of hand was,
oh,

550
00:29:38,081 --> 00:29:39,670
well fine,
we'll just play a different,

551
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,430
oh,
oppressor versus gain and we'll

552
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:46,300
introduce identity politics.
It's like,

553
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:47,051
okay,
okay.

554
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,600
You're not being oppressed because
you're a member of the working class.

555
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:53,440
You're being oppressed because you're a
woman or you're being oppressed because

556
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,980
you have an ethnicity that's outside the
main paradigm,

557
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,810
whatever that might be.
Um,

558
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,970
or it's because of your,
your,

559
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,580
your,
your sexual preference or your sexual

560
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:04,990
identity or whatever.

561
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,040
Whatever places you in some manner
outside the normative culture.

562
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,010
And you know,
the thing is the postmodernist you

563
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:12,701
don't,
you might think,

564
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:15,580
well your culture is good for something.
It gives you a hierarchy of value.

565
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,000
It rewards competent people.
It gives you a direction so you can

566
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:19,870
climb up,
you know,

567
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,610
cause otherwise everything's leveled to
nothing.

568
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,000
And then why do anything?
Well,

569
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,720
they don't care about any of that.
They don't believe that there's any such

570
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,940
thing as competence.
They don't believe that there's any such

571
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:31,240
thing as up.
This is all postmodernism wipes,

572
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:34,700
all of that out.
And so when the postmodernist tantalize

573
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,390
the text,
all they care about is how it privileges

574
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,820
the position of the author and who had
impresses.

575
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,100
And that's the only thing they regard as
real.

576
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,950
And they don't believe in grand unifying
narratives.

577
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,840
They don't believe that there's a
Canadian identity.

578
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,730
They don't believe that there's an
American identity.

579
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,890
They don't believe that there's a
western identity.

580
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,320
They don't believe that value structures
exist.

581
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
Or if they are,
there are replaceable.

582
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:58,300
With some other value structure,
they certainly don't believe that they

583
00:30:58,301 --> 00:31:02,950
have any biological grounding that
there's any such thing as a human being.

584
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:06,400
It's all socially constructed,
which is really convenient if what you

585
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:11,080
want to do is be the author of an
entirely social constructed you utopia

586
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,350
that you can run.
And then when the marks is say,

587
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,500
well that wasn't real Marxism,
what it really means,

588
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,210
and I've thought about this for a long
time,

589
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,720
it's the most arrogant possible
statement anyone could ever make.

590
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,930
It means if I would've been installing
his position,

591
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:28,450
I would have,
I sure didn't the damn utopia instead

592
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:33,370
that instead of the genocidal massacres,
because I understand the doctrine of

593
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,890
Marxism and everything about me is good.

594
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,730
It's like well think again sunshine,
you don't understand it,

595
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,970
you don't understand it and you're not
that good.

596
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,750
And if the power was in your hands,
assuming you had the competence,

597
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:50,590
which you don't,
you wouldn't have done any better.

598
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,900
And even if you had,
there would have been someone else

599
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:56,890
waiting right behind you to shoot you
the first time you actually tried to do

600
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:59,230
anything good.
And that's what happened to all of the

601
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:03,730
old guard who ran the damn revolution.
Stalin rounded them all up and shot them

602
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,580
along with their families and millions
of other people.

603
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,530
So even if you do happen to be that
Avatar of moral purity that you claim

604
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:14,260
implicitly,
the probability that you'd give it to

605
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:18,820
act out your goodness in relationship to
those possessed by Your radiology is

606
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:21,040
zero.
So it's

607
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,670
so,
you know,

608
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,540
you think,
well,

609
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:32,730
why are these postmodern is doing what
they're doing?

610
00:32:32,731 --> 00:32:35,460
Why did they oppose the patriarchic?
Here's a question,

611
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,520
why don't the feminists complaining
about Saudi Arabia?

612
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,733
It's like,

613
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,620
you know,
God sod,

614
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,290
who's this guy up concordia who is in a
business school so he can actually say

615
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:54,980
what he thinks now.
And then he tweeted yesterday,

616
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:55,671
well,
hey,

617
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,920
see tweeted to the woman's march.
You know,

618
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,650
cause there's little twitter thing you
could do that I suppose for the

619
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:01,790
organizers.
And he said,

620
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,480
why don't you go to the Middle East and
have a nice march again Saudi Arabia and

621
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:07,720
see,
see how that works out for Ya.

622
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,980
It's like,
so you think,

623
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,420
well,
why not?

624
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,500
Like why not?
Why?

625
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,790
Why are the why or the radical left as
to are so much for rights everywhere.

626
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:20,030
That's what they say.
Why aren't they complaining about Saudi

627
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:20,863
Arabia,
for example,

628
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,920
which you know,
breeds a particularly pathological form

629
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,830
of video,
logically rigid Islam that basically in

630
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:30,920
slaves they're women.
That's to put it properly.

631
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,010
It's like why not complain about that?
Well how about this?

632
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,800
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

633
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:37,980
Yeah.

634
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,670
And so when push comes to shove,
you see how much concern there is among

635
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,830
the radical feminists for the rights of
women.

636
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,520
It's like if the,
if the pushing those rights forward

637
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,700
doesn't also at the same time under a
undermine the western patriarchy,

638
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:55,890
then we'll take the undermining and
leave the damn rights behind.

639
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,300
And so there's an insight for you about
exactly what's going on at the bottom of

640
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:02,010
all of this.
So,

641
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,240
okay,
so then there's another weird thing,

642
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:08,460
and I've already sort of hit on it
tangentially.

643
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,950
It's like,
well the postmodernists don't believe in

644
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,890
grand unifying narratives.
They don't believe in narratives at all.

645
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,120
They don't care about value because they
never know.

646
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,070
You have to value something in,
in order to have some hope in life,

647
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:22,440
right?
Because when you value something,

648
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,810
you're pursuing it.
And in the pursuit,

649
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:27,150
that's where the meaning in life is,
you know,

650
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,810
cause the rest of it's suffering.
If you're trying to struggle upwards

651
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:32,190
towards the light,
it's like,

652
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:36,360
well that's something to motivate you
and to protect you against the

653
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:38,730
suffering.
But the postmodernists don't care about

654
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:41,310
any of that.
And I would say it's because they don't

655
00:34:41,311 --> 00:34:42,390
care about suffering.

656
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,070
Okay.

657
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,770
So all right,
so here,

658
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,690
but here's the,
here's the final question.

659
00:34:48,691 --> 00:34:49,524
It's like,
well,

660
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,550
if the postmodernists don't care about
grand unifying narratives and they don't

661
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,040
believe in identity,
why in the world are they willing to

662
00:34:56,041 --> 00:35:01,041
believe in gender identity and sexual
identity and racial identity and ethnic

663
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,330
identity?
And the answer to that is,

664
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,800
well,
they can't,

665
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,130
but they don't care because coherence
isn't on their agenda.

666
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,220
And besides that,
when push comes to shove,

667
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,880
they're postmodernism is nested inside a
deeper Marxism.

668
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:17,550
And so when the postmodern narrative
doesn't suffice,

669
00:35:17,551 --> 00:35:20,610
say to push forward,
the idea that Western civilization

670
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:23,880
should be overturned,
they just revert back to the over

671
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,680
arching Marxism and say,
well,

672
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,350
those people are oppressed and that's a
bad thing.

673
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,430
It's like you might say,
well,

674
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:32,460
you're a postmodernist.
It's like you'll believe in any of that.

675
00:35:32,461 --> 00:35:33,294
And they say,
well,

676
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,550
yeah,
I'm only a postmodernist this deep.

677
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,900
But underneath that there's a,
and I can always rely on that to fill in

678
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:42,030
the gaps and that's exactly what's
happening.

679
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,870
So,
so that's what's happening as far as I

680
00:35:45,871 --> 00:35:47,340
can tell.
And you know,

681
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,690
so why do I believe this will all,
there's a little war going on in our

682
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,310
culture.
Maybe it's not so little.

683
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,920
I put my finger on it and I wouldn't
recommend that,

684
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:57,270
by the way.
You know,

685
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,130
because okay,
you explain it man.

686
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:02,610
You explain why.
Like 3 million people have watched the

687
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,770
UFT free speech rally and I think 7
million people downloaded the Joe Rogan

688
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,660
podcast.
And it's like crazy.

689
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,810
It's crazy.
There was 180 newspaper articles about

690
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:15,180
this.
It was news for four months.

691
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,940
Why?
Who cares what I think,

692
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,490
God,
I don't even care that much about what

693
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,550
I,
what about trump?

694
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,760
What's going on there?
What's going on there?

695
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:33,770
Exactly.
You know,

696
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,930
it was interesting listening to trump's
inauguration speech because I detected

697
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:41,400
elements of national socialists thought
in it,

698
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,830
you know,
and not being dismissive.

699
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,830
I'm seriously not being dismissive,
but when you radically activate on the

700
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:52,830
side of the left,
you call forth compensate Tory forces

701
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:56,460
and they're not in your control.
And like trump opened his speech,

702
00:36:56,461 --> 00:36:57,370
he just read it.
It's,

703
00:36:57,371 --> 00:36:59,640
he sounds like a 1950 socialist,
you know,

704
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:03,840
he's going to use the power of the state
to bring the industry home to produce a

705
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:07,110
lot of infrastructure.
It's a state business unity with the

706
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,050
state in charge.
And then at the end of his speech,

707
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,260
which is where he stopped speeding,
at least the international kind of

708
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,250
socialist,
he says,

709
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,530
well borders are really important and so
is national identity.

710
00:37:17,531 --> 00:37:20,250
And you know,
he does embed that within belief in God,

711
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:24,090
which is probably a good thing,
assuming that he's serious about that.

712
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,920
But you know,
the fact that trump was elected in the

713
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:30,810
end,
that there was such a fight between him

714
00:37:30,811 --> 00:37:33,540
and the Clintonites and,
and that the Clinton nights were playing

715
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,450
identity politics instead of speaking
for the working class,

716
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,060
who then trump co-opted like he should
have.

717
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,790
Um,
there there's a war going on there.

718
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,260
And then what,
what about brexit?

719
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,170
What's going on there?
And what about France with Marine Le Pen

720
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,410
and what about Holand with wielders,
you know,

721
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,490
watch it.
We're in a chaotic time and you know,

722
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:57,150
I've gotten letters from people all over
the world who tell me how they can't say

723
00:37:57,151 --> 00:37:58,260
what they think.
It's like,

724
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,580
oh,
well that's not very good.

725
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,610
And they're kind of happy with me
because maybe they think that I

726
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:05,670
emboldened them in some way and so good.
Good for that.

727
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,310
Hypothetically.
And most of the people who wrote me the

728
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:12,120
overwhelming majority were reasonable.
So pretty happy about that too.

729
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,580
But,
and maybe I'm wrong about my damn

730
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:19,380
diagnosis because like what do I know?
But I do have this proclivity to get to

731
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:23,700
the bottom of things and what's out the
bottom of this as an ideological war or

732
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,780
philosophical war.

733
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,420
It's even deeper than that.
It might even be deeper than a

734
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,820
philosophical board,
which is something that's more like a

735
00:38:29,821 --> 00:38:32,820
metaphysical or theological war.
You know?

736
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:37,120
It depends on how far down you look and
the know exactly what they're doing.

737
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:38,590
This isn't accidental.
Of course,

738
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:42,180
you shut down speakers you don't agree
with because you can't have a dialogue

739
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:44,800
with him then anyways,
because human beings can't have

740
00:38:44,801 --> 00:38:46,660
dialogue.
There's no such thing as a human

741
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:48,580
individual.
There's no such thing as truth.

742
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,930
Here's the postmodern world.
It's the hubs Z and nightmare.

743
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,500
It's everyone against everyone else
except it's not individuals.

744
00:38:56,501 --> 00:39:00,310
It's groups and you're stuck in your
damn group and it's the only thing about

745
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:00,880
you.
Anyways,

746
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,910
that's relevant,
which is why we might base our hiring on

747
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,020
it,
for example,

748
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,830
and you're oppressed and even if you
don't know it just only because you've

749
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:11,320
internalized it and it's the only thing
that's real about you.

750
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,300
Anyways and I can't talk to you because
I'm in my own little silo of privileged

751
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:18,730
belief.
And besides we can't use logic because

752
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,640
that doesn't exist.
And so you're in a group and I'm in a

753
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,600
group and all we can do is have a war or
we can talk,

754
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:28,750
but we don't get to talk cause he can't
talk if you're a postmodernist because

755
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:33,700
speech is just chatter.
So when it's just chatter that supports

756
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:36,310
the people in power,
that's how they think.

757
00:39:36,311 --> 00:39:41,311
And so the whole world is this little
armed war of identity group against

758
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:46,360
identity group against identity group.
And you shut down people who don't agree

759
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:49,120
with you because why should you let them
talk?

760
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,320
It's you don't believe in any of the
reasons why you would let someone talk.

761
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:57,160
So this isn't accidental.
It's not because they're afraid.

762
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,400
Although it's also because of that they
hijack,

763
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,290
you know,
fear,

764
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:06,430
they hijack compassion.
They make anyone who who puts forward an

765
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:11,431
alternative view into a terrorist of
ideas and someone who's heartless at the

766
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,380
core,
which is really incredibly intelligent.

767
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:18,790
It's such a good strategy.
It's so devious and brilliant and it's

768
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,840
so effective because who wants to,
who the hell wants to be labeled a

769
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,760
bigot?
You probably are a damn big.

770
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,630
It just like everyone else.
So you know when it's easy to make

771
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:30,970
people feel guilty about that,
maybe they should.

772
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,410
So anyways,
what's going on?

773
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,860
Well that's what's going on.
And so what do you do about it?

774
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:40,870
Well,
I don't know what you do about it,

775
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,300
but I haven't theory.
And that's when I'd been working on for

776
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,060
like 40 years.
So one of the problems with

777
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:48,820
postmodernism,
and I'm going to take five minutes and

778
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,490
then we're done.
One of the problems with postmodernism

779
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:54,040
is that,
and this is a big problem,

780
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:57,310
like this is a fatal problem,
apart from the fact that it's incoherent

781
00:40:57,311 --> 00:41:00,520
and there's no value structure in it and
it's fundamentally divisive and

782
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:03,490
destructive.
There's a logical problem with a two

783
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:06,250
that's even worse.
And so you might be noticing that the

784
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:09,570
lgbt set of acronyms keeps growing hay
and it,

785
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:10,480
it's,
it's Kinda,

786
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,480
it's kind of a form of it's own parody
in some sense.

787
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:13,901
It's like,
well,

788
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:14,830
I'm oppressed.
It's like,

789
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:15,341
yeah,
yeah,

790
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,050
you are.

791
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,860
And while I'm impressed too,
yeah,

792
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:21,820
you're also oppressed and maybe I'm even
pressing you being part of this other

793
00:41:21,821 --> 00:41:23,980
marginalized group,
but at least we share oppression.

794
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,510
Well,
I'm also oppressed.

795
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:26,230
Well,
so am I.

796
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,910
I'm oppressed too.
It's like,

797
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,640
okay,
so here's the problem.

798
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:33,100
There's a big problem here.
The problem is,

799
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,290
it's true.
You're oppressed,

800
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,530
you're oppressed,
you're oppressed,

801
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,630
you're oppressed.
God only knows why.

802
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,130
Maybe you're too short,
or you know what,

803
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:42,050
as beautiful as you could be,
or you know,

804
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:45,020
your parent,
your grandparent was a surf likely

805
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,720
because almost everybody's granted great
grandparent was,

806
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,010
it's like,
you know,

807
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:52,490
and you're not as smart as he could be.
And you have a sick relative and you

808
00:41:52,491 --> 00:41:54,800
have your own physical problems.
And it's like,

809
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:57,530
frankly,
you're a mass and you're oppressed in

810
00:41:57,531 --> 00:42:00,500
every possible way,
including your ancestry and your

811
00:42:00,501 --> 00:42:04,490
biology.
And the entire sum of human history has

812
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:08,690
conspired to produce,
victimized you with all your individual

813
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,430
pathological problems.

814
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,660
It's like,
yes,

815
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,850
true.
Okay.

816
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,550
But the problem is,
is that it is true.

817
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:19,950
And so if you take the oppressed,
you have to fractionate them and

818
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:21,980
fractured ate them.
It's like you're a woman.

819
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,521
Yeah.
Okay,

820
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,600
well,
I'm a black woman.

821
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:25,730
Well,
I'm a black woman who has two children.

822
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,800
Well,
I'm a black woman who has two children

823
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:30,260
and one of them isn't very healthy and
then,

824
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,220
well,
I'm a,

825
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,150
I'm a Hispanic woman and I have a genius
son who doesn't have any money so that

826
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:38,840
he cannot go to university and you know,
I had a hell of a time getting across

827
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:40,580
the border.
It was really hard on me to get my

828
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:43,340
citizenship and my husband is an
alcoholic brute.

829
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,300
It's like,
well,

830
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:46,940
yeah,
that sucks too and so well,

831
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,020
so let's,
let's,

832
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:52,880
let's fix all your oppressive oppression
and we'll take every single thing into

833
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,190
account and then we'll fix yours too.

834
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,090
We'll take every single thing into
account.

835
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:56,901
It's like,
no,

836
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,230
you won't because you can't.
You can't.

837
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,350
It is technically impossible.
First of all,

838
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:05,690
you can't even list all the ways that
you're oppressed.

839
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,550
Second,
how are you going to weight them?

840
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,800
Third,
who's going to decide,

841
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:12,770
and that's the bloody thing.
Who's going to decide?

842
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,800
That's the thing.
Well,

843
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,900
what's the answer in the West?
It's like in free markets.

844
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,390
Oh yeah.
Christ will never be able to solve this

845
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,070
problem.
No one can solve it.

846
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,890
What are we going to do about that?
We're going to outsource it to the

847
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:26,900
marketplace.
You're going to take your,

848
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:29,450
sorry,
pathetic being and you're going to try

849
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:34,310
to offer me something that may be I want
and I'm going to take my story pathetic

850
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,810
being,
and I'm going to say,

851
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,860
well,
all things considered as well as I can

852
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:42,980
understand that maybe I could give you
this much money,

853
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:47,490
which is actually a promise for that
thing and you've packed all of your damn

854
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,380
old pressured into the price and I've
packed on my oppression into the

855
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:54,350
willingness to pay it and that solution
sucks.

856
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,770
It's a bad solution.
But compared to every other solution,

857
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:59,140
man,
it's white.

858
00:43:59,141 --> 00:44:02,640
10% of us have freedom.
And so there,

859
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,390
there's a tremendous illogic at the
bottom of this.

860
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:09,740
It's like
you have to fraction eight theo pressed

861
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:12,290
all the way down to the level of the
individual.

862
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,330
Well,
that's what the West figured out.

863
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,910
You know,
there's a couple of figures who at the

864
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,730
mythological roots of our culture,
and you know,

865
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,700
people get upset with me because I bring
in religious themes,

866
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,480
but I understand some things about
mythology and religion.

867
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,700
It's not an accident that the axiomatic
western individual is someone who was

868
00:44:31,441 --> 00:44:35,190
unfairly nailed to a cross and torture.
It's like,

869
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,710
yes.
Right.

870
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,240
Exactly.
So what do you do about that?

871
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:46,590
Well,
I thought about that for a long time

872
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:47,424
too.
It's like,

873
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:50,040
well,
you don't get together in a damn Bob,

874
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:54,390
because all that does is allow you to be
as horrible as you could possibly

875
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,940
imagine and suffer from none of the
consequences.

876
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,540
That's a bad idea.
So how about we don't do that?

877
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,690
Well,
there's a deep idea in the west too.

878
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:08,160
It's like,
pick up your damn suffering and Barrett.

879
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:09,203
Okay.

880
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,410
And try to be a good person so you don't
make it worse.

881
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:14,733
Okay,

882
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:17,200
well that's a truth.
You know,

883
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:22,120
I read a lot about the terrible things
that people have done to each other.

884
00:45:22,121 --> 00:45:26,410
You just cannot even imagine it so
awful.

885
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:30,090
So you don't want to be someone like
that?

886
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,890
No.
Do you have a reason to be?

887
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,610
Yes.
You have a lots of reasons to be God.

888
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:38,130
There's reasons to be resentful about
your existence.

889
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:41,830
Everyone you know is going to die.
You know you too,

890
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,910
and there's going to be a fair bit of
pain along the way and lots of it's

891
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:46,350
going to be unfair.
It's like,

892
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,510
yeah,
no wonder you're resentful.

893
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,820
It's like act it out and see what
happens.

894
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:54,570
You make everything you're complaining
about infinitely worse.

895
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,830
There's this idea that hell is a
bottomless pit and that's because no

896
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:01,410
matter how bad is some stupid son of a
bitch,

897
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:04,350
like you could figure out a way to make
it a lot worse.

898
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,420
So you think,
well,

899
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:08,790
what do you do about that?
Well,

900
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:11,280
you accept it.
That's what life is like.

901
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:14,880
It's suffering.
That's what the religious people have

902
00:46:14,881 --> 00:46:17,370
always said,
life is suffering.

903
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,050
Yes.
Well,

904
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:20,400
who wants to admit that?
Well,

905
00:46:20,401 --> 00:46:22,290
just think about it.
Well,

906
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,240
so what do you do in the face of that
suffering?

907
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,300
Try to reduce it.

908
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:28,780
Yeah,

909
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,910
start with yourself.
What good are you?

910
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,060
Get yourself together for Christ sake so
that when your father dies,

911
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:37,690
you're not wining away in a corner and
you can help plan the funeral and you

912
00:46:37,691 --> 00:46:40,900
can stand up solidly so that people can
rely on you.

913
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,070
That's better.
Who'll be a damn victim course.

914
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,290
You're a victim.
Jesus obviously

915
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,700
put yourself together and then maybe if
you put yourself together,

916
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,890
you know how to do that.
You know what's wrong with you,

917
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:57,200
if you'll admit it,
you know there's a few things you could

918
00:46:57,201 --> 00:47:00,680
like paulie sharp a little bit that you
might even be able to manage.

919
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,220
You're insufficient present condition
and so you might shine yourself up a

920
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:07,640
little bit and then your eyes will be a
little more open.

921
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:11,190
Then you can sign yourself up a little
bit more and then maybe you could bring

922
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,460
your family together instead of having
them be the hateful,

923
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:17,850
spiteful,
neurotic in fighting batch that you're

924
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,550
like doom to spend Christmas with.

925
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,380
So then you fix yourself up a little
bit,

926
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:28,530
kind of humbly because you know God,
you're a fixer upper.

927
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:31,360
If there ever was one and then you got
to figure out,

928
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,360
well what can you figure out how to make
peace with your idiot brother and

929
00:47:34,361 --> 00:47:36,880
probably not because he's just as dumb
as you,

930
00:47:36,881 --> 00:47:38,860
so the holiday hell are you going to
manage that?

931
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,460
And so then you've maybe you get
somewhere that way and your family sort

932
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:45,580
of functioning and you find out,
well that kind of relieved a little bit

933
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:48,400
of suffering,
although it reduce the opportunities for

934
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:53,140
spiteful revenge and that's kind of a
pain in the neck and so then you get

935
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:57,280
your family together a little bit and
your little clued in then at least a bit

936
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:00,400
because you've done something difficult
that's actually difficult.

937
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,270
You're a little wiser and so then maybe
you could put an tend to do finger out

938
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:08,320
beyond the family and try to change some
little thing without racking it.

939
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,640
It's like our society is complex and we
teach our students that they could just

940
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:15,910
fix it.
It's like go fix a military helicopter

941
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:19,150
and see how far you get with that.
It's like you're going to get a dude,

942
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:21,610
you're like a chimp with a wrench.
Whack.

943
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,230
Oh look,
it's better.

944
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,520
It's like,
no,

945
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,830
it's not better.
Things are complicated.

946
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:31,831
And to fix things is really hard and you
have to be like a golden tool to fix

947
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:36,100
things and you're not.
So,

948
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,320
and that's the other message of the
West.

949
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,890
It's like how do you overcome the
suffering of the of life?

950
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,980
And I'm not saying it's only the message
of the West.

951
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:49,120
How do you overcome the suffering of
life is be a better person.

952
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,760
That's how you do it.
Well,

953
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,820
that's hard.
It takes responsibility.

954
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:55,901
And I think,
you know,

955
00:48:55,901 --> 00:48:58,750
if you said to someone,
you want to have a meaningful life,

956
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,120
everything you do matters.

957
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:03,430
That's a definition of a meaningful
life.

958
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,510
But everything you do matters,
you're going to have to carry that with

959
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,870
you.
Or do you want to just forget about the

960
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:14,890
whole meaning thing and then you don't
have any responsibility because who the

961
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:17,350
hell cares?
And you can wander through life doing

962
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,880
whatever you want,
gratifying,

963
00:49:18,881 --> 00:49:22,030
impulsive desires for how useful that's
going to be.

964
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:26,110
And you're stuck in meaninglessness.
But you don't have any responsibility,

965
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:28,330
which one do you want?
Well,

966
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,310
ask yourself which one are you pursuing
and you'll find very rapidly that it

967
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:37,720
isn't the majority of your soul that's
pursuing the whole meaning thing

968
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,240
because,
well look what you have to do to do

969
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:41,074
that.
Yeah.

970
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,630
Have to take on the fact that life is
suffering.

971
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,540
You have put yourself together in the
face of that.

972
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,910
Well that's hard.
Christ,

973
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:50,620
it's amazing.
People can even do it.

974
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,860
I'm stunned every day when I go outside
and it isn't a re a riot with everything

975
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,880
burning.
It could really,

976
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,570
God you talk to people.
It's like I knew this guy,

977
00:50:01,571 --> 00:50:05,380
he'd been in a motorcycle accident and
it really ruined him and he was like a

978
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:06,161
linesman,
you know,

979
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:09,640
working on the power and he was working
with someone who had Parkinson's disease

980
00:50:09,641 --> 00:50:14,641
and they had complimentary inadequacies
and so two of them could do the job of

981
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:19,630
one person and so they're out there
fixing power lines in the freezing cold

982
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:23,560
despite the fact that one was three
quarters wrecked with a motorcycle

983
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:25,510
accident and the other one had
Parkinson's.

984
00:50:25,511 --> 00:50:30,290
It's like that's how our works.
It's like there's all these ruled people

985
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,240
out there.
They've got problems like you can't

986
00:50:32,241 --> 00:50:35,360
believe off.
They go to work and do things they don't

987
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:36,500
even like,
and look,

988
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:38,210
the lights are on.
My God.

989
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,470
It's unbelievable.
It's,

990
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,020
it's a miracle.
It's a miracle.

991
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,440
And we're so ungrateful.
College students,

992
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:47,900
the postmodern types,
they're so ungrateful.

993
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,240
You know,
they don't know that they're surrounded

994
00:50:50,241 --> 00:50:51,980
by it.
Just a bloody miracle.

995
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:54,560
It's a miracle.
It all this stuff works that all you

996
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,840
crazy.
Chimpanzees that don't know each other

997
00:50:56,841 --> 00:51:01,520
can sit in the same room for two hours,
sweltering away without tearing each

998
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,920
other apart because that's what chimps
do.

999
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,283
So

1000
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:12,730
anyways,
so what happened?

1001
00:51:12,731 --> 00:51:15,100
Well,
I made some videos and I got to the

1002
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:17,680
bottom of some things,
at least as far as I can tell.

1003
00:51:17,681 --> 00:51:20,830
So I told you what the bottom is and
then I got this idea about what you

1004
00:51:20,831 --> 00:51:23,260
might do about it,
which isn't my idea.

1005
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,790
It's like,
it's not my idea.

1006
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,020
It's an old,
old,

1007
00:51:26,021 --> 00:51:26,980
old,
old idea.

1008
00:51:26,981 --> 00:51:30,020
It's far older than Christianity.
It's all,

1009
00:51:30,021 --> 00:51:34,720
it's the oldest story of mankind.
Get yourself together,

1010
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,550
transcend your suffering,
see if you can be some kind of hero,

1011
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,270
make the suffering in the world less.
Well,

1012
00:51:43,271 --> 00:51:45,400
that's the way forward as far as I can
tell,

1013
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,770
if there isn't any way forward.
Knots,

1014
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,080
what's under assault by the
postmodernists?

1015
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,780
So look out,
cause they know exactly what they're

1016
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:55,450
doing and they know exactly why they're
doing it.

1017
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,520
And that's what it looks like to me.

1018
00:51:58,310 --> 00:51:59,143
So

1019
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,613
that's it.

1020
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,220
[inaudible].
