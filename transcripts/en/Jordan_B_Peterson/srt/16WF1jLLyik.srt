1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,480
Have asked me some questions about the 
exam.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,093
There's not much to say.
Most of the descriptions listed on the 

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,350
syllabus,
it be in this class.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,903
Um,
my idol regard my exams is particularly 

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,264
tricky.
So if you come to the lectures and done 

6
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:18,530
the reading and he,
people generally do,

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,640
you know as well in this class as they 
do in other classes,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,450
maybe a little bit better.
So it's all multiple choice

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:33,100
and you won't run out of time.
So I don't,

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,410
that's about all there is to say.
There are sample questions posted on the

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,060
website so you can go there and see what
the questions are going to light.

12
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,463
Um,
I just select the dem random lead from 

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,920
questions I've used before,
so they're representative of what you're

14
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,930
going to see.
So,

15
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,430
all right,
so

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,080
back to Sigmund Freud.
So I found a recording of Freud.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,960
I think it's the only known recording.
It's from a BBC broadcast.

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,210
Um,
not too long before he died,

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,440
fall.
Play it.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,000
You can listen along or we long because 
he has a pretty heavy accent,

21
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:24,650
so it's somewhat difficult to
follow.

22
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,550
Ooh,
Ooh,

23
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Ooh,
Ooh,

24
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
Ooh,
ow.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Ow.
Ow,

26
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,010
ow,
ow,

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,790
ow.
I don't remember

28
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,070
why
was

29
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,403
it

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,940
few introductory comments to this 
lecture.

31
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,230
It's hard to imagine the degree to which
Freud re-introduce,

32
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:45,744
biological or introduced biological 
ideas into the study of the human 

33
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:52,850
psyche.
Because by the time Freud came along,

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,450
most of the formal thought about thought
and about the human,

35
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,423
uh,
human psychology was very influenced by 

36
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,580
enlightenment ideas.
And so there was a

37
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,753
relatively widespread belief that people
were rational and scientific and 

38
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,144
becoming increasingly more so.
And perhaps people were becoming 

39
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,943
increasingly more so.
But Freud put the biology back in 

40
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,900
psychology.
I mean,

41
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:34,901
he was a medical doctor and he was 
trained as a neurologist and he was also

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,473
part of a,
I like burgeoning interest in placing 

43
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,913
human beings firmly in that category of 
the Animal Kingdom that was 

44
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:50,531
characteristic of the late 19 hundreds,
particularly in relationship to Darwin

45
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,043
and was Freud who most particularly 
established the fact that our 

46
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:01,844
rationality is in some sense nested 
inside our motivations and emotions and 

47
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,460
our unconscious mind.
And

48
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,830
I think there's no doubt that those 
claims are correct.

49
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,673
Um,
psychologists have always had an animus 

50
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,550
towards Freud.
Um,

51
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,480
it's not exactly clear why he was a 
psychiatrist.

52
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,460
He was a medical doctor.
So maybe that's part of it.

53
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,910
Maybe it's the distinction between the 
different professions.

54
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,453
Um,
but I also have this proclivity to 

55
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:37,934
believe that psychologists tend more 
towards the type of person who's 

56
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,870
convinced that the primary activities 
that characterize human,

57
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,210
the human psyche are our rational 
cognitive.

58
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:54,943
And,

59
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,650
and we certainly have fried to think in 
large part for making a strong case that

60
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,484
that's not not true.
You'll encounter lots of psychologists 

61
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,203
who
do their best in some sense to push 

62
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,870
freud to one side and consider his 
theories outdated and unproven.

63
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,580
And you know,
I don't really think that's fair,

64
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,463
partly because
the literature regarding psychoanalysis 

65
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:32,564
as an effective treatment seems to 
indicate quite clearly that it's as at 

66
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,250
least as or more effective than other 
psychotherapeutic schools.

67
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,143
And it's basically showed that since 
outcome studies of cycle psychotherapy 

68
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:52,760
have been conducted,
so that's three or four decades.

69
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,533
Hmm.

70
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,573
Um,
I don't know if there are gender 

71
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:00,974
differences.
I'd actually different looked into that 

72
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,344
with regards to outcome studies.
I don't think there's there 

73
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,240
substantative so cause I've never heard 
much made of them.

74
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,110
Now the other,
the other issues that Freud described,

75
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,183
for example,
that much of our psychological life is 

76
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,284
unconscious
and much of it is motivated by what are 

77
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,930
both implicit memory.
So memories we don't really realize that

78
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:27,764
we have anymore or basic biological 
drives that seems to me to be 

79
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,610
unquestioned.
Um,

80
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,853
30 years ago a little more than that,
psychologists rediscovered the 

81
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:43,640
unconscious and they made a big fuss 
about that.

82
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:48,641
But I have was well first at 
psychoanalytic thinking by that time and

83
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:49,814
certainly didn't regard that as 
particularly revolutionary because as 

84
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,970
far as I could tell the psychoanalysts 
had been there 60 years before.

85
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,804
In fact,
a lot of the experimental procedures 

86
00:07:58,821 --> 00:07:59,654
that psychologists use to examine the 
unconscious are derived from the sorts 

87
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,104
of Word Association studies,
Priming Studies in some sense that Carl 

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,400
Young pioneer when he was still working 
with Freud.

89
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,970
So we have a lot to thank Freud for.
And he also

90
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,670
introduced and developed the idea of 
psychotherapy as something distinct from

91
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,060
medical treatment for mental disorders.
And you know,

92
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,473
I think there's room for a variety of 
opinions about the overall social and 

93
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:39,914
cultural utility of psychotherapy.
I've read interesting critiques making 

94
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,054
the claim that it's reduced the 
necessity for familial and friendship 

95
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,390
ties,
for example,

96
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,523
as it's proliferated society,
but be that as it may all of the 

97
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,364
psychotherapeutic fields that are 
practically applied I think have freud 

98
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:11,010
to thank for their founding.
So it seems a bit on the ungrateful side

99
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,370
to criticize him too harshly.

100
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,213
I've also found that Freud's 
conceptualizations of certain pathways 

101
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,454
to psychological pathology are 
fundamentally correct and I'll discuss 

102
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:30,954
those in a little bit more detail as we 
proceed through today's lecture now 

103
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,540
because the late 1900 is now a long time
ago.

104
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,510
It's useful to put Freud in his 
historical context.

105
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,003
Um,
so this is partly history of psychology 

106
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,004
I suppose,
but it also shed some light on how the 

107
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:51,744
nature of psychiatric and psychological 
disorders transform with time because 

108
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:56,640
you know,
you tend to think of them as,

109
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,610
especially if you're more
scientifically oriented,

110
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,030
you tend to think of a disorder or an 
illness as something that approximates a

111
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:10,530
scientific category.
But I think about illnesses,

112
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,723
diagnostic categories,
let's say is they're not precisely 

113
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,140
scientific categories.
In fact,

114
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:18,150
they might not be scientific categories 
at all.

115
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,163
They're informed by science sometimes.
And I would say increasingly as we 

116
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:25,920
develop the diagnostics and statistics 
manual,

117
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,754
which is the fundamental book that 
outlands psychiatric and psychological 

118
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:32,220
diagnosis,
particularly in North America,

119
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,054
but increasingly around the world,
science is being used to inform the 

120
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:38,754
language that sits at the bottom of the 
dimensions along which the pathologies 

121
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:45,000
are defined.

122
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,223
So for example,
with regards to the personality 

123
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:50,220
disorders,
there's increasing emphasis,

124
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,630
although not enough emphasis yet on 
dimensional models such as the big five.

125
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,453
But you have to understand that medical 
diagnostic categories serve a number of 

126
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,514
purposes.
And you shouldn't get cynical about 

127
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,420
this.
Often people start out by thinking about

128
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:07,254
diagnostic categories is scientific.
And then they soon find out that the 

129
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:11,424
idea that their scientific can be 
criticized on multiple different fronts 

130
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:16,980
and quite severely.
Michel Foucault,

131
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,630
for example,
has done a lot of that.

132
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,683
Um,
and his works were regarded as 

133
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,594
revolutionary by people who didn't know 
anything about the history of 

134
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:25,044
psychiatric disorders because most of 
what he outlined was already known by 

135
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:30,684
people who took the time to know,
hardly went through code line was the 

136
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:34,944
fact that psychiatric diagnostic 
categories like medical diagnostic 

137
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:43,281
categories play a sociological and 
political and economic role as well as a

138
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,530
scientific and treatment oriented role.

139
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,453
And that's part of it because as I 
mentioned at the beginning of the 

140
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:50,874
lecture series,
when you're attempting to move someone 

141
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,424
from abnormality say,
or ill health towards normality or 

142
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,140
health and the Noah's Ark precisely at 
the same,

143
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,550
not precisely parallel lines there,
um,

144
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,193
you're doing a lot more than science.
You're also involved in athletics and 

145
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,240
you can't help it.
And then,

146
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,103
you know,
you also have to think about why it is 

147
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,010
that we have psychiatric diagnostic 
categories,

148
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:19,720
for example.
And you know,

149
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,830
some of the critics of psychiatry,
especially in the 1960s,

150
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,993
regarded that as primarily an economic 
or political movement that was designed 

151
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:32,620
to categorize people who engaged in 
abnormal behavior and to,

152
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,220
and to prevent them from exercising 
their full rights.

153
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:37,180
In society.
No,

154
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,940
because it was thought of as a purely 
oppressive

155
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,933
enterprise.
Now all you have to do is take a walk 

156
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:47,644
around Toronto and see all the d 
institutionalized schizophrenia ix 

157
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,933
wandering around and enjoying their 
freedom to understand that the 

158
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,124
description of psychiatry as a purely
tyrannical rural pressive sociological 

159
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:09,181
regime has a lot to account for because 
those people were Ddd,

160
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,410
institutionalized in the late sixties 
and early seventies and the institutions

161
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,580
have never been rebuilt.

162
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,713
And all that happened was that they were
dumped on the streets where they 

163
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:22,240
generally stop taking your medication 
and survived very poorly.

164
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,573
So even if psychiatry plays a 
sociological and political and economic 

165
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,070
role,
don't be thinking that,

166
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:30,904
that it validates it as an enterprise 
just me and said it's a very complex 

167
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:38,470
enterprise that has to span multiple 
dimensions of,

168
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,170
it stands on many different 
philosophical and scientific foundations

169
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,353
now,
psychiatric diagnostic categories and 

170
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,640
the symptomatology that's associated 
with them also transforms with time.

171
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,453
And that's kind of a strange thing,
especially if you think about 

172
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,550
psychiatric ill health as a biological 
phenomenon.

173
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,300
But the language transforms across time 
too.

174
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,433
And it's grounded in biology.
And the truth of the matter is that 

175
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,660
nothing that human beings do or 
experience exists in a cultural vacuum.

176
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,720
So for example,
when I was young,

177
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,830
Carmen,
schizophrenia delusions,

178
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,610
especially for the paranoid 
schizophrenia,

179
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,473
was that the TV was talking to them.
Now obviously they didn't have that 

180
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,350
delusion in 1920 because there weren't 
any televisions.

181
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,320
So by the time it was saying 1930 it 
wouldn't be in the radio.

182
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,410
And now the most common focus of 
paranoia is the internet.

183
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,003
And there's some reasons for that 
because even if the TV wasn't spying on 

184
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:49,920
you,
the Internet probably is.

185
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,523
So that's a simple example showing how 
cultural transformation can change the 

186
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,064
content and send the phenomenology 
that's associated with a given 

187
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,273
psychiatric disorder.
So you can take them to them as being 

188
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:08,831
characterized by some combination of 
biology,

189
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,460
biological pathology,
historical pathology,

190
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,240
pathology that's limited to the 
individual's experience.

191
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,440
And then you can think of it that all as
nested inside a given cultural context,

192
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,620
which in itself may be pathological or 
normative.

193
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,713
And so it's the interplay of all those 
factors that makes understanding mental 

194
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:37,850
illness and diagnostic categories are 
very challenging enterprise,

195
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,940
especially when you also add to that the
necessity for social control,

196
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,410
which would be the political and 
economic dimension,

197
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,590
and then also for intervention at the 
individual level.

198
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:51,230
Because one of the things you want to 
ask yourself as well,

199
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,013
what serves society better?
Society served better by putting people 

200
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,674
who are completely unable of adopting 
normative behavior and who may be 

201
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:05,954
disruptive and frightening somewhere
where they cannot disturb the bulk of 

202
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:17,110
the population.
So that's question number one.

203
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,470
The answer of that is all not.
Obviously that's a mistake.

204
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,723
Now,
it may be a mistake and it certainly 

205
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:24,314
would be a mistake in some cases,
but you can't just simply say that it's 

206
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:31,580
a mistake all the time because you want 
to be able to walk around on the streets

207
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,523
relatively on harassed and free of fear 
to not an unreasonable desire for a 

208
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,820
civilized society.
Then the next question,

209
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,560
or maybe even the first question might 
be,

210
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,633
well,
do these institutions help the 

211
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,980
individuals with whom they're directly 
interacted?

212
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,880
And then the right answer to that is 
compared to what?

213
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,630
Because compared to perfect,
the answer is no,

214
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,920
but compared to no help whatsoever,
the answer is probably yes.

215
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,860
And so it's also worthwhile to be useful
in your,

216
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,460
or to be realistic in your expectations.
So for example,

217
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,294
most people who are schizophrenia don't 
like to take their psychiatric 

218
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:11,054
medication.
And the reason for that is because 

219
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:13,634
antipsychotic medications,
which were only really popularized at 

220
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:21,290
the end of the 1950s work on the 
biological axis,

221
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,050
the dopaminergic system that produces 
positive emotion.

222
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,153
And so if you take an anti psychotic,
it's going to flatten out your positive 

223
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:28,964
emotion and demotivate,
motivate you and sort of take the color 

224
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,280
out of your life.
And you can imagine that that's not very

225
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,013
music.
And then of course if you take them and 

226
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,564
you start to feel better and maybe 
you're feeling better for three or four 

227
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,520
months or six months or a year,
you're going to be thinking,

228
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,133
well,
maybe I kept her and then you're going 

229
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,524
to stop taking them.
So if you ask a schizophrenia very 

230
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:54,030
frequently about their medication,
they'll say,

231
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,560
well,
they're not very happy to be taking it,

232
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:58,020
and they'd like to quit as soon as they 
can.

233
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,740
But that does not necessarily mean that 
the medication is not

234
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:03,420
okay

235
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,253
doing something that's beneficial.
It just means that the best they can 

236
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:07,764
hope for is not very good.
And that doesn't point directly to a 

237
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:14,670
flaw in the system that's dealing with 
them.

238
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:15,683
It just points to the terrible nature of
the disease and it's fundamentally 

239
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,120
intractable qualities.
Okay,

240
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:24,954
so back to front.
So that now a lot of what Freud saw was 

241
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,710
sexual pathology.
Now you might ask yourself why.

242
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,783
Well,
the first thing we could point out is 

243
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:37,854
that when Freud was alive,
society was very highly divided by 

244
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,683
gender,
was divided by gender roles and man's 

245
00:18:45,521 --> 00:18:50,070
were authorities and women's were by and
large subordinate.

246
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,933
Although

247
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,790
that situation is more complex than a 
simple reading of history might lead you

248
00:18:57,791 --> 00:19:00,310
to conclude.
So for example,

249
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,144
if you read tolstoy's novels 
characterizing Russian society in the 

250
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:05,914
late 1900 you find out that among the 
aristocratic women and after all only 

251
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,633
the aristocrats have power,
there was plenty of power being 

252
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:13,804
exercised.
The women essentially structured 

253
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:15,754
society,
men were involved in politics and they 

254
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:18,784
were involved in war,
but women were setting up the social 

255
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:26,380
interactions that characterize the bulk 
of of society

256
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,270
in their groups and in there and then 
their own interactions.

257
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,910
So it's not clear who was doing what 
when.

258
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,330
What is clear though is that in the 
Victorian times,

259
00:19:37,331 --> 00:19:42,130
sex was a lot more dangerous for women 
than it is now and it's plenty dangerous

260
00:19:42,131 --> 00:19:43,390
now.
A,

261
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:46,390
there was no reliable form of birth 
control.

262
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,510
That's a big problem.
And B,

263
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,673
there was tremendous risk of syphilis 
and selfless for all intensive purposes 

264
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,490
was as bad or is as bad or worse than 
aids.

265
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,070
Now what's controllable now,
but it wasn't controllable then.

266
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,143
And syphilis could also be passed on to 
children and it was a neurological 

267
00:20:07,511 --> 00:20:10,210
disease that could take virtually any 
form.

268
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,880
So it was a real terror for European 
society.

269
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,953
And so the reason that's a Europe that 
the victorians were sort of repressive 

270
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:21,010
in sexual matters was because of the 
environment demanded it.

271
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,640
And we know and more research has been 
done on this recently.

272
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,474
It's fascinating research.
We know that as the rate of contagious 

273
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,843
pathogen in the environment increases,
the degree to which is society becomes 

274
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:38,950
authoritarian increases and very 
rapidly.

275
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,053
In fact,
there's recent data showing that it was 

276
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,143
a paper published just a few months ago 
showing that the correlation between 

277
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:47,224
infectious prevalence in a given 
geographical locale and authoritarian 

278
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,413
political views held by the individuals 
in that locale approaches 0.7 which is 

279
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,420
absolutely phenomenal.
It's such a high correlation that it,

280
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,383
it,
it almost eats up all of the 

281
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,374
relationship.

282
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,560
And so as the risk of infectious disease
rises,

283
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,060
people become less and less tolerant in 
there.

284
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,093
Um,
views on interpersonal behavior and a 

285
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,490
lot of back scoring can be associated 
with sexual behavior cause that's a very

286
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:20,290
good vector for the transmission of 
disease.

287
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,330
We should remember that,
you know,

288
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:26,470
if we hadn't been so technologically 
advanced in the 1980s,

289
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,783
well first of all,
age wouldn't have spread because it 

290
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:34,121
spread because of air travel.
But apart from that you don't,

291
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,493
age could have taken us all out.
It was just luck of the draw and 

292
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,600
technological power that enabled us to 
keep it under control.

293
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,320
And you know,
there's no reason to assume that another

294
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,040
sexually transmissible play like age 
won't come along.

295
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,910
So does that price promiscuity increases
the rate at which sexually transmissible

296
00:21:57,461 --> 00:22:00,250
diseases are transmitted rises 
exponentially.

297
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,470
Right.
And in a connected world,

298
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,333
that's bad news.
So my point is the Friday and the 

299
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:06,634
victorians had their reasons to be 
relatively repressive from a sexual 

300
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,560
perspective.
Um,

301
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,310
there was another problem too,
which for women in particular,

302
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:16,150
which was that

303
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,533
yeah,

304
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,133
apart from the danger of pregnancy and 
the danger of sexually transmitted 

305
00:22:24,291 --> 00:22:25,124
disease,
there was also the danger of the 

306
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,134
destruction of their social reputation.
And so if a woman got a reputation for 

307
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,880
um,
promiscuity at any level,

308
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,163
the probability that she was going to be
tossed out of her sociological niche 

309
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,350
into some God awful life of prostitution
for example,

310
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,730
was really quite high.
So now,

311
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,680
so that sets up the sociological,
what would you call it?

312
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,260
This,
the sociological surround.

313
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,980
You don't repress something unless
engaging in it has high cost.

314
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,270
And certainly for the Victorian sexual 
behavior was a high cost enterprise,

315
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,940
especially for the women.
And so freud,

316
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,440
given Freud's emphasis on biological 
motivation

317
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,340
and given his,
his belief that section sexual drive was

318
00:23:25,341 --> 00:23:28,510
a fundamentally,
what's one of the fundamental biological

319
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:32,440
motivations?
You can see that the stage is set for in

320
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,300
some sense for it,
no amount of conflict.

321
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,130
Now the conflict.
So I'm already there.

322
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,730
When you were a child,
say of 11 or 10

323
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,183
you exist in a world where the demand or
even the desire for engaging in sexual 

324
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,620
behavior is low.
But as soon as puberty kicks in,

325
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,663
things changed dramatically.
Then the child was faced with a problem 

326
00:23:52,371 --> 00:23:53,204
of integrating the new demand that's 
placed on them by the maturation of 

327
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:59,300
their body into their personality and an
end to the social surround.

328
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,600
And that's no simple matter when there's
genuine conflicts between its expression

329
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,560
and other important considerations like 
social propriety and health,

330
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:13,220
for example,
or maybe medium to longterm relationship

331
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:16,910
stability or maybe the provision of a 
safe place to raise children,

332
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,013
et cetera.

333
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,573
So that's the situation that the 
[inaudible] or the victorians found 

334
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,890
themselves in.
Now,

335
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,110
Freud believed that many of the patients
that he saw,

336
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,350
the female patients had been sexually 
abused or molested as children.

337
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,303
He wavered in that belief throughout his
life and has been called to task rather 

338
00:24:41,301 --> 00:24:44,450
severely for that by more current 
critics.

339
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,780
But Freud was one of the first observers
of the extreme malleability of memory.

340
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:56,800
And he found it very difficult when he 
was interacting with his clients,

341
00:24:57,471 --> 00:24:59,930
especially the ones who are more 
hysterical in,

342
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,063
in their essential orientation to 
distinguish between memories that they 

343
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,840
had made up or fantasies and things that
actually happened to them.

344
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:13,841
And until you encounter someone who's 
memory structure is extremely incoherent

345
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,743
and chaotic,
it's almost impossible to realize to 

346
00:25:20,781 --> 00:25:21,614
what degree people can wonder around in 
the world with no sense whatsoever of 

347
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:28,400
what's happened to them.

348
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,233
So for example,
I had a client at one point who told me 

349
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,230
that she thought she had been raped five
times.

350
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,383
And so the first thing you might know if
you heard a statement like that is that 

351
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:42,703
the word thought is a very peculiar 
insertion in that sentence because it's 

352
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:47,474
not exactly all that straightforward to 
understand how you would have any doubt 

353
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:56,111
about that if it happened five times.
So she was a very strange woman,

354
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,993
and she was a person who was very much 
like someone Freud would have described 

355
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
in the late 19th century as a hysteric.
She had virtually no catalyzed identity.

356
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
She was,
as far as I could tell,

357
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:13,874
almost completely hollow in that none of
the things that have ever happened to 

358
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:18,794
her see you have been processed beyond 
the mere fact that they occurred and I 

359
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:24,554
think that a big part of that was 
because she didn't really ever have 

360
00:26:27,111 --> 00:26:28,130
anyone to talk to.

361
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,700
And one of the things that's emerged as 
a consequence of Freud's work in part is

362
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:34,544
a realization of the degree to which 
communication about your experiences is 

363
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,170
advantageous or even necessary in the 
maintenance of mental health.

364
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,470
Now,
Freud believed that

365
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,043
you needed to talk about experiences 
that were particularly emotionally 

366
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:49,704
significant part in it because it was 
necessary to release or or ab react the 

367
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:59,160
emotions that were associated with the 
experience he called that Catharsis more

368
00:26:59,161 --> 00:26:59,994
recent research,
particularly on like that and done by 

369
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:02,154
James Pennebaker has indicated that it's
actually the articulation of those 

370
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:06,264
experiences,
the verbalization and their 

371
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,283
transformation into a coherent 
representation that seems to be 

372
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:17,130
beneficial for mental health rather than
the mere expression of it

373
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,150
motion.
But

374
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,893
just because Freud was only partially 
right about why his method worked 

375
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,830
doesn't mean he was wrong about the fact
that it did work.

376
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Now this woman
was unemployed and had been for years,

377
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,913
although she dressed in a business suit 
and she had talked her way into hosting 

378
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:50,011
a cable television show in the town I 
was working with in,

379
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,043
in the city I was working in.
That was a program about fostering the 

380
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:55,264
entrepreneurial spirit even though she 
was unemployed and it never started a 

381
00:27:58,361 --> 00:27:59,194
business in her life and she has also 
talked her way on to a government board 

382
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:08,080
that was charged with investigating the 
development of a high speed rail lake in

383
00:28:08,081 --> 00:28:12,070
southern Ontario even though she had 
absolutely no experience whatsoever with

384
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,623
business or railways,
so she had a reasonably well developed 

385
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:18,664
persona from a union perspective.
I asked her at one point to show me her 

386
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,653
resume and she brought me in a binder.
You know those three ring binders that 

387
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:31,384
was an inch and a half thick with those 
little tab dividers that you use to 

388
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,823
segregate different sections of your cv 
and in which she had included a 20 page 

389
00:28:44,051 --> 00:28:44,884
description of her recent dreams and a 
discussion or a list of all the novels 

390
00:28:49,901 --> 00:28:54,130
she read in the last 10 years.
She was completely

391
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:55,930
okay,

392
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,763
incapable of noting that every single 
thing about that cv was inappropriate 

393
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,140
even though she didn't suffer from any 
formal thought disorder.

394
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:05,974
She,
she wasn't schizophrenia or a psychotic 

395
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:13,291
in any way.
With regards to the rape statement,

396
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,873
she told me that what happened to her 
frequently was that she would go to a 

397
00:29:18,671 --> 00:29:19,504
bar in her vague and ill defined way and
she'd have a few drinks or maybe more 

398
00:29:24,341 --> 00:29:25,174
than a few and then she'd end up back in
her place with some mat or at his place 

399
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,660
and then that night they would have

400
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,973
sexual relations and then in the morning
she was unclear about whether or not 

401
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:39,394
that was voluntary.
Now this was a fascinating case for me 

402
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,700
because she outlined that story to be 
in.

403
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,090
At this point,
I have become somewhat familiar with the

404
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:54,091
danger of therapists,
manipulation of patient memories because

405
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,040
therapists can implant,
so to speak,

406
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,380
memories in clients,
but it's very,

407
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,214
very complicated because when you're 
dealing with someone who's as chaotic 

408
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,040
and vague as this particular person was,
it's virtually impossible not to implant

409
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,250
memories just by talking about them.
So here's,

410
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,620
so I thought,
she told me the story and I thought,

411
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:15,454
okay,
I have a chance to reorganize this 

412
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:18,874
woman's entire concept,
conception of her past sexual 

413
00:30:21,191 --> 00:30:25,450
experiences by uttering a variety of 
sentences.

414
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,920
So I could have said,

415
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,213
well,

416
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,610
unless you give express consent to each 
stage of the sexual transaction,

417
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,073
then you're clearly being victimized and
your claim that you may have been raped 

418
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:45,090
five times could be transformed into the
claim that you work.

419
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,430
Or it could have said,
are you completely out of your mind?

420
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,773
If you go to a bar and a single's bar by
yourself and you have six or seven 

421
00:30:56,941 --> 00:30:57,774
drinks or however many drinks you had 
and you bring someone home or go to 

422
00:31:01,351 --> 00:31:06,210
their place and you end up in bed with 
them and that happens five times,

423
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,820
then probably you have something to do 
with it.

424
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,970
And making a claim of rape is observed 
and then you might ask yourself which of

425
00:31:14,911 --> 00:31:15,744
those opposing interpretations are 
correct and it doesn't matter because I 

426
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:20,064
did tell her either of them because it 
was up to her to sort out exactly what 

427
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:25,044
had happened.

428
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:27,563
Now,

429
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,830
it's not that easy to believe that 
people like that exist,

430
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:31,664
but they do.
And she was someone who had never 

431
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:39,740
reflected on any of her experiences.
She had no real articulated identity.

432
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,370
And a big part of that was because she 
was completely isolated.

433
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,803
And so when Freud got confused about 
whether his client's memories of sexual 

434
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:53,720
trauma in childhood were accurate or 
inaccurate,

435
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:55,123
the reason that he got confused was 
because he was frequently dealing with 

436
00:31:58,281 --> 00:31:59,114
people who were confused right down to 
the bottom of their souls and who for 

437
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:03,584
one reason or another had never been 
able to engage in the process of 

438
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:07,484
articulation that would've allowed them 
to established a well establish a well 

439
00:32:11,301 --> 00:32:13,070
differentiated identity.

440
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,493
The

441
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,033
texted I'm showing you in these slides 
is based department work by book by a 

442
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:30,840
man named Henry Henri.
Actually Ellen [inaudible],

443
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,980
who is an existentialist,
was an existentialist psychologist,

444
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:36,083
psychiatrist who lived in Montreal and 
he wrote a book called the discovery of 

445
00:32:38,611 --> 00:32:39,444
the,
and if you're interested in 

446
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:43,700
psychoanalytic thought and the history 
of psychoanalytic thought,

447
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,890
that's the best book that's ever been 
written.

448
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,050
It's called the discovery of the 
unconscious.

449
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,240
Now the other thing Alan Bridgej points 
out,

450
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,823
cause I paraphrased his book here,
is that punishments for transgressions 

451
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:58,700
in the Victorian Times,
we're also fairly draconian.

452
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,600
And that also sets up the situation for 
conflict.

453
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,273
No.
If you're driven by something that's a 

454
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:05,954
very strong drive and you're liable to 
encounter tremendous trouble as a 

455
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:13,130
consequence of engaging in it,
it's not a very easy thing for you to do

456
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:15,530
to figure out how to negotiate that 
particular landscape.

457
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,530
Alabama Shay says,
psychoanalysis evidently belongs to that

458
00:33:25,531 --> 00:33:26,364
unmasking trend.
The search for hidden unconscious 

459
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:33,270
motivations characteristic of the 1880s 
and nineties in Freud as a nature,

460
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,343
words and deeds are viewed as 
manifestations of unconscious 

461
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:37,554
motivations,
mainly of instincts and conflicts have 

462
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:44,280
instincts for both men.
The unconscious is the wild realm of the

463
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:45,114
wild bruce instincts that cannot find 
permissible outlets that derive from 

464
00:33:48,631 --> 00:33:49,464
earlier stages of the individual and of 
mankind and that find expression in 

465
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:54,000
passion,
dreams,

466
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,893
and mental illnesses.
Even the term id does s originates from 

467
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:00,594
nature.
The dynamic concept of mind with the 

468
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,154
notions of mental energy,
Quanta of latent or inhibited energy or 

469
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:09,384
release of energy or transfer from one 
drive to another is also to be found in 

470
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:12,984
nature.
Before Freud nature conceived the mind 

471
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:20,160
as a system of drives that can collide 
or be fused into each other.

472
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,343
Okay,

473
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,510
this is from

474
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,670
okay.

475
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:37,060
The life and work of Sigmund Freud by 
Jones,

476
00:34:37,061 --> 00:34:42,061
who was Freud's biographer
talking about the process that

477
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:48,400
resulted in Freud's hypothesis about the
unconscious.

478
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,800
John says in the summer of 1897 freud 
undertook his most heroic feat.

479
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,813
A psychoanalysis of his own unconscious 
is something that's akin in some sense 

480
00:34:58,841 --> 00:34:59,674
to the initiatory routines that I've 
described for you at the beginning of 

481
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,380
this course.
It's hard for us nowadays to imagine how

482
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:06,214
momentous this achievement was,
that difficulty being the fate of most 

483
00:35:09,221 --> 00:35:10,054
pioneering exploits.
Yet the uniqueness of the feet remains 

484
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,490
once done.
It has done forever

485
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,050
for no one again,
can be the first to explore those depths

486
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,723
and the long history of humanity.
The task has often been attempted 

487
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,370
philosophers and writers from Salon to 
Montana,

488
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,353
from juvenile to show up and hire.
Schopenhauer had essay to follow the 

489
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:34,630
advice of the delphic oracle know 
thyself,

490
00:35:34,631 --> 00:35:35,464
but all had succumb to the effort.
Inner had borrowed advance there had 

491
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:43,110
from time to time being flashes of 
intuition to point the way,

492
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,820
but they'd always flickered out the 
realm of the unconscious whose existence

493
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:49,950
was so often postulated,
remained dark,

494
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,170
and the words of Hair Clyde is still 
stood,

495
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,183
stood.
The soul of man is a far country which 

496
00:35:56,101 --> 00:35:56,934
cannot be approached or explored.
Freud had no hell no one to assist the 

497
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:03,900
undertaking in the slightest degree,
worse than this,

498
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,113
the very thing that drove him onwards,
he must've definitely divine however 

499
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:09,474
much he tried to conceal it from himself
could only result it profoundly 

500
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:14,514
affecting his relations,
perhaps even severing them with the one 

501
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:20,160
being who he was so closely bound and 
who had steadied his mental equilibrium.

502
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,000
It was daring bunch and risking much 
what courage,

503
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,160
intellectual and moral must've be 
needed,

504
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,250
but it was forthcoming.
Now obviously Jones is a real admirer of

505
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,114
Freud

506
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:35,953
and he believed that
Freud's hypothesis emerged from a 

507
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:44,720
careful analysis from Freud's careful 
analysis of his own fantasies and drives

508
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:46,010
an unconscious life.

509
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,853
Okay.

510
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,403
The Friday and model divides the human 
psyche and in a variety of different 

511
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:02,904
ways,
the simplest of which is conscious and 

512
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:09,870
unconscious and elman bear.
He points out that by 1,904 functions of

513
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:14,460
the unconscious had been described.
There's the conservative,

514
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,580
so that's memory,
that's memory,

515
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:20,640
so in some manner that we don't really 
understand

516
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,423
your psyche is the storehouse of 
representations of experiences that 

517
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:29,664
you've had prior to today.
Now some of those are recallable as the 

518
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:36,984
stories that constitute your experience.
Those would be the sorts of things that 

519
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:40,374
come up in your mind is images,
maybe dreamlike images or movie like 

520
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:43,854
images or stories that you can 
explicitly tell people about your past 

521
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,700
experiences where you're the actor in 
those experiences.

522
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,973
There's also the elements of memory that
enabled you to do things like to speak 

523
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,503
and you don't have conscious access to 
how it is that you know how to speak or 

524
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:01,854
for example,
how it is that you know how to ride a 

525
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:05,280
bike.
That's more implicit forms of memory.

526
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:06,114
So that unconscious contains the 
information or the skills or the 

527
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:12,414
circuitry that enables you to engage in 
complex motor acts that you've learned 

528
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:16,704
to do.

529
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,000
Does alluded the unconscious contains 
habits.

530
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:22,834
Those are,
those are the more procedural elements 

531
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:25,624
that I,
that I just described and dissociated 

532
00:38:27,911 --> 00:38:31,240
elements of the personality which may 
lead a parasitic existence.

533
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,223
Now that's an interesting idea.
So part of that's predicated the notion 

534
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:38,920
that I showed you this hierarchy before.
Yes,

535
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,120
you've seen this before,
right?

536
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,720
So now you can imagine that when you're 
watching,

537
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,000
when you're interacting with maybe your 
father,

538
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,080
your mother,
your sister,

539
00:38:47,081 --> 00:38:47,914
your great aunt,
or that there are chunks of their 

540
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,494
personality that you incorporate into 
yourself sort of from whole cloth that 

541
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:58,690
maybe you're doing that in the PS Yeti 
incense by imitating them and,

542
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,603
and so the and and that you're,
you're being is full of these 

543
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,703
hierarchies are sub hierarchies,
each of which is devoted towards a 

544
00:39:09,101 --> 00:39:13,750
single per purpose or maybe singular 
collection of purposes.

545
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,063
And that you can switch back and forth 
between being dominated by one of these 

546
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:20,860
or the other.

547
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,450
And some of them are more straight 
forward,

548
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:23,284
like the state of perception and action 
that might characterize you if you're 

549
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,390
simply angry or if you're simply 
possessed by sexual desire.

550
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:32,403
But the more complicated ones would be 
those that make those who know you say 

551
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,983
you're acting just like your mother now 
or you're acting just like your father 

552
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:45,370
now and what that means in the sense 
from the [inaudible] perspective,

553
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,270
and I think as well from the Piagetian 
and perspective that you've incorporated

554
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,403
huge subsets of the habits and 
perceptual scheme is that make up the 

555
00:39:54,071 --> 00:39:57,610
people who were closest to you in your 
developmental history.

556
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,680
Now Freud would believe that those 
things can motivate you on unconsciously

557
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,523
in that for example,
you might be living out your parents 

558
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,053
unconscious dreams or maybe you're 
living out your parents unconscious 

559
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:13,891
dreams that you'd be a bad child.
That happens very frequently.

560
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,970
I've seen families,
for example,

561
00:40:15,971 --> 00:40:16,804
where a daughter was born instead of a 
son to the great dissatisfaction of the 

562
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:22,174
mother,
and the consequence of that was that 

563
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,383
that child was essentially demonized 
from day one and to the degree to which 

564
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:34,450
that was precisely unconscious behavior.
On the part of the mother was debatable,

565
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,284
but certainly if you asked her if she 
was out to destroy her child with every 

566
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:41,470
action she ever cooked,
she would say no.

567
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,290
But if you watched her carefully across 
months,

568
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,840
you would see that that was precisely 
what she was doing.

569
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,190
Now you might ask,
well,

570
00:40:48,191 --> 00:40:50,530
why would someone develop an attitude 
like that?

571
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,603
And this particular person,
the mother had grown up in a culture 

572
00:40:55,270 --> 00:41:00,270
where boys were more valued than girls,
certainly within the confines of a given

573
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:04,680
family,
and she'd already had daughter.

574
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,950
So was that her?
Was that the culture?

575
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,440
Was it something that she picked up for 
whom parents,

576
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,423
God only knows,
but with this free floating spirit in a 

577
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:16,084
sense that happened to inhabit her and 
shaped the way that she was interacting 

578
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,014
with the world without her really 
understanding what she was doing at an 

579
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,750
articulated level at all.
In fact,

580
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26,584
if you ever more or less confronted her 
with the evidence that she was doing 

581
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:30,124
such a thing,
she did out solutely everything you 

582
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:32,914
could possibly to refuse to take any 
ownership for that whatsoever or to 

583
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,294
articulate it or even to conceive that a
human being might be capable of such a 

584
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:43,634
thing,
even though the situation to her and 

585
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,890
family made a polling look like a 
vacation.

586
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,080
Okay.

587
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,913
Creative.
The unconscious serves as the Matrix of 

588
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:54,980
new ideas.
Well,

589
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:58,040
here's an idea.
Where do your thoughts come from?

590
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,580
Well,
you know,

591
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,460
you say you think them up.
Well,

592
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:05,580
you know,
as far as black sexplanations goal,

593
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,590
that's a prime one.
There's,

594
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,320
what do you mean you think of them off 
young,

595
00:42:10,321 --> 00:42:12,060
pointed out.
That's not even accurate.

596
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:15,660
It's more like they appear in your 
experience more or less.

597
00:42:15,661 --> 00:42:16,494
Unbidden you know,
it's funny thing because you can 

598
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,494
concentrate and that seems to facilitate
the process of the generation of new 

599
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:23,634
ideas at least sometimes.
But most of the time it just seems like 

600
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,410
you're standing in a room by yourself in
the dark and the thought comes.

601
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,630
And where does it come from?
Well.

602
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:37,690
The psychoanalytic explanation for that,
which is more of a description is tall.

603
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,040
It comes from the unconscious.
That is the unconscious that's producing

604
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,310
those Mytho poetic,
the unconscious constructs,

605
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,570
narratives and fantasies that appear 
mythic or roulette,

606
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:48,443
religious in nature.
So what that means at least in part is 

607
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:54,264
that some of the dissociated fragments 
of personality say that inhabit you and 

608
00:43:01,561 --> 00:43:06,561
guide your actions are so ancient,
partly because of their biological basis

609
00:43:06,841 --> 00:43:11,160
and part of that because of the ancient 
historical overlay on top of that,

610
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,323
that they take the form of great myths 
and stories that look like they're 

611
00:43:17,131 --> 00:43:20,670
common to everyone in one form or 
another.

612
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,923
So for it,
I think a good example of that might be 

613
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:29,730
the degree to which you are possessed by
the rivalry with your sibling,

614
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,420
which is one of the oldest stories that 
no,

615
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,293
the man,
the individual members of mankind tell 

616
00:43:36,401 --> 00:43:41,400
it to one another because it's such a 
common experience and because the manner

617
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,234
in which that experience is going to 
manifest itself has been shaped by 

618
00:43:45,181 --> 00:43:46,660
cultural representation.

619
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,103
Freud was also very much convinced that 
the mind was a composite of 

620
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:54,494
contradictory drives.
This is a very interesting proposition 

621
00:43:57,811 --> 00:44:00,170
and I think one that's true.
I think you can,

622
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,123
you can see it most particularly if you 
consider the behavior of two year olds 

623
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,070
and as I've already discussed with you,
if you watch a two year old,

624
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,480
they rapidly cycle from one intensely 
motivated state to another.

625
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:16,780
And I think I'm reasonable way of 
conceptualizing that is that much of the

626
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:22,061
underlying biology of the two year old 
is already in place in terms of it's his

627
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:27,620
or her fundamental motivations.
Two year old can be hungry in a two year

628
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:28,454
old can be hot or colder,
uncomfortable in a variety of different 

629
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:36,711
ways or feel pain or feel anxiety or 
feel joy or feel exhilaration.

630
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,610
Your curiosity,
your surprise,

631
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,773
all that circuitry is there,
but it's not integrated at a higher 

632
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,900
level into a functioning personality.

633
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Because in part what the functioning 
personality is is a collective agreement

634
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:57,261
among all those fundamental drives as to
which is going to take priority when and

635
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:58,824
under what conditions and the 
integration of that with the entire 

636
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,690
broader cultural meal.
You.

637
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,531
So,
for example,

638
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:12,531
by the time your two year old is for,
you would expect them to be able to rate

639
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,673
self regulate,
which means when they step into a 

640
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:17,723
particular circumstance,
they should be able to determine which 

641
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:24,270
of their motivational states is going to
be allowed to manifest itself.

642
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,170
We would think about that as a form of 
learned inhibition,

643
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:29,004
even though it's really not,
it's more like the integration of those 

644
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,950
motivated states into a higher order 
game where each of them gets a chance to

645
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:38,003
express themselves,
but only in a particular order and only 

646
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:44,070
under particular circumstances.
And then of course the four year old has

647
00:45:44,071 --> 00:45:44,904
to have learned to do that in the 
presence of other children and in the 

648
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,410
presence of other adults.

649
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:50,483
So that that fundamental motivational 
structures are integrated into a higher 

650
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,604
order structure that allows everybody to
get along just fine and for everyone to 

651
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:02,400
pursue the things that they need to 
pursue.

652
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,103
And so
part of the reason you might think that 

653
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,394
you have a cortex is so that you can 
take the more fundamental elements of 

654
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:14,754
your drives,
which you could think of as part of the 

655
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,420
Friday and Ed,
which means it.

656
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,433
It's the thing that in you isn't you.
It's the things that you're subject to 

657
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:23,844
from within.
The reason that you have a cortex in 

658
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,990
many ways is so that you can figure out 
how to integrate those complex states of

659
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:31,824
being that,
that keep you alive in some fundamental 

660
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:35,904
sense into a society that's 
characterized by hundreds or thousands 

661
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:44,490
of other creatures trying to do the same
thing at the same time.

662
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,713
And so you can imagine that that 
requires particular adaptation to the 

663
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:53,340
particulars of this society and that and
the more general functions of the,

664
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,570
of the deep end.

665
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:00,410
So the unconscious is partly the end,
which is this collection of drives,

666
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:02,274
Freud concentrated mark mostly on the 
sexual drives and the aggressive drives 

667
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,220
because those are,
or instincts,

668
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,350
the sexual instincts and they're 
aggressive instincts.

669
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:11,184
It's a better term that drive because 
those are the most difficult to 

670
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:15,744
integrate into the surrounding social 
male you because sex for example is a 

671
00:47:20,401 --> 00:47:21,234
pretty selfish act.
It isn't an altruistic act in any 

672
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:28,440
sentence and in some sense it's also a 
zero sum game.

673
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,483
You're in competition with everyone else
for your success at that particular 

674
00:47:33,641 --> 00:47:34,474
game.
You can say the same thing about 

675
00:47:35,351 --> 00:47:36,184
aggression,
especially if you think about it in 

676
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:38,734
relationship to dominance,
hierarchy striving because there are 

677
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:46,510
very few positions in any given 
dominance hierarchy that are at the talk

678
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:47,883
and so in some ways the competition is 
zero sum and it's every person against 

679
00:47:52,151 --> 00:47:55,000
every other person,
but well that's happening.

680
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:57,790
You have to keep the dominance hierarchy
itself in place,

681
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,833
right?
Because there's no sense in destroying 

682
00:47:59,831 --> 00:48:00,664
the structure that you're trying to 
climb and so fried points of considered 

683
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,320
constantly that this is a very,
very difficult process of integration.

684
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,693
He also points out that in some sense,
the way that people solve that problem 

685
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:16,420
is not by integrating.
What they do instead is rip press.

686
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:20,260
Now repression has two elements.
One might be,

687
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:23,860
and this is maybe more what's dealt with
by cognitive behavioral psychologist,

688
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,930
one form of repression is you just don't
develop the capacity.

689
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:30,723
So let's say
if you're a sophisticated child and 

690
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:35,764
you're a fairly aggressive child,
then what you learned to do is to 

691
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:43,630
integrate your aggression into the games
that you play with other people.

692
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:47,260
So maybe you turned into a very 
competitive and skilled child,

693
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,800
and that doesn't mean precisely that 
you've inhibited your aggression.

694
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,023
It means that you've developed it into 
an unbelievably sophisticated set of 

695
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,714
skills so that you can manifest it 
within the games that people play 

696
00:48:59,140 --> 00:48:59,973
without blowing the games apart.
So you can be a competitive and skilled 

697
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:04,480
player,
basketball player,

698
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:05,314
for example,
which can be extremely aggressive or a 

699
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:07,264
hockey player or something like that.
But everyone still wants to play with 

700
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,880
you.
So that means that the,

701
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,153
that the,
there's been no repression of the 

702
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:15,724
aggression drive or limited,
it's just being integrated into all the 

703
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,430
things that it could conceivably 
informed.

704
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,860
The alternative to that would be,
well,

705
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:24,694
let's say your parents said you're never
to be angry with anyone under any 

706
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,800
circumstances whatsoever because good 
people never get nap.

707
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,080
Now lots of people believe that,
um,

708
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,980
identifying the aggression with evil 
certainly,

709
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:42,850
or at least with the kinds of actions 
that only people they despise engaging,

710
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,983
which generally means that their 
capacity for aggression is still there 

711
00:49:46,871 --> 00:49:49,270
in a very nascent and underdeveloped 
form,

712
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,313
but that they have absolutely no skills 
whatsoever that would be useful for 

713
00:49:54,071 --> 00:49:55,600
integrating it into their lives.

714
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,463
So for example,
one manifestation of the integration of 

715
00:50:00,521 --> 00:50:01,354
aggression is,
let's say that you're negotiating for a 

716
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:05,164
jaw.
It's an aggressive negotiation because 

717
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:14,130
they want you cheat and you don't want 
to be taken chiefly.

718
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,490
So if you're good at
drawing on your aggressive ability,

719
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:24,040
the first thing that you figure out is,
well,

720
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:28,070
how is it that I can say no in this 
negotiation and meaning,

721
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,220
which is an aggressive act.
If you want something from me and I just

722
00:50:31,221 --> 00:50:32,054
say no,
then at minimum I'm putting up a wall 

723
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:36,134
that you don't get to cross.
And if you're negotiating with someone 

724
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:40,304
and you can't do that,
you lose and then people walk all over 

725
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:45,074
you.
And then what's going to happen to your 

726
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:48,710
aggression is it's going to manifest 
itself in resentment,

727
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:49,990
which is,
you know,

728
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,780
a very,
um,

729
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,210
unproductive form of aggression.
And then according to Freud,

730
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,560
I think this is a very accurate 
observation.

731
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,723
That resentment is going to drive 
leakages of aggressive behavior 

732
00:51:01,611 --> 00:51:04,880
everywhere.
So you'll come home from the negotiation

733
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:07,250
where you didn't get the salary that you
deserve,

734
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,093
that you know,
your husband or your wife will say some 

735
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:15,330
little niggling thing that's under most 
circumstances wouldn't bother anyone.

736
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:17,360
And poof,
there'll be a big fight,

737
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,370
which is not very helpful and maybe you 
don't even know why it happens.

738
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,690
And that would be part of being 
unconsciously motivated.

739
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,610
And this sort of thing happens all the 
time.

740
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,623
It seems to especially happen with 
things like aggression because if you 

741
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:34,730
get picked on,
you know,

742
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:38,720
repeatedly during the day,
each time that happens,

743
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,873
the mechanisms will say they're the 
defensive aggressive aggression 

744
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,640
mechanisms that reside in the 
hypothalamus.

745
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,833
They're sort of noting that you're 
taking dominance hierarchy blows and 

746
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,174
being pushed down that structure where 
it's unsafe cause you don't want to be 

747
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:59,840
at the bottom of the dominance hierarchy
and then that system is,

748
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,273
has a proclivity more and more to grab 
your behavior and your perception and 

749
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:06,404
react as it should because you don't 
want to be pushed down the dominance 

750
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:08,780
hierarchy.

751
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:09,613
And then if it's,
if enough darts have been thrown at you 

752
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:13,604
for that a pay,
then someone will push you over 

753
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,150
threshold and Poof,
all hell break loose,

754
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:17,984
but it's very unsophisticated his 
behavior and it's likely to work at 

755
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:26,570
cross purposes to the end.
That could be achieved if those impulses

756
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:28,970
were properly integrated into the 
personality.

757
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,210
So from the [inaudible] perspective,
the answer would never be shy.

758
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,480
Don't be aggressive part of it because 
you don't have that choice.

759
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:38,690
The answer would be if you're going to 
be aggressive,

760
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,550
which you need to be,
because that protects you,

761
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:41,563
then be sophisticated about it and don't
pretend that it isn't there and people 

762
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:47,780
do that all the time.
That's part of repression.

763
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,153
Part of what Freud described as 
repression can ease Maura simply be 

764
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,140
conceptualized just as self deception.
You tell yourself,

765
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,033
well,
I'm not that sort of person and the 

766
00:52:59,901 --> 00:53:02,090
truth of the matter is,
Oh yes you are,

767
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,043
and then there's a deeper truth 
underneath that which is not only are 

768
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:06,794
you but you should be,
and that applies on the dimension of 

769
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,370
aggression and on the dimension of 
sexuality.

770
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,860
Because another thing that you might 
think about is,

771
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,550
well,
how many marriages break down because of

772
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:20,384
infidelity?
And then the answer to that is a 

773
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:28,901
substantial proportion often because of 
marriage cannot tolerate even one act of

774
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:31,830
infidelity mean if it's hidden,
that's one thing.

775
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:32,664
Maybe the marriage could still survive 
even though you know it's on very 

776
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,653
unstable ground at that point.
But if the act of infidelity is exposed 

777
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:41,903
or admitted to,
then the contractual relationship at 

778
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,254
that point becomes radically unclear.
It's very difficult to maintain a 

779
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,900
marriage relationship after that.
Well,

780
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:53,100
you might ask yourself,
well,

781
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:57,900
how is it that you start such a thing 
from happening and a psychoanalytic act,

782
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,540
a psychoanalytic answer would be,
well,

783
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:03,630
don't try to be too good in your 
marriage.

784
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,290
And what,
what the Friday's would mean by that is,

785
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,333
well,
you don't want to be the sort of 1950s 

786
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:15,620
couple
each of whom sleeps in a different bed.

787
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,233
Because even though that might
fulfill some restricted notions of 

788
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:27,420
propriety and purity,
the probable probability that it will

789
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,003
satiate the more instinctive sexual 
desires that necessarily manifest 

790
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:36,344
themselves and more importantly,
that also make up part of what makes 

791
00:54:39,561 --> 00:54:43,370
life Dionysian and rich instead of just 
rational adult.

792
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,413
Those things have to be integrated 
inside the marriage and that means that 

793
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,033
it's difficult.
I think this is often a difficult thing 

794
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,370
for men to do because,
and maybe this is less true than it was,

795
00:54:55,371 --> 00:54:56,330
but I doubt it

796
00:54:58,770 --> 00:54:59,603
does a difference between the category 
wife and the category mistress and the 

797
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:05,430
wife's category is sort of the pure 
category.

798
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,030
Maybe that's like mother or maybe it's 
like sister or maybe it's like,

799
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,190
eh.
And then there's the mistress category,

800
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:12,024
which is more like stripper or a 
prostitute or or temptress or something 

801
00:55:16,081 --> 00:55:17,880
like that.
And well,

802
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,990
if each category is completely separate 
from the other,

803
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,780
then if you were in the merit married 
category,

804
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,410
the mistress category is going to start 
looking pretty attractive.

805
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,660
And so the trick is to get those things 
integrated,

806
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:31,643
but that also means that the man and the
relationship has to foster the 

807
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:38,910
development of the mistress and his wife
and often his moral propriety.

808
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:39,744
We'll stop that from happening or maybe 
his jealousy because one of the things 

809
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,250
that you see happening,
for example,

810
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:45,093
in in marriages,
if the wife starts to make yourself and 

811
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,324
this,
this can also be reversed if the wife 

812
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:51,900
starts to make herself look more 
attractive,

813
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,040
perhaps to get in better physical shape,
to dress better,

814
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,203
to look more attractive and public to 
the degree that the husband is insecure 

815
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,243
and feeling inferior,
he'll interfere with that because he's 

816
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:05,940
afraid of,
she gets more attractive.

817
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,150
Then she'll attract someone who will 
take her away from him.

818
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,043
So he'll do everything he can to 
unconsciously ensure the cheese is 

819
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,550
oppressed and Downey as she can possibly
be so that at least she doesn't run away

820
00:56:17,551 --> 00:56:18,384
from him screaming.
And that's a standard for the 

821
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:22,863
unentangled weapon.
Something that's very characteristic of 

822
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:25,924
many close relationships.
You see the same things often say 

823
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:33,541
between parents and children where the 
mother or the father are afraid that the

824
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:38,960
child will surpass them in some way or 
leave them and that's the Friday and eat

825
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:39,794
apples situation.
If either parent is afraid that the 

826
00:56:41,771 --> 00:56:44,770
child will leave,
then the parents will do everything they

827
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:45,604
can to undermine every movement 
whatsoever towards the child's 

828
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:53,611
independence and keep them infantiles 
and the infant title highs child becomes

829
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,624
dependent but unbelievably resentful as 
they should because the parent is doing 

830
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:00,574
everything they can unconsciously to 
ensure that the best part of the child 

831
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,080
is never allowed to develop.

832
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,690
And that's an unbelievably common 
occurrence.

833
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:08,943
Freud believed that was characteristic 
of most families and that was partly 

834
00:57:11,651 --> 00:57:12,484
because of the long developmental period
that children need in order to become 

835
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,530
independent,
but more complexity.

836
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:25,590
It was because the dynamics between the 
father and the mother may be impaired in

837
00:57:26,441 --> 00:57:31,300
one fashion or another sexually or from 
a perspective of communication or in any

838
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:33,670
of the ways that people can be 
mismatched.

839
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,780
And maybe as well the couple's isolated,
somewhat friendless.

840
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,793
And so there are many things that I need
to be accruing to themselves in order 

841
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:45,460
for the mice to be full and they're not 
getting them.

842
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,353
And so then they turned to their 
children for more attention than they 

843
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:50,350
should,
for example.

844
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:53,680
And encourage their children to pay more
attention to them then they should.

845
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:59,010
And then from the Freudian perspective,
what happens is that the whole,

846
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:01,203
I'm conscious dynamic and fantasy 
structure of the household becomes 

847
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:10,950
extremely pathologized so that the,
so that what people are acting out so to

848
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:18,390
speak is this weird intermingling of 
mother,

849
00:58:18,391 --> 00:58:21,150
father,
child and lover,

850
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:24,840
where none of the roles aren't clearly 
and were,

851
00:58:24,841 --> 00:58:27,120
none of the roles are clearly 
distinguished from one another.

852
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,770
It's a mess,

853
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,003
you know?
And that's a situation that's very much 

854
00:58:35,271 --> 00:58:36,104
facilitated by deceit on the part of the
parents because maybe the husband asks 

855
00:58:41,361 --> 00:58:42,530
the wife,
well,

856
00:58:42,531 --> 00:58:44,540
are you happy deer?
And she says,

857
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:46,460
oh,
of course everything's always going well

858
00:58:46,461 --> 00:58:49,800
in our house.
What she means is I'd like to take out a

859
00:58:49,801 --> 00:58:52,400
knife and stab you 50 cartons of laundry
and sleep,

860
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,760
but she doesn't regard that as 
inappropriate verbal statement.

861
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:59,540
Even though it might be something that 
she's fantasizing about deeply,

862
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,090
you know,
for for hours a day,

863
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,640
but there's no way that's going to come 
to light.

864
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:05,474
You know,
you,

865
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,313
you can see these sorts of things 
happening if you pay attention to your 

866
00:59:09,051 --> 00:59:09,884
fantasy life from a Freudian perspective
because you'll see if you could catch 

867
00:59:13,041 --> 00:59:13,874
flashes of fantasy,
especially when you're frustrated or 

868
00:59:16,191 --> 00:59:18,890
disappointed or annoyed or something 
hasn't gone your way,

869
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,010
you'll have little stories branch in 
your mind.

870
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:24,690
And those are these underlying it like 
this,

871
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:28,010
since systems that are trying to inform 
your behavior,

872
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:28,844
but they're kind of one sided and single
minded and fantasies that they pop up 

873
00:59:33,141 --> 00:59:37,520
can be pathologically aggressive or say 
pathologically sexual,

874
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:38,354
but they're,
they're attempting to make a case for a 

875
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:45,020
motive being that needs to be integrated
into your personality.

876
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,190
Now the other thing that Freud's noted 
was saying,

877
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:53,150
the less sexual you are as an integrated
personality,

878
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,360
the more sexuality will manifest itself,
has pathologized in your fantasy.

879
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,253
It's partly because in some sense it has
to scream very loudly to get your 

880
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:05,810
attention,
but it's also because

881
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,770
if you refuse to allow something that's 
alive,

882
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:15,970
healthy pal path of development,
it's not just going to go away.

883
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,920
If you put a potato in the cellar and 
you put shine very dim light on it,

884
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:21,754
all you get are these white spindly 
shoots that are hideous and and you 

885
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,540
know,
and the polling.

886
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:29,523
But the thing is trying to live and the 
same thing applies from the Freudian 

887
01:00:33,191 --> 01:00:37,210
perspective to the fundamental 
instinctual motivations that drive human

888
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:38,044
beings.
It's like they can be deeply 

889
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:44,530
pathologized to the degree that they're 
not allowed to be properly expressed.

890
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,220
And then you can get more and more 
dissociated from them so that it becomes

891
01:00:48,221 --> 01:00:53,221
an increasing war between family sees 
that are developing more and more to the

892
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:57,154
pathological side and the ego,
which is doing everything it can to 

893
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:04,300
increasingly defend itself from those 
realizations.

894
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,363
So

895
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,710
here's a cat,
a list.

896
01:01:22,711 --> 01:01:25,230
This is a good list.
This is a very good list to think about.

897
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,573
Here are some of the voluntary
actions that people undertake in order 

898
01:01:33,781 --> 01:01:34,614
to ensure that the unconscious,
both as a repository of instinctual 

899
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:45,120
motivation and as a repository of memory
becomes as pathological as possible.

900
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:49,080
And so one way of thinking about the 
froggy and unconscious,

901
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:52,200
apart from the the element,
which is the instinct part,

902
01:01:52,201 --> 01:01:54,190
this is more to do with the memory 
element is,

903
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,313
well,
when people engage in something that's 

904
01:01:57,391 --> 01:01:59,640
pathological,
are they conscious of it?

905
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:01,590
And the Floridians would say,
well,

906
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:02,424
generally not.
But that doesn't mean they weren't 

907
01:02:04,561 --> 01:02:09,270
conscious of it when they first did it.
It's like the decision,

908
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,750
it's like the decision to lie is 
conscious.

909
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,080
You may forget that you did it and only 
be

910
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:21,420
moving forward through the consequences 
of having engaged in it,

911
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,560
and the fact that you've made it 
habitual and that there are consequences

912
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:28,200
may be something you forget and that 
becomes unconscious.

913
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,140
But it doesn't mean you didn't know what
you were doing when you first did it.

914
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,453
And so here are some of the little nasty
tricks that people play on each other 

915
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:39,360
and on themselves in order to ensure 
that they don't accurately represent the

916
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:42,510
nature of their experience.
And you might ask yourself,

917
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:43,344
what is accurate representation mean?
Given that there's no way you can ever 

918
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:47,754
have a coherent and complete 
representation of anything that ever 

919
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:50,904
happens to you.
And so one rule of thumb for that is 

920
01:02:53,431 --> 01:02:54,264
that what you've accurately represented,
something that's happened to you that 

921
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:58,344
was negative in the past,
if you represented it such that you're 

922
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:02,184
not going to do it again in the future.
Because the purpose of memory in large 

923
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:05,994
part is to stop you from doing the same 
stupid things that you've already done 

924
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:12,240
again in the future.
It's not purely representational,

925
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:12,780
right?

926
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:16,860
It's adaptive.
And so if you're twisting and distorting

927
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:18,023
your memory so that they're more 
acceptable to you from a conceptual 

928
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:21,624
level,
but not developing in this direction 

929
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:26,440
that would allow you to become 
increasingly adaptive,

930
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,790
well then you're engaging,
you're likely engaging in one or more of

931
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,950
these processes,
repression,

932
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,473
well,
repression is that you just don't admit 

933
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,444
it.
I think mostly what happens when people 

934
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:40,680
repress is not so much that they 
actively repressed.

935
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,693
It's not exactly that.
They do something and they remember it 

936
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,143
and then they push it down.
It's that they do something and there 

937
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:48,834
are some consequences and the 
consequences are complex and maybe 

938
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:52,044
they're motivated and then they just 
don't think about it anymore because 

939
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,760
it's easy not to think about something.
You just don't think about it.

940
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,740
It's easy.
So in some sense,

941
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,350
although this isn't a precisely Friday 
an idea,

942
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,680
the default position is repression,
you know,

943
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:08,514
because most of the things that you do 
are complex and they require 

944
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,570
articulation and an ordered to 
understand.

945
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,613
You can just avoid engaging in that and 
then the nasty little situation will 

946
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:18,683
remain sort of emotionally vaillant and 
attempting to pop up in your memory 

947
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:24,750
structure.
Those are the sorts of things that maybe

948
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,130
you remember that happened more than 18 
months ago that still cause an emotional

949
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:29,964
response when you bring them to mind.
That's a good clue that there's 

950
01:04:32,761 --> 01:04:35,490
something there that you have not 
articulated.

951
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,320
Sometimes it's because you don't want 
to,

952
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,300
and sometimes it's just because he 
can't,

953
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,230
you know,
you just,

954
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,930
you don't know how to make sense out of 
the occurrence.

955
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,970
You know,
maybe you were bullied law when you were

956
01:04:44,971 --> 01:04:47,070
13 it's still bothers you when you think
about it,

957
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:49,950
but you still haven't been able to 
figure out exactly why

958
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,920
denied.
Well,

959
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:53,754
that's just outright,
you know when you're dealing with a 

960
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:57,720
teenager and they're lying and you say,
are you lying?

961
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:58,650
And they say,
no.

962
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,950
Well that's the end of that reaction 
formation.

963
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,360
Oh,
that was a sneaky when.

964
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,480
So Freud would observe that,
for example,

965
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:07,314
in sibling relationships where you know,
one sibling is extremely irritated at 

966
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:11,814
the other,
but the way they cover that up to 

967
01:05:13,351 --> 01:05:16,920
themselves and other people is by 
overdoing it in the other direction.

968
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,483
So no,
maybe a husband is having some serious 

969
01:05:22,271 --> 01:05:23,104
second thoughts about his wife and what 
he does in order to stay unconscious of 

970
01:05:26,891 --> 01:05:27,724
that particular
bit of reality is act with excessive 

971
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,484
care towards or whenever they go out.
Cause there's always a false and it's 

972
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:36,790
about that.
I mean,

973
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,580
if your antenna are up at all,
that sort of thing,

974
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:40,503
actually
maybe it's worse for me because I've 

975
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,820
seen this so often,
I'm sensitive to it,

976
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:46,551
that sort of thing.
Read,

977
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,250
it turns my stomach,
you know,

978
01:05:48,251 --> 01:05:52,450
when you see this is saccharin falseness
with which people treat each other,

979
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:53,920
you know,
there's something gone,

980
01:05:53,921 --> 01:05:54,754
awful brewing right underneath the 
surface and neither of them will admit 

981
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:57,691
to it,
you know,

982
01:05:57,691 --> 01:05:59,800
a good fistfight would do them a lot of 
good,

983
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:00,843
but instead they'll just karcher each 
other to death with politeness for two 

984
01:06:03,341 --> 01:06:04,270
or three decades.

985
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,660
So displacement,
Laurie talked about that.

986
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:09,130
Well,
my boss yells at me,

987
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,410
I yell at my husband,
my husband yells at the baby,

988
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,553
the baby bites the cat.
It's sort of movement of the problem 

989
01:06:15,281 --> 01:06:16,540
down the dominance,
hierarchy,

990
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:20,020
identification.
Um,

991
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:21,093
you're bullied in school and so you 
start bullying kids that are younger 

992
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,410
than you.
Rationalization.

993
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,610
Oh,
this is a good one.

994
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:29,770
If your intelligence,
so all those of you,

995
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:32,470
you're all pretty intelligent.
If you want to be neurotic,

996
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,590
the best thing to do would be to turn 
your intelligence to the,

997
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:36,993
to the function of rationalization so 
that when you do something that is 

998
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,240
clearly not in your best interest or 
anyone else's,

999
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,313
then you want to meditate on how to 
formulate a sequence of complex 

1000
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,504
explanations that make that pathological
behavior look positively altruistic and 

1001
01:06:54,341 --> 01:06:56,170
then stick to that.
You know,

1002
01:06:56,171 --> 01:06:57,004
as hard as you can in every argument 
that you ever have for the rest of your 

1003
01:06:59,411 --> 01:07:00,244
life.

1004
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:04,600
So that's a excellent use of 
intelligence,

1005
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:06,730
intellectual ization,
same sort of thing.

1006
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:09,880
That's usually when you dress up your 
neurosis with philosophy.

1007
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:10,923
And so you often see that in people who 
instead of addressing their own 

1008
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,570
personality,
pathologies,

1009
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,580
blame them on,
you know,

1010
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:22,930
the pathological cultural conditions and
try to foment revolutions of one type or

1011
01:07:22,931 --> 01:07:26,260
another because it's pretty clear that 
they don't have the problem.

1012
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,660
It's the whole society that has the 
problem.

1013
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,330
And if it would just reorganize itself 
around them,

1014
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,403
then everything would be fine.
And so a good example of this and the 

1015
01:07:35,321 --> 01:07:39,190
Atlantic monthly,
several months ago where a woman who had

1016
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:44,290
despite her best efforts,
in some sense not be married by the time

1017
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:48,130
she was in her forties blamed the 
structure.

1018
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:48,993
Yeah.
The entire structure of Western 

1019
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:53,440
civilization for the continued failure 
of her dating attempts.

1020
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,483
Which,
you know,

1021
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:55,803
that might be the case,
but I would say that before you jumped 

1022
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,910
to that conclusion,
you might give some consideration to the

1023
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:05,911
fact that perhaps your integrally 
involved in that failure sublimation.

1024
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,593
Oh yes.
Well Freud regarded this as a real 

1025
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:15,410
driving force in culture per se.
So the quote is,

1026
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:17,360
okay,
then I'll sculpt naked women.

1027
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,790
So Freud believed that

1028
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,420
instinctual motivations like sexuality 
that weren't finding their expression in

1029
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:32,421
the logical behavioral conclusion could 
be the energy could be channeled,

1030
01:08:32,581 --> 01:08:34,860
so to speak,
in other sorts of pursuits.

1031
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:35,970
And the sublimation,

1032
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:37,353
yes,

1033
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,213
explanation is really interesting.
One from an evolutionarily evolutionary 

1034
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,760
psychology perspective because you see 
these weird things happening not only in

1035
01:08:44,761 --> 01:08:47,910
human beings but also an animals.
There's this animal verb,

1036
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:49,110
colon,
bower bird.

1037
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:51,150
You could look them up.
Bauer is b.

1038
01:08:51,151 --> 01:08:52,020
O.
W.

1039
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:52,021
E.
R.

1040
01:08:52,021 --> 01:08:55,590
They're really cool burns.
And so the males make this,

1041
01:08:55,980 --> 01:08:59,190
they go on the ground and then they 
sweep the ground with their wigs.

1042
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,260
And then they built this really 
complicated,

1043
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:02,423
we've thing that's nest like,
and then they make little art pictures 

1044
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:07,284
in front of it.
So they take like red leaves and they 

1045
01:09:08,581 --> 01:09:09,414
put them all in a pile and then they go 
find some yellow leaves and they put 

1046
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:14,880
them in a pile and maybe a few rocks and
some seeds and some bottle caps.

1047
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,280
And they make this really beautiful 
display.

1048
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,500
And then you know,
there's a bunch of them in one area that

1049
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:20,334
do that.
And then the females come along and 

1050
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:22,234
they'd look at the artistic display and 
they look at the little bird and they 

1051
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,694
look at the artistic display and maybe 
they're happy and move in or maybe they 

1052
01:09:29,251 --> 01:09:32,130
hop off to find some other bower birds,
little artistic production.

1053
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,060
And the really nice,
like these are major league efforts,

1054
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:37,770
especially given that birds make them.

1055
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,380
If the bottom bird gets visited by three
or four females and uh,

1056
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:46,083
you know,
the whole artistic thing isn't going 

1057
01:09:47,551 --> 01:09:48,384
very well.
Let me erase the little thing they've 

1058
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:54,720
done with their,
with their wings and they tear apart the

1059
01:09:54,721 --> 01:09:55,554
little thing they've woven and then 
they're all depressed and then they 

1060
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,250
started again.
And so,

1061
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:00,293
and that's a good example of this 
complex idea called sublimation because 

1062
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:09,380
obviously the bird is utilizing its 
creative capacity to fill a sexual,

1063
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:10,613
to fulfill a sexual instinct.
Now Fried would say the sexual instinct 

1064
01:10:13,351 --> 01:10:16,410
is being channeled into the creative 
production.

1065
01:10:16,411 --> 01:10:19,590
And it's actually relatively hard to 
make a case against that.

1066
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:22,080
If you're a Darwinian.
And we know for example,

1067
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:22,914
that one of the things that makes human 
beings attractive to one another is 

1068
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:27,090
creativity.
You know,

1069
01:10:27,091 --> 01:10:29,490
manifested say dress and all sorts of 
other things.

1070
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,440
And so,
you know what the question is,

1071
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:35,730
is sexuality driving that at the 
individual level,

1072
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:36,564
which would be afraid and interpretation
or is it tangled up in an even more 

1073
01:10:39,571 --> 01:10:40,404
deeply at a biological level?
And then the whole reason that people 

1074
01:10:42,961 --> 01:10:46,410
are creative is so that we're attractive
to one another and so,

1075
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,590
and that drives the species and it dries
rep production.

1076
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:53,850
And so our creative endeavor is somehow 
tangled up deeply with our,

1077
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:59,360
with our reproductive desire.
And it's certainly not an unreasonable

1078
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,213
proposition projection.
So you're arguing with someone when you 

1079
01:11:06,461 --> 01:11:09,670
do think you guys do this all the time,
you're making me mad.

1080
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,820
It's like you think about that.
That's a really interesting statement.

1081
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,160
It's,
well,

1082
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,890
you know it's true in a way,
right?

1083
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:18,750
Cause now you're,
you're arguing with someone who's really

1084
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:21,150
annoying and clearly they're making you 
map.

1085
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:22,103
On the other hand,
the only reason they're making you mad 

1086
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:25,464
just because you're accepting that you 
know the structure within which the 

1087
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:29,184
argument is occurring and the fact that 
they were able to elicit that sort of 

1088
01:11:32,671 --> 01:11:33,504
response from you means that your 
interpretation of circumstance plays a 

1089
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:41,460
causal role.
So that's a complex form of projection.

1090
01:11:41,461 --> 01:11:43,440
A simpler form of projection is,
well,

1091
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:46,410
you just don't think about it at all.
It's like you're not touchy.

1092
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,244
The other person's annoying and a lot of
arguments are actually about settling 

1093
01:11:50,641 --> 01:11:53,070
that you're touching.
No,

1094
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,660
you're annoying.
No,

1095
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:55,590
you're touchy.
No,

1096
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:56,730
you're annoying.
It's like,

1097
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:58,610
how do you ever settle that?
Well,

1098
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:02,910
usually you start dishing out even 
larger in salt,

1099
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,090
you know,
not only are you annoying,

1100
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:08,500
but you annoy lots of other people,
not just me know.

1101
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,413
And that's,
it's a funny kind of projection because 

1102
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:14,843
I don't have to use,
we use it often isn't precisely clear 

1103
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:19,410
who started or who he is,
in fact at fault.

1104
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:20,423
Anyways,
that's not a comprehensive listing of 

1105
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:24,600
Freudian Defense mechanisms,
but it's not a bad one.

1106
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,490
Unconscious ideas are at the core of 
psychological conflicts.

1107
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,730
I can give you an example.
Let's do psychosomatic.

1108
01:12:46,731 --> 01:12:49,100
One sort of thing is extremely 
complicated.

1109
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:52,310
So I had a client once who,
she had a real fun time,

1110
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,780
I'll change the story a little bit.
Um,

1111
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,013
she was at a job that she had been 
training yet for a long period of time 

1112
01:13:00,471 --> 01:13:02,090
and she thought she was doing pretty 
well,

1113
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,133
but they fired her and then they packed 
her up and put her on her bicycle to go 

1114
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:07,634
home the same day.
And then on the way home she drove her 

1115
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:13,610
bicycle down a ravine and and you know,
crashed into a tree.

1116
01:13:13,910 --> 01:13:16,070
So that's real fun.
That's a one two punch.

1117
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:17,120
Right?
So first of all,

1118
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:21,200
your job disappears and then how's your 
just barely not recovering from that.

1119
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,150
Then Bang,
you get hurt.

1120
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:25,520
And she was quite hurt as a consequence 
of the accident.

1121
01:13:25,521 --> 01:13:29,240
So
she had come to see me for,

1122
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,430
was looked like post traumatic stress 
disorder.

1123
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:34,293
But there was a bit of a,
there was a bit of underlying thought 

1124
01:13:36,661 --> 01:13:38,610
disorder.
There was sort of associated with it.

1125
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:39,444
But to make a long story short,
one of the things that she did when she 

1126
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:44,310
came to see me when she was always like 
this,

1127
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,693
and um,
I found this very bothersome after a 

1128
01:13:48,561 --> 01:13:50,490
while because of mirror,
I think it was mirroring.

1129
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:53,250
So she'd come in here like this and that
would make me uncomfortable.

1130
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:57,750
And one day I had,
I had mentioned this to her and she said

1131
01:13:57,751 --> 01:13:58,584
she was,
she thought she had hurt her arm and 

1132
01:13:59,611 --> 01:14:03,030
maybe she had.
And so I started getting her to move her

1133
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:03,864
arm little bit.
So she moved with like this and then 

1134
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:08,700
she'd move it like this and then she'd 
move it like this and she was getting so

1135
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:09,870
she could move it pretty well.

1136
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,033
And then the next time she came in,
she was still like this and I got this 

1137
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:15,490
weird impulse and I said,
well,

1138
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,560
come over,
just stand.

1139
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,510
I've seen her for like years by this 
point and said,

1140
01:14:19,511 --> 01:14:22,480
just stand wide my desk.
And so she stood like this and I sort of

1141
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,840
pounded my fist down her spine and she 
cried for like 45 minutes.

1142
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:29,463
So that was pretty interesting.
I mean it was like light light and then 

1143
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,310
her shoulder was loose,
certain she could move her arm more.

1144
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:38,410
And so then I kind of investigated that 
and she said,

1145
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:41,200
well she was afraid to move her arm 
because she might damage it more.

1146
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,273
And so then I looked into that and then 
she told me a story about how one time 

1147
01:14:45,851 --> 01:14:46,684
when she was five years old,
she got accidentally into a wagon and 

1148
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:52,900
gone down a hill and,
and cracked up at the bottom.

1149
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:53,733
And then they put her in the hospital.
And then her parents weren't allowed to 

1150
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:58,660
see her for like a month and a half,
which is what hospitals used to do.

1151
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:03,430
Cause they were sadistic and stupid.
And I left her with a permanent distrust

1152
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:04,264
of institutions,
which was sort of associated with kind 

1153
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,520
of the paranoid edge of her post 
traumatic stress disorder,

1154
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:12,910
but also accounted for why she didn't 
want to move her arm because she thought

1155
01:15:12,911 --> 01:15:13,744
if she moved it then that might hurt her
more and then she'd end up in the 

1156
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:16,774
hospital.
And so that's a good example of how 

1157
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:20,593
unconscious memories and conflicts,
part of the big conflict there for her 

1158
01:15:25,061 --> 01:15:27,520
was she had a real problem with 
institutions,

1159
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:29,320
you know,
and a lot of that was politicized.

1160
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:31,270
There was something wrong with all 
institutions,

1161
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:33,970
which is true but irrelevant.
Most cases,

1162
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,313
you know,
because you still have to adapt to the 

1163
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:36,820
damn things.

1164
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,653
But it had really hurt her adaptation 
because she couldn't trust the 

1165
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:41,454
institutions.
And then if she ever got hurt 

1166
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:43,264
physically,
she couldn't move herself because she 

1167
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:45,844
was afraid she'd read damaged the body 
part and then she did end up in an 

1168
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:50,530
institution.
So that's a good example.

1169
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:55,240
Um,
incomprehensible distress.

1170
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,700
See if I can come up with a good example
of that.

1171
01:15:58,330 --> 01:15:59,920
Oh,
I can give you a hallucination one.

1172
01:15:59,921 --> 01:16:02,890
This is a good one.
So I had a client one time who,

1173
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,080
uh,
he was a schizophrenia.

1174
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:07,390
I met him then,
not behavioral outpatient,

1175
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:10,310
inpatient ward in Montreal.
And I,

1176
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,313
um,
I was doing an Iq test with him and he 

1177
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:15,700
wasn't concentrating at all.
And so I said,

1178
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,480
why are you concentrating?
And he was looking all distracted and he

1179
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:20,314
said,
because the war between the battle 

1180
01:16:22,031 --> 01:16:24,670
between good and evil and heaven is 
going on in my head,

1181
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,970
which I thought was the most interesting
reason for not concentrating.

1182
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:28,803
I had ever heard of.
I spent some time like getting to know 

1183
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:33,874
him,
walking around with him for some hours 

1184
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,830
on the ward.
And even though he was paranoid,

1185
01:16:38,831 --> 01:16:39,664
he opened up to me after a while and I 
asked him about how his illness had 

1186
01:16:43,571 --> 01:16:44,404
developed and he had been,
he was the third son of a first 

1187
01:16:48,041 --> 01:16:50,530
generation immigrant family.
And so,

1188
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:51,393
you know,
there was a lot of ambition and the 

1189
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:54,070
family and his oldest brother was a 
doctor.

1190
01:16:54,071 --> 01:16:57,010
And then the second oldest was a lawyer 
or maybe the other way around.

1191
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:02,280
And so he was taking a master's degree 
in some behavioral science at Miguel and

1192
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:06,820
he got behind.
And so he faked his research data and he

1193
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:09,010
wrote up his thesis,
many hands and at the end.

1194
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,123
And then that night he went home and 
went to sleep and he woke up in the 

1195
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:13,874
middle of the night and the devil was 
sitting on his bed at the end and that 

1196
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:19,430
was the beginning of his schizophrenia 
illness.

1197
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:24,530
And so that's the hallucination 
manifestation of,

1198
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:28,083
and I'm conscious moral conflict.
Well unconscious to some degree he knew 

1199
01:17:30,891 --> 01:17:31,724
that he had done wrong.
Why he wasn't conscious of was exactly 

1200
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:36,770
how much damage that was going to do to 
him.

1201
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,330
Now you know when you could say,
well,

1202
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:39,164
maybe he had a predisposition to 
psychosis before he faked his data and 

1203
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,970
that was interfering with his 
performance and that's why he got behind

1204
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:47,451
him.
You know,

1205
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:50,090
who knows?
These things are usually complex.

1206
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:53,630
Lee Closet looped.
But Tom,

1207
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,793
there was no doubting the phenomenology.
And when he said that he couldn't 

1208
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:02,120
concentrate on the Iq test because the 
battle between good and evil,

1209
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,010
it happened.
What's going on in his head?

1210
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:04,933
He mentioned whatever that means.
And when he told me that he woke up and 

1211
01:18:09,321 --> 01:18:11,300
saw the devil sitting at the foot of his
bed,

1212
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,820
like that was a hallucination.
Well,

1213
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:16,970
fair enough.
But that really doesn't explain it,

1214
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,833
which is white people in mental 
hospitals generally don't talk to 

1215
01:18:20,601 --> 01:18:23,770
schizophrenia because they'll tell you 
things that will curl your hair,

1216
01:18:23,771 --> 01:18:26,520
or he listened and they're very 
difficult to make sense of it.

1217
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:27,643
And that's partly why Freud noted at the
beginning of this lecture in the little 

1218
01:18:32,511 --> 01:18:33,344
recording that I played for you,
that his ideas were met with 

1219
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:36,403
incomprehension and hostility and 
continued to be met in that matter to 

1220
01:18:40,821 --> 01:18:43,610
this day.
See you soon.

1221
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:48,423
Okay.
