1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,703
Oh,
I was about 18 when I first came to 

2
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,360
London.
I was the first trip I took to Europe.

3
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:11,194
I saved up money for a whole year to 
travel through Europe for a few months 

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:16,120
with some friends of mine was the age of
London.

5
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:16,954
That really struck me because I'd come 
in from western Canada and hadn't 

6
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:21,970
traveled much at that point and of 
course western Canada.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,570
The town I grew up in was only 
established in the 19 thirties.

8
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:26,404
Really no one to walk into pubs that had
been around for five or 600 years was 

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,520
something unheard of in Canada.
The magnificence of the architecture and

10
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:34,354
the fact that things were built to last.
The parliament buildings are remarkable 

11
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:40,660
and the castles and the depth of history
and the stability of the country,

12
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:41,494
all of that and the freedom.
It's an amazing achievement as far as 

13
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:48,420
I'm concerned.
One of the things that we learned in the

14
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:49,254
west and one of the things that's part 
of the great English journalistic 

15
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,524
tradition is that journalists and 
predicted or have the freedom to say 

16
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,664
what they want and what they want and 
that keeps everyone including the 

17
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:02,220
journalists honest and on track,
and we sacrifice that,

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,503
especially at the feet of the idea that 
no one is to be oppressed by anything 

19
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:10,020
anyone else says.
We sacrifice that at our complete peril.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,500
It's the.
It's the cardinal,

21
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,020
right?
Because when people speak freely,

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,883
they're able to think and people orient 
themselves in the world by thinking and 

23
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,964
they re update the state by thinking and
they conquer unknown lands by thinking 

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,730
and if you put restrictions on their 
ability to speak freely,

25
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:30,564
then you put restrictions on their 
ability to think and all of those other 

26
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:36,120
processes grind to a halt and then 
everyone suffers for it.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,913
Interesting.

28
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,263
Well,
I started reading George Orwell when I 

29
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,064
was a kid about 13 or 14.
Then my read 1984 and animal farm of 

30
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,524
course,
because that's the books that everyone 

31
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,080
starts with,
and then later in my life,

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,263
no,
I became aware of how prescient George 

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,060
Orwell was with regards to the dangerous
of totalitarianism.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,913
He was one of the first intellectuals in
the west to sound the alarm about what 

35
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:02,220
was going on,
especially in the Soviet Union or wells.

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,050
Definitely one of my intellectual heroes
from the 20th century.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,273
He's been a hero of mine consistently.
Britain holds a special place in the 

38
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:13,750
hearts of Canadians and for good reason.
You know,

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,933
you guys got so many things right.
English common law tradition and the 

40
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,514
parliamentary tradition and no,
it's been a great gift to everywhere in 

41
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:23,380
the world as far as I'm concerned.
