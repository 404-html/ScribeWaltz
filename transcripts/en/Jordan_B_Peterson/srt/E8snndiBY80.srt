1
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:09,903
Really,

2
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,890
you should have read by now.
Well that little book that,

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,450
uh,
what's it called?

4
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,000
Thought emotion and memory should have 
read the three or so papers in here.

5
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:37,650
Maybe there's four of them.
Four and also the first,

6
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,080
well the chapters in this book up to the
end of the neuropsychology section,

7
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:48,030
which is basically to page 80.
So that's what we've covered today.

8
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,133
Yeah,
sure.

9
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,410
I showed you a simpler diagram of this 
sword last week and that's

10
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,283
okay.

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,300
The model of the known normal loud 
amputation.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,060
Let me show you a little cartoon here 
that I think is kind of funny.

13
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,573
All right.
So as far as I can tell that's a decent 

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,510
but simplistic model of what it is that 
you know,

15
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,740
when you say that,
you know,

16
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,574
something with regards to its 
implications for behavior or its 

17
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,080
meaning,
because remember,

18
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,914
that's what we're,
that's what we're trying to specify in 

19
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:36,871
this class,
right?

20
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:37,704
The initial introductory discussions 
hinged on the notion that when we map 

21
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,540
our environments as a consequence of 
active exploration,

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,620
we mapped them for two reasons.
We want to specify the sensory nature of

23
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:51,990
the things that we encounter.
And we also,

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,210
more importantly,
more fundamentally,

25
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:56,220
perhaps not more importantly,
but more fundamentally,

26
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:59,430
we really want to keep track of where 
the meanings reside.

27
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,260
Now this is coopera coded by something 
that we'll discuss to some degree today,

28
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:07,860
which is that things aren't simply given
in the environment.

29
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,400
I mean it's,
that's the case with sensory things even

30
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,050
although there's a lot of dispute about 
this.

31
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:15,790
I mean that was coons fundamental point 
as far as I can tell him.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
His book,
the sign,

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,143
the structure of scientific revolutions 
in that what constitutes the object of 

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,480
objects seems to shift as we shift our 
techniques of exploration,

35
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,920
which is why we have new scientific 
theories.

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,773
I mean,
theoretically there's something at the 

37
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,350
bottom of it all towards which were
towards,

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,180
which are ideas are approximating.
But anyways,

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
it's a difficult,
it's a difficult idea,

40
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,123
but it's much more clear in the case of 
our maps of meaning because how you 

41
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,170
approach something really does determine
in large part,

42
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,850
it's an effective significance,
right?

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,180
We can all,
you can all see this fire for animals is

44
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:59,440
dangerous,
pure and simple,

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,950
but fire for people is liberal,
has been liberating.

46
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,784
That's,
I mean that's the most sort of the most 

47
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,480
dramatic example I can think of,
right?

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,643
You switched the motivational category 
of the object by altering your approach 

49
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,230
to it.
It's dangerous if you let it burn you.

50
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,363
If you control it,
then it cooks your food and it heats 

51
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,950
your cae and et Cetera,
et Cetera,

52
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,740
and it's something I'll buy an 
alteration in your action.

53
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:23,230
You've completely transformed the nature
of the object,

54
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,183
at least with regards to its utility and
that's a big part of what we consider 

55
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,104
creativity.

56
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,943
Anyways.
One of the things I've been trying to 

57
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,444
figure out is what's this?
What is the structure of our knowledge 

58
00:03:36,601 --> 00:03:38,430
when we say that we know something and 
that's this,

59
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,264
the gnome and it's a bounded domain 
basically that's characterized by 

60
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,693
specification of the emotional 
significance of what's going on in the 

61
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,234
present,
at least as far as that's interpreted 

62
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,933
and specification of what we would like 
to happen in the future and then the 

63
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:57,300
construction of motor plans to turn one 
into the other.

64
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,060
Now I've appended or updated this 
diagram,

65
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:03,300
someone from its original simpler form 
to show that,

66
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,223
well,
you were attempting to transform this 

67
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,260
into this things that you don't expect 
might happen,

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,333
which is,
and that's pretty obvious if you think 

69
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:13,314
about it,
because fun expect that things didn't 

70
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:16,260
happen.
That would mean that you knew everything

71
00:04:16,261 --> 00:04:17,094
and you don't know everything.
So that means it unexpected things are 

72
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,034
always happening
if you're undertaking a behavior that's 

73
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:27,480
designed to meet a certain end and 
something unexpected happens.

74
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,930
Well,
hmm.

75
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,743
That activates a chain of phenomena
that I described later that we're going 

76
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,020
to discuss today as the orienting 
reflects.

77
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,854
But basically the bottom line is that 
anything unexpected is the UN in and of 

78
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:46,120
itself intrinsically meaningful.
That's really,

79
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,440
really important.

80
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,273
MMM.

81
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,613
We don't assign meaning to things so 
much as we do restrict the meaning that 

82
00:04:57,111 --> 00:05:00,290
they already offer us to it,
to a specified domain.

83
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,863
And,
uh,

84
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,310
if you think about that,
that kind of reverses has a,

85
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,144
as I've mentioned before,
that reverses many normal psychological 

86
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:15,530
presuppositions,
which is that we have to,

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,840
that things are neutral until we 
discover it useful to them.

88
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,283
Okay.

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,553
So I told you this story or you read the
story perhaps about the guy who's 

90
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,543
thinking about his performance.
At some meeting he's thinking about how 

91
00:05:32,931 --> 00:05:35,450
well he's going to do and how he's going
to dominate the meeting and so on.

92
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,830
He runs and he runs into a number of 
obstacles on his way to the meeting,

93
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:42,710
including an elevator that won't 
function and people who get in his way.

94
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:43,544
And the reason I told the story in the 
book is to just to show you how this 

95
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:48,740
sort of thing operates in day to day 
life.

96
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:49,574
It's a pretty boring story.
I mean nothing particularly exciting 

97
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,560
happens I suppose until the end.
Nothing exciting.

98
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:59,120
Happens means only unexpected things 
occur,

99
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,983
nothing exciting happens.
Meaning means no emotion is released in 

100
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,494
the course of the story until the end 
because all of the things that are 

101
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:06,464
unexpected are trivial,
unexpected things that all occur at the 

102
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,700
level of of minor lea plan.

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,700
So my guy is upset by the fact that the 
elevator doesn't come,

104
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:19,814
but that's not such a catastrophe 
because he can always take the stairs 

105
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,623
and if someone's
ahead of you on the sidewalk and you're 

106
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:29,330
in a hurry,
while you can always go around them.

107
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,373
These are pretty minor deviations and 
they're interesting and they do inspire 

108
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,914
a certain amount of emotion.
But all they mean is that you have to 

109
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:40,640
shift from one sub goal to another.
And then at the end of the story,

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,793
well,
events of a different magnitude to 

111
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:48,230
occur.
And the idea there is that,

112
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,563
well,
the protagonist of this story that's 

113
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,874
outlined in the book,
he's expecting a commendation for his 

114
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:01,370
performance in the recent meeting and 
instead he gets fired.

115
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,800
And in a sense you could say,
well,

116
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,634
all hell breaks loose as a consequence 
of that because that information which 

117
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,700
can be easily denied,
blows his whole world.

118
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,730
It isn't something as simple as an event
that interferes with a particular plan,

119
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:17,564
a sequence of behavior.
It's something that demonstrates 

120
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
incontrovertibly.
And this whole notion of the ideal 

121
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:27,470
future is impaired in some nontrivial 
manner.

122
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,483
And that his viewpoint of himself in 
relationship to the world is 

123
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:33,740
dramatically and drastically flawed.
Well,

124
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:34,574
the thing is,
you don't need to know a lot of the 

125
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:39,530
things that we've been talking about to 
start to make sense out of this thing.

126
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:40,364
You know,
that if you get fired from a job that's 

127
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,320
a catastrophe or something ochres to 
make you a really quick question,

128
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,660
your own abilities or,
or where you're going or,

129
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,763
or where you've come from,
that people find that very emotionally 

130
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:52,890
disruptive and well,
the,

131
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,380
the answer to,
well,

132
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,214
what does it mean by the fact that 
people find that emotionally disruptive 

133
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:58,874
is to say that well,
things that aren't predictable have 

134
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:06,491
their own effect of valence and you 
render things predictable using a Schema

135
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,994
of this sort.
And if something comes along to blow 

136
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,874
your Schema,
then all those things that you've 

137
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:13,064
rendered predictable with regards to 
your current patterns of behavior are 

138
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:18,140
all of a sudden unpredictable.
And if they're unpredictable,

139
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,020
most particularly,
they're frightening.

140
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,370
That's the first thing that comes up.

141
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,880
His reaction to the elevator and the 
traffic.

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,953
All right.
Absolutely.

143
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,830
The
distinction between,

144
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,210
uh,
uh,

145
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,060
losing,
uh,

146
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,173
not the scenario now working anymore,
like losing confidence in this scenario 

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,530
and losing confidence in himself as a 
scenario maker.

148
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,960
I mean there seems to be

149
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,501
very,
yeah,

150
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:49,281
the perfect,
perfect.

151
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,770
Yes.
That's perfectly reasonable be,

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,780
is that a useful way?
Because I was trying to go yes.

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
Rotated.
Just think it really different.

154
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:56,971
No,
no,

155
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,740
that's a,
that's a perfectly reasonable,

156
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,320
uh,
that's a perfectly reasonable comment.

157
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,850
Exactly.
The thing,

158
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,010
think about Tom Punishments.

159
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,110
You know,
we know that punishments produce pain,

160
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:09,580
for example,
they produce hurt.

161
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:10,990
That's a,
that's the effect of state,

162
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,600
I mean formal punishments and we'll 
define what they are later.

163
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,420
Um,
the thing about people though is that we

164
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,254
can generalize and,
and in animals you can punish out 

165
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:22,870
particular patterns of action and human 
beings.

166
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:23,704
You can punish out hierarchies of action
right down to the level of the action 

167
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,600
that generates action.
And that's basically what are the action

168
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:34,060
that generates patterns of action.
And that's what you're talking about.

169
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,440
See if you really punish someone,
then they lose faith in their ability to

170
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,181
adapt.
And well,

171
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:41,110
when that happens,
while you're depressed,

172
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,400
well,
you're not just depressed,

173
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,660
be depressed,
doesn't,

174
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,690
you're not just hurt.
Depressed doesn't just mean you're hurt.

175
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,020
Depressed means while you're in pain.
This is literal by the way,

176
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:50,621
it's,
it's not.

177
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:51,850
It's not metaphorical.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,740
About 70% of people who are chronically 
depressed have chronic pain syndrome,

179
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,660
low back pain,
migraine,

180
00:09:58,661 --> 00:09:59,494
et cetera.
The two things look very closely 

181
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:01,714
related.
Phenomenologically you also lose all 

182
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:06,250
hope,
but what does that mean when all,

183
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,630
we're going to talk about that a little 
later,

184
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,490
but these aren't metaphors.
Look,

185
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,270
whenever you put in this box is a 
consumer Tory reward.

186
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:17,170
It's a satisfaction by definition.
This is what I want to talk about this a

187
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,640
little bit more than the neuro psych 
section.

188
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,163
We know about satisfaction,
but there's four classes of 

189
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,164
motivationally relevant phenomena.
There's punishments and there's 

190
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:27,754
satisfaction.
Those are primary positive and negative 

191
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:34,030
reinforcers in somewhat archaic 
behavioral language,

192
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,780
punishments and satisfactions,
and then there's cues of punishments,

193
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,530
accused of satisfactions and cues of 
satisfaction give you hope,

194
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,020
but they're always conceived of in 
relationship to some goal.

195
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,730
You lose the goal.
Well,

196
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,080
you lose hope.
That's what,

197
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,000
that's exactly what happens literally.
So if your goal has come tumbling down,

198
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,983
and the thing is,
the other thing you have to realize is 

199
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:57,174
that your goal is always conceived of in
relationship to your conceptualization 

200
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:00,624
of yourself because you always view 
possibility in relationship to what you 

201
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,900
think you can accomplish.
So these two things can't.

202
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,850
That's why this is a system.
You know,

203
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,240
this cannot be conceived up except in 
relationship to this.

204
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,223
And vice versa.
You always construe where you're going 

205
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,243
with regards to your conceptualization 
of your current level of abilities and 

206
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,844
possibilities and so on.
And you evaluate the utility and 

207
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,684
desirability of what you have currently 
in relationship to the best that could 

208
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,570
possibly be.
So it's a system,

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,520
it's a system.
This is the known.

210
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,740
As long as you're operating in this 
territory,

211
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,100
you're aware exploration has already 
taken place fundamentally.

212
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,130
So you're protected by your culture.
That's one way of looking at it.

213
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,490
You're protected by your particular 
story anyways.

214
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,543
That's assuming nothing really 
dramatically unpredictable is going 

215
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:51,100
wrong.
So you referred to a scenario,

216
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:51,934
so it would be right.
Would it be right to say that whole 

217
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,970
thing is a scenario.
I mean that's a story is absolute.

218
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,550
That if that's something that that's a,
we have a representation of it,

219
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:03,490
then it's,
and that's abstract.

220
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,790
So in that sense we are a scenario 
makers we made.

221
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,983
Yes.
Right?

222
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,823
Yes.
And this is the thing that's 

223
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,054
interesting.
I think one of the things that's 

224
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,854
interesting about that is that the 
scenario from a mythological 

225
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,120
perspective,
that's the world.

226
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,703
That's how,
that's like myth from the mythological 

227
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,614
perspective,
which is concerned with meaning and not 

228
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,730
with sensory qualities.
The world is what you know,

229
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:25,564
what you don't know,
and the mediating process between the 

230
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,530
two and the mediating process,
by the way,

231
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,364
is what you were referring to because 
the mediating process is the thing that 

232
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:33,304
creates order out of chaos or upon 
occasion that turns chaos and door or 

233
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,220
order into chaos as well.

234
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,440
It's the transformative process.
Anyways.

235
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,170
If you lose faith in that transformative
process,

236
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,700
that's the end of you.
Fundamentally.

237
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:48,850
I mean life comes to a halt and that's 
why,

238
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,680
well as we'll find out many,
many,

239
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,514
many religious systems,
if not all religious systems attempt to 

240
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
catalyze identification with the 
transformative process as their aid to 

241
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,400
the good life.
Anyways.

242
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,410
Um,
okay,

243
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:04,450
so this is a story.
It's a story.

244
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,770
The story is,
well,

245
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:06,604
things aren't so good now,
but they're going to be much better in 

246
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,730
the future and this is how we're going 
to bring it about.

247
00:13:09,731 --> 00:13:10,564
That's just your straight linear story.
That's a scenario and you have your 

248
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:13,954
particular story and do you have your 
particular story to the degree that you 

249
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,214
share cultures,
there are some elements of your stories 

250
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:20,884
that are identical.
So I was thinking the mark this other 

251
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,291
day,
you know,

252
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,124
like if you read in the newspaper that 
Congress is going to cut off funding to 

253
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:32,530
a cognitive psychologists who specialize
in vision.

254
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,550
Then all of the cognitive psychologists 
who specialize in vision,

255
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,193
to the degree that they share that story
going to be threatened by that 

256
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,910
particular piece of news because it's 
interfering with their scenario.

257
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:43,923
They're are going to band together as a 
group and they're going to do whatever 

258
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:50,110
they can to to Perry the threat.
Now if you read that we'll all cognitive

259
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,690
psychologists funding is going to be 
cut,

260
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,703
then your reference group is all of a 
sudden expanded because you pulled in a 

261
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,843
larger number of people who share the 
presuppositions of your story and then 

262
00:14:00,671 --> 00:14:01,504
you could say,
well,

263
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,373
if it was all psychologists,
that would be a larger group and if it 

264
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:06,310
was all uh,
academics,

265
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,310
that would be a larger group and so on.
And you can see that as,

266
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,410
as the threats are more and more 
fundamental,

267
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:12,244
the groups that are effected get larger 
and larger and well anyways because 

268
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,360
you're including more and more people 
under the rubric of the same story.

269
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,300
If your country is under attack from 
foreign forces,

270
00:14:22,301 --> 00:14:27,130
then it's the constitution in a sense 
that's at risk and everything.

271
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,060
That's kind of the trunk of the 
presupposition tree so to speak.

272
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,740
And everyone's going to unite against 
that

273
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,670
threat or virtually everyone is going to
unite against it.

274
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,720
This is like a shared experience for 
normal adaptation,

275
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,333
snare and can help.
And thinking like people with anxiety 

276
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:50,270
disorders,
like the ideal future would be to get on

277
00:14:50,271 --> 00:14:51,104
the elevator and know and that it would 
come and it would go down and there 

278
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:55,940
would be no problem with that.
And that's the unpredictable,

279
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:56,774
that's the big problem.
Like so if the LDL number comes or they 

280
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:02,090
get stuck in the elevator or something,
that's chaos.

281
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,920
Like that's,
that's the end.

282
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,700
Predictable expense.
So I was just wondering on this chart,

283
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,610
like how would you map

284
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:09,790
oh well the,
okay.

285
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,450
The thing is is that any,

286
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,873
hmm.

287
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,800
Phenomena have ambivalent meanings.
And this is something that I referred to

288
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:18,090
in the chapter.
Neuropsychology,

289
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:22,380
is it an event that can be construed 
with a particular motivational relevance

290
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,214
from one frame of reference can be 
construed from a different frame of 

291
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,400
reference in,
in a completely different matters.

292
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:33,450
So let's say you're on your way to the 
meeting and you have an anxiety disorder

293
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:34,980
soul,
you're afraid of elevators.

294
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,083
Okay.
So the elevator doesn't come well with 

295
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:40,710
regards to the story that says,
I want to go to the meeting.

296
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,690
Then the fact that the elevator hasn't 
shown up,

297
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,630
it's very anxiety provoking.
And perhaps frustrating and punishing,

298
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,290
but from fruit with reference to the 
frame of reference that says,

299
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,363
well,
I'm the kind of person who can't 

300
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:51,714
tolerate taking elevators.
It's relief that not that the elevator 

301
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:58,800
not showing up brings about and then 
your neck motor output so to speak,

302
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:02,970
is a function of the competition between
between those two frames of reference.

303
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,550
I don't know exactly how that 
competition plays out,

304
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:06,384
but like virtually everything that you 
can possibly conceive of how has 

305
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,453
motivational significance is that vary 
with the frame of reference and you do 

306
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:15,594
this to yourself like you can look,
this is really not complicated enough 

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,833
unfortunately,
and I'll draw the map that we'll use 

308
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,580
later.
This is just the note.

309
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,090
Well anyways,

310
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,630
this is actually more like how this 
diagram should look.

311
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,510
You get the picture,
okay.

312
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,793
Now

313
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,910
these are more or less comprehensive 
stories and damage to the story can take

314
00:17:08,971 --> 00:17:09,804
place at any level of analysis.
The higher up on the or the the more 

315
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:16,680
inclusive the place at which the damage 
takes place.

316
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,723
The more behavioral adaptation is a 
rendered useless and the more phenomena 

317
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:25,860
are transformed.
Once again back into chaos from,

318
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,753
from from whence they came from the 
mythological perspective as you'll find 

319
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:30,744
out.
Cause the next thing you're going to do 

320
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,084
is read the Sumerian creation myth and I
tried to map it onto the kind of just 

321
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,180
descriptions that we'd been talking 
about,

322
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,373
the Sumerian creation.
I had a good dream about this last 

323
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,073
night.
I'll tell you about it can benefit the 

324
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,320
Sumerian creation myth is particularly 
relevant because,

325
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,790
well it's been said that history began 
in summer.

326
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,143
So in a sense it's the most ancient of 
creation stories that we have extent 

327
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:58,983
that it has been transmitted down into 
our culture along the line that our 

328
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:04,644
culture came from.
Basically I dreamed last night that I 

329
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,154
told this class,
although the class was like slightly 

330
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,990
different in my dream that we all have 
Sumerian skeletons.

331
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,500
Just in a weird way of looking at what 
their point is.

332
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:16,261
This,
you know,

333
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,094
it's only been,
it's only about 5,000 years that 

334
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,430
separate us from the Sumerians and you 
had to take who are,

335
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,390
you know,
that's a long time.

336
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,224
We have nothing in common with them.
But there's a bunch of ways to look at 

337
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:27,090
that.
Like that's only 60 80 year old men,

338
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,823
so we're not,
which if you think about that 80 years 

339
00:18:31,321 --> 00:18:32,880
old and then another 80 year old man and
so on,

340
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:36,860
that's only 60 entire,
moderately long lifespan.

341
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,950
This is nothing,
you know,

342
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,170
and it's nothing when the evolutionary 
perspective,

343
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:43,170
because we'd been around as well as a,
as a species.

344
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:47,790
Exactly like we are for 150,000 years 
and something similar to what we are for

345
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,390
at least 2 million,
so like 5,000 tears.

346
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,290
That's nothing.
That's yesterday.

347
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,273
We're still scenarios.
When you read that creation myth where 

348
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,920
you want to think about it with relate 
in relationship to the things we've been

349
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:00,630
talking about,
the Sumerian say,

350
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:03,870
well everything emerges from chaos.
Like what the hell does that mean?

351
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,883
Well it means
it means most basically that everything 

352
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:13,140
that you understand comes from the 
domain that has not yet been explored.

353
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,860
That's a chaotic domain cause he can't 
say anything about it.

354
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,843
There's no distinctions drawn.
Plus it has infinite motivational 

355
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:21,900
relevance.
You can specify it.

356
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,970
That's very chaotic.
Ken.

357
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,200
Those things that you haven't yet 
explored are simultaneously punishing,

358
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:29,034
satisfying,
and threatening and promising all at 

359
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,850
once and none of those as well.
Anyways.

360
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,130
So anyways,
when,

361
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,560
when I say things like,
well,

362
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,773
um,
interference with a structure of this 

363
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:44,094
sort of reduces everything to chaos and 
that chaos is in some sense equivalent 

364
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:51,240
to the chaos that existed before the 
creation of things.

365
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,070
That's what all that means is kind of 
the,

366
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,023
you know,
you just think about it as a 

367
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,120
metaphorical language,
I guess.

368
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,790
Anyways,
this is a better model.

369
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,703
So,
uh,

370
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,930
you know,
to use the university example,

371
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,190
all cognitive scientist specializing 
envision would be here and all cognitive

372
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:15,010
psychologists would be here and that all
psychologists would be here.

373
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,140
That's one way of looking at it anyways.
Okay,

374
00:20:20,141 --> 00:20:20,974
so

375
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,020
recipe,
yes.

376
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,333
When you're talking to,
you were talking about how much anxiety 

377
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:35,290
is caused by the absence of the 
elevator.

378
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,423
Yeah.
You're referring to it as a function of 

379
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,710
what your interpretive scheme is,
but also how much of it has to do with a

380
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:49,720
sort of more basic biological function 
of how much tolerance,

381
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,990
I mean,
given individual has or unknown.

382
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,853
I mean that's a tough question.
I mean it looks like there are all 

383
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:00,370
these,
these four systems so to speak.

384
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,740
Well that's the satisfaction,
punishment,

385
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,960
promise and hope systems.
From the subjective perspective,

386
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,730
they all seem to have thresholds for 
activation.

387
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,510
So if your threshold for activation of 
your incentive reward system is low,

388
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,180
it looks like you're likely to be 
extroverted.

389
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:24,730
You're very happy and social situations,
you smile easily,

390
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:25,840
you talked a lot,
et cetera.

391
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,350
And that's something that's biologically
determined.

392
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,810
And the same with regards to your 
response to threat.

393
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,643
You could have a high level,
a high threshold or low threshold and 

394
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:35,464
you make dilla well,
but then it really gets complicated 

395
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:38,674
because the problem is is that what you 
construe as threatening or promising 

396
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,070
depends on your framework of 
interpretation.

397
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,650
Nobody knows how that plays into the 
biology.

398
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,763
So
whether those two things can be 

399
00:21:51,221 --> 00:21:54,730
separated because well I think in 
principle they can be,

400
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,730
because I think it would be possible.
Say if I,

401
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:01,420
if you and I both went into the lab,
a lab,

402
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,381
you could say,
well,

403
00:22:02,381 --> 00:22:05,020
we're under the same,
more or less the same set of precepts.

404
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,913
We're governed by the same set of 
presuppositions in that laboratory 

405
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:10,840
circumstance.
So say they give us both a goal directed

406
00:22:10,841 --> 00:22:15,841
task that's very bounded and uh,
a set of phenomenal occurs and,

407
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,130
and I get more,
more anxious by physiological measures,

408
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:21,964
then you do well,
assuming that we've held the framework 

409
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:25,024
of reference constant,
we might be able to say something about 

410
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,500
the intrinsic biological differences,
but it's very,

411
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:34,180
it strikes me as very difficult,
isn't the interpretation.

412
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,120
We have pastors that are going to be 
dependent on what we imagined,

413
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,360
how we naturally react anyway.
I would suspect so.

414
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:41,194
Yeah.
So I,

415
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,093
I don't know,
like I really don't know the answer to 

416
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,650
your question.
Um,

417
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,103
I mean it's obviously the case that you 
can modulate the motivational 

418
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:53,590
significance of phenomena merely by 
shifting frameworks of reference.

419
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,210
I think you can say,
well,

420
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,100
if you're very upset,
save just a relationship you had is just

421
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,140
broken up and you think,
you know,

422
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:02,974
while this is finally going to kill me.
And so you have very temp temporally 

423
00:23:06,161 --> 00:23:10,000
bounded interpretation of this,
this is absolutely catastrophic and what

424
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,650
am I going to do tomorrow?
And then you think,

425
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,890
well
is this really going to mean anything in

426
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:15,724
five years?
And you know from that perspective like 

427
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:22,090
how relevant is this phenomena with 
regards to my five year plan,

428
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:22,924
for example,
it's relevance is going to shrink 

429
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,204
dramatically.

430
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,133
And you might say,
well how much is it gonna mean to me in 

431
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,340
40 years?
And you think,

432
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:33,460
well under those circumstances it 
dwindles to absolute triviality.

433
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:35,920
And you can say,
well what does any of this going to mean

434
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,680
in a thousand years?
And then you have an existential crisis.

435
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,050
But the thing is,
because you can,

436
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,943
that's an,
it's very interesting because you can 

437
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:43,834
modulate the motivational relevance of 
phenomena by shifting your framework of 

438
00:23:46,671 --> 00:23:47,504
reference.
It looks to me that paper by John 

439
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:50,850
Duncan,
the first paper in here,

440
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,530
me in a sense that's sweet.
But he says the frontal cortex does,

441
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:56,840
at least in part,
is that I think,

442
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:58,430
well,
going back to the neuro psych,

443
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,553
I think the near the frontal cortex says
hijack the more motivational systems to 

444
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,860
give us increased adaptive flexibility 
like animals.

445
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,920
Oh,
this gets us into a big argument,

446
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:13,250
a big disagreement about what 
constitutes an unconditioned stimulus.

447
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,083
You know,
lots of behaviors think there are such 

448
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:16,574
things as unconditioned stimulus,
which are just those things that you 

449
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:22,040
will respond to automatically.
Like electric shock,

450
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,960
you know,
that's bad.

451
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,973
It's anxiety provoking.
While more particularly it's punishing 

452
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,530
if it's of sufficient intensity,
it hurts.

453
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,960
But the problem with that is is that you
know,

454
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,540
you can take a dog.
Yeah.

455
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,620
And if you give it food just after your 
shock,

456
00:24:36,621 --> 00:24:37,820
it soon,
when you shock it,

457
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:38,654
it wags its tail.
Well that means that the effect of 

458
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:45,650
relevance of the unconditioned stimulus 
is at least modifiable by learning.

459
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,550
And almost all I'm conditioned so called
unconditioned stimuli,

460
00:24:49,551 --> 00:24:52,340
have that property.
So,

461
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
and we know that,
you know,

462
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:54,554
people,
people have an immense amount of 

463
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,910
disagreement about what constitutes good
goods.

464
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,670
For example,
like anorexics don't like food.

465
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,100
And they starve to death.
So it's a bad decision.

466
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,490
But the point is is that even something 
as fundamental as food,

467
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,593
the motivational relevance of that can 
be shifted by shift in the framework of 

468
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:12,200
reference.

469
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,033
So you can say,
well the anorexic is caught in a 

470
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,940
situation where her unvariable present 
his,

471
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,890
you know,
my terribly fat body,

472
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,900
although no one else might construe it 
in,

473
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,210
in that,
in that manner that's hers and her ideal

474
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,044
future is I'm thin,
thinner than anyone else and that 

475
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,870
there's an associate of network around 
fin so to speak,

476
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,760
that includes beautiful,
well liked,

477
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:32,930
admired rich,
you know,

478
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,460
whatever the hell you want to throw in 
there.

479
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,623
And in relation that makes food in 
relationship to the movement from here 

480
00:25:39,231 --> 00:25:40,064
to here,
something punishing and threatening 

481
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:41,714
because it interferes with it.
So then it takes on the motivational 

482
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:46,670
significance of a threat or a 
punishment.

483
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,070
And of course,
well she still gets hungry.

484
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,200
Okay,
so there's going to be a heavy,

485
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,470
heavy dose of internal conflict.
That's an internal conflict.

486
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,070
Means in part is you're internally 
conflicted about a stimulus.

487
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,820
If it has one significance for one of 
your plans.

488
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:02,654
And an alternate significance for 
another plan and you have an integrated 

489
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,504
the two plans into something that's
into a higher order construction where 

490
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:13,430
there's no conflict.
So that that's a problem.

491
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,120
You're saying how if you're too rude by 
your ideal future,

492
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,890
crazy anxiety
or if you're an,

493
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,880
you don't have cause you sense of how 
the teacher and if you don't move.

494
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,540
All right,
is there some kind,

495
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,880
and then even talking about about 
relativity perspective a year,

496
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,714
four years,
four years and is there such a thing as 

497
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,210
a balance because there's what four 
universally,

498
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,630
what is enough of just sort of move you 
on?

499
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,020
Yeah.
Well you know this is,

500
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,830
this is one of the things we're going to
hope cancer over the course of the whole

501
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:48,150
course.
I mean I said,

502
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:48,984
well in a sense I said everything is 
relative because you can shift the 

503
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,630
motivational significance of phenomena 
by shifting your frame of reference.

504
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:56,640
But also said that if you think food is 
evil,

505
00:26:56,641 --> 00:27:01,641
you'll start.
So obviously there's those two arguments

506
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:05,160
in a sense or in conflict.
I mean it is possible for you to believe

507
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:08,400
that food is a punishing item.
But if you do believe that there will be

508
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:09,234
certain consequences,
like you won't be able to pursue any 

509
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:14,400
other plans because you'll be dead.
So

510
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,763
I'm interested in trying to resolve the 
argument that those two arguments are 

511
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,950
resolved.
The problem that those two arguments set

512
00:27:22,951 --> 00:27:23,784
up on the one hand while we need to eat,
although people can regard food as a 

513
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:28,020
punishment,
on the other hand,

514
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,280
you can switch the motivational valence 
of things by an with an act of will,

515
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,114
so to speak.

516
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,073
So it strikes me that there's a high 
probability that certain phenomena will 

517
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:40,764
be regarded as satisfactions and we'll 
take on the aspects of consumer Tory 

518
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:46,710
rewards.
One of those high probability items,

519
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:47,940
for example,
is food.

520
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,430
You know,
that's why I have a quote here.

521
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,970
We'll show you this quote
from Nietzsche.

522
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,570
Nietzsche said,
anyone who considers the basic drives of

523
00:27:57,571 --> 00:28:00,640
man,
it's a very sophisticated idea.

524
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,483
It's a 100 years old.
We'll find that all of them have done 

525
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,274
philosophy at some time and that every 
single one of them would like only too 

526
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:14,430
well to represent just itself as the 
ultimate purpose of existence and as the

527
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:18,900
legitimate master of all the other drugs
for every drive one is to be master kind

528
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,030
of attempts to philosophize in that 
spirit.

529
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,493
So I've been trying to resolve this,
all these dilemmas that are posing the 

530
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:27,930
dilemma,
for example,

531
00:28:27,931 --> 00:28:30,630
that shock has this significance of an 
unconditioned stimulus,

532
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:31,530
but it can be shifted.

533
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,180
It looks to me that what happens is that
these underlying biological systems like

534
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:40,620
the one that governs hunger,
has the capacity to grip,

535
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,900
to gain access to the representational 
system that constructs these futures.

536
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,950
So for example,
you say,

537
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:50,370
well,
you're basically doing your homework and

538
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,653
you haven't eaten for a long time.
So now your warp rating within a 

539
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,890
particular frame of reference.
So you're,

540
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,993
the action of doing your homework is a,
it's a motor program that's part of a 

541
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:05,490
larger series of goals and sub goals,
right?

542
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:06,990
Graduation,
career and all that.

543
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,960
That's what you're busily pursuing,
but you haven't eaten well.

544
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,110
So what happens is that your attention 
starts to get diverted,

545
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,100
which basically means that the system 
that's responsible for ensuring that you

546
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:17,934
get enough calories has started to,
has started to take control of the 

547
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:24,660
representational system and the 
constructs your ideal futures.

548
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,020
So you start thinking about food.
It's like that's another,

549
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,240
a fantasy that's making itself known in 
the theater of your imagination.

550
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,570
And if you keep doing your homework and 
don't eat long enough while you're going

551
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:39,404
to start feeling conflict because you're
switching between these two control 

552
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:46,330
systems basically,
and sooner or later in all likelihood,

553
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,063
the system that mediates food intake is 
going to get the upper hand and you'll 

554
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:50,740
say,
oh,

555
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,573
to hell with it because that's your 
interpretation from the perspective of 

556
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:58,240
finishing your homework and you'll go to
the fridge and get something to eat.

557
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,890
So when nature says,
all our drives a template,

558
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,740
philosophize basically,
see this is the way you fit.

559
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,653
The reason I'm trying to tell you this 
is because it gets away from the notion 

560
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:08,374
of stimulus response because it's not,
your hunger isn't driving you towards 

561
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,294
the fridge.
It's not like it's gripping your 

562
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,640
behavioral output.

563
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,250
What it's doing is positive,
a potential future towards which you can

564
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:24,190
plan and it has the capacity to grip 
that future.

565
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,330
That's Nietzsche's attempts of the 
drives to philosophize.

566
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,530
So you'd say,
well you think about this,

567
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:34,540
so we defined pathology in this way.
Often say,

568
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:37,390
well if you're,
if everything in your life boils down to

569
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,910
food,
that's your God.

570
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,683
Say That's your ideal futures,
you eating as much and as often as 

571
00:30:43,841 --> 00:30:44,674
possible.
Well then we would say somethings 

572
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,853
something is pathological about your 
scheme of representation or your 

573
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:52,864
behaviors.
Something's pathological about your 

574
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:54,784
personality.
While part of the reason we say that is 

575
00:30:55,871 --> 00:31:00,520
because food is a good sub goal,
it's necessary sub goal,

576
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,743
but it's a bad ultimate master.
While the question in part that we're 

577
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,730
going to try to address in this class 
is,

578
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,440
well given that food saying sex and 
water and heat and shelter and all these

579
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:16,441
other things are necessary sub goals,
what would constitute the ideal master?

580
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,750
Well,
you read this,

581
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,260
you want to read this Sumerian creation 
myth with this in mind.

582
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,110
So I say these are gone.
So that's one way of looking at it.

583
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,090
It's a little bit more complicated than 
that.

584
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,700
Um,
they,

585
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,500
well,
here's another quote.

586
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:33,880
This is quite funny.
I think too,

587
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,260
this is from Eliana with regards to 
Sumerian mythology.

588
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,363
It is true that man was created in order
to serve the gods who first of all 

589
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,510
needed to be fed and clothed,
not such a,

590
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,030
you know,
not such a foreign conception really.

591
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,223
Well,
the guards are construed as 

592
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:54,280
transpersonal processes that are eternal
fundamentally,

593
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,833
and a man mortal man is created in order
to ensure that their needs are 

594
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:02,410
fulfilled.
Anyways,

595
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,244
of course,
you're going to think at least some of 

596
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,350
you're gonna think that that's a bit of 
a leap.

597
00:32:05,351 --> 00:32:08,860
But
it's quite interesting to read the,

598
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:09,783
the Mesopotamian creation myth,
and part of what it entails is 

599
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,320
hierarchical competition between the 
gods and the eventual victory of one God

600
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,163
who's,
as part of the movement towards 

601
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:19,650
monotheism.

602
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,990
And Marduk,
by the way,

603
00:32:20,991 --> 00:32:25,991
is the one God who reveals himself as a,
at the top of the hierarchy.

604
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,560
And what more Martech represents is the 
capacity to explore.

605
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:34,060
So the Mesopotamian creation myth based 
because Marduk it's very interesting.

606
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,130
MARTICA carves tie mat up tire.
Matt is a dragon.

607
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,780
She represents chaos.
She's also the mother of all things.

608
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,600
Marta carves tie that up and makes the 
world out of her.

609
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,490
It makes the sky,
it makes the earth,

610
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:48,890
makes the Zodiac.
He makes one.

611
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,710
In fact,
one of this is very amusing,

612
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,820
one of Mark's names cause he has like 
200 names because actually he's a,

613
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,530
he's a mixture of gods.

614
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,603
Mesopotamian culture was made up of a 
whole bunch of subcultures that mailed 

615
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,754
it over a long period of time.
And all those subcultures had their own 

616
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,860
gods and they all got sort of mixed 
together to make Martech.

617
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:11,900
So Murdoch had a whole bunch of names 
and one of his names,

618
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:12,734
for example,
was the maker of ingenious things from 

619
00:33:15,471 --> 00:33:17,480
the combat with Tire Mat,
which is very,

620
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:18,770
very interesting.
But anyways,

621
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,963
the Mesopotamians figured out,
although they didn't know they had 

622
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:25,190
figured it out,
they figured out that the thing to which

623
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:28,950
all these other drive should be made 
subordinate was the thing that was Marta

624
00:33:28,951 --> 00:33:29,784
and Martin was the thing that carve new 
territory out of unexplored territory 

625
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,733
because basically they manage to presume
that if you didn't arrange your life so 

626
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,180
that you could constantly generate new 
information,

627
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,750
everything would come to a halt.
So everything should be made subordinate

628
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,153
to this capacity to encounter the 
unknown and generate new information on 

629
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:51,344
it because all of the other drives were 
necessary dependent for their 

630
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:58,280
fulfillment on that particular function.

631
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
So it's,
it's very,

632
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,480
it's very interesting.
It's once you understand,

633
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,333
if you understand that,
I think you understand something that's 

634
00:34:04,491 --> 00:34:05,324
unbelievably important.
That's part of the reason why I think I 

635
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:12,101
dreamt last night we had Sumerian 
skeletons because now there's more to it

636
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,154
than this of course,
because Marduk was also the ritual 

637
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,550
mortal of emulation for the Mesopotamian
emperor,

638
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,970
which basically meant that the 
Mesopotamian emperor was emperor because

639
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,043
in a sense he was Marduk and only to the
degree that he was Marta was he granted 

640
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,570
any sort of divine status and the 
emperors,

641
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,140
the embodiment of the state,
and of course our state now as a body of

642
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:35,840
laws and not a,
not a human body because we don't have a

643
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:36,674
monarchy anymore.
But the point is is that states only 

644
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:43,170
work too if they recognize that the 
property that Marta incarnated is,

645
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,313
is the thing of most central importance,
which is the capacity of the capacity 

646
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:50,870
for exploration.
Anyways,

647
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:53,180
that was a good digression.
Alright,

648
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,613
neuropsychology,
but you have to bounce around these 

649
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:57,980
things in order to get a picture of them
and

650
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,553
now the question,

651
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,210
right,
right.

652
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,293
Well they,
well that that's the ideal solution at 

653
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:21,900
least as far as the Sumerians were 
concerned.

654
00:35:21,901 --> 00:35:22,734
And like we're going to explore the 
consequences of that solution as a 

655
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:26,634
solution because it has a whole,
a whole series of important 

656
00:35:30,301 --> 00:35:32,460
implications.
It's a solution.

657
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,550
Now I happen to think it's really a good
solution,

658
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:36,420
but we'll,
we'll,

659
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,980
we'll see how plays out.
But

660
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,120
yeah,
the thing is

661
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,453
you're not determined so to speak 
because the stimulus doesn't control 

662
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,360
your behavior.
Nonetheless.

663
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,253
There are certain you are constrained,
which is to say you have boundaries and 

664
00:35:52,231 --> 00:35:56,100
I can say with a high probability in a 
broad variety of conditions,

665
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:01,250
what you are likely to consider a 
conservatory reward.

666
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,393
And I can say that because you're 
composed in part of specialized 

667
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,310
subsystems,
each of which have a stake,

668
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,290
each of which have their own job pluses,
stake in maintenance of the whole unit,

669
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,390
which is you.
So they want what they want,

670
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:17,790
but they also want you to stay around so
to speak,

671
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,420
because without you nothing happens.
And that's what the Sumerians meant when

672
00:36:21,421 --> 00:36:23,910
they said that men were created to serve
the gods.

673
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:29,330
So the relativity is modulated by the 
fact that you have a number of competing

674
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,670
tasks constantly to perform.

675
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,923
Uh Huh.
So well that's why that's one way of 

676
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:39,830
construing it anyways.
So question

677
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,500
systems or these,
can they ever,

678
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:48,980
in cases of really extreme severe 
deprivation,

679
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:52,490
can they directly grab control of the 
motor output or must they always go,

680
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,010
they always affect behaviors

681
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,240
that,
I don't know.

682
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,970
I suspect,
I suspect that there's probably,

683
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,260
there's both operating like in 
situations that are so extreme that

684
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,210
thought would be an interference rather 
than an aide,

685
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,100
then I suspect there's direct output.
Um,

686
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,593
but I,
I can't say anything because that's the 

687
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:21,970
problem with trying to reduce the brain 
to one system of operations.

688
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,493
There's evolutionary redundancy in the 
brain and often for a given type of 

689
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:28,444
response,
there's more than one system that has 

690
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:31,444
the capability for that response.
And there was some circumstances under 

691
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,960
which I suspect behavior is directed,
directly controlled,

692
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,423
but I think this is more relevant when 
you're trying to weigh potential 

693
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:46,300
alternatives.
Like,

694
00:37:46,301 --> 00:37:47,134
let's say if you're hungry and thirsty 
and you haven't been engaged in a 

695
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:53,590
romantic relationship for like a year 
and uh,

696
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,693
uh,
your job is under pressure and you're 

697
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,840
not getting along well with your 
children,

698
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,170
well then you have a whole nest of 
problems to solve and uh,

699
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,130
an almost infinite number of potential 
solutions to those problems.

700
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:09,964
And I think the role of the higher order
critical systems is to modulate the 

701
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:18,220
fantasies that all of these underlying 
systems so to speak,

702
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:21,550
might produce in order to construct the 
optimal outcome.

703
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,350
And that's well here you'd say,
again,

704
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:25,480
this is a story I keep telling you.
This is a story.

705
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:26,980
Well,
that's a vision of paradise.

706
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:27,814
That's what's up here as the archetype 
of ideal future and a vision of 

707
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:32,620
paradise.
Well that's the land of milk and honey,

708
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:33,454
right?
Where everything is bound to fleet 

709
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,040
provision where every

710
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,910
motivational system is,
is properly addressed.

711
00:38:39,911 --> 00:38:40,744
While there's a problem with that 
viewpoint that Dostoyevsky pointed out 

712
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:43,840
and all of that,
that is this,

713
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:45,550
that well,
if everything's perfect,

714
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:47,500
everything's predictable and 
everything's predictable,

715
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:50,410
then you're bored and bored.
Boredom is not part of perfection.

716
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,244
So perfection is not perfection and 
that's a big problem and that's not a 

717
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:56,470
problem.
Hopefully that will be able to address.

718
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,500
It's a big problem because it's a big 
problem because incentive reward,

719
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,973
which is what the unknown producers,
that's a cue for a reward incentive 

720
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:11,350
reward is a more potent driving force 
for people.

721
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:14,020
I think.
Then satisfaction and you think,

722
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,390
think about this in with regards to your
own behaviors.

723
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,224
Like often those things say you have a 
goal in mind and you obtain sub goals 

724
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,390
with relationship to that goal.
You're very,

725
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:26,224
very excited.
You actually attain the goal and it's 

726
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:32,950
nowhere near as exciting is 
participation in the process.

727
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:35,560
That led up to the goal,
which is to say you're more activated by

728
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:38,620
incentive reward.
Then you are by satisfactions and that's

729
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:40,390
the thing about people.
That's what we're like.

730
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,893
That's why we like novelty.
So static conceptions of the ideal 

731
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,640
future have an intrinsic

732
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,623
problem.

733
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,203
Well the problem is is that getting what
you want is not enough to make you 

734
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:02,314
content because contentment is something
that transcends the attainment of 

735
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,190
determinant satisfaction.
So that would be,

736
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,690
there's more to the story than the 
attainment of a goal that's conceived of

737
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:17,550
as a final goal.
And that has something well that,

738
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,933
Yup.

739
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,240
Well no I think,
I think you're making a valid point.

740
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,133
I mean the [inaudible] and fair enough,
I mean I guess what I'm talking about 

741
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:43,960
our systems that postulate like 
political utopian systems that postulate

742
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:44,794
that there is a particular manner of 
organizing society that will provide a 

743
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:48,604
final salute,
final static solution to all our 

744
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:51,424
problems.
A lot of more or less simplistic utopia 

745
00:40:54,011 --> 00:40:57,790
notions do in fact promise that like 
Marxism I think would be,

746
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,140
that'd be a system that fits well into 
that sort of conceptualization.

747
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,103
It's just reorganize the essential 
building blocks of society will 

748
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:07,354
inevitably produce a future that 
everyone will find ideal and that will 

749
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:13,780
be the final solution so to speak.
So yeah,

750
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,614
I mean if you know that incentive reward
is one of the things that motivates you 

751
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,050
and and in a really profound way,
again,

752
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:20,884
as I've pointed out before,
cocaine activates our incentive reward 

753
00:41:23,211 --> 00:41:24,340
systems.
People really like,

754
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:26,020
okay,
so the animals for that matter,

755
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,270
Bill self administer cocaine.
Until they die.

756
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,703
They like incentive reward.
We like incentive reward money is an 

757
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:33,980
incentive for example.

758
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,070
Bit.

759
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,960
Once you realize that a lot of things 
start,

760
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,630
a lot of weird things start to happen 
because you say,

761
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:42,464
well for example,
a perfect world therefore would have to 

762
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,244
contain novelty.
Now that's a strange thing to say 

763
00:41:48,351 --> 00:41:49,184
because novelty also induces anxiety.
So you've instantly said in the sense 

764
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:54,560
that a perfect world is also one that 
makes you anxious,

765
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:57,470
which is of course not really in 
accordance with the kinds of things that

766
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,930
we would normally consider a perfect.
So

767
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,360
are you making the claim that ideal 
future is,

768
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,910
is uh,
is is a world of unlimited exploration?

769
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,741
No,
not,

770
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,930
not entirely Daniel.
Because see,

771
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:17,310
I kind of thought that in the past,
but it's more a matter of balance.

772
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,200
You say,
well if this,

773
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:20,034
if you can represent this as the known,
which is the thing that's transformed 

774
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,160
necessarily by the appearance of 
novelty,

775
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,570
it's also a precondition for the 
capacity to assimilate novelty.

776
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:31,883
So you have to know something,
which is to say that part of what makes 

777
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:39,000
you capable of exploring and 
assimilating new information is the fact

778
00:42:39,001 --> 00:42:41,820
that you're already composed of static 
structures of knowledge.

779
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,983
So you could say the ideal has to 
therefore con be composed at least in 

780
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,060
part of a balance between what static 
and what's normal.

781
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,420
So it isn't just exploration,
it's also,

782
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,283
it's also the security that makes known 
terrifying exploration possible and the 

783
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:04,080
security that gives rise to the skills 
that make creative exploration possible.

784
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,273
So you get someone like Einstein,
I think it was Einstein who said he 

785
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:09,630
could see so far cause he stood on the 
shoulders of giants.

786
00:43:09,631 --> 00:43:13,590
And that's a good mythological image 
because basically what Einstein said was

787
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,424
that he stood on the ground that was 
prepared by his dead ancestors and 

788
00:43:18,151 --> 00:43:18,984
that's why he could see so far.
So it's a matter of balance and you 

789
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:22,914
know,
that's what the oriental yen and Yang 

790
00:43:24,061 --> 00:43:26,620
symbol basically states too is that you 
know,

791
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,480
order is necessary and chaos is 
necessary.

792
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,643
And the ideal is some balance between 
and that's where you're supposed to 

793
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:35,600
walk,

794
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,310
would that's,
that's an eye that same uh,

795
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,170
ideal mode of adoption.
Yup.

796
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,020
Which is answering,
when you say ideal in that context,

797
00:43:45,021 --> 00:43:47,180
you're not talking about the box top 
runners.

798
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:47,941
No.
Well then,

799
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:49,350
okay,
that's fine.

800
00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:51,390
Absolutely.
That's why I said,

801
00:43:51,391 --> 00:43:52,040
well,
in that,

802
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,750
in their little story there's,
there's a grammar of,

803
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,380
there's a simple grammar of the story 
which is,

804
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,170
which is the,
which is this,

805
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:03,841
which is,
you know,

806
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:07,770
this is your kingdom.
Why is that or your culture?

807
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,633
Well,
you're a part of the same culture with 

808
00:44:10,921 --> 00:44:12,510
someone else.
If you share their story,

809
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:13,463
it's as simple as that.
And their story is the manner in which 

810
00:44:15,181 --> 00:44:17,010
they have fixed motivational 
significance.

811
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:17,844
Though I'm going to this including you 
as an on going in there and to the 

812
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:23,130
degree that you share that scheme of 
interpretation,

813
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,143
they are,
you are a part of that culture and 

814
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,740
that's because,
well,

815
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,680
it's quite straight forward.
I guess that's it.

816
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:30,923
If you and I share same vision with 
regards to the value of a goal and the 

817
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:34,810
means for getting there.

818
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,053
I can predict your behavior and you can 
predict mind knowing that you can rely 

819
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:39,624
on me and we can cooperate.
So we've just drawn a magic circle 

820
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:46,320
around ourselves so to speak,
that it eliminates the,

821
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,050
the unpredictable and novel from our 
interactions except in very connected,

822
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,893
very constrained matter.
So you're a defined territory as far as 

823
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,500
I'm concerned.
And vice versa.

824
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,440
We are from the same culture and you can
make very,

825
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,813
you know,
you can make very trivial distinctions 

826
00:45:02,101 --> 00:45:03,570
within cultures.
For example,

827
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:04,703
we're both psychologists,
but we're practicing in different 

828
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,360
domains.
That could easily mean we could split it

829
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,750
into some cultures depending on the 
event that's going on.

830
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,530
Because if something threatened your 
room subgroup and benefited mind,

831
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,660
instantly we fragment because our 
stories,

832
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:21,030
what does the switch,
so anyways,

833
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:22,223
this is the law.
This is the more comprehensive story 

834
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,470
because you have a story.

835
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,680
But then there's this story about how to
transform your stories when that becomes

836
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:33,570
necessary.
And so this is a fixed story and this is

837
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,553
another fixed story.
You notice I've structured it so that 

838
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,840
this one's a square here in a circle 
here,

839
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,220
which is the idea that this is the metal
structure remains the same,

840
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:45,054
but the details shift not to stage 
transition from the Piagetian 

841
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,990
perspective or a revolution from the 
Cuny and perspective.

842
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:57,000
And uh,
this is blown apart by the appearance of

843
00:45:57,001 --> 00:45:57,834
anomalous information.
And you can think of anomalous 

844
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:03,450
information as the agent of chaos,
particularly weird way of looking at it.

845
00:46:03,451 --> 00:46:04,284
But anyways,
it's anomalous information that follows 

846
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:08,790
this structure apart.
And in initiation rituals,

847
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,624
for example,
they catalyze this sort of 

848
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:13,140
transformation.
I face you with something anomalous.

849
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:15,990
I blow apart your story.
You are reduced to chaos.

850
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,010
But what does that mean?

851
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,263
Well,
it means that you have all of the 

852
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:23,640
determinant motivational significance is
that you have a fixed two events,

853
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:27,510
including yourself and other people.
That's all up for grabs again.

854
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,120
So you're by turns,
depressed,

855
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:31,200
anxious,
elated,

856
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,990
et cetera.
Your emotional systems are in flux.

857
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,824
And the reason they're in flux is 
because the metal structure that kept 

858
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,304
them integrated has been destroyed.
So you're now subject to the war of 

859
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,550
competing emotions basically.
Yeah.

860
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,350
So that's,
that's a descent into chaos.

861
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:47,184
And if it's an initiation ceremony,
the members of your culture will give 

862
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:51,534
you a new story.
Say this is the story for these things 

863
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:55,200
usually happen to men,
but not always.

864
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,580
This is your story for being a man bag.
Well that's a new framework of reference

865
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:03,950
that makes your new position now 
determinant.

866
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,660
So then you're up here when you could 
say,

867
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:09,360
well there are different ways of 
construing the ideal.

868
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,400
If you're a patriot,
you say

869
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,100
to the degree that I identify with this,
I'm perfect,

870
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,173
I'm moral.

871
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,553
If you're identifying,
that's one form of perfection and you 

872
00:47:24,101 --> 00:47:26,950
can see the utility to that.
Do people do that all the time?

873
00:47:26,951 --> 00:47:28,930
Even when they're identifying with 
football teams for

874
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,693
there's a more profound type of 
identification and that would be 

875
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,153
identification with the process,
with the capability to undergo this 

876
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:44,530
process identification with the capacity
for transformation.

877
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,341
And that,
again,

878
00:47:45,341 --> 00:47:46,174
that that ties back with your earlier 
comment about viewing yourself as well 

879
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:53,500
as someone who's capable,
not only of adhering to stories,

880
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,680
but if generating and modifying them.
That's a much,

881
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,300
and again,
well,

882
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,463
I want you to read this next section on 
Marta with this sort of thing in mind 

883
00:48:01,961 --> 00:48:02,794
because again,
that's what the Mesopotamians positive 

884
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,660
as ideal.
In fact,

885
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:09,730
the k,
the emperor of Mesopotamia,

886
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,790
every new year when the year is 
regenerated,

887
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,830
you can view this as the year,
by the way,

888
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,560
from the Mesopotamian perspective.
Anyways,

889
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,503
the king was ritually reduced to chaos 
and reconstituted at the beginning of 

890
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:25,600
every new year from the Mesopotamian 
perspective,

891
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:28,450
that was equivalent to reduction of the 
world,

892
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:31,390
the cosmos to its constituent elements 
and then renewal.

893
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,690
That's a comment that's the most common 
of mythological themes by the way.

894
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:36,923
Okay.
Uh,

895
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:41,990
yeah,
exploration is necessary because you and

896
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,280
everything else is going to change 
whether you like it or not.

897
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,460
Uh,
then wouldn't,

898
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,413
wouldn't be ideal,
would be not necessarily active 

899
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:52,023
exploration,
but exploration when you need to 

900
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,780
explore.
Yeah.

901
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,800
Yeah.
Fair enough.

902
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:00,010
You're talking about the ideal is the 
ideal state that you are,

903
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:03,700
the ideal future is wanting to make sure
you're always actively,

904
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:04,600
it's no or no,
no,

905
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:05,130
no,
no,

906
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:05,411
no,
no,

907
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:06,350
you're right.
You're,

908
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,100
you're alternative.
Reformulation is more accurate,

909
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,443
has its exploration when it's necessary,
which is to say that you need to know 

910
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:18,220
what you know so you don't have to go 
looking for trouble necessarily or be an

911
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,920
agent of change for the sake of being an
agent of change.

912
00:49:20,921 --> 00:49:25,921
But if you detect an anomaly which which
you do it voluntarily,

913
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,540
that's the thing about how your brain is
set up.

914
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:31,100
If something anomalous happens,
you notice it.

915
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,140
Once you notice it,
then it's incumbent on you to alter your

916
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:35,974
story,
but it's not necessarily the case that 

917
00:49:38,021 --> 00:49:39,910
you have to be actively going about 
that.

918
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,680
While I would exhaust you,
in fact,

919
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:43,480
I think in some ways that's what happens
too.

920
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,910
Paranoid schizophrenia.
You think this is,

921
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,950
you might think that this is kind of 
another leap,

922
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:50,280
but if you read graze article in this 
book,

923
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,890
Gray has a theory of the neuropsychology
of schizophrenia.

924
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:53,743
What happens to schizophrenia is that 
novelty starts appearing over where it 

925
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:58,294
shouldn't,
which is to say that the inhibitory 

926
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:04,441
structure that stops meaning from being 
experienced has been disrupted.

927
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,493
So for the poor schizophrenia,
meanings are popping up everywhere and 

928
00:50:07,931 --> 00:50:12,931
meaning means this signifies something 
usually something threatening.

929
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:14,434
It's something promising that attracts 
your attention to the poor 

930
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:18,250
schizophrenia.
His attention is always attracted.

931
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:19,383
It's part of the reason that paranoid 
schizophrenia or hypervigilant and what 

932
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:27,211
happens to them is that I think is well 
if you,

933
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,870
if something appears as meaningful to 
you,

934
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:33,230
that activates your exploration system 
and that's dope and surgically mediated.

935
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,740
Well that explains in part the hyper 
dopamine Nirjah,

936
00:50:36,741 --> 00:50:38,930
that's characteristic of schizophrenia 
and the hyper vigilance.

937
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,200
But the problem with that is that if 
you're on all the time,

938
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,243
you'll kill those systems.
I think that's what happens to 

939
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,540
schizophrenia when they go into second 
stage schizophrenia,

940
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:50,540
which is characterized by no flat out 
effect and,

941
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,380
and uh,
Parkinson light symptoms.

942
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,753
So,
uh,

943
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,420
it's not so good to be on all the time.
You know what's funny because a common,

944
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,030
a common,
mythological ideal is piece,

945
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:02,691
right?
I mean,

946
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:03,524
and that would seem to be,
that would seem to be specifically not 

947
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,690
upset maybe when you're here to to 
maintain peace.

948
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:09,591
Yeah.
Yes.

949
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:10,424
That's a,
but then there's this the contrary 

950
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:13,850
argument.
That's a perfectly valid point.

951
00:51:13,851 --> 00:51:14,684
But there's the contrary argument and I 
think this is an argument that the red 

952
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:19,590
queen and there wasn't wondering,
I was,

953
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,240
she said you have to run as fast as you 
can just to stay where you are.

954
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,370
So which is to say that a static mode of
adaptation is not,

955
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,020
is no adaptation at all systems age all 
by themselves.

956
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:33,854
So you have to stay very active in order
just to maintain things the way they 

957
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:39,310
are.
So what's,

958
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,690
you don't necessarily have to be 
running,

959
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,653
running all the time.
I mean absolutely come to a sort of a 

960
00:51:44,721 --> 00:51:48,200
peaceful existence with yourself and 
you're living in the woods or something.

961
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:50,810
Yeah know and Y'all are in here and they
were completely happy with it.

962
00:51:50,811 --> 00:51:51,644
Well you're not going to have to,
you're not going to have to do a lot of 

963
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:54,490
active change in less.

964
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,200
Your situation changes or you change.
Yeah,

965
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:59,420
I think that,
I mean it's a complex,

966
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,553
it's a complex issue because you can 
also by expiration you can also produce 

967
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:04,641
a normal,
he's,

968
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:07,520
it's not necessarily the case that they 
just happened to you.

969
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,140
So,
but you know your,

970
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:11,420
I've got no argument at all with what 
you say.

971
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,610
It's a matter of balance.
I mean the point is is that,

972
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,950
well Egypt,
Egypt for example,

973
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,203
stayed stable for about 3000 years,
which is to say that as far as modern 

974
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,303
archeologists are able to determine,
there was a 30 century period where the 

975
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:30,140
fundamental substructures of Egyptian 
society state exactly the same.

976
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,070
And the Egyptians were convinced as are 
many traditional societies,

977
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,173
that change meant death.
And you can understand that because any 

978
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:39,614
cultural innovation is all cultural 
innovations have the capacity to 

979
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:44,360
undermine the cultures that produce 
them.

980
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:48,560
So many cultures off for restasis.
But the problem is is,

981
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,060
and three,
because they think,

982
00:52:50,061 --> 00:52:52,040
well we have a good thing and that sort 
of play around with it.

983
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,120
It's like biological mutations.
It's a good analogy.

984
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,060
Most biological mutations kill you.
Can you think every innovation is in the

985
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:04,130
cultural sphere and analogy to a 
mutation,

986
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,310
but the one in every thousand mutations 
that doesn't kill you,

987
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,950
it's necessary for the survival of the 
species.

988
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:13,260
So it's a very strange balance.
Does that,

989
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,450
does that argument make sense?
Does that didn't know what to you?

990
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:16,940
Makes Sense.
So

991
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:26,150
how do you explain things like marriage?
Like why isn't the divorce

992
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,353
was seriously,
or even if you love like a have a 

993
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:31,203
favorite song or like a rarity,
the same person or decades that's got 

994
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,820
like that's gotta be boring after a 
while.

995
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:38,940
I mean there's no,

996
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,000
maybe it does,
I don't know if it has to be meaning you

997
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,760
also have the capacity to shift 
frameworks of reference.

998
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,260
It's also,
right,

999
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:47,213
so you,
I mean especially with something as 

1000
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:51,930
complex as another person,
if you think you know someone else,

1001
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,150
that's only a delusion that you have 
about this,

1002
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,810
the extent of your knowledge.
So if you,

1003
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,210
if what you see is what you have 
habituated to,

1004
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:02,640
then what you see is what you have 
habituated to,

1005
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:06,150
not what's there because you don't know 
what that other person is like.

1006
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:08,220
And perhaps they've fallen into the same
damn game,

1007
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,010
which is they play out the rule you've 
specified for them.

1008
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,260
But that's your tough luck,
you know?

1009
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,094
So that's,
that's a good answer with regards to 

1010
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:16,824
marriage anyways.
So I mean with regards to simpler 

1011
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:21,560
phenomenon,
well you know,

1012
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,030
you can move from,
from thing to thing and people do that.

1013
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:24,864
But so part of,
part of the human capacity for 

1014
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:29,310
expiration is also to see what hasn't 
been mapped.

1015
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,144
Where are you,
where people think everything is 

1016
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,603
understood

1017
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,430
and uh,
but her point,

1018
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:38,693
uh,
brings up something interesting to me 

1019
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,450
when you boil into chaos and then you go
and then you go to any place,

1020
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:45,830
can you take part of the old system?

1021
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,961
Oh,
absolutely.

1022
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:47,910
I've looked,
look with,

1023
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,813
this is another thing you want to read 
when you go through this next chapter 

1024
00:54:50,981 --> 00:54:53,320
because part of the,
uh Huh.

1025
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,900
That Pharaoh,
the Egyptian Pharaoh for example,

1026
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:58,180
who's a nice Mesopotamian emperor 
analog,

1027
00:54:58,181 --> 00:55:00,250
although a little later down the 
historical chain,

1028
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,473
he was simultaneously the,
the Pharaoh who had died and the new 

1029
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:05,464
pharaoh always.
And that meant basically that he was 

1030
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,720
both ocirus and horace.
This is how the Egyptians construed it.

1031
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:11,991
No,
no,

1032
00:55:11,991 --> 00:55:12,824
serious was the old pharaoh who 
basically was confined to the 

1033
00:55:15,881 --> 00:55:19,600
underworld.
And Horace was the process that gave new

1034
00:55:19,601 --> 00:55:23,620
life to the pharaoh or Cirrus who was 
confined in the underworld.

1035
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:24,454
So the new pharaoh was simultaneously 
everything that had already been 

1036
00:55:26,921 --> 00:55:30,670
learned,
plus the process that allows you to make

1037
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:33,550
use of everything that's already been 
learned in a creative manner.

1038
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,460
So,
hey,

1039
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:36,663
so of course this,
that's why this is the structure is the 

1040
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:41,830
same.
So if this is composed of this,

1041
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,670
plus this,
so which is to say that when you make,

1042
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,800
when there's a revolution in your 
thought,

1043
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,000
what you use is everything you already 
knew,

1044
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:52,953
plus the information that has been in 
gendered by your contact or your 

1045
00:55:55,931 --> 00:55:58,210
assimilation up via normal ist 
information.

1046
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,010
So here,
I'll just give you,

1047
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:00,844
this is kind of funny.
I think this is often represented as a 

1048
00:56:03,281 --> 00:56:05,710
serpent,
the serpent of chaos for the Egyptians.

1049
00:56:05,711 --> 00:56:09,610
That was Adam and Adam.
What was the most primordial of gods who

1050
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:10,444
ruled at the beginning of the time and 
who will once again rule at the end of 

1051
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:13,474
time.
So he's sort of the place that 

1052
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,630
everything came from.
It's a serpent anyways,

1053
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,310
when you can see,
for example,

1054
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:22,420
the structure of the story in genesis of
Adam and eve in this,

1055
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:25,300
in this little as well because,
well,

1056
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,150
anomalous information,
maybe I'm jumping ahead and man,

1057
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,283
I'll tell you anyways,
anomalous information is often given a 

1058
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:32,194
feminine form.
So you'll see when we go through 

1059
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,850
because,
well,

1060
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,684
because anything anomalous,
this is a hypo hypothetical state is 

1061
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:40,870
chaos.

1062
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:41,703
You can say it's,
it's all the unknown that you haven't 

1063
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:46,180
encountered.
It can't say anything about that because

1064
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:47,980
it's not actually part of your 
experience.

1065
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:48,963
It's just a hypothesis about the source 
of all those things you don't 

1066
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,710
understand.
It's not those things themselves.

1067
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,293
When,
when something anomalous actually makes 

1068
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:00,280
itself manifest,
which is to say that you're,

1069
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,900
you're,
you're,

1070
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:02,734
uh,
following your story and something 

1071
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:04,414
unexpected happens,
then something has something actually 

1072
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:09,370
unexpected has happened to you.
Well,

1073
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,510
it's in exploring that unexpected thing 
that you generate new information.

1074
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:14,344
So you could think of the unexpected 
that you experience as the Matrix of 

1075
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:20,020
everything that you know,
because it's the source.

1076
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,110
It's the source of everything that you 
know,

1077
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:24,063
you have to explore it,
but it's still the place where 

1078
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:27,370
information comes from.
A matrix.

1079
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:30,460
I use that word because it said in the 
logically related to mother in any ways.

1080
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,710
This is often given feminine feminine 
form.

1081
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,573
Yeah.
The Matrix of things absolutely matters 

1082
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:37,220
as well.
Um,

1083
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,500
but anyways,
so,

1084
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:41,793
well it's a complicated thing.
The serpent gives the crude to even the 

1085
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:49,480
story of genesis and producers of a 
complete collapse.

1086
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,693
That's the rise of self consciousness 
and the genesis story in Christian 

1087
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:56,020
morality is the attempt to get from here
back to here.

1088
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,280
Well in a sense that's,
anyways,

1089
00:57:59,290 --> 00:58:00,123
that's just,
that's another example of how these 

1090
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:01,953
sorts of things tied together.
Let me just show you this cartoon 

1091
00:58:05,261 --> 00:58:07,420
because I might otherwise forget it.
This is quite funny.

1092
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,380
This is,
this is just a cartoon.

1093
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:15,670
It sort of illustrates how we do respond
to things that we understand.

1094
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,700
Things that we don't
know.

1095
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,890
The reason this cartoon is funny of 
course,

1096
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,733
is because you don't sit around the 
campfire at night and talking about the 

1097
00:58:26,721 --> 00:58:28,530
things you understand,
right?

1098
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,800
They don't have any motivation with 
significant steps.

1099
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:35,850
That's why you think you understand the
tales of the note.

1100
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,820
It's also,
it's also well in embedded in,

1101
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:43,654
this is also the notion that the things 
you have explored don't have a lot of 

1102
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:50,050
effect of valence anymore.
So they're not very interesting and it's

1103
00:58:50,051 --> 00:58:50,884
unknown things that are interesting 
around the campfire and make it more 

1104
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:57,530
effective to tell a story arc all 
around.

1105
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,271
Right,
right.

1106
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:00,160
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1107
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,660
Yeah,
sure.

1108
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,660
Penn Penn rules around the campfire at 
night,

1109
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:06,190
right.
Pans the God who lives,

1110
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:10,660
who lives in the forest and who causes 
panic basically.

1111
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,583
And uh,
he's the God that inhabits the forest 

1112
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:17,650
because the forest is unknown territory 
and unknown territory produces a seizure

1113
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:21,070
of ongoing activity is associated with 
anxiety.

1114
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:22,423
So,

1115
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,890
so if you have this conception of the 
future,

1116
00:59:25,891 --> 00:59:26,750
which is,
you know,

1117
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,750
being perfect and happy and that has 
some goals of being successful and being

1118
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:35,751
an academic and being a psychologist
and then something happens that disrupts

1119
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,364
you or your interest in or your faith 
and your ability to do cognitive 

1120
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,400
psychology and so that,
that particular style going,

1121
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:43,234
we'll get plunged into chaos.
And you come back up with this idea of 

1122
00:59:44,911 --> 00:59:46,550
being a developmental psychologist.
Right?

1123
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,401
Right.
Absolutely.

1124
00:59:47,401 --> 00:59:50,700
That without affecting your larger goal.

1125
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,790
Sure.
You just did it in that example.

1126
00:59:52,791 --> 00:59:54,050
That's exactly what happens.
Sure.

1127
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,033
That's fine.

1128
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:56,003
I mean,
does it,

1129
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,890
and can it ever happened in isolation,
Justin and support?

1130
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,090
Absolutely.
Yeah,

1131
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,710
absolutely.
Sure.

1132
01:00:01,711 --> 01:00:03,270
And then it doesn't provoke that much 
anxiety.

1133
01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:04,170
That's,
that's why,

1134
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,540
well that's all the time,
right?

1135
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,280
Like when all the time for the meeting 
and that's just a disruption.

1136
01:00:08,281 --> 01:00:10,530
It was absolutely right.
Absolutely.

1137
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:11,563
And that's a tree.
That's the thing that's so neat about 

1138
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,880
this and like a tree by the way,
is a very,

1139
01:00:14,881 --> 01:00:17,340
very,
very common figure in mythology.

1140
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:18,870
The tree of life,
for example.

1141
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,450
I really believe that's what it's 
referring to is this.

1142
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:26,070
It's the tree like structure that holds 
your motivational systems in check.

1143
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,353
So you can lose like minor league 
branches or you could lose things that 

1144
01:00:30,841 --> 01:00:32,840
are close to the trunk,
which is a,

1145
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,063
that's a very big catastrophe spend you 
looms whole Schema is of actions in an 

1146
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,813
interpretation,
interpretations that whole entire 

1147
01:00:40,081 --> 01:00:43,530
sections of your experience in 
motivational check.

1148
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,490
So given that they have any priority 
significance,

1149
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:50,460
you're try to restrict that significance
to some useful domain always when you're

1150
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:52,030
trying to do so,
can you own it,

1151
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,920
have adapt to things that affect some 
goals on some level,

1152
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:55,790
I you,
because if you,

1153
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,713
if something happens that draws into 
question like let's say your most 

1154
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:02,180
fundamental like the trunk of the tree,
right?

1155
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,610
And you adapt from that or do you just,

1156
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,350
that's part of what we're trying to 
address in this class.

1157
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,120
See,
because you can say,

1158
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:11,870
well,
the best story is the one that addresses

1159
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:14,060
the widest range of potential 
phenomenon,

1160
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:14,931
right?
Say,

1161
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:16,160
well,
mythologies,

1162
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:19,760
collect mythologies,
distill the best story.

1163
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:20,713
So what we're going to try to do is to 
understand what the best story is 

1164
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:24,494
because the best story is the one that 
has the largest domain of potential 

1165
01:01:28,971 --> 01:01:29,990
relevance.
So you could say,

1166
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:31,460
well,
what's the big problem?

1167
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:32,720
Well,
the big problem for example,

1168
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:33,670
might be,
uh,

1169
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:37,070
the fact of human mortality because that
would be the,

1170
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:39,560
the,
the anomalous phenomena,

1171
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:43,310
which puts the determinant significance 
of everything into dispute.

1172
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:45,620
So how can you adapt to that?
Well,

1173
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,880
again,
that's the question.

1174
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:48,890
Say That's at the bottom of Christian 
morality.

1175
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:51,260
You view it,
I'm using Christian morality.

1176
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:52,094
Just as an example.
If you view the rise of self 

1177
01:01:54,531 --> 01:01:55,910
consciousness,
for example,

1178
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,833
one of the concomitants of the rise of 
self consciousness is the knowledge of 

1179
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:01,310
death.
And that the two things are very closely

1180
01:02:01,311 --> 01:02:03,320
linked.
If you're self conscious,

1181
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,810
that means you can conceive of your 
boundaries.

1182
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,673
That's what it means.
And you have spatial boundaries and you 

1183
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:09,620
know,
they kind of bother you,

1184
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:11,180
but you can move from one place to 
another.

1185
01:02:11,181 --> 01:02:14,090
So that's not such a big deal.
It's the temporal boundary.

1186
01:02:14,091 --> 01:02:16,760
That's the big problem.
So the question is,

1187
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:17,594
well,
can you adapt to the fact a temporal 

1188
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,910
boundary?
Well,

1189
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,340
obviously this is a very tough,
very difficult question about talk.

1190
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:29,040
It's the sort of thing that we'll see.
Part of what,

1191
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:31,800
okay,

1192
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,490
part of what I'm interested in trying to
understand is why people get so horribly

1193
01:02:35,491 --> 01:02:37,560
twisted as they mature.
I mean,

1194
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:40,560
there's lots of reasons for it there.
They're pretty much plainly evident.

1195
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,443
Like in many ways the world is a 
terrible place and there's sufficient 

1196
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:48,300
reason all the time for people to get 
twisted off the path.

1197
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,193
And in fact,
I think often it's more surprising that 

1198
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:51,624
that doesn't happen all the time.
Then it is surprising that it sometimes 

1199
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:55,930
happens well,

1200
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,773
well
if you're growing up in a family that 

1201
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,640
maybe doesn't have this normal 
adaptation,

1202
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,250
I've seen these things are,
you know,

1203
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:13,343
caught up in stuff holds or maybe 
something traumatic happened that 

1204
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:20,761
affects one of your fundamental Schema.
That's prob definitely,

1205
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,290
yeah,
well the,

1206
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:26,240
yeah,
but that in itself is not enough.

1207
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:27,074
Like I think that's it.
That's a necessary but not sufficient 

1208
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:31,130
precondition.
So you can say,

1209
01:03:31,131 --> 01:03:33,200
well,
some people never like,

1210
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:34,034
if you're lucky you at least start here.
Some people never bloody well even get 

1211
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:37,394
here.
They just,

1212
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,520
they were born and this is where they 
stay and that's terrible for them,

1213
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:42,800
but if it possible to stay there without
being entirely insane,

1214
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:46,480
I mean because anyone who functions at 
all how good the Schema,

1215
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,300
because you have to have a go.
I mean you are working toward something.

1216
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:54,140
I have no idea what it is.
Not necessarily don't necessarily,

1217
01:03:54,141 --> 01:03:54,974
you have to allow yourself the 
possibility that there may be something 

1218
01:03:57,201 --> 01:03:58,034
that you're working towards even if you 
don't understand what it is and that's 

1219
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:03,440
the thing that you can hold on to in the
darkness so to speak,

1220
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:04,070
something you don't.

1221
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,870
That's faith from the religious 
perspective and he might,

1222
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:07,510
I'll,
I'll,

1223
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,260
I'll get to you right away.
You might say,

1224
01:04:09,261 --> 01:04:11,830
well,
what's that faith in the answer to that?

1225
01:04:11,831 --> 01:04:13,310
And it's says possibility.
He said,

1226
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:17,020
even if you don't know like this 
revolutionary adaptation,

1227
01:04:17,021 --> 01:04:19,190
that's some,
that's what this morning represents.

1228
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:19,971
You can say,
well,

1229
01:04:19,971 --> 01:04:23,180
this is an image of the hero from the 
mythological perspective to say,

1230
01:04:23,181 --> 01:04:26,240
well,
you may identify with that figure,

1231
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:29,360
even if you don't know you're doing it,
which is to say that when you were here,

1232
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:31,250
you may say to yourself,
well,

1233
01:04:31,251 --> 01:04:35,540
it's possible that if I pay attention 
better things will come about.

1234
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,823
Well,
I'm gonna say it's that what you're 

1235
01:04:37,551 --> 01:04:39,230
doing,
whether you know when you're not,

1236
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:43,730
is identifying with the capacity to 
undergo this process.

1237
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,710
So then you'd say,
well,

1238
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,800
even when you're in chaos,
you still have a story.

1239
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,460
Well,
that's true.

1240
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,200
You do.
But you don't have to like people.

1241
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,183
This is,
this is the problem with notions like 

1242
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,580
Joseph Campbell,
for example.

1243
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:57,140
Most new age philosophy.
They say,

1244
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:58,070
well,
you know,

1245
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,900
follow your interests.
Well,

1246
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:00,913
there's a lot of the,
normally wherever your interest take 

1247
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:03,590
you,
that's perfectly fine.

1248
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:05,180
They say,
follow your interest in.

1249
01:05:05,181 --> 01:05:06,360
You'll get to hear,
well,

1250
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,930
that's loaded.
That's uh,

1251
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,050
uh,
what would you say?

1252
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:12,650
A very over simplistic and naive 
conception of development.

1253
01:05:12,651 --> 01:05:15,530
Because if you follow your interest and 
you hit a big anomaly,

1254
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,890
which you will,
you'll end up here.

1255
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,260
And this is the,
this is by definition,

1256
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,870
the most unpleasant place that you could
imagine to me.

1257
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,240
And so it isn't just a matter of,
well,

1258
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:27,610
things are pretty damn good now and if 
you're just real good,

1259
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,450
they'll get a lot better.
It's well things or you know,

1260
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:33,250
however they are right now,
I don't know how that,

1261
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,500
each person determines that personally.

1262
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:36,633
And if you do what you should do,
they're going to get a lot worse before 

1263
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,120
they get better.
So

1264
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,573
that's,
that's part of it because you need an 

1265
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,220
explanation,
you know,

1266
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,970
it's like,
why don't people do this?

1267
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,073
Why don't people pay attention to a 
normalcy information when it doesn't 

1268
01:05:49,931 --> 01:05:50,764
take that much cognitive work to realize
that if you ignore something that's 

1269
01:05:54,041 --> 01:05:54,874
real,
sooner or later it's going to cause you 

1270
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:57,401
trouble.
Well,

1271
01:05:57,401 --> 01:05:58,234
why do people ignore it then?
But it must be a reason because some 

1272
01:06:00,911 --> 01:06:03,850
interpretation is better than them,
that's for sure.

1273
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:05,260
Even a bad one,
that's for sure.

1274
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,520
That's for sure.
Yeah,

1275
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,970
that explains a lot of the persistence 
of forms of psychopathology.

1276
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:11,111
So like you say,
well,

1277
01:06:11,111 --> 01:06:12,070
you know,
when someone has,

1278
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:13,053
someone has a real cockeyed story and 
it's obvious to them that it's cockeyed 

1279
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:16,684
because their story transforms almost 
everything into the determinant 

1280
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:25,960
significance is off anxiety and pain.
But they'll still hang on to that like a

1281
01:06:25,991 --> 01:06:26,824
lifeline when you offer them an 
alternative story that would allow the 

1282
01:06:32,141 --> 01:06:35,910
motivational states of hope and 
satisfaction to emerge.

1283
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:40,630
Because even though this is terrible,
this is worse,

1284
01:06:41,850 --> 01:06:42,683
I think it's at the new one,
they'd have to go there right now 

1285
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,880
because they're not being a hero.
Like they're escaping.

1286
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,780
Escaping just perpetuates the anxiety.
So if they're stuck in anxiety,

1287
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,860
pain,
then

1288
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,420
yeah.
Well this is what,

1289
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:59,280
this is why I want you to read paradise 
lost because Milton's paradise lost is a

1290
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:01,070
description of,
of uh,

1291
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,123
the,
the feedback process that refusal to 

1292
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:08,700
admit to a normally necessarily 
produces.

1293
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,063
So question,
is there a qualitative difference or a 

1294
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,100
difference in the degree damage to the 
branch?

1295
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:20,150
Well,
it depends on how you look at it.

1296
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:22,910
Like though,
if you look at it from this perspective,

1297
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:25,140
there's a qualitative difference because
uh,

1298
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:27,350
damage to a branch would be damaged in 
here.

1299
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:30,650
It's just a matter of means.
And then the qualitative difference,

1300
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:33,080
the qualitative shift would be damaged 
here or here.

1301
01:07:33,650 --> 01:07:36,590
But if you look at it this way,
it's really quantitative.

1302
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,950
And I think this is actually a more act 
by,

1303
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,803
by the way,
Daniel Higgins helped me with 

1304
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,650
substantial load developing this 
particular representation by talk.

1305
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:49,100
This makes it appear quantitative.
And then

1306
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,350
the thing is you can,
you could say,

1307
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:56,270
well maybe there's a qualitative,
sorry,

1308
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:59,270
a quantitative difference between damage
here and here,

1309
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,493
but there's a qualitative difference 
between damage here and here because 

1310
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,361
anyways,
that's how I,

1311
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:06,650
that's how I look at it.
So

1312
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:09,973
it's a quantitative process that has the
appearance of qualitative shift from 

1313
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:16,130
time to,
so

1314
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:24,170
using this is a lot more
difficult to handle.

1315
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:31,950
But I'm,
I'm wondering why Maddie,

1316
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,880
if I'm part of the leap of faith is,
is

1317
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:45,540
simply accepting that even if you don't 
understand what you're doing,

1318
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,950
you're doing it for something that the 
possibilities,

1319
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,300
it will still make you feel better.
How exactly that

1320
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:53,750
maybe fit in there.

1321
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,670
Well,
often pain is bounded.

1322
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,043
So like let's say you're on,
you're operating under a system of 

1323
01:09:00,211 --> 01:09:03,780
presumptions that always interferes with
your interpersonal relationships.

1324
01:09:03,781 --> 01:09:06,720
So they always end in catastrophe,
but it's very predictable.

1325
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,033
The point of the story,
remember the point of having a story is 

1326
01:09:09,691 --> 01:09:11,490
to render things predictable.
Now,

1327
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:14,490
predictable pain is a hell of a lot 
better than unpredictable pain.

1328
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,540
And it is possible depending on your 
attitude towards anxiety,

1329
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:19,703
that predictable pain is better than 
unpredictable pleasure because the 

1330
01:09:22,471 --> 01:09:25,740
unpredictable aspect of the pleasure 
means anxiety.

1331
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,080
And then of course,
whether you,

1332
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:29,493
whether where you would prefer anxiety 
to pain in a sense depends on how you 

1333
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:37,140
construe your potential relationship to 
anxiety.

1334
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:41,893
Unpredictable.

1335
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:53,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

1336
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,323
And that's,

1337
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:00,260
yeah,
it's intermittent reinforcement.

1338
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,730
Yeah.
It's very hard to extinguish.

1339
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:03,890
Well,
the thing about the thing about novelty,

1340
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:06,320
this makes it complex,
is that it's an intrinsically,

1341
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,310
it's an intrinsically ambivalent 
stimulus.

1342
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:13,150
The thing is novel stimulus or not 
really stimuli there,

1343
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,043
their cloud,
there were a class of stimuli and they 

1344
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,170
produce both anxiety and incentive 
reward.

1345
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,004
So the circumstances of the problem,
like the gambling d determined in large 

1346
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:24,614
part,
like whether it's incentive reward or 

1347
01:10:26,301 --> 01:10:27,134
anxiety that predominates and and that's
very situationally situationally 

1348
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:32,900
dependent.
So in the case of gambling,

1349
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:36,080
this situation is set up so that at 
least for those who gamble,

1350
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,020
the incentive reward outweighs the 
anxiety.

1351
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:42,020
But they both produce it while a 
heightened state of arousal,

1352
01:10:42,021 --> 01:10:44,840
for example.
But lots of people won't gamble too.

1353
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,733
So that that would,
that would have something to do partly 

1354
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:50,180
with scheme of interpretation and partly
with biological differences.

1355
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,273
So similar,

1356
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:57,150
it seems it biologically that we respond
more to it than to actual reward.

1357
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,300
Well,
I think that you can make an argument to

1358
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,134
that end.
Yeah.

1359
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:03,600
So would you say the same thing then for
threat and anxiety versus punishment?

1360
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,190
What would you say like,
look,

1361
01:11:07,191 --> 01:11:11,780
it's a lot easier for us to adapt to,
to the fact of punishments.

1362
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:14,850
We just eliminate them like very rare 
that any of us are in pain,

1363
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,830
but it's not rare at all that were 
anxious.

1364
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,810
We haven't been able to do much about 
that at all.

1365
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,750
Partly because there's the existential 
aspect of anxiety,

1366
01:11:21,751 --> 01:11:22,584
but whether,
whether anxiety is more motivating than 

1367
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:28,410
pain is kind of a moot point because 
it's situationally dependent.

1368
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:29,244
But it is certainly more difficult to 
rid ourselves of anxiety on any 

1369
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:35,610
permanent basis.
So for,

1370
01:11:35,611 --> 01:11:36,444
for,
for people who have already solved the 

1371
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:39,504
problem of subjugation to pain and also 
the problem of most basic satisfactions 

1372
01:11:44,101 --> 01:11:45,810
and,
and that that's the case in our culture,

1373
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:48,720
we're still very much governed and 
almost entirely governed,

1374
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:52,290
I think by anxiety and incentive reward.
So

1375
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:54,703
there,
it's funny because there are secondary 

1376
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,580
reinforcers so to speak,
but they're in some,

1377
01:11:58,650 --> 01:11:59,483
in many ways,
more fundamental than the primary 

1378
01:12:00,961 --> 01:12:01,800
reinforcers.

1379
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,590
I wanted to go back and forth on for a 
second because I was thinking about this

1380
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:07,424
the other day and it,
a board of them just doesn't make sense 

1381
01:12:10,731 --> 01:12:15,731
to me except in terms of not moving 
toward some goal or rather,

1382
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,830
because I was just thinking about this,
if you're,

1383
01:12:18,831 --> 01:12:19,664
if you're,
uh,

1384
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,513
important,
boredom is essentially results from 

1385
01:12:22,611 --> 01:12:23,444
being in a,
in,

1386
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:27,620
in monotonous situation.
But if,

1387
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,980
if in that situation you,
you didn't have any,

1388
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:31,814
you didn't have any other goals,
you'd be perfectly happy just sitting 

1389
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:34,420
there.
I mean I was just thinking if,

1390
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:35,690
if I'm,
if I'm just sitting around,

1391
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:37,520
I'm sitting,
I'm sitting alone in a room,

1392
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,354
in a chair with nothing going on.
It's all only if that doesn't conflict 

1393
01:12:42,381 --> 01:12:43,214
with some other drive,
like to go get food or something more 

1394
01:12:45,051 --> 01:12:46,810
complex or,
or you know,

1395
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:50,030
I dunno,
but only if it conflicts with some other

1396
01:12:50,031 --> 01:12:51,830
drive.
Am I going to be unhappy sitting there?

1397
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,030
Am I going to feel what people refer to 
as boredom.

1398
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,610
Yeah.
Okay.

1399
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:56,443
Because otherwise if I don't,
if I don't want anything in particular 

1400
01:12:58,941 --> 01:12:59,774
at the time,
I'll be perfectly happy just sitting 

1401
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:01,340
there,
you know,

1402
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:02,174
if it doesn't conflict with some 
movement toward whatever ideal future I 

1403
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:09,320
have,
I'm going to be,

1404
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,830
I'm not going to be bored per se.
Well,

1405
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,753
yeah.

1406
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:17,520
Well here we are.
Yes,

1407
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:19,290
we do seek out novelty.
Absolutely.

1408
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:21,570
And that's partly because,
well,

1409
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,850
it ties back with what I was describing 
earlier,

1410
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:26,040
is that if you have nothing better to 
do,

1411
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,220
seeking out some more information is 
useful per se.

1412
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,790
So not only for any goal that you,
that you actually have,

1413
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,340
but for all conceivable goals that you 
could have.

1414
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:38,220
So if you're sitting around doing 
nothing,

1415
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,383
then that's worse in a sense.
Then doing something new and generating 

1416
01:13:44,131 --> 01:13:44,964
new information on there was one of the,
one of the most metal drives is simply 

1417
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:48,384
to look for novelty so that maybe you'd 
be able to take sitting around for a 

1418
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:52,230
while because I drive hasn't really 
kicked in,

1419
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:53,064
but you know,
eventually door because you need a rest 

1420
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,383
or eventually,
but eventually you get restless and 

1421
01:13:56,701 --> 01:13:58,050
you'll go cruising around even if it's 
not,

1422
01:13:58,051 --> 01:13:58,884
even if it's aimless,
even if you have nothing particularly I 

1423
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:02,020
did do just simply because of that 
drive.

1424
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,590
Is there just to cause trouble leaving 
often?

1425
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:07,783
Yeah.
Okay.

1426
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:08,670
Yeah.
It's to produce,

1427
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:10,680
well actually it's to produce new 
information,

1428
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:12,100
I guess you could say.
That would be the,

1429
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:14,050
that's kind of the,
the final,

1430
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,810
that's the final explanation.
So you will feed on information,

1431
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:21,970
right?
Just like food.

1432
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,850
So it's not so much a question of not 
being bored is how long you can,

1433
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:28,060
you can wait before you get bored 
because you will necessarily,

1434
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,730
and there seems to be individual 
differences in that too.

1435
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:35,270
But novelty,
novelty is very motivating and uh,

1436
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,330
well it's also,
it's also anxiety provoking,

1437
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,500
so.
Okay.

1438
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,860
Are there other issues or,
yeah,

1439
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:45,230
if I had,
if I asked you what was the ideal future

1440
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:46,183
in the middle of the last century,
you might have said that the ideal 

1441
01:14:49,131 --> 01:14:52,820
future at the cultural level,
one that was that uh,

1442
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,090
the trunk of the tree,
the all encompassing,

1443
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:00,670
the ideal future of that story.
The answer might have been that it would

1444
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:05,390
have been identification with Christ
or else it would have been

1445
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,000
getting to the new Jerusalem.
Both of them seem,

1446
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:16,410
and the first one is
the identification with Christ is the,

1447
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,583
the ideal as the way and the new 
Jerusalem would be a ideal as a static 

1448
01:15:25,371 --> 01:15:26,240
state,
which may,

1449
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,640
which may be prolonged over time.
And I came across,

1450
01:15:31,700 --> 01:15:33,410
I came onto this cause I was wondering 
what,

1451
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:34,244
what,
what's the implications for the ideal 

1452
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:36,464
future if you throw away the five 
unconditioned stimuli as the 

1453
01:15:39,981 --> 01:15:43,070
unconditioned stimuli,
because the new Jerusalem is the,

1454
01:15:43,071 --> 01:15:44,960
is the five unconditioned stimuli

1455
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:48,040
optimally dealt with,
always

1456
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:49,660
taken care of.
Whereas the,

1457
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:52,210
uh,
the Christ is,

1458
01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:54,700
well that's a different one.
That's,

1459
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,850
that's a more sophisticated ideal 
future.

1460
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:03,750
So
what is the ideal future then,

1461
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:06,590
are there to decide?

1462
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,830
Well,
I mean it's,

1463
01:16:08,870 --> 01:16:11,900
it's still a reasonable way of 
conceptualizing things mean you can look

1464
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,940
at it from a,
within the system perspective,

1465
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:14,893
because there's a anthropological terms 
for this that I always forget and make 

1466
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:18,314
an EP ethic.
One means or within the system 

1467
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:21,254
perspective.
And the other means that between the 

1468
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:26,090
system perspective and a
well,

1469
01:16:26,091 --> 01:16:26,924
so that you can construe your ideals 
either from within the confines of a 

1470
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:30,824
particular story,
if you accept the story or you can 

1471
01:16:32,361 --> 01:16:33,194
construe it in terms of always being 
able to update the story if necessary 

1472
01:16:35,661 --> 01:16:36,340
with the story.

1473
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,730
This identification with Christ as the 
ideal future.

1474
01:16:38,731 --> 01:16:40,770
It doesn't,
is not surrounded by chaos.

1475
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,361
No,
no,

1476
01:16:42,361 --> 01:16:43,370
no.
That's not exactly,

1477
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,430
well,
yeah,

1478
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,433
that's a complicated issue.
It's surrounded by belief in the 

1479
01:16:47,451 --> 01:16:50,660
capacity to deal with chaos.
If it arises in a sense that's what gets

1480
01:16:50,661 --> 01:16:51,494
rid of it,
or at least gets rid of the negative 

1481
01:16:52,791 --> 01:16:56,750
aspect of it so it doesn't eliminate it 
permanently.

1482
01:16:56,751 --> 01:17:00,080
It just transforms it in a sense into 
something that can always be dealt with.

1483
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,830
It's internal,
so if you draw,

1484
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:04,683
if you the story,
if you construct the story with 

1485
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:10,160
identification with Christ as the ideal 
of future and you put a circle around

1486
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,840
it,
chaos is inside the circle.

1487
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,151
Yeah.
Okay.

1488
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,800
I see what you mean.
Yeah,

1489
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,431
well that,
okay,

1490
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:17,280
that's a good point,
Dan.

1491
01:17:17,281 --> 01:17:17,631
Danielle.
Well,

1492
01:17:17,631 --> 01:17:19,510
that has to do with the,
well,

1493
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:22,890
that has to do with put that whole 
scheme that if you were,

1494
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:25,500
if you can taste this as your model,
what's your take Christ Cynthia,

1495
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,980
ideal future.
Then that would put that,

1496
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:30,970
that whole diagram in yet another 
diagram.

1497
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:32,453
Okay.
Yes,

1498
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:33,520
yes.
Okay.

1499
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:34,460
Hey,
yes.

1500
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,510
Okay.
Hang on a second.

1501
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:37,303
First of all with regards to board of 
which we talked about earlier is the 

1502
01:17:40,521 --> 01:17:42,380
thing is,
is that we know that that,

1503
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:43,683
that the problem with a perfect static 
state is that there's no novelty and 

1504
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:49,820
that's a problem because all the 
incentive reward disappears.

1505
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:50,983
But if you want novelty,
then you will then you necessarily take 

1506
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:55,370
anxiety.
So you could say,

1507
01:17:55,371 --> 01:17:56,690
okay,
so that's part of the argument.

1508
01:17:56,691 --> 01:17:57,524
Then the other idea here is in part how 
do you deal in the final analysis with 

1509
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:03,800
the fact that there are normalist events
too,

1510
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:06,230
which you can't adapt like death.
Well,

1511
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:07,190
the,
the,

1512
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:11,930
the point that you're driving out in 
park is that if you got,

1513
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:13,143
if you think about

1514
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:15,893
the

1515
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,500
one way of looking at the ideal future 
is it's a place where there is no chaos,

1516
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:25,900
which is,
that means it's permanently eliminated.

1517
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:27,970
Okay.
Everything's predictable.

1518
01:18:27,971 --> 01:18:30,460
Everything is random,
unpredictable and theoretically perfect.

1519
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:32,680
The other way of looking at it just to 
say,

1520
01:18:32,681 --> 01:18:33,514
well no,
because that wouldn't be perfect for 

1521
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:36,550
there.
For things to be perfect,

1522
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:40,480
there has to be some chaos.
So on the chaos might be the type,

1523
01:18:40,481 --> 01:18:44,560
for example of this,
of the anomalies that we can't solve.

1524
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,573
So then the ideal type of adaptation 
would be the construction of a mode of 

1525
01:18:50,141 --> 01:18:53,950
being in which the fact that there are 
permanent anomalies,

1526
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:57,520
even a very terrifying sort of makes 
sense and is acceptable.

1527
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,250
So hope so.
And that's again,

1528
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:01,084
that's kind of,
that's part of what we want to drive 

1529
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:05,980
that in this course.
I mean people find with regards to being

1530
01:19:05,981 --> 01:19:06,814
twisted,
people find the fact that very unfair 

1531
01:19:09,401 --> 01:19:10,234
and threatening and hurtful things 
constantly happen and that turns them 

1532
01:19:12,551 --> 01:19:17,110
against life because they think,
well there can be no possible story,

1533
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:18,333
there can be no possible justification 
in which that category of events can 

1534
01:19:21,941 --> 01:19:22,774
attain an acceptable determinant.
Meaning therefore life is cruel and 

1535
01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:27,663
unreal and unreasonable in its intrinsic
aspects and deserves spot under those 

1536
01:19:31,871 --> 01:19:33,640
conditions.
I can take revenge against it,

1537
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:34,773
which I think is what,
that's a non simplistic explanation for 

1538
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,600
anti social behavior.
Because as psychologists,

1539
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,220
we tend to think about these social 
people,

1540
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:44,290
they like novelty and they like to break
rules,

1541
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:45,124
but we never really get at the fact that
they're like very hostile and very 

1542
01:19:47,801 --> 01:19:50,440
revengeful and they like hurting other 
people and so on.

1543
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:53,680
Because we don't know how to understand 
that category of emotions say

1544
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,003
to,
to start that sort of thing from 

1545
01:19:57,031 --> 01:19:59,010
happening.
You need a story that says,

1546
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:00,151
well,
yeah,

1547
01:20:00,151 --> 01:20:00,984
unreasonable things always happen,
but in some sense they're absolutely 

1548
01:20:04,831 --> 01:20:05,664
necessary.
And what a story that's believable so 

1549
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:11,280
that their effect of valence has 
shifted.

1550
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,533
So we'll talk about,
there's this section later in this 

1551
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:14,964
manuscript that talks about I then 
there's a section in the grand 

1552
01:20:17,731 --> 01:20:20,700
inquisitor or in the brothers Karamazov 
Ivan,

1553
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:21,773
who's an atheist,
is talking to his younger brother 

1554
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:24,680
Alicia,
who wants to be,

1555
01:20:24,681 --> 01:20:25,750
uh,
uh,

1556
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,480
who's st like it wants to be a priest 
and Ivan as a committed atheist.

1557
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:31,314
And he says,
he tells a bunch of stories about 

1558
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,960
torture of children in,
in Russia at the turn of the century.

1559
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,230
He says,
I'm world,

1560
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,210
like there can be no god in the world 
like this.

1561
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:42,000
And basically what he's saying is that 
if you look around you,

1562
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:42,834
the valence of things is such to 
demonstrate unequivocally that things 

1563
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:48,090
are meaningless in the final analysis.

1564
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,343
And,
uh,

1565
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,980
some people regard that that particular 
section of the brothers Karamazov is the

1566
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:56,970
most potent argument for atheism that's 
ever been constructed.

1567
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,343
And well,
that's the kind of argument that you 

1568
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:02,850
have to address if you want to deal with
phenomena that twist people up.

1569
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,273
You know,
if you beat someone and torture them 

1570
01:21:05,371 --> 01:21:07,680
when they're a child,
it's not that surprising that they might

1571
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,514
turn against the world in regard to that
something that should be obliterated so 

1572
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:12,710
that,
that,

1573
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:13,543
that might be the moral thing to do.
So you need a story that can address 

1574
01:21:15,781 --> 01:21:17,280
those sorts of possibilities.

1575
01:21:17,690 --> 01:21:18,523
So are you,
would it be fair then to say the pure 

1576
01:21:20,661 --> 01:21:24,380
asking us to,
to modify our current state,

1577
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,790
our current view of the world,
um,

1578
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:32,200
from one where we will do absolutely 
anything to avoid chaos into some,

1579
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:35,660
into one where we posit an ideal future 
which has,

1580
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:38,450
right.
We'll do as the anything to avoid

1581
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:42,110
as a necessary constituent element of it
and can hopefully,

1582
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:46,490
and hopefully also that you will come to
understand from the rational perspective

1583
01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:47,443
why the existence of that is a 
precondition for the fact that there is 

1584
01:21:50,031 --> 01:21:51,680
existence.
Because that's the,

1585
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,053
that's another thing that these 
mythological stories are very good at 

1586
01:21:54,891 --> 01:21:55,724
outlining.
They say the cosmos is actually 

1587
01:21:57,321 --> 01:22:00,590
constructed of the division between 
chaos and order.

1588
01:22:00,740 --> 01:22:01,573
If you obliterate that dividing line,
then everything returns to this 

1589
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:07,940
hypothetical state of no one being in 
which there is no pain,

1590
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,370
but there's nothing,
there's nothing.

1591
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,120
So then the question is,
is the fact that there is something,

1592
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:19,870
despite all its negative motivation will
implications preferable to nothing?

1593
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:21,620
Of course.
That's the,

1594
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:22,663
I think it was Khumbu didn't come who 
say that the only question worth 

1595
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:26,540
considering is whether or not to commit 
suicide?

1596
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:29,840
Well that's the question.
That's the same question is,

1597
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,793
is life in with its intrinsic 
limitations preferable to a state where 

1598
01:22:34,521 --> 01:22:36,350
there's nothing.
Well that's,

1599
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,110
that is the bottom line.
That's the bottom line question.

1600
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:43,650
So I'd like to address this because I've
been listening for the past hour or two.

1601
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,090
It seems like a lot,
many attempts to,

1602
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:48,943
to reconcile an ideal future would just 
like a utopia perfect society or on Fox 

1603
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,340
and static sense.
If I just sit in the chair,

1604
01:22:57,370 --> 01:22:59,840
when will I get bored with an ideal 
life,

1605
01:23:00,170 --> 01:23:03,530
which is identification process or 
identification with Christ,

1606
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:05,920
which is not the same thing as ideal 
society.

1607
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,063
Right.
And somehow that those are not the same 

1608
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:10,170
thing.
Right.

1609
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,013
But that's what I hear people trying to 
do is to make an ideal society the same 

1610
01:23:15,221 --> 01:23:16,110
thing as an ideal life.

1611
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:18,870
Well,
people constantly confuse the state with

1612
01:23:18,871 --> 01:23:21,330
the process.
But this is also true as we'll see with,

1613
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:26,750
with regards to conceptualizations of 
evil because people presume that evil is

1614
01:23:27,421 --> 01:23:28,254
a state rather than a process.
And the state might be aggression or 

1615
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,173
cruelty or jealousy or you know,
we can list a whole bunch of 

1616
01:23:35,701 --> 01:23:39,870
motivational states that people tend to 
value negatively.

1617
01:23:39,871 --> 01:23:40,704
So I say,
well,

1618
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,170
you know,
uh,

1619
01:23:42,270 --> 01:23:43,103
people fight,
people produce social conflict because 

1620
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:47,394
they're aggressive and therefore if we 
can socialize boys in particular to not 

1621
01:23:51,541 --> 01:23:54,930
be aggressive,
then the capacity for war we'll vantage,

1622
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,780
which I think is like truly an idiotic 
theory.

1623
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:02,100
But that's what happens when you confuse
the process of evil with,

1624
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,490
with,
with uh,

1625
01:24:03,870 --> 01:24:05,820
what you make an idol of evil 
fundamental.

1626
01:24:05,821 --> 01:24:06,301
And we say,
well,

1627
01:24:06,301 --> 01:24:09,480
it can be identified as this set of 
phenomena,

1628
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,400
which basically turns it into an idol.

1629
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,580
Well,
it's just as bad.

1630
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:17,890
It's just as significant a philosophical
error as doing the same thing to good.

1631
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:19,650
And the reverse saying,
well,

1632
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:20,723
uh,
pieces good or happiness is good or 

1633
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,630
contentment is good.
It was,

1634
01:24:24,631 --> 01:24:27,840
those are all context dependent 
evaluations.

1635
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:30,450
Sometimes happiness is very bad so to 
speak.

1636
01:24:30,451 --> 01:24:33,000
Like if you're experiencing it well,
uh,

1637
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:36,450
torturing someone else for example,
which is certainly a possibility.

1638
01:24:36,810 --> 01:24:37,643
So what we'll come to at the end of the 
lectures is a Mrs Taletha had slightly 

1639
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:44,880
as a conceptualization,
well if,

1640
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,950
if the conceptualization of good is the 
capacity to admit to the existence of an

1641
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:53,730
anomaly when it manifests itself and 
then to act accordingly,

1642
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:56,460
then evil is the precise opposite of 
that,

1643
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:57,294
which is not aggression or hostility or 
jealousy or anything that people 

1644
01:25:00,781 --> 01:25:01,614
normally sort of label evil but,
but the process of refusing to admit 

1645
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,410
that something has changed.
So and you can say,

1646
01:25:10,411 --> 01:25:11,244
well that leads to aggression in 
situations where it might not be 

1647
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:15,360
desirable,
it leads to hostility and so fine,

1648
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,140
but it's still a process,
not a,

1649
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:21,150
not a state.
So question

1650
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,400
to the limitations,
but actually not

1651
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:44,780
concerning it
and still have something attractive.

1652
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,630
That's why they like you see this in 
American movies very,

1653
01:25:48,631 --> 01:25:50,700
very often.
It's like the anti hero,

1654
01:25:50,701 --> 01:25:53,280
the gangster for example,
is actually viewed as a hero.

1655
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:56,220
Although his,
his paths of action produce well,

1656
01:25:56,221 --> 01:25:58,290
disruption and chaos,
there's still something very,

1657
01:25:58,291 --> 01:26:01,310
very attractive about that.
So that's,

1658
01:26:01,340 --> 01:26:04,240
that's one example of that as a,
Yup.

1659
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:05,563
It's also the case that the agent that 
produces the disruption of this system 

1660
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,120
can be viewed as something positive from
this perspective,

1661
01:26:14,360 --> 01:26:17,030
but as something entirely negative from 
within here,

1662
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,650
which is part of the reason you know,
you know,

1663
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,800
people don't like geniuses very much.
For example in science,

1664
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:22,160
no,
there,

1665
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:22,993
there,
there's a lot of resistance to truly 

1666
01:26:24,861 --> 01:26:28,520
novel theoretical formulations to truly 
creative activity.

1667
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,653
Well that we all presume like if we're 
evaluating how those in the past 

1668
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:35,624
responded to creative genius,
say like the Catholic priesthood 

1669
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:38,864
responding to Galileo,
we always make the presumption that we 

1670
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,014
would have been on Galileo side had we 
been there because viewing the past we 

1671
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:46,150
can take sort of a,
uh,

1672
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,750
a higher order view point.

1673
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,583
But the point is,
is that for the Catholic priests who 

1674
01:26:50,451 --> 01:26:53,030
were stuck in this story,
Galileo's discovery was the,

1675
01:26:53,031 --> 01:26:56,780
normally at the highest order,
it had catastrophic consequences.

1676
01:26:56,990 --> 01:26:57,823
I think that's improper primarily 
because they actually misunderstood the 

1677
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:03,410
import of the,
of the information.

1678
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:04,303
But still from in here,
Galileo looked like an agent of the 

1679
01:27:07,101 --> 01:27:08,390
devil.
Now we would say,

1680
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:09,110
well,
no,

1681
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,943
in actuality he was providing the kind 
of anomalous information that leads to 

1682
01:27:15,321 --> 01:27:16,800
this.
But you know,

1683
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,110
I think at least in part thinking,
oh,

1684
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:20,944
this is that the excesses of the Soviet 
Union could be regarded as the 

1685
01:27:25,451 --> 01:27:26,284
inevitable historical consequence of the
process that Galileo set into motion 

1686
01:27:30,670 --> 01:27:33,970
because the Russians lost their Orthodox
Christianity around,

1687
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:35,003
you know,
in the late 18 hundreds that laid them 

1688
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:41,320
wide open for an invasion of,
for the invasion of rationalistic utopia

1689
01:27:41,321 --> 01:27:44,410
notions and,
and the death of the consequent death of

1690
01:27:44,411 --> 01:27:47,650
66 million people.
And it wasn't as if the Catholic priests

1691
01:27:47,651 --> 01:27:48,484
were entirely wrong.
What Galileo had to say was dangerous 

1692
01:27:52,150 --> 01:27:52,600
in,
in the,

1693
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,433
in the highest order has taken.
It's how long since Galileo made his 

1694
01:27:57,401 --> 01:28:00,610
discovered 300 years,
something like that.

1695
01:28:00,611 --> 01:28:05,440
Does anybody know anyways?
400 years I can say.

1696
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

1697
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:10,153
Well,
we all think that was just perfectly 

1698
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,330
positive and understandably so.
I mean,

1699
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:17,110
it's sad.
It's sad that the real danger.

1700
01:28:23,770 --> 01:28:24,260
Wow.

1701
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,041
Yeah.
But you know,

1702
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:29,060
it's more complex than that because the 
Catholic priesthood and religious people

1703
01:28:29,061 --> 01:28:29,894
in general ever since then have not been
able to figure out what to do with 

1704
01:28:32,601 --> 01:28:33,434
Galileo was information.
The perceived motivational significance 

1705
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:39,740
was this is a death blow to everything 
that we believe in,

1706
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,830
and this is not trivial because as 
Nietzsche points out,

1707
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,520
clearly in Western society,
at least our morality,

1708
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,760
which is our behavior,
has Judeo Christian roots,

1709
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:52,400
has a Judeo Christian trunk,
so to speak.

1710
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,353
If you chop off the trunk,
then the rationale for the morality 

1711
01:28:55,971 --> 01:28:56,804
disappears.
Now you might not know that and you 

1712
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:00,440
might not accept it at a cognitive 
level,

1713
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,340
but that doesn't stop it from being 
true.

1714
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:04,250
Now,
I would say that the,

1715
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:05,473
the religious of Galileo's time in the 
modern times for that matter 

1716
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:13,740
misconstrued the motivational 
significance of Galileo's discovery.

1717
01:29:14,220 --> 01:29:15,053
I mean,
because they were under the presumption 

1718
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,484
that they're religious theories of the 
nature of the universe described the 

1719
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:24,420
same universe that Galileo is 
describing.

1720
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:26,610
I don't think that's true.
The religious stories,

1721
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:27,444
we're trying to describe how the world 
was constructed with regards to its 

1722
01:29:31,531 --> 01:29:35,070
implications for action,
which is absolutely vital.

1723
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,053
You have to know that whereas Galileo 
was doing something related but 

1724
01:29:39,181 --> 01:29:42,150
different.
So there they are conflict,

1725
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:46,710
a death conflict.
Definitely conflict was seeing where one

1726
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:47,544
did not actually exist in sense,
but they could scarcely avoided since 

1727
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:53,940
the tumor had been combined right before
previously.

1728
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,470
Right?
Absolutely.

1729
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:56,723
It was inevitable.
There wasn't any need to separate 

1730
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:01,140
before.
No and no methodology for doing so.

1731
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:02,753
So it's not surprising,
but it's worthwhile to consider that 

1732
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:07,164
some of the intelligence was in fact on 
the side of the Catholic priesthood in 

1733
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:12,870
which is something we tend not to think 
about.

1734
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,600
I mean they were at least for all of 
their flaws,

1735
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,880
which are the flaws of any organized 
system.

1736
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:21,240
They're on the side of a certain amount 
of stability,

1737
01:30:21,241 --> 01:30:22,074
which is also necessary.
So you can say what you want about the 

1738
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:25,884
kind of stability that they provided.
But the thing is stability always comes 

1739
01:30:29,371 --> 01:30:30,690
at a cost,
always,

1740
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:32,820
always.
So,

1741
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,590
okay.
Um,

1742
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:40,200
I want to show you a couple of things.
This is like,

1743
01:30:40,201 --> 01:30:41,034
I would rather have the class go like 
this actually then for me just to 

1744
01:30:44,521 --> 01:30:48,780
outline during the lectures what you're 
going to be reading anyways.

1745
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,943
So we,
I would rather use this as a forum for 

1746
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:52,524
discussion of the issues that the 
reading brings up that would make it a 

1747
01:30:55,430 --> 01:31:00,040
much more participatory enterprise.
So I got,

1748
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,180
what I would hope is that,
you know,

1749
01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:03,053
we could as a group get immersed in the 
material that we'll be discussing and 

1750
01:31:07,621 --> 01:31:12,621
hack away at it critically in,
during the course of these classes.

1751
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:14,543
I just want to end with a very brief 
summary of what I was going to discuss 

1752
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:19,194
in part today.
I think it looks to me like your brain 

1753
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:26,871
is organized to react to the universe as
if it's constructed of three things.

1754
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,050
And these are things that constantly are
described in mythological stories of the

1755
01:31:31,051 --> 01:31:31,884
nature of the world.
And one of the things is the territory 

1756
01:31:33,931 --> 01:31:38,700
that you have explored and the other is 
the territory that you haven't explored.

1757
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:42,570
And the third is the process of 
exploration itself.

1758
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,320
And those,
those,

1759
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:46,830
those three things you can regard as 
environmental constants,

1760
01:31:47,250 --> 01:31:49,560
they're always there.
As long as there's been human beings,

1761
01:31:49,561 --> 01:31:51,060
those three things have always been 
there.

1762
01:31:51,061 --> 01:31:53,940
And as far as we can tell,
as long as they're human beings,

1763
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:56,370
those three things will continue to be 
there.

1764
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,533
That's right.
Cause there's always things that you've 

1765
01:31:58,201 --> 01:31:59,034
mapped and things that you haven't,
and there's always the process of doing 

1766
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:02,614
the mapping.
That's the world from the mythological 

1767
01:32:05,081 --> 01:32:05,914
perspective.
And it appears to me also from the 

1768
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:09,530
neuropsychological perspective.
Um,

1769
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:10,503
I want to show you a picture,
say from the neuropsychological 

1770
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:14,314
perspective,
you could construe us as specialized 

1771
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,614
primarily for exploration and for the 
communication of the things of the 

1772
01:32:24,131 --> 01:32:26,890
knowledge that we've generated as a 
consequence of exploration.

1773
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:27,993
And to buttress this,
I want to show you some diagrams of the 

1774
01:32:30,221 --> 01:32:32,230
representation of the body and the 
brain.

1775
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,240
Nope.
Okay.

1776
01:32:38,970 --> 01:32:39,990
Here,
that's,

1777
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,360
let me just show you where it is first.

1778
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,373
Okay.

1779
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,630
This is the motor unit of your brain and
this is the sensory unit,

1780
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:55,540
how the motor units is about half of 
your brain.

1781
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:59,320
And it's also the part that we haven't 
been able to figure out what does,

1782
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,860
we haven't been able to figure out what 
it does very well.

1783
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:04,183
Um,
lesions in this part of your brain 

1784
01:33:06,101 --> 01:33:09,340
produce snow decrements in static Iq 
has,

1785
01:33:09,341 --> 01:33:10,174
you will know if you read that paper by 
Joan Dunkin that's in the collection of 

1786
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:13,624
papers for a long time.
People weren't sure what this part of 

1787
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:15,994
the brain does anyways.
What it does is sequence abstractly 

1788
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:22,600
sequence motor activity at least in part
that's a big part of its role.

1789
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:23,553
This is the motor strip right there and 
damage to that part of the brain 

1790
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,630
interferes with your ability to actually
move your body and you could.

1791
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:29,763
This part which is the prefrontal cortex
grew out of the motor strip during 

1792
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:36,010
evolution and that provides a clue to 
its essential function.

1793
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,950
As evolution progressed in that part of 
the brain gain in size,

1794
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,650
which you did in a tremendous to a 
tremendous degree,

1795
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:42,870
much more,
he was,

1796
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,500
by the way,
than any other form of animal.

1797
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,573
We became able to abstractly act and 
abstract action is very useful because 

1798
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:50,224
if you can act abstractly,
you can think your way out if novel 

1799
01:33:52,451 --> 01:33:54,850
situations without actually having to 
put yourself in them.

1800
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:58,480
And obviously that's useful because then
you can get the damn information without

1801
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,610
getting killed.
And you can also,

1802
01:34:00,790 --> 01:34:02,980
you can also watch other people for 
example,

1803
01:34:02,981 --> 01:34:05,860
and imitate them,
which means you can get their behavioral

1804
01:34:05,861 --> 01:34:06,694
wisdom without,
without actually having to go through 

1805
01:34:08,411 --> 01:34:11,120
all the aggravation of learning what it 
was that they are encountering,

1806
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:12,260
what it was they had to.
Well,

1807
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:16,090
they were formulating those patterns of 
motor behavior anyways

1808
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:24,290
were specialized for exploration and uh,
well let's take a look at that.

1809
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:29,970
This is how your body is represented in 
the motor and the sensory cortex.

1810
01:34:29,971 --> 01:34:31,740
I want you,
it's pretty similar really,

1811
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:34,410
but I want you to pay most attention to 
the motor cortex.

1812
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,273
All right?
It's quite interesting because this is 

1813
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,113
how what your brain thinks of your body 
in a sense from the perspective of you 

1814
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:45,720
being a thing that can do things.
All right,

1815
01:34:45,721 --> 01:34:47,700
and as you'd suspect,
well,

1816
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,070
what's a human being?
Well,

1817
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,050
first of all,
we're all thumbs.

1818
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:55,410
I look at that.
I mean the thumb is bigger than the rest

1819
01:34:55,411 --> 01:34:58,790
of the body by a substantial well,
thumb and ham.

1820
01:34:58,791 --> 01:34:59,960
They,
that's the,

1821
01:35:00,350 --> 01:35:02,780
that's what we are.
And also Tom,

1822
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:06,140
that's the tongue there and face.
Well that's what we're like.

1823
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:06,974
All right.
Let me show you kind of have a better 

1824
01:35:09,831 --> 01:35:11,180
representation of this.

1825
01:35:11,650 --> 01:35:16,650
Um,
oh,

1826
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,400
there is,
this is,

1827
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:26,060
this isn't quite right does this is the 
sensory homonculus but you still get the

1828
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:27,230
basic idea.
Okay.

1829
01:35:27,231 --> 01:35:31,250
That's now the motor homunculus is even 
more exaggerated than this,

1830
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:32,084
which is to say that the motor 
representation throws even more weight 

1831
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:37,124
on the hands and the face.
Well that's our capacity to pick things 

1832
01:35:41,301 --> 01:35:43,670
apart and put them back together to 
manipulate the world.

1833
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:47,000
And this is our capacity essentially to 
communicate.

1834
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:49,850
You can't see the tongue representation 
in here,

1835
01:35:49,851 --> 01:35:50,684
but
we're creatures who are specialized to 

1836
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:58,400
encounter things that we don't 
understand and to make of them something

1837
01:35:58,401 --> 01:35:59,234
that we want,
which is not the same as exploring them 

1838
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:03,560
by the way.
Precisely that we have another kind of a

1839
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:05,590
cockeyed notion about what expiration 
means.

1840
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:08,060
We tend to think that when we explore 
something unknown,

1841
01:36:08,061 --> 01:36:08,894
we discover its properties.
But that's a strange notion because 

1842
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:12,734
usually what we're trying to do when we 
explore something is not so much 

1843
01:36:14,721 --> 01:36:16,970
discovered the sensory properties of 
something,

1844
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:20,360
but to turn something that has 
indeterminant significance,

1845
01:36:20,361 --> 01:36:23,510
which means it could be threatening or 
promising into something that we can,

1846
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:25,970
that we can either ignore or use.

1847
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:27,313
And well,
you'll have to think through that 

1848
01:36:29,181 --> 01:36:32,090
argument I guess on your own because we 
don't have enough time to discuss it.

1849
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:32,924
But the point is,
is that the universe that we inhabit is 

1850
01:36:35,241 --> 01:36:36,074
not entirely given.
It's also something that we erect as a 

1851
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:41,510
consequence of our actions.
And there's um,

1852
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,453
yeah,

1853
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:49,010
which is to say that it's the process.
It's the process of exploration,

1854
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,353
which is in large part linguistically 
mediated that brings into being the 

1855
01:36:54,171 --> 01:36:57,920
world that we regard as familiar and the
world that we inhabit.

1856
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,780
And that's why,
for example,

1857
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:01,670
in,
well,

1858
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:03,740
I can tell you for example,
in the Sumerian,

1859
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,060
most primordial of Sumerian creation 
myths,

1860
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:10,093
there's a god goddess sort of of 
indeterminate sexuality that represents 

1861
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:17,600
chaos,
who's divided into the male sky.

1862
01:37:17,601 --> 01:37:20,690
And the female earth and who is 
separated.

1863
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:23,810
These two daddies are separated by the 
god of the atmosphere.

1864
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:25,310
So you could say,
well again,

1865
01:37:25,311 --> 01:37:26,144
from the Sumerian perspective,
the universe is composed of the 

1866
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:30,043
primordial chaos,
then a masculine principle that in this 

1867
01:37:33,501 --> 01:37:34,334
mythology is represented by this guy and
a feminine principle that's represented 

1868
01:37:36,651 --> 01:37:37,484
by the earth and the process that 
separates them or distinguishes between 

1869
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:42,260
them.
And that's the god of the atmosphere.

1870
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:43,520
And that's,
that's a,

1871
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,520
that's a wholly triad,
basically father,

1872
01:37:49,521 --> 01:37:51,860
mother and divine son.
In Christianity,

1873
01:37:51,861 --> 01:37:52,694
there's the doctrine of the logos,
which is the word and the word is the 

1874
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:58,990
thing that in gendered creation and the,
the,

1875
01:37:59,080 --> 01:37:59,913
the derivation of the logos,
while the idea of the logo schools all 

1876
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:03,444
the way back through Egyptian society 
into Mesopotamian society and reflects 

1877
01:38:07,291 --> 01:38:11,520
people's intuition that there was some 
integral relationship between the nature

1878
01:38:11,521 --> 01:38:16,521
of the world as we inhabited and the 
process that generates that world in the

1879
01:38:16,621 --> 01:38:17,454
context of exploration.
So the myths say the capacity for 

1880
01:38:20,521 --> 01:38:25,380
exploration is a function of that which 
already existed.

1881
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:29,190
And simultaneously the thing that brings
both chaos in order into being,

1882
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,113
so it's both,
it's the offspring of chaos and order 

1883
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,473
and the thing that creates them that 
we're not used to thinking in causal 

1884
01:38:35,941 --> 01:38:37,260
loops like that.
But well,

1885
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:39,690
mythology could care less whether you 
can understand it.

1886
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:44,310
That's basically the bottom line.
It's just a representation of in a sense

1887
01:38:44,311 --> 01:38:46,260
of the way that things are.
So,

1888
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:50,010
uh,
that x except even more exaggerated.

1889
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:52,260
That's what we are from the perspective 
of our brain.

1890
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:52,861
And you say,
well,

1891
01:38:52,861 --> 01:38:54,720
this might you think this might be a 
trivial,

1892
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:56,940
uh,
a trivial statement.

1893
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:58,920
For example,
you know,

1894
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,020
I just picked the motor strip in the 
sensory stuff.

1895
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:01,854
That's not a very big part of the brain,
but you have to realize that the 

1896
01:39:04,711 --> 01:39:05,544
prefrontal cortex is the thing that 
provides abstract programming for the 

1897
01:39:09,241 --> 01:39:10,074
motor strip.
So the prefrontal cortex is concerned 

1898
01:39:11,671 --> 01:39:12,504
with the programming of movement and the
sensory cortex well is mostly taken up 

1899
01:39:16,351 --> 01:39:17,490
by the visual system.

1900
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,410
So this is,
this is a good picture of who we are.

1901
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:23,483
And I want to extend that argument by 
pointing out that people have made much 

1902
01:39:27,361 --> 01:39:30,030
of the supposed intelligence of dolphins
and whales.

1903
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:31,530
And the reason they'd done this is 
because,

1904
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:35,160
well,
your intelligence is dependent on part,

1905
01:39:35,161 --> 01:39:38,700
on the area of the gray matter of your 
cortex.

1906
01:39:38,701 --> 01:39:40,620
And we have about a meter of gray 
matter.

1907
01:39:40,621 --> 01:39:43,440
If you spread it out on you,
spread it out in a sheet,

1908
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:45,720
um,
the more gray matter,

1909
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:46,573
the more intelligence roughly or new,
or you could say the ratio of brain 

1910
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:51,060
tissue to bodyweight.
That's the encephalization.

1911
01:39:51,061 --> 01:39:55,200
Quotion is a rough estimate of animal 
intelligence and dolphins have very high

1912
01:39:55,201 --> 01:39:59,070
encephalization factors and tremendously
convoluted cortex,

1913
01:39:59,071 --> 01:40:00,120
isn't it?
So people think,

1914
01:40:00,121 --> 01:40:01,650
well,
they're extraordinarily intelligent,

1915
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:02,484
but this,
this is simplistic thinking as far as 

1916
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:07,170
I'm concerned.
Unless dolphins are doing something that

1917
01:40:07,171 --> 01:40:09,780
we just can absolutely have no 
conception of,

1918
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:11,220
they don't have hands.

1919
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,563
And that's a,
that's a nontrivial difference because 

1920
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:16,710
it's the hand that makes us in large 
part who we are,

1921
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:18,870
its primary exploratory tool,
right?

1922
01:40:18,871 --> 01:40:21,780
It's the thing by which we construct the
worlds that we live in.

1923
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:24,090
And I don't mean this in the 
mythological sense.

1924
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:24,924
I mean it just makes us able to build 
tables and houses and so on and to 

1925
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:29,940
modify to modify the environment to 
suit,

1926
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:31,073
to suit us and dolphins,
whatever else you might want to say 

1927
01:40:33,631 --> 01:40:35,070
about them.
They don't do that.

1928
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:36,053
And that's a non trivial difference and 
it's the difference is immense and all 

1929
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:39,984
you have to think about it for a few 
minutes to to realize that well the 

1930
01:40:42,811 --> 01:40:44,430
snake,
does anybody have any idea what the hell

1931
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:45,264
they're doing when all that brand?
Not a lot that they can the same very 

1932
01:40:49,111 --> 01:40:53,350
complex songs and they also seem to use 
some of,

1933
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,940
well I don't know how that's how that's 
attached to the intelligence.

1934
01:40:58,030 --> 01:41:03,030
No is the answer as far as I can tell.
So they are very intelligent.

1935
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:04,143
There's no doubt about that.
You can teach dolphins to do lots of 

1936
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:06,640
things,
but you have to,

1937
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,690
you have to realize that your brain is 
not a disembodied spirit.

1938
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:13,690
I mean it's integrity attached to your 
body.

1939
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:14,703
In fact,
you might even regarded as part of your 

1940
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:19,180
body.
By the same token,

1941
01:41:19,181 --> 01:41:23,590
your body is the environment to which 
your brain has adapted and vice versa.

1942
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,850
And the fact of the structure of your 
body is,

1943
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,620
is very relevant to how your brain 
functions.

1944
01:41:29,621 --> 01:41:30,454
And it's obvious that a dolphin and 
human being are very different in terms 

1945
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:33,994
of morphological structure.
It's not like they just have two brains 

1946
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:37,024
that are the same,
that could easily be transposed at the 

1947
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:40,690
structural level.
The,

1948
01:41:41,110 --> 01:41:43,240
the organs are much,
much different.

1949
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:44,613
So we're specialized to tear,
tear things apart and put them together 

1950
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,570
and to tell other people what we've 
done.

1951
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:50,643
That's what we're like say,
say well that's the process of 

1952
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:54,610
exploration and that's the thing.
Well,

1953
01:41:54,611 --> 01:41:55,444
in a sense that's also the thing that 
mythology tells us that we should be 

1954
01:41:57,731 --> 01:42:00,730
doing at least when it's necessary.
Now the other,

1955
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:02,710
there's another reason why I brought 
this up.

1956
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:07,711
And that's because art of the part of 
the question that sort of underlies this

1957
01:42:08,111 --> 01:42:08,944
course is,
is it possible to come up with a 

1958
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:12,310
definition of what constitutes the good 
life,

1959
01:42:12,311 --> 01:42:16,030
that source of stable across different 
cultural presuppositions?

1960
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:16,864
And,
but one of the things that's quite 

1961
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:18,634
interesting as you know,
is that novel phenomenon are cues for 

1962
01:42:22,091 --> 01:42:22,924
satisfactions,
which makes them incentive rewards and 

1963
01:42:25,661 --> 01:42:30,400
incentive rewards make us feel as good 
as we can feel fundamentally.

1964
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:32,560
They also have very analgesic 
properties,

1965
01:42:32,561 --> 01:42:33,394
which is quite interesting.
Cocaine is a profound analgesics and 

1966
01:42:36,161 --> 01:42:38,320
that basically suggests that,
well,

1967
01:42:38,321 --> 01:42:39,154
you're involved in the voluntary 
exploration of novelty from the aspect 

1968
01:42:42,190 --> 01:42:43,210
of perspective.

1969
01:42:43,570 --> 01:42:46,450
Your brain is functioning in a sense at 
its optimal level,

1970
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,553
at least from the effect of perspectives
you're interested in things and you're 

1971
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:53,380
also relatively immune to,
to pain.

1972
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:58,000
So he can make of that what you want.
But I mean we can just lower this,

1973
01:42:58,001 --> 01:42:58,834
you know,
down to a more pragmatic level of 

1974
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:00,791
discussion,
you know,

1975
01:43:00,791 --> 01:43:04,690
perfectly well from your own experience 
that if you're involved in something you

1976
01:43:04,691 --> 01:43:08,980
really find interesting that uh,
well that's about as good as you can.

1977
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,550
That's as good a feeling as you can 
possibly hope to generate.

1978
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:15,670
I mean,
basically what people tend to do I think

1979
01:43:15,671 --> 01:43:20,260
is arrange their lives so that 
everything else feeds the possibility of

1980
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:22,300
them doing something that they really 
want to do.

1981
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:25,450
Although people will sacrifice that 
often because they are afraid.

1982
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,673
But,
uh,

1983
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:31,180
well the reason I'm bringing up this 
discussion is because it has employee,

1984
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,163
well,
it has implications for all sorts of 

1985
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:34,140
things.
And um,

1986
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:36,123
it's also curious,
and this is something you might want to 

1987
01:43:37,391 --> 01:43:40,510
think about because it really,
it's very strange for me.

1988
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:44,230
I think that the world that myth 
describes,

1989
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,180
so let people would say,
look,

1990
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:47,463
if you had to make a distinction in 
terms of the description of reality 

1991
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:52,610
between the scientific

1992
01:43:52,610 --> 01:43:54,560
description and the mythological 
description,

1993
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:55,603
while there's no contest,
the scientific description is the 

1994
01:43:57,651 --> 01:44:00,380
description of the world and there's 
lots of evidence on that.

1995
01:44:01,390 --> 01:44:02,460
To that end,
right?

1996
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,740
I mean,
science is a very poor,

1997
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:06,110
powerful technique,
but the peculiar thing is,

1998
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:09,410
is that you would also say,
say as an evolutionary biologist,

1999
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:13,160
that the world to which your brain has 
adapted is the real world.

2000
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:17,150
And from my perspective,
the world that your brain has adapted to

2001
01:44:17,151 --> 01:44:17,984
is the mythological world because your 
brain construes things as the territory 

2002
01:44:21,951 --> 01:44:24,410
that you've explored,
the territory you haven't,

2003
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:26,720
and the process that mediates between 
the two.

2004
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:30,200
And
you can see why that might be.

2005
01:44:30,201 --> 01:44:33,350
If you think about where danger exists,
for example,

2006
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:34,403
hello,
I'll close this with one interesting 

2007
01:44:36,501 --> 01:44:41,000
fact that I learned long after I had 
figured out that

2008
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,343
that tough people identify those from 
different cultures as agents of the 

2009
01:44:49,811 --> 01:44:52,090
unknown.
The Egyptians,

2010
01:44:52,091 --> 01:44:52,924
ancient Egyptians would not let 
foreigners into their temples because 

2011
01:44:56,350 --> 01:44:57,183
foreigners,
we're agents of chaos and the temples 

2012
01:44:59,411 --> 01:45:00,244
were microcosms of the entire state and 
they didn't want the state disrupted by 

2013
01:45:03,941 --> 01:45:05,680
the presence of foreigners in the 
temples.

2014
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,523
Know.
Lots of religions still construe the 

2015
01:45:08,231 --> 01:45:09,490
world in that matter today.
I mean,

2016
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:11,560
think of marriage restrictions for 
example.

2017
01:45:11,561 --> 01:45:12,394
But that's one interesting thing.
The other interesting thing is that the 

2018
01:45:15,551 --> 01:45:17,830
Egyptians,
and it wasn't just the Egyptians,

2019
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,670
he actually identify five cultures that 
did exactly the same thing.

2020
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:25,630
They use the same symbol for the dragon 
that ate the sun at night

2021
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:30,700
and for foreigners for barbarians that 
an inhabited,

2022
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:33,640
unexplored territory and the dragon that
ate the sun at night,

2023
01:45:33,641 --> 01:45:35,680
by the way,
it was the dragon of chaos.

2024
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,193
The daddy that rule prior to the 
division of the cosmos into chaos and 

2025
01:45:39,941 --> 01:45:40,774
order.
So you could say human human word has a 

2026
01:45:43,601 --> 01:45:47,860
natural category.
And that category is the category of all

2027
01:45:47,861 --> 01:45:50,830
things that have yet to be explored.
That's the unknown.

2028
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:54,790
And the unknown has a priory,
motivational significance.

2029
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:57,500
It's frightening.
But it's also interesting and it's,

2030
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:03,120
it's natural to us to not to associate 
foreigners with that category,

2031
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:07,600
but to presume that they occupied the 
same domain,

2032
01:46:07,601 --> 01:46:08,434
which is even more fundamental.
It's not like the Egyptian stock 

2033
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:12,033
foreigners chaos equivalent.
What the Egyptians thought was that 

2034
01:46:15,460 --> 01:46:19,390
these two things were the same thing.
They hadn't yet been distinguished.

2035
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:23,530
It's more fundamental than a mere 
association is that the foreigner is the

2036
01:46:23,531 --> 01:46:24,364
ancient of chaos.
And that basically means that your 

2037
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:31,201
response to the foreigner is going to be
integrally tied into the manner in which

2038
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:35,530
you approach chaos as part of your,
as part of the nature of your being.

2039
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:36,513
So your attitude towards the terrible 
unknown is the same as your attitude 

2040
01:46:40,241 --> 01:46:41,510
towards the stranger.
Oh,

2041
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:43,060
that's something to think about.
All right,

2042
01:46:45,490 --> 01:46:47,170
well questions.

2043
01:46:50,980 --> 01:46:52,740
Oh,
um,

2044
01:46:53,700 --> 01:46:56,190
okay.
What exactly do you want to know?

2045
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:58,740
Look all I'll tell you about it.
Generally.

2046
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:02,200
I want you to pick something that is 
interesting to you.

2047
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:04,343
That's,
and it's relevant to the topics that 

2048
01:47:06,991 --> 01:47:10,830
we've discussed in the course.
And those are the two major criteria.

2049
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:11,873
Um,
I don't just want a summary of what 

2050
01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:15,533
we've discussed.
I want you to take what we've discussed 

2051
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:20,370
and apply it to a problem that you find 
compelling.

2052
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:21,803
MMM,

2053
01:47:24,580 --> 01:47:25,540
yeah.
That's basic.

2054
01:47:25,541 --> 01:47:27,220
I mean that's basically the bottom line.

2055
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,393
MMM.

2056
01:47:30,730 --> 01:47:32,480
During the next class.
Yes.

2057
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:36,470
Yeah.
The dates are screwy on the syllabus,

2058
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:39,590
but the class times when they're 
supposed to be handed in.

2059
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:42,200
That's right.
So next class is class four.

2060
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:43,733
It's going to summarize really quickly 
the way you just said in like two 

2061
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:45,981
sentences.
Okay.

2062
01:47:45,981 --> 01:47:49,190
So the world is set up into,
for us as a known,

2063
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:51,740
the unknown and the process which,
which,

2064
01:47:51,770 --> 01:47:53,690
which mediates between the two.
Right.

2065
01:47:54,020 --> 01:47:56,360
What we do after that process then is 
to,

2066
01:47:56,361 --> 01:47:57,194
they will think is something we use in 
that process and things that we don't 

2067
01:48:00,291 --> 01:48:02,450
use for that process.
Well,

2068
01:48:02,451 --> 01:48:04,490
that the latter part of that isn't quite
right.

2069
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:05,383
Basically what we're trying to do when 
we explore the unknown is to manipulate 

2070
01:48:09,561 --> 01:48:10,394
the things that we encounter so that 
they take on the effect of significance 

2071
01:48:13,881 --> 01:48:14,714
that we want,
which is now what people would normally 

2072
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:18,374
say as well.

2073
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:20,870
When we explore something,
we discovered their properties,

2074
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:24,620
but that's not exactly right because the
properties of something depend very much

2075
01:48:24,621 --> 01:48:25,454
on how you approach it,
which is the example I used with fire 

2076
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:29,600
and you say before people had mastered 
fire,

2077
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:34,601
it was something unknown and dangerous.
Mastering fire means erecting a sequence

2078
01:48:35,451 --> 01:48:36,284
of behaviors in the presence of fire 
that allow the fire to shift 

2079
01:48:39,561 --> 01:48:44,420
motivational category from intrinsically
interesting and threatening to useful in

2080
01:48:44,421 --> 01:48:45,254
some determinant manner.
So when that's what we do when we 

2081
01:48:48,981 --> 01:48:49,814
explore,
it's where assigning us fixed domain of 

2082
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:56,690
motivational relevance to something that
only exists as possibility.

2083
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,360
And we're doing that by rearranging our 
behaviors.

2084
01:48:59,361 --> 01:49:03,380
That's what adaptation means.
So you can see this too.

2085
01:49:03,381 --> 01:49:04,214
For example,
if you're trying to adapt to the 

2086
01:49:05,241 --> 01:49:06,074
presence of another person,
the other person is a very complex and 

2087
01:49:08,481 --> 01:49:09,440
you can say,
well you,

2088
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,750
you explore someone else,
you get to know them.

2089
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:12,913
But really what you're doing when you 
explore someone else is in large part 

2090
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,570
matching your behaviors.
If you,

2091
01:49:20,571 --> 01:49:21,404
if you like the person matching your 
behaviors to their expectations so that 

2092
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:29,390
in your presence they only manifest 
those phenomena that you want.

2093
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:30,793
That's exploration.
It's not mere evocation of all 

2094
01:49:33,021 --> 01:49:35,240
possibilities.
Like if I want to get to know you,

2095
01:49:35,241 --> 01:49:36,074
for example,
one of the things I probably won't want 

2096
01:49:37,911 --> 01:49:40,340
to know is how you react.
If I put a knife in your foot.

2097
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:41,493
That's,
that's one category of the phenomena 

2098
01:49:43,251 --> 01:49:46,160
that compose you that I'm not interested
in eliciting.

2099
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:49,840
So it's not random.
Our exploration is not random.

2100
01:49:50,140 --> 01:49:54,070
We're attempting to transform what has 
in determining significance,

2101
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:57,940
which means meaning into something that 
we want,

2102
01:49:58,270 --> 01:50:00,790
not something we expect,
something we want.

2103
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,220
That's what they,
that's what adaptation means.

2104
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,980
So most things I just tried to be 
neutral.

2105
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:07,000
That's true.
But that's,

2106
01:50:07,001 --> 01:50:07,834
I would say in the sense we want lunch.
Well that's also a failure because it's 

2107
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:11,914
better to transform something into a 
satisfaction or a promise that into 

2108
01:50:15,191 --> 01:50:16,024
something irrelevant.
Although that's the way that thing most 

2109
01:50:17,561 --> 01:50:20,980
things end up.
So it's the best kind of failure,

2110
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,383
but it's still a failure.
You know that because it's often the 

2111
01:50:24,251 --> 01:50:24,941
case.
For example,

2112
01:50:24,941 --> 01:50:25,774
if you're conducting an experiment,
you define something as irrelevant and 

2113
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:30,610
10 years later someone else comes along 
and says,

2114
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:31,444
well no,
that's not irrelevant if you treat it 

2115
01:50:32,261 --> 01:50:33,094
this way,
it has this set of possibilities and 

2116
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:36,634
well you know,
so irrelevant is a dangerous 

2117
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:41,110
categorization as well.
Cause it probably,

2118
01:50:41,220 --> 01:50:43,720
it may mean that you've overlooked 
something important.

2119
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:47,140
So I know that's how things turn out and
you can understand why and all that.

2120
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:48,003
But still really successful adaptation 
means you turn possibility into desired 

2121
01:50:53,591 --> 01:50:54,424
actuality.
Can you do that by rearranging your 

2122
01:50:57,131 --> 01:50:59,620
behavior or your scheme of 
representation?

2123
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:00,483
That's

2124
01:51:01,070 --> 01:51:03,400
so
okay.

2125
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:05,550
And one of the other classes you told us
a story about,

2126
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:06,583
um,
it was talking about the drive that we 

2127
01:51:07,561 --> 01:51:08,394
have to explore new things.
And you said like babies will fight for 

2128
01:51:10,921 --> 01:51:13,620
the chance to explore a toy on the floor
they've never seen before.

2129
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:17,100
So they're not fighting for the toilet 
or fighting for the chance to be the one

2130
01:51:17,101 --> 01:51:20,550
to explore it.
And I was wondering how,

2131
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:22,243
well,
how does that kind of change when you 

2132
01:51:23,971 --> 01:51:26,490
get to a level of an adult or a culture 
or something?

2133
01:51:26,730 --> 01:51:29,000
And how has that affected by,
well,

2134
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:30,990
I guess you'd have to know this is a 
presumption,

2135
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:34,290
but if it seems that we're running out 
of objects and things to explore,

2136
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:35,980
like aside from space,
I mean we don't know.

2137
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:37,510
No,
I would say that's a presumption.

2138
01:51:37,511 --> 01:51:38,830
We're not running out of things to it.
Yeah,

2139
01:51:40,480 --> 01:51:42,070
yeah.
No,

2140
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,730
I think the nature of the things that 
we're,

2141
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,830
that we have to explore is changing in 
some way.

2142
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:50,250
I mean it's like what we can explore now
is more likely,

2143
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:53,630
I don't know,
like the properties of the ocean or like

2144
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:57,690
we can fight about it appears to explore
it now.

2145
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:00,680
It appears to us that that's the case.
More of an idea.

2146
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:01,670
I mean,
I mean it's,

2147
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:04,400
we recognize it as more of an idea.
Like let's say that,

2148
01:52:04,401 --> 01:52:05,234
you know,
if rushton psychologists are studying 

2149
01:52:05,871 --> 01:52:07,580
one thing and American psychologists are
studying,

2150
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:09,093
you're not as likely to physically fight
over that as if we're fighting over the 

2151
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:15,110
country or a territory or something that
we can conceive as the object.

2152
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,110
It's like we're running on an object and
we're thinking of more ideas.

2153
01:52:18,390 --> 01:52:21,280
And even in the case of space,
it seemed that we saw space.

2154
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:22,114
There's more of an abstract idea because
space is something that it's not very 

2155
01:52:25,071 --> 01:52:26,750
likely to,
to be,

2156
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,053
um,
a dangerous unknown to us unless we go 

2157
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:31,280
into it.
So as long as we stay where we are,

2158
01:52:31,281 --> 01:52:34,280
we can think of it as an idea rather 
than as a place.

2159
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:35,600
And so we had,
you know,

2160
01:52:35,601 --> 01:52:37,250
this little space race,
but it wasn't,

2161
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,173
it didn't seem to be as,
we didn't get as involved in it as we 

2162
01:52:40,461 --> 01:52:41,720
did in previous conflicts.

2163
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,480
Well,
okay.

2164
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:45,770
There's a lot,
sorry,

2165
01:52:45,771 --> 01:52:46,100
go ahead.

2166
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,933
And through that,
our environment is much more 

2167
01:52:47,571 --> 01:52:48,340
constructive.
I mean,

2168
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:53,340
as much less that we have to worry about
and mean we're exploring more of our own

2169
01:52:53,901 --> 01:52:56,690
construction
and you're billing,

2170
01:52:56,700 --> 01:52:57,533
for me it's more of them because you 
don't know all the implications of that 

2171
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,873
change sort of title anyway.
I mean not to look at your lifespan and 

2172
01:53:04,561 --> 01:53:07,100
that the position that you're in right 
now,

2173
01:53:07,340 --> 01:53:08,173
you're in a position where people try 
very hard to make everything was 

2174
01:53:10,191 --> 01:53:12,830
predictable for you as possible so you 
can focus on ideas,

2175
01:53:13,130 --> 01:53:15,910
but that may not be what your life is 
like.

2176
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:16,913
And it also may seem that in comparison 
to things that have been discovered in 

2177
01:53:20,031 --> 01:53:20,864
the past,
the things that we're exploring right 

2178
01:53:22,191 --> 01:53:23,024
now are more subtle.
But I think that's only because we have 

2179
01:53:25,461 --> 01:53:26,294
the advantage of viewpoint on the past 
to us because of those things have 

2180
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:31,190
already been explored.
They seem obvious.

2181
01:53:31,370 --> 01:53:33,140
But to the people that we're exploring 
them,

2182
01:53:33,141 --> 01:53:35,270
when they were still undefined 
territory,

2183
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,313
they were as obscure it to them as the 
things we explore art us with this 

2184
01:53:40,311 --> 01:53:41,330
mysterious.
So yeah.

2185
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:42,293
Yes.
Which is to say that if you answer a 

2186
01:53:44,001 --> 01:53:45,710
question,
you answer a question,

2187
01:53:45,711 --> 01:53:48,260
but you generate to new problems as a 
consequence.

2188
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,090
It's like the introduction of the 
computer.

2189
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,273
Well,
it seems like the things where it's 

2190
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:52,463
going now are things that we're not as 
likely to see it as a competition for 

2191
01:53:55,711 --> 01:53:58,260
resources.
Like if I want to study something,

2192
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:01,320
it doesn't mean that the other person 
can't study it.

2193
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:03,380
It's sort of like you want to own 
America,

2194
01:54:03,450 --> 01:54:05,610
you have to fight the other countries 
and keep them away from it.

2195
01:54:05,611 --> 01:54:07,230
Otherwise you can't be the one to the 
sport.

2196
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,140
But if people want to explore,
you know,

2197
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:11,340
psychology,
you don't have to keep other people from

2198
01:54:11,341 --> 01:54:15,290
doing it.
Oh yeah.

2199
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:17,413
Did your education,
like other countries think academics is 

2200
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:23,093
extremely competitive because you don't 
want somebody else who told us your 

2201
01:54:24,961 --> 01:54:25,794
idea.
You want to be the one to define the 

2202
01:54:27,031 --> 01:54:30,210
terms to set the
day with.

2203
01:54:30,211 --> 01:54:32,470
The questions are,
does that transcribed into the conflict?

2204
01:54:32,471 --> 01:54:35,010
Do you actually try to keep them from 
studying it or is it just that you,

2205
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,870
you hope that they don't see?
I mean,

2206
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:40,560
are we having cross generational 
congregation the,

2207
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,920
we don't fight each other,
but we,

2208
01:54:44,550 --> 01:54:45,810
yeah,
but we do fight too.

2209
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,873
Yeah.
