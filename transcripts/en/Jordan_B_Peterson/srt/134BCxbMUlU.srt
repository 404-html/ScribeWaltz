1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,660
The,
the heroic path is,

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,440
is laid out in like a,
in,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,383
as a metta path by religious systems 
basically as the road to redemption and 

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,330
the redemption is redemption from chaos,
but also from tyranny.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,990
It's redemption from both.
And in,

6
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,824
uh,
in the transcendent space that those 

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,830
metta stories exist.
That's a divine archetype,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,630
right?
It's the successful hero.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,740
But then that's an archetype mean.
So,

10
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,574
you know,
let's say you're doing everything right 

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,793
and then your family gets killed in a 
car accident and you slip and fall down 

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,480
the stairs and you know,
you have a concussion and maybe you wake

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,430
up in your brain damaged,
you know,

14
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,040
so,
and then while you're recovering,

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,810
you get hit by some other illness 
because that often a one,

16
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,000
two punch like that will often really 
hurt people,

17
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,110
you know,
because they're,

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,350
they're just getting up there,
quite fragile and they're pretty hurt.

19
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,680
And then something else comes along and 
wax them and you know,

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,953
it isn't the case.
That identification with the archetypal 

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:08,844
hero will stop those things from 
happening because there's an element of 

22
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:15,370
randomness in life.
So.

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,100
So you have to be sensible about it.
You have to say it's your best bet,

24
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,000
which is a different thing.
It's no certain path,

25
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:28,260
but given the range of potential 
negative outcomes,

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,260
voluntary confrontation with emergent to
normally roughly speaking,

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,310
gives you the best poker hand or maybe 
makes you the best poker player.

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,333
That would be a better way of thinking 
about it now so people can be 

29
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:49,041
traumatized by my failure to update 
their models because then the moral gets

30
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,560
old like,
oh,

31
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,600
Cyrus,
and it's unable to see the tyranny,

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,673
plus it's archaic and can just get wiped
out because it no longer is adapted to 

33
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,920
the situation.
It's like you'd be like that if you were

34
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,080
still using dos as an operating system.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,183
Well,
it's a perfectly reasonable operating 

36
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:10,890
system,
but it doesn't.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,320
It usually it used to really work,
but all you had to do was not update and

38
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:18,210
you'd be extinct.
Right.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,153
One of the things Mercia Eliana pointed 
out was that one of the processes that 

40
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:29,340
sort of universally regarded as a sin in
so far as that's a universal conception,

41
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:31,590
so you might think about it as a data 
error,

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,723
is speeding along the process of 
inevitable decay through willful 

43
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,694
blindness,
so things will decay of their own 

44
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,340
accord,
so you have to be awake just to keep the

45
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:45,174
bloody thing alive,
but you can speed the rate at which it 

46
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,044
decays by pretending that nothing's 
wrong and and refusing to change 

47
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,450
anything at all.
And so then you say,

48
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:55,950
well,
not only does it decay,

49
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,590
but your blindness is contributing to 
the decay.

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:04,350
And that's well in one of the stories 
we're going to talk about today,

51
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,130
which is the flood story.

52
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,540
That's basically the underlying story of
the flood is like God's pretty irritated

53
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,374
that everybody's blind and stupid,
but he's particularly irritated that 

54
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:16,024
they stay blind and stupid.
And so the consequence of that is 

55
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,180
everything gets washed away and that 
actually is the consequences of that.

56
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,110
So when the ancient Hebrews,
we're imagining that story,

57
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:27,850
you know,
when modern people look at that story,

58
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,301
they think,
well,

59
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,400
what kind of God would do that?
It's like,

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,130
well,
we talked about New Orleans.

61
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,950
Why did New Orleans get washed away?
Well,

62
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:39,100
one answer is hurricane.
That's a good answer.

63
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,260
But the other answer is,
um,

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,890
maybe they should've made the dike 
stronger like they knew for the last 100

65
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,724
years and maybe all the money that was 
supposed to be spent on the dikes 

66
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,940
shouldn't have got diverted into the 
pockets of corrupt politicians.

67
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,380
And so then you say,
well,

68
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:54,214
why did New Orleans get flooded 
hurricane or the sins of man and the 

69
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:00,700
tendency of things to decaying.

70
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,980
Well,
the truth is,

71
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:06,340
is that they're both equally potent 
causal elements.

72
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:07,923
You know,
when your city collapses because your 

73
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,730
engineers have built the concrete with 
sand,

74
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,580
which happens all over the world,
right?

75
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,963
Like especially in corrupt countries 
where they don't make the concrete 

76
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,850
properly because it's cheaper just to 
fill it with sand.

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,360
The whole bloody city falls over.
It's like,

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,040
is that the earthquake?
While.

79
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:27,874
Yes,
because it wouldn't have happened 

80
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,224
without the earthquake,
but it also wouldn't have happened if 

81
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,450
people weren't corrupt,
so and there's a constant,

82
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,463
that's the the dynamic between the 
terrible mother chaos and the terrible 

83
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,224
father like and and the,
the other dynamic there is also the 

84
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:44,674
adversarial element of the individual.
You can't assess the situation without 

85
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:53,851
taking those three causal forces into,
into consideration simultaneously.

86
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,090
Someone just gave me a paper a couple of
weeks ago linking corruption to poverty.

87
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,003
Now I knew that for a long time because 
if you look at the list of if you look 

88
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:11,580
at countries and rank the by GDP and 
then look at their corruption indexes,

89
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,800
it's like there's a tremendously high 
correlation and you might say,

90
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,170
well,
poverty causes corruption,

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,390
but really that's what you're going to 
say.

92
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:21,220
You're going to say that poor people are
corrupt.

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
Really?
No,

94
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,610
I wouldn't do that.
First of all,

95
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:26,230
there's lots of poor people who weren't 
corrupt,

96
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,580
but corrupt people are poor.
You can bloody well be sure of that.

97
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,673
So

98
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,540
d a Dip.

99
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,931
Well,
yeah,

100
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,640
absolutely.
Absolutely.

101
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,440
I mean,
the Robo is falling like mad,

102
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,453
you know,
and there's a variety of causes of that 

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,700
but is corrupt beyond belief,
you know,

104
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,300
so,
and corruption.

105
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,570
Corruption is like inertia,
you know,

106
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:59,270
if you and I have a transaction and we 
both stick to what we say,

107
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,060
I hardly even have to think about you.
You know,

108
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,640
you're just,
you're a sentence on a page,

109
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:05,863
what a good deal.
But if you're not that God only knows 

110
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,114
you might,
you might wipe me out because I'm 

111
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,940
trading with you.
You know,

112
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,774
I mean,
I've had the business dealings with 

113
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:18,680
people.
Some people I don't even have a contract

114
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:21,080
with.
We just say what's going to happen?

115
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,210
And that happens and for years,
you know,

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,670
and then other people,
it's like detailed contracts.

117
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:30,440
They take really six months of work to 
lay out and they're violated continually

118
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:32,840
and it turns into just an absolute 
catastrophe.

119
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,050
And so the cost of that is exceptionally
high.

120
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,093
You can't have a transaction that can be
profitable roughly speaking in the 

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,020
presence of corruption because the 
transaction cost is too high.

122
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,453
And so it just spirals into poverty.
You do spend all your time trying to 

123
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:54,470
figure out what the hell the other 
person is up to instead of concentrating

124
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:55,304
on what you could actually do.
So I think the only real natural 

125
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,380
resources,
honesty,

126
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,660
you know,
and you might think,

127
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,530
well that's,
you know,

128
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,650
what's your evidence for that?
It's like that's not a problem in stable

129
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,003
democratic countries.
The best predictor of longterm success 

130
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,310
is intelligence and conscientiousness.
It's like,

131
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,623
isn't that an index of.
Isn't that an index of the integrity of 

132
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,560
the system?
I mean,

133
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:23,600
I don't see how you can argue that any 
other ways.

134
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,620
Conscientious people are diligent,
beautiful and honest.

135
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,760
They do what they say they're gonna do 
and smart people are faster.

136
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,013
So basically what the data reveal is 
that if you're fast while you're going 

137
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:36,964
to get there faster than other people 
because you're fast and then if you're 

138
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,514
fast and honest,
the probability that you're going to 

139
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,190
move up your dominance hierarchy is 
massively,

140
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,980
massively increased.
You know,

141
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,110
the overall Rahr is probably about point
six,

142
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,570
relationship between Iq and 
conscientiousness,

143
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,080
but a lot of that's measurement error,
you know,

144
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,153
because I can't figure out how conscious
you are with a conscientious you are 

145
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:01,550
with a questionnaire.
There's going to be a lot of measurement

146
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,400
error there.
There's less measurement error with Iq,

147
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,090
but then the performance indexes are 
also full of measurement error,

148
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,270
right?
Because it isn't easy for me to tell how

149
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:14,480
well you're doing.
I could use estimates your income,

150
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,913
self reports of how you're doing peer 
ratings of how you're doing your 

151
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,454
supervisors ratings of how you're doing 
your subordinates ratings of how you're 

152
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:24,320
doing,
how much money you make.

153
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,170
If you're a salesman or someone who has 
a direct income,

154
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,303
but that only captures a small maybe 
that capture 60 percent of your success 

155
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:33,914
or something.
And if that's the case then the are for 

156
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,470
the measurement of your success is only 
about point seven five.

157
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,110
And so if there,
if the,

158
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,303
if the measurement error for,
for ICU and conscientiousness tops out 

159
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:48,404
at about point seven,
which is probable and the performance 

160
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:53,420
index accuracy tops out at about point 
seven,

161
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,230
a correlation of point five is like,
it's not 35 percent of the variance.

162
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,530
It's like 70 percent of the measurable 
variance.

163
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,590
So,
you know,

164
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
and I can't think of a counter 
explanation for that.

165
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,800
Now,
if you look in creative domains,

166
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,634
you have to use openness because,
and you have to use different measures 

167
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,910
because creative people,
it's not,

168
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,190
it's not easy to assess the performance 
of creative people.

169
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,263
If it was,
they wouldn't be creative because the 

170
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:23,310
problem with creative people is they 
keep mucking with the structure that you

171
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,240
would use to assess them,
you know,

172
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,930
so you couldn't assess the castle as an 
impressionist,

173
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,333
that just isn't going to work.
So it's very hard for people to think 

174
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,973
about what to do with someone like the 
castle because he demands that you come 

175
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,140
up with a whole new rating scheme.
And that's,

176
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,003
you know,
that's the real problem with creative 

177
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,200
people.
So,

178
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,090
but anyways,
um,

179
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,323
I'm going to talk about this summit,
this mind matters thing on Sunday 

180
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,720
because I've been thinking about power,
you know,

181
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,540
and we were.
Well we can segue into this.

182
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,374
So we already talked about how the great
mother emergence from chaos and so this 

183
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,120
idea,
that's God the father by the way,

184
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:00,954
I think that's a eastern Orthodox 
representation and the eastern Orthodox 

185
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,930
church split off from the Western 
Christian church in.

186
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,830
It was a long time ago.
I don't remember exactly when.

187
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,940
It was within 200 years of the 10th 
century.

188
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,710
So I know that's a fairly big error and 
I can't remember exactly the difference,

189
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,100
but it was way before the Protestants 
and the Catholics split for example.

190
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,143
So it happened a long time ago.
But the idea here is that there's a 

191
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,284
structure that emerges out of chaos and 
that structure is symbolized by the 

192
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:36,720
father.
And basically what the father represents

193
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,583
is the,
the model of behavior and perception 

194
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:44,220
that has been constructed by history.
So roughly speaking,

195
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:46,710
it's what the feminists referred to as 
the patriarchy.

196
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,083
Except the problem with the feminist is 
they only see the tyrannical element of 

197
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,594
the Patriarchy and you know,
a lot of the reason for that is because 

198
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,343
they were strongly influenced by the 
postmodern philosophers of the late 19 

199
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:02,520
sixties who are almost all without 
exception,

200
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,210
radical left wing student 
revolutionaries who were working for the

201
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:08,970
overthrow of the French government in 
the late 19 sixties.

202
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,420
So it's like there's a problem with 
that.

203
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,483
The problem with this,
assuming that the great father is only 

204
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:18,910
tyrannical,
is,

205
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,930
well,
first of all,

206
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,963
it's ungrateful because know you're in 
the university and I know that as a 

207
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:27,250
general rule,
University of Toronto students aren't,

208
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,173
you know,
the happiest creatures in the world and 

209
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,780
their reaction generally to the 
university.

210
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,614
And I think it's because the workload is
pretty damn high and the place isn't 

211
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,850
that social.
You know,

212
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,440
they're stressed and unhappy especially 
in their first couple of years.

213
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,603
But

214
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,203
what are you going to say about that?
You're going to say the whole bloody 

215
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:49,100
institution is nothing but a tyrannical 
mass.

216
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,280
So like,
if so,

217
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:52,620
what the hell are you doing here?
You know,

218
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:53,723
you got to give the devil his due,
so maybe it's 30 percent oppressive and 

219
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,170
ridiculous and 70 percent good.
I mean,

220
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:01,000
what would you say,
what do you guys think?

221
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,120
How would you balance it?
You've been through the university,

222
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,110
you've in your fourth year,
what proportions would you suggest?

223
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,340
Thirty.
70.

224
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,211
Okay.
Well,

225
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,044
one of the things I can tell you that 
that's a hell of a lot better than most 

226
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,280
institutions.
Right?

227
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,001
So,
you know,

228
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:21,940
even if it's not the ideal,
which perhaps it isn't,

229
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:23,263
um,

230
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,540
compared to actual institutions rather 
than comparing it to a utopian ideal,

231
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,540
it's like not too bad,
you know,

232
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,680
it didn't crush you completely,
you know,

233
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,523
and,
and you guys are all going to graduate 

234
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,804
and that's actually going to be of some 
benefit and there's even a possibility 

235
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:45,040
that you know more than you did four 
years ago.

236
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,600
Right?
And you haven't starved to death and all

237
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,260
those things and everything you taught 
wasn't the complete or was taught.

238
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,330
Wasn't a complete lie,
you know,

239
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:57,331
so all things considered,
alright it's 30 percent mandating tyrant

240
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:58,984
and 70 percent benevolent farther and 
maybe we could push that up to 80 slash 

241
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,390
20 or something or maybe 80 5:15,
but leave me,

242
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:08,224
you're never going to get it past that.
I think at some point your attempts to 

243
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,990
make it better than that will actually 
make it worse,

244
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,360
you know,
so it's like in the,

245
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,390
in the old Egyptian story of,
of seth and it'll cyrus at horace horace

246
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,320
comes along and chases seth away,
but he's just hovering around there,

247
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:27,460
out in the border.

248
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,760
You don't get rid of them so you're 
never going to get completely rid of the

249
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,670
tyrannical element of your cultural 
heritage.

250
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,743
And that's partly because it's made out 
of the past and the past is dead and 

251
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:41,740
blind because for obvious reasons,
you know,

252
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,310
all the people who made it are dead.
So it's,

253
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,330
it's static,
dead and blind.

254
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,810
But that doesn't mean it isn't worth 
knowing about.

255
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:50,644
And you know,
your job fundamentally is to revivify 

256
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:53,434
it.
One of the things I often do in this 

257
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:55,930
class,
I'm not doing it this year,

258
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:59,020
is she'll students Pinocchio Because you
know,

259
00:13:59,021 --> 00:13:59,854
Pinocchio is a dramatic tale about a 
marionette whose strings are being 

260
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,474
pulled by forces he doesn't understand,
transforming himself into an autonomous 

261
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,274
individual.
And a variety of things happen to 

262
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,884
Pinocchio.
He has to deal with corruption in the 

263
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,374
form of the criminal underworld.
And the devil himself sort of lurks 

264
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,520
behind that in the story.

265
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,090
He has to deal with the,
uh,

266
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,023
the temptation of eating,
pulled neuroticism because at one point 

267
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,163
that criminals entice him into being 
useless and lazy because he's too sick 

268
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:31,144
to stand up for himself.
And then he also has to go deep into 

269
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,560
the,
into the,

270
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,570
into the oceanic depths to confront 
chaos itself.

271
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,763
And when he does that,
he finds his father who's blind and 

272
00:14:44,921 --> 00:14:48,940
dying roughly speaking and brings them 
up to the surface.

273
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,800
And now he actually sacrifices himself,
save them.

274
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,010
You know,
even though the story insists that,

275
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,873
you know,
while the father is drowning after the 

276
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:58,580
whales been chasing around,
he basically says,

277
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:00,090
you know,
I've had it Japan.

278
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,080
I've had it swim to shore and save 
yourself.

279
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,400
Pinocchio refuses and drags him to shore
and then he dies in is reborn,

280
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,330
and then poof,
you know,

281
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,380
he's real.
It's like,

282
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,870
yeah,
that's exactly right.

283
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,621
And so,
you know,

284
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:13,454
part of your obligation as a student is 
to come to the university that's 15 

285
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:23,291
percent corpse or 30 percent corpse,
we'll say and make the bloody thing come

286
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:27,590
back to life without assuming that it's 
all tyrannical and just rejecting it,

287
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,933
you know?
And it's very dangerous to do that 

288
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,274
because first of all,
if the past is corrupt and tyrannical 

289
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:37,850
sore you,
because you're an embodiment of the past

290
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:40,250
in so far as you're enculturated,
you know,

291
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,550
so it's not like it's outside of you.
It's inside of you too.

292
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,320
So that's,
that's a hell of a thing.

293
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,154
You're going to write off your.
Are you going to write off your 

294
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:52,040
socialization completely as nothing but 
tyranny.

295
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,720
I mean,
that's a big problem.

296
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,830
A,
it's not true.

297
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:57,230
Although for some of you it's probably 
more true than others.

298
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,780
And be,
well,

299
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,270
if that's the case and you're utterly,
utterly corrupt,

300
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:04,070
what the hell do you think you're going 
to do about it?

301
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,080
So that's a big problem,
you know,

302
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:08,960
plus it's ungrateful and that's a big 
mistake because,

303
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,823
you know,
if you're ungrateful you can get 

304
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,430
arrogant and then you're really in 
trouble and you are trouble.

305
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,800
Sure.
Well that's,

306
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,860
that's exactly why I made reference to 
what happened in the sixties,

307
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,420
you know,
because the idea,

308
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,421
then part of that was because people 
thought the Vietnam War was staggeringly

309
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:34,324
unjust and part of that was because 
people were pretty tortured 

310
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:40,540
existentially by the underground battle 
between communism and,

311
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,710
and,
and,

312
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,420
and the West,
roughly speaking,

313
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,760
which was breaking out all over the 
world,

314
00:16:45,761 --> 00:16:46,594
including in Vietnam.
So there was a lot of underground 

315
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:51,424
turmoil but part.
But that doesn't mean you get to throw 

316
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:56,260
the baby out with the bathwater.
You know,

317
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,600
when Timothy leary was a good example of
that,

318
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,190
a turn on.
So that's the LSD tune in,

319
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,520
drop out.
It's like,

320
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:08,791
no,
no,

321
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,530
no,
turn on,

322
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:15,120
wake up and adopt some responsibility,
you know?

323
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,680
And so,
but you see,

324
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:19,350
because as soon as you go to draw out,
you think,

325
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,783
well,
are you running away or leading and 

326
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,670
neat,
you would say,

327
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,003
hey,

328
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,010
you're running away.
That's what you're doing.

329
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,240
The probability that you're leading is 
vanishingly small.

330
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,193
The probability that you're diluting 
yourself about being a leader when you 

331
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:38,334
drop out is exceedingly high.
So the right assumption is if you drop 

332
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:44,460
out,
you're useless and

333
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,653
lazy as well as arrogant and resentful.
And you should start with that 

334
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,624
presumption and then go through a 
cataclysmic soul searching to see if 

335
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:59,220
maybe it might not be true.
It's true.

336
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,590
You know,
what's the probability,

337
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,230
you know,
saint or loser.

338
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,213
Well that's,
there are so few saints that you just 

339
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,080
use a baseline predictions,
you know,

340
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:13,350
actuarial tables,
you have to assume loser.

341
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,540
So you know,
when,

342
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,490
if you're a loser who thinks they're a 
saint,

343
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,150
well then you're going to cause an awful
lot of trouble,

344
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,370
you know,
so and that,

345
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,280
a lot of that happened in the sixties.
So you know,

346
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,190
the sixties generation likes to think 
about themselves as admirable rebels.

347
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,820
It's like,
yeah,

348
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:34,320
let's,
let's check a bit.

349
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,630
For some self serving tendencies there,
you know,

350
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:41,470
like the refusal to adopt responsibility
and that's always lurking underneath a,

351
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,990
like a revolutionary facade.
So you know,

352
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,824
and I think that's had an absolutely 
pernicious influence on the 

353
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,304
universities,
especially the humanities which are 

354
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,393
dropping in enrollment,
cataclysmically deteriorating in 

355
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:02,541
influence and based far more on,
you know,

356
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:05,460
the,
the,

357
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:06,390
uh,
what would you call it,

358
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,343
the,
the idea that you have a moral 

359
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,800
imperative to be a radical activist.

360
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,050
It's like,
no,

361
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,170
you have a moral imperative to be useful
and honest.

362
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,450
That's the whole,
that's a whole different thing,

363
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,390
you know,
if you want to change things like,

364
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,403
fair enough,
but don't be thinking that change isn't 

365
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,060
dangerous and that you're right,
it's highly unlikely.

366
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,850
So,
so anyways,

367
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:39,360
it's very,
my point is there's an architectural way

368
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:44,280
of representing the great father and the
archetypal way is tyrant or,

369
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,890
or benevolent dictator.
It's something like that.

370
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:50,040
And if you don't get to just say one of 
them,

371
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,950
now you know,
here's the way you're thinking about it.

372
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:56,940
Historically,
you could say that once,

373
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,690
like these are archetipal and religious 
representation.

374
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:02,610
So you could say roughly,
that's God the father and God the father

375
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:07,350
you see there is ruling over a walled 
city and the world acidity is the father

376
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:08,184
as well because it's an enclosed space 
that's keeping chaos out and there's a 

377
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:12,174
hierarchy in there,
a dominance hierarchy and everybody 

378
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:19,290
slotted in the hierarchy and you could 
think of the dominance hierarchy and the

379
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,124
value hierarchy as the thing that's 
manifests itself as the father 

380
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,290
symbolically speaking.

381
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,503
So and that you're protected by the fact
of the hierarchy even though it also 

382
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,690
would presses the hell out of you.
Maybe you're like a surf,

383
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,990
you know,
but maybe maybe it's better to be a surf

384
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,570
than to be someone alone in the middle 
of a battlefield.

385
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,550
You know,
that's certainly possible.

386
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,210
You can make a case for that anyways.
So then you look at that and you think,

387
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,290
well,
is that tyranny or security?

388
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,101
And the answer is,
well,

389
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:50,500
it's both.
And what's the ballots and what you hope

390
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:50,921
is,
well,

391
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,500
let's have a little more security than 
tyranny.

392
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,600
And then what's your moral duty?
Well,

393
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,643
to ensure that the great father who you 
are not bloody well going to get rid of 

394
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,024
and you better not because you'll end up
like the Mesopotamians when they slap 

395
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,350
suit,
you remember what happened to them,

396
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,440
right?
Absolutely.

397
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,630
Was Tiamat consort.

398
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,480
He was the masculine element.
Chaos and order.

399
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:11,643
As soon as the ancient gods were formed,
they made a lot of racket and they were 

400
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:18,280
really careless and they killed Appsu 
and then they lived on his corpse.

401
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,250
While that's not a very good idea 
because then time,

402
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,640
outcomes,
you know,

403
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,553
swarming back and the probability that 
she's going to do you in with all her 

404
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:28,324
monsters,
unless you really pay attention and 

405
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:31,600
speak properly,
is very,

406
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:32,860
very high.
You know,

407
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:36,280
the Mesopotamians had that figured out.
Well they and they had it figured out an

408
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:38,530
image.
It's an absolutely remarkable,

409
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,760
a remarkable story.

410
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,570
So yes,
I can imagine.

411
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,710
Okay.
There's two questions in there.

412
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:09,500
One of the ones where sometimes it would
provide a lot of both.

413
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,193
Well,
I think that's what happens when you 

414
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:14,360
were subjected to extraordinarily high 
standards,

415
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,640
you know,
is that order chaos?

416
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,930
Well,
it's both,

417
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,080
you know,
because there's massive benefits in high

418
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:22,310
standards.
The problem is,

419
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:24,800
is they provoke anxiety and they're very
hard to attain.

420
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,873
Does that make them bad?
There's no saying it makes them bad end 

421
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:31,694
good and it's even more complex than 
that because whether they're bad or 

422
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:36,490
good,
depends on how you react to their,

423
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,333
their imposition.
If you discipline yourself and 

424
00:22:40,731 --> 00:22:41,564
straighten yourself up and learn a 
tremendous amount and achieve the high 

425
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:45,564
standards,
it's way better for you than if this 

426
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,740
high standards weren't there,
but they're also going to crush people.

427
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,813
You know,
they're going to crush people for all 

428
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,164
sorts of reasons.
They're going to be really hard on 

429
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,860
people who just aren't that fast.

430
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,693
Even if they work really hard or they're
going to be really hard on people who 

431
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,590
are quite fast but really don't work 
very hard,

432
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,720
they're going to be hard on people who,
you know,

433
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:10,310
have impediments to progress in,
in one unfair way or another.

434
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,340
So the tyrannical element is exactly 
there.

435
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,830
So,
you know,

436
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:19,550
I think the whole bloody thing 
degenerates into tyranny when the people

437
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:24,290
inside it are doing nothing but lying.
That's the pathway to tyranny,

438
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,350
you know,
and,

439
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,720
and I would also say that that's the 
hallmark of the adversarial personality.

440
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,763
You know,
we've talked about the great mother 

441
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:36,710
creation and destruction and the great 
father Tierney and security,

442
00:23:36,711 --> 00:23:37,544
but on top of that is the individual and
there's the part of the individual 

443
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:43,310
that's heroic and I would say that's 
exploratory,

444
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,383
attentive,
and capable and willing to articulate 

445
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,250
the truth in so far as that can be 
conceptualized.

446
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,293
And then his polar opposite,
which is the opposite of that willfully 

447
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,350
blind and deceitful at every possible 
opportunity.

448
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,950
You know,
there's certainly an interaction between

449
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:09,020
all three of those levels.
You know,

450
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,300
and I think that's part of the reason,
you know,

451
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,343
one of the things that happened in 
Christianity was that the serpent that 

452
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:17,240
was in the garden got associated with 
Satan.

453
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,240
That's very weird thing.
You know,

454
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,173
it's very unlikely when that story first
emerged that the serpent had any 

455
00:24:23,391 --> 00:24:26,300
association with the idea of the 
adversary at all.

456
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,583
But as the story developed through time,
what happened was if you construe the 

457
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:34,730
serpent as chaos itself and maybe the 
negative element of chaos,

458
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,380
it was easy to associate that with the 
tyrannical father.

459
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,760
So there'd be a botanical element to 
that and the adversary himself,

460
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,290
right?
Because it's all negative.

461
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,124
So that's the,
that's the connection between the three 

462
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:48,644
levels.
And it took western culture roughly 

463
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:54,530
speaking thousands of years to delineate
that idea.

464
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,603
You know,
it probably didn't come to its full 

465
00:24:56,691 --> 00:24:57,524
poetic flowering until Milton.
And it's very little of it is in the 

466
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,740
Bible as it's as it as it currently 
stands,

467
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,940
virtually nothing.

468
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,733
That's one translation.
Lucifer's also the bringer of light 

469
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,320
though,
weirdly enough.

470
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,900
So you know,
it's a,

471
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,170
it's a very,
it's,

472
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,130
it's,
it's wild.

473
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:21,560
It's again,
it's one of these paradoxical situations

474
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:26,561
because it's also not always the case 
that your adversary is the devil,

475
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,900
so to speak.
It might be an angel in disguise,

476
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:30,734
you know,
and that's young's notion with regards 

477
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,270
to the shadow.
You might think that it's evil,

478
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,033
but it might be the thing you actually 
need now lurking underneath that is the 

479
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:44,270
idea that there is absolute good and 
absolute evil and I think you can make a

480
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:45,860
case for that.
In fact,

481
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:49,970
I think the 20th century made a case for
that and I think that's what was decided

482
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:50,804
at the Nuremberg trials after World War 
Two because the judicial decision was 

483
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,533
there are some things you don't get to 
do no matter what your culture is like 

484
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,120
and no matter what your excuse is,
you know,

485
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,963
and the alternative that too,
that was deciding where we can let you 

486
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:09,650
off the hook because you were following 
orders,

487
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,603
you know,
and people really debated that and you 

488
00:26:11,661 --> 00:26:12,494
can say,
well the Nuremberg judges were the 

489
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,690
allied victors and so they just imposed 
their own viewpoint.

490
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,523
But I think that's pretty damn cynical.
There was probably some of that because 

491
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,290
things are tyrannical and benevolent at 
the same time,

492
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,124
but you know,
accepting that judgment is a very 

493
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:32,030
peculiar metaphysical move.
But rejecting it,

494
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,480
that's also a very peculiar metaphysical
move,

495
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,910
you know,
because basically what you say if you,

496
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,343
if you reject the Nuremberg decision,
is that what happened in Nazi 

497
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,873
concentration camps was had to be judged
through the lands of cultural 

498
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:52,610
relativism.
So you can say that if you want,

499
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,444
but you know,
it's not one of those things that you 

500
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:58,200
should do lightly because,

501
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,610
well,
you run into Dostoyevsky's problem.

502
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:04,790
Dostoevsky's problem fundamentally is if
there's no order,

503
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,960
you know,
hierarchical order.

504
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,380
If there's no god,
then everything is permitted and you can

505
00:27:09,381 --> 00:27:14,381
walk down that road,
but it doesn't lead to very good place.

506
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,660
Okay?
So,

507
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,110
so you know what,
what we're,

508
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,400
what we're trying to sort out is the 
idea.

509
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:24,110
We're trying to propose the idea that 
what,

510
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,303
what myths are doing is trying to 
represent the fundamental elements of 

511
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:33,860
being as being,
as experienced at every level of being.

512
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,010
So it's not a reduction to chemical or 
physical constituent elements.

513
00:27:39,081 --> 00:27:39,914
It's a,
it's a perception of the world as it 

514
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:47,750
manifests itself at every level of 
existence simultaneously.

515
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,853
And it's predicated on the proposition 
that there's no reason to make any one 

516
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:57,200
of those levels primary from an 
ontological perspective.

517
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,273
So what that would mean in part is that 
the web of relationships that you find 

518
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:06,941
yourself in is just as real as the 
physiological components of yourselves.

519
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,343
Now,
obviously in some sense it can't be 

520
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:13,400
measured or even conceptualized in the 
same way,

521
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,900
but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean 
that the relationship isn't real,

522
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,610
you know,
so it's,

523
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,503
it's a much more comprehensive way of 
looking at things and it tends to take 

524
00:28:24,531 --> 00:28:27,410
on this dramatic and imagistic for Mei 
think because,

525
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,400
well,
first of all,

526
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,920
it was acted out before it was 
understood.

527
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:35,921
And second images can capture all sorts 
of things that words cannot yet express,

528
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,720
which is why we liked,
we liked looking at,

529
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,020
um,
profound artistic images.

530
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:44,460
They're filling us with information.
You know,

531
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,390
what I found out recently that 
Heidegger,

532
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,583
whose ideas actually have a fair number 
of similarities with what I've been 

533
00:28:52,191 --> 00:28:54,060
teaching you.
Um,

534
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,320
except I'll tell you something 
interesting there that I think is true.

535
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,090
So heidegger tended to view modern 
civilization.

536
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,003
He tended to view it as the radical 
element of the great father stopping us 

537
00:29:08,391 --> 00:29:10,640
from being able to interact with pure 
being.

538
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:12,283
So he was very.
His proposition was that we reconnect 

539
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:30,521
ourselves with the positive element of 
being and produce our producer culture,

540
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,090
social culture that was much more 
benevolent.

541
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,160
But I think if you think about

542
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,770
this from a union perspective,
what the Union's claim,

543
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:45,604
and this is an Alfred Adler claimed the 
same thing and so did need you to some 

544
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,250
degree is if you tilt too far in one 
direction,

545
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,963
a counter position develops in your 
imagination and starts to have an 

546
00:29:57,191 --> 00:30:00,220
uncanny influence on you.
So I can give you an example.

547
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,160
So I've had clients for example,
who are way too agreeable,

548
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,553
you know,
so maybe they're pushed around by their 

549
00:30:06,941 --> 00:30:07,774
father for decades and you know,
one of the ways they react to the hyper 

550
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:15,460
aggression of their father or the 
dominance of their father or maybe their

551
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:16,294
own weaknesses that they classify 
dominance and aggression as evil and 

552
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:21,904
then refuse to engage in it.
Of course that just weakens them 

553
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:27,370
further.
But then they harbor resentment,

554
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,263
you know?
And so one of the things you suggest is 

555
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,340
that if you get gripped by an emotion 
you need,

556
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,950
you need to let it manifest itself in a 
fantasy,

557
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,233
you know,
and I've had my clients tell me 

558
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,080
fantasies once they've learned to let 
the manifest themselves,

559
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,600
you know,
they'll be irritated,

560
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,730
for example,
by something their father says,

561
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,790
and they'll let the fantasy play out and
it's like,

562
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,760
not only is it murderous like you would 
not believe,

563
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:57,760
but it's viciously and violently 
murderous,

564
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,870
you know,
when,

565
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,703
what happens there is that because the 
little issues that constitute the 

566
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:10,240
tyrannical element of the relationship 
between them are never dealt with.

567
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:15,210
The part of them that is capable of 
standing up and,

568
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,083
and,
and pushing forward has been assaulted 

569
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:22,870
by a million blows.
And it's so.

570
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,043
It's been pushed into such a 
pathologically defensive position by 

571
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:34,110
that point that it doesn't fantasize 
about,

572
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,973
well,
maybe I should have a chat with my dad 

573
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,170
and settled this.
It's like,

574
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:37,621
oh no,
no,

575
00:31:37,621 --> 00:31:38,454
no.
It's like full fledged murderous 

576
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:41,730
impulse.
And by that time,

577
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:44,850
the person is also terrified even to let
that fantasy emerge.

578
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:46,290
Because then they'll think,
oh my God,

579
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,124
you know,
what am I some kind of serial killer or 

580
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:51,050
some kind of homicidal maniac,
and you know,

581
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,010
the answer is,
well,

582
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,180
of course you're partly all I'm a cidal 
maniac,

583
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,014
you know,
you got to keep that stuff under 

584
00:31:56,071 --> 00:31:56,904
control,
so otherwise you take it out on your 

585
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,110
children and the people that love you 
and all of that.

586
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,750
But that's not so bad if it's,
you know,

587
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,060
manifest in day to day trivialities and 
you kind of keep things sorted out.

588
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:11,280
But if you don't do anything about it 
for 20 years,

589
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,233
you always hear about these guys that 
burst forth and do something ultra 

590
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:15,900
violent.

591
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,733
What are the neighbors always say?
Especially if they're the lone killer 

592
00:32:19,201 --> 00:32:20,220
types.
Oh,

593
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:22,350
he was such a nice boy.
You know,

594
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,540
we never saw many.
Never caused any trouble.

595
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,351
It's like,
yeah,

596
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:27,750
right.
He never caused enough trouble.

597
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,584
That was the problem.
But he sure made up for it in one fell 

598
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,340
swoop.
So anyways,

599
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:35,160
back to heidegger.
Heidegger had this.

600
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,040
Heidegger seemed to have this vision of 
the patriarchy,

601
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:44,570
roughly speaking as hyper dominant and 
then valued the opposite,

602
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:48,880
which was more cooperative and more in 
tune with nature and you know,

603
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,920
sort of like an environmentalists dream 
of what human society should be like.

604
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,193
And I say that seriously because I 
believe a lot of what the modern 

605
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:04,751
environmental movement uses to dry this,
it's utopian visions is actually derived

606
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,210
directly from heidegger's thinking.
I mean,

607
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:11,170
you can trace the causal pathways.
You got think,

608
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,830
remember what happened to heidegger 
though.

609
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,420
He became a Nazi,

610
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,900
you know,
when it was a real shock to everyone who

611
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:22,220
is a high tech area and follower because
it only seemed like such a good guy.

612
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,851
It's like,
yeah,

613
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:26,810
well maybe he was too good a guy,
you know.

614
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,620
And so there was the,
he was all sweetness and light,

615
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:31,454
so to speak,
on the sort of patriarchal end of the 

616
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,033
distribution.
And then the counterbalance to that 

617
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:39,560
manifested itself politically and he was
just pulled right in.

618
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,903
So I think one of the differences 
between what I'm proposing and what 

619
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:47,840
heidegger proposed is that like I would 
never say that,

620
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,970
that there's a utopian solution to the 
problem of the great father.

621
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:56,990
I would say you're stuck with the 
positive and the negative.

622
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,150
You're stuck with it.
Now.

623
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,163
I think through diligent effort you can 
keep the positive on top of the 

624
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:04,004
negative,
but you don't do that by sacrificing 

625
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:07,520
strength.
You know,

626
00:34:07,521 --> 00:34:11,360
you don't get rid of tyranny by 
weakening society.

627
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,093
All you do then is you increase the 
probability that when tyranny bursts 

628
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,080
forth,
it's going to be far more brutal than it

629
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:19,760
would otherwise be.
You know,

630
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,643
you increase the benevolent element of,
of society by increasing its competence 

631
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:31,270
and power.
So you make it more powerful,

632
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:33,310
not less.
Now that doesn't mean more.

633
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,560
That doesn't mean more oppressive,

634
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,563
right?

635
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,350
They don't.
So that's,

636
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,120
that's a solution.
It's problem.

637
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,300
So one of the things Solzhenitsyn wrote 
about was he was in prison in the prison

638
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:08,134
camps in Russia for a long time.
And one of the things that he used to 

639
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,014
amuse himself within the darkest 
possible way with his compatriots was 

640
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,660
teasing communists once they got 
arrested,

641
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:20,963
you know,
and it was pretty brutal because once 

642
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:25,384
you were thrown into the gulag system,
the probability that you were going to 

643
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:28,324
get out,
especially if you were a political 

644
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:29,711
prisoner,
was like,

645
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,630
you're in there for 20 years,
you know,

646
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:32,464
and you're lucky if you didn't get 
worked to death and the thugs and the 

647
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,090
murderers and the thieves didn't beat 
you senseless constantly.

648
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,063
There was nothing left of you.
So it was no joke to be thrown into 

649
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,670
ghoulag if you were a political 
prisoner.

650
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,180
And there were lots of people who are 
thrown in there purely arbitrarily.

651
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,210
And that's actually because if you 
really want to punish someone,

652
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,750
you punish them because they didn't 
commit any crime.

653
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:52,584
That's a way better punishment than 
punishing them if they actually 

654
00:35:54,721 --> 00:35:56,240
committed the crime,
you know,

655
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,083
because that's just justice.
But random punishment if you want to be 

656
00:36:00,301 --> 00:36:01,830
brutal,
that's the one to use.

657
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,650
So the communists would get thrown in 
with the prisoners,

658
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:07,980
had been in there for awhile and they'd 
still be like rampant communists.

659
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:08,814
They'd be writing letters to everyone 
and trying to extricate themselves from 

660
00:36:11,251 --> 00:36:13,950
the situation assuming that a mistake 
had been made,

661
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,233
you know,
and so those units and his compatriots 

662
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:21,150
would just tease the hell out of them 
because they had nothing left to lose.

663
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,860
Plus they thought,
well,

664
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,383
you're still part of the God system that
actually imprisoned and brutalized 

665
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:31,830
yourself and us.
So part of Social Lipson's moral problem

666
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:36,630
with what should I do with you?
Like should I feel sorry for you because

667
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,780
you've fallen into this absolutely 
hellish category of that person betrayed

668
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,400
by their own ideals and their own 
person,

669
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,490
or should I treat you like,
well you right?

670
00:36:47,491 --> 00:36:51,330
Because you're blind tyrant and look at 
what you've produced.

671
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,430
And Solzhenitsyn's answer was you're a 
blind tyrant until you repent.

672
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,013
Right?
So as long as you still think you're 

673
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:01,744
right,

674
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,130
there is no possibility of 
communication.

675
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,980
So then what he observed was some people
would collapse,

676
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,670
they admit,
and maybe it took a long time that maybe

677
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:16,504
there was something wrong with the 
system and that the other people in 

678
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:23,080
there weren't all the guilty ones in 
them,

679
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:23,914
the only innocent ones.
So some people would accept the facts 

680
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:31,114
even at whatever brutal costs that would
be and what that would be was starting 

681
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:35,104
to decompose the entire value system 
they had that was predicated on 

682
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,950
axiomatic communists belief.
But the other ones,

683
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,680
and these are the ones that social 
instance also writes about,

684
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,610
they just never changed,
you know,

685
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:50,110
release.
Twenty years later they'd say,

686
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:50,944
well that just proves the system was 
right all along and that I was an error 

687
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:54,851
because you,
you know,

688
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:59,851
you can always interpret the data.
The data does not speak for itself.

689
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,730
That's a big problem.

690
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,813
So.

691
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,320
So I thought his solution was brilliant.
It's like,

692
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,154
well,
what do you do with someone who still 

693
00:38:10,761 --> 00:38:13,820
acting out what has destroyed them?
Well,

694
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,553
until they stopped being part of that,
you can't really forgive them or 

695
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:23,000
communicate with them.
But as soon as they drop it,

696
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:24,530
it's like,
well then you give them a hand,

697
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,443
which seems to me like a reasonable 
balance between justice and forgiveness 

698
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,690
and that's a very hard balance to 
strike,

699
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,780
right?
It's a very hard balance to so okay.

700
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,393
So then I kind of differentiated this 
into the tyrant is the king that eats 

701
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:44,644
his own son roughly speaking.
And that means that like if you have a 

702
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,310
tyrannical father say in your actual 
family,

703
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,353
what that father is going to do is to 
react to everything that makes you 

704
00:38:55,691 --> 00:39:00,130
independent or that could make you an 
independent being as if it's a challenge

705
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,870
to his own authority and dominance.

706
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,063
And so whenever you stand up,
you know and make your little thrust 

707
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:09,850
forward like you would if you were a 
three year old,

708
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,710
you know you're going to get whacked 
hard for it.

709
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,710
You're going to get punished for 
everything that would allow you to climb

710
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,690
a dominance hurricane to become a 
challenger.

711
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,303
And so that's,
that's sort of the paternal element of 

712
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:23,290
the whole situation.
You know,

713
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,400
mother who demands nothing and father 
who punishes everything good.

714
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,323
It's a perfect combination.
If you want to raise someone who's 

715
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,183
completely demolished and also in in 
high probability resentful and 

716
00:39:41,411 --> 00:39:44,680
dangerous,
so and you know,

717
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,750
you have societies like that too,
you know,

718
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,584
you see this in corporations,
what especially when they start to 

719
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,164
deteriorate as they start to punish the 
people inside the corporation for being 

720
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:54,064
hardworking and creative and you know,
the thing is in real trouble at that 

721
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:57,430
point.

722
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,090
It's basically dead.
It might take 10 years to fall over,

723
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,820
but it's basically dead.
So,

724
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,800
and you know,
as corporations,

725
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:06,634
as hierarchical structures get full of 
people who are doing nothing but trying 

726
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,150
to climb the dominance hierarchy,
you know,

727
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,993
their power motivated.
They're very annoyed at anyone who's 

728
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:16,534
competent and creative because the 
competent and creative people are using 

729
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,090
competence and creativity declined the 
hierarchy.

730
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,410
Whereas they're just using political 
machinations and the desire for power.

731
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,633
So they want nothing.
They don't want to have those people 

732
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:32,920
around because all they are is 
competitors and they're not even that.

733
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,600
They don't even actually care if while 
they're climbing the ladder on the ship,

734
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,760
the thing is sinking,
you know,

735
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,100
in fact,
they might be facilitating.

736
00:40:42,101 --> 00:40:42,934
It's sinking in trying to pirate 
everything they possibly can while the 

737
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:48,670
thing falls apart.
Now it happens all the time.

738
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,610
So when it happens in all sorts of 
institutions,

739
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,953
so that sort of the sun eating farther 
representation in a political or 

740
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,810
corporate institution,
you know when it sorta.

741
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,653
What's interesting about that I think is
that both the Liberals and the 

742
00:41:04,721 --> 00:41:06,280
conservatives see that,
hey,

743
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,350
they say the left wingers and the right 
wingers,

744
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,683
the left wingers see the tie radical 
element of the great father in 

745
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:13,644
corporations and the right wingers see 
the tie radical element of the great 

746
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:18,670
father in the government.
So it's projection,

747
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,863
you know,
I mean,

748
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,063
it seems to me like a radical 
oversimplification to assume that all 

749
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,553
the evil is embodied in the government 
or all the evil is embodied in 

750
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,540
corporations.
It's like,

751
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,374
you know,
we should be a little more 

752
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,454
differentiated than that.
So all corporations are not the same 

753
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,633
obviously.
And all governments are clearly not the 

754
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,024
same.
And all governmental policies are 

755
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,240
clearly not the same,
but people are lazy.

756
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,160
So they don't want to do the 
differentiation.

757
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:43,994
And so what happens is that the 
archetypal representations possess them 

758
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,840
initially and they failed to 
differentiate them,

759
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,393
you know,
and they're pretty happy about that 

760
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:54,590
because their theory explains 
everything.

761
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,270
You know,
I,

762
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,103
I asked,
I talked to a guy a while back and he's 

763
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:03,110
a pretty smart guy and I was thinking 
about this issue of corruption.

764
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:04,400
I was trying to think,
I thought,

765
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,493
how the hell did some countries get not 
corrupt because I cannot figure that 

766
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,320
out.
I cannot understand how that can even be

767
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,580
possible.
And for me that's a massive mystery.

768
00:42:16,581 --> 00:42:19,250
Like I can imagine digging through that 
for like 30 years,

769
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:22,040
trying to sort it out.
And he answered in two seconds.

770
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:22,491
He said,
well,

771
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:24,070
it's government.
I thought,

772
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,800
you know,
all that means is,

773
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,480
I don't,
I don't want to think about that.

774
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,610
And so here's my one word,
low resolution answer that covers 50,000

775
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:37,400
snakes at once.
It's not helpful,

776
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,590
you know,
it,

777
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:40,424
all it does is convince them that he 
possesses knowledge because he's using 

778
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:46,004
low representation representations to 
encompass huge swaths of the complex 

779
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,260
world,
you know,

780
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:52,094
it's so,

781
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,520
um,
and then punish them.

782
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,960
Well,
but what that is exactly so,

783
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:15,560
so the reference there is you know,
people,

784
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,770
people have tried to model optimal 
social interactions,

785
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:19,604
you know,
so should we cooperate or should we 

786
00:43:21,771 --> 00:43:25,940
fight and so first of all,
the people who tried to model that,

787
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:29,540
we're doing it in one offs so it can 
make a case that

788
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,110
if I,
if,

789
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,130
if there's $20 at stake and I could get 
$20 by like giving you a zero,

790
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,870
I should do that if I'm only going to 
interact with you once.

791
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,823
And so the initial experiments basically
showed that if you are a psychopath 

792
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:49,910
you'd win.
But then someone figured out that,

793
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,803
well wait a minute,
you don't ever do anything once you 

794
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:56,060
iterate it and that's a phd an idea,
right?

795
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,923
Because Piaget would say,
well what's the stable solution across 

796
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,700
multiple iterations of the same thing.
So it's like,

797
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:05,180
well what if we always cooperate?
A group of us,

798
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:07,490
we always cooperate.
Well there's a problem with that because

799
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:12,080
then psychopath a pop up randomly and 
he's like a shark in a tank of guppies.

800
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:14,660
He just eats all the guppies and that's 
the end of this situation.

801
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:19,240
So if all we do is cooperate,
someone who's noncooperative Canadian,

802
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,900
any immediately get everything we have 
and so then the problem becomes,

803
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,283
well,
you don't want to take full of sharks 

804
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:29,810
and you don't want a tank full of 
guppies.

805
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:32,130
What should you do?
And the answer,

806
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:35,640
because this has been played out on 
computer simulations by the way all over

807
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:36,391
the world,
is well,

808
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:38,700
how do you ensure stability?
And it's something like,

809
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,170
I trust you.
I start with the presumption that you're

810
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,210
trustworthy if you react in a 
trustworthy manner.

811
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,760
Away we go,
we trade and it's transparent.

812
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,800
If you screw me,
I whack you,

813
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,740
and then I offered a trade with you 
again.

814
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,673
Cool.
And that seems to be now that's really 

815
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,940
worth thinking about because there's a 
shadow idea in there,

816
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,250
right?
It's like I trust you,

817
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:06,240
but if you bother me all bite you and 
I'll bite you hard,

818
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,590
but then we can trade again.
So it doesn't that.

819
00:45:10,591 --> 00:45:12,780
What that allows is that you can screw 
up,

820
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,640
you know,
and you will.

821
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,070
So it means that we can continue to 
play,

822
00:45:17,071 --> 00:45:17,904
even if you're not perfect,
but you're going to get punished and 

823
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:22,890
appropriate amount if you're not 
perfect.

824
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,570
And then we'll try to get the game going
again.

825
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,950
And so I would say that's an example of 
a pig and celebrated solution,

826
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:30,650
roughly speaking.
And it could ease,

827
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:31,503
it could be that that does have 
something to do with the way that a 

828
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:34,644
culture learns to become non-corrupt,
but it still doesn't explain how that 

829
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:40,820
gets implemented,
you know?

830
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,510
So.
Okay,

831
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,390
so the,
there's a walled city,

832
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,224
you know,
and that's,

833
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:49,230
that's uh,
that place exists that's in France.

834
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:52,620
And fortunately I can't remember the 
name of it at the moment.

835
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,740
It's one of the best preserved medieval 
cities in the world.

836
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:57,660
And there's actually quite a few of 
those left in Europe.

837
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,480
I've seen a lot of them and they're 
staggeringly beautiful,

838
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,000
unbelievably beautiful.
So,

839
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,070
but you see how those things were 
constructed a,

840
00:46:05,071 --> 00:46:07,290
because there's a double wall,
right?

841
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,580
And so you think about what's the 
psychological message that's embodied in

842
00:46:11,581 --> 00:46:12,414
that city and the messages inside the 
walls where there's a civilized 

843
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,910
organization,
you're safe from barbarians.

844
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,110
And chaos and the barbarians and chaos 
surround that.

845
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,450
And so it's better to be inside the 
city.

846
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,570
Now obviously the problem is the city's 
walled,

847
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:33,150
so it's not that easy to get out.
You're trapped in there,

848
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,200
you know,
in some way.

849
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,813
So you could see while you could find,
you imagine if you're a teenager and a 

850
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:41,820
medieval city like that.
You're 12 years old or 13 years old,

851
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:42,654
you're off with your ratty little 
buddies and the first thing you want to 

852
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:46,710
do is go outside the wall and see what's
out there.

853
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,740
But by the same token,
if there weren't any walls,

854
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,574
well then the barbarians would come in 
and they'd steal everything you had and 

855
00:46:52,591 --> 00:46:55,350
everyone would be dead and that would 
not be a good thing.

856
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,491
So,
you know,

857
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:57,324
it was also a place to store prod,
use our agricultural produce so that it 

858
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:01,914
couldn't,
wouldn't rot and wouldn't get eaten by 

859
00:47:02,851 --> 00:47:06,000
bugs and wouldn't be stolen by thieves,
you know?

860
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:06,834
So,
and that was also extraordinarily 

861
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:08,964
useful.
And so there's a belief system embedded 

862
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:12,710
in that.
That's,

863
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:13,723
that would be the medieval world order.
But as well as there being a belief 

864
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,890
system and a psychological 
representation,

865
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:24,891
it's obviously a physical structure and 
it's also a mode of relationship and all

866
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:27,750
of that together constitutes the great 
father.

867
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:28,584
It's not just the belief and some of 
that's going to be tyrannical because 

868
00:47:31,511 --> 00:47:35,320
there's a king and some of it's going to
be beneficial because,

869
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,650
well maybe better to have one king than 
30 kings.

870
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,484
They're having a war.
So that's been the dilemma in American 

871
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:45,940
foreign policy,
you know,

872
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:46,774
if,
if you give American football foreign 

873
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,000
policy,
some credit,

874
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,060
you know,
which you,

875
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,800
which is a reasonable thing to do 
because part of the,

876
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,840
what are the Americans we're always 
trying to figure out,

877
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,300
especially since the end of the World 
War World War was,

878
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:01,540
is it better to have a tyrant

879
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,080
or take them out and have 30 of them,
you know,

880
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:12,720
announcer to that is who knows,
you know,

881
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:17,100
so they took the tire and out of Iraq,

882
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:19,843
what happened?

883
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,623
You know,
the country basically fractured and it 

884
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:26,320
happens very frequently.
It's,

885
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,173
it's a failed state.
You get little fiefdoms of war lords 

886
00:48:30,361 --> 00:48:31,194
basically,
who are certainly no improvement over 

887
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,700
the original tyrant and they tear the 
place apart.

888
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,450
Now I'm not making a case for the 
utility of a tyrant,

889
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,613
but.

890
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:43,523
But the opposite of order is chaos and 
chaos can be just as destructive as 

891
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:49,950
tyranny or maybe it can be more 
destructive.

892
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,383
So you know,
the same thing happened to some degree 

893
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,600
with the Arab spring.
It was like,

894
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,500
okay,
poof,

895
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:57,180
chaos.
It's like everybody thinks,

896
00:48:57,181 --> 00:48:59,730
well this is a chance for a new 
beginning and you know,

897
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:03,420
it seems like in places like Tunisia 
that actually worked,

898
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:05,820
and then the things loosened up a bit in
Morocco too.

899
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:09,330
So there was some indication of some 
progress.

900
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,240
But in places like Libya,
it's like,

901
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,074
well,
that looks like it's degenerating into 

902
00:49:14,131 --> 00:49:14,964
complete hell.
And you see the same thing in many 

903
00:49:16,561 --> 00:49:19,050
places in the Middle East where the Arab
spring occurred.

904
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,573
So

905
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,533
the.
That's also why it's so necessary to 

906
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:29,730
understand what lurks behind tyranny 
because what lurks behind tyranny is not

907
00:49:29,731 --> 00:49:30,564
freedom.
It's chaos and Harris has the potential 

908
00:49:33,901 --> 00:49:34,734
for freedom,
but then it depends on what people do 

909
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:38,430
with the chaos,
so,

910
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,383
and it's not,
it's not self evident that the chaos is 

911
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,024
better than the tyranny.
And part of the reason for that is that 

912
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:48,270
in every society there are agents of 
chaos and there are people.

913
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:53,330
They're often at relatively low strata 
on the dominant Turkey.

914
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,070
They're usually young men.
They're usually extremely aggressive.

915
00:49:56,071 --> 00:49:56,904
They're usually incredibly resentful and
displaced and for them as soon as chaos 

916
00:50:01,411 --> 00:50:03,630
appears,
it's like it's open season.

917
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,760
You know,
that struck,

918
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:08,910
the society has been restructured and 
they can just go about taking everything

919
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:12,710
they want.
So you know,

920
00:50:12,711 --> 00:50:16,220
you see that even in countries like 
Canada where those are the guys who riot

921
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,630
after a hockey game,
you know,

922
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:18,464
they need no excuse whatsoever to go out
and chaos and act like absolute 

923
00:50:22,941 --> 00:50:27,941
barbarians.
Absolutely.

924
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,273
Security.

925
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,390
Yeah.
But they,

926
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,350
it's a,
it's a,

927
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,450
it's a causal interrelationship.
You know,

928
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,284
there's a whole chapter on that near in 
the last third of maps of meaning 

929
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,820
describes the relationship between the 
two halves of the adversary.

930
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,540
There's a nihilistic element and a 
fascistic element,

931
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:51,923
you know,
and once the value hierarchy falls 

932
00:50:54,771 --> 00:50:55,604
apart,
one response is let's go in there and 

933
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:00,680
get up the golden rebuild,
something,

934
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:01,543
you know,
I'd say that would be the heroic 

935
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:05,690
element,
but the adversarial element is,

936
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,060
well,
everything's falling apart.

937
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,930
It's every man for himself.
And the fascistic element would be me,

938
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:16,843
right?
I'm going to exert power not for 

939
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:20,870
competence,
dominance,

940
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:24,020
pure dominance,
and that's like rape and pillage.

941
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:26,330
That's what that is.
So,

942
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,153
you know,
in the,

943
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,153
that's what it is and you know,
if you contrast that with utter 

944
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:34,543
powerlessness,
you can see how rape and pillage might 

945
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:39,590
be attractive.
And you know,

946
00:51:39,591 --> 00:51:43,490
that's also why I think it's attractive.
Often too young men at the bottom of the

947
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:45,500
dominance hierarchy who are 
dispossessed.

948
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,040
You know the,
one of the things we know is that if you

949
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:49,874
have a fairly flat dominance hierarchy,
so that opportunity is distributed and 

950
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:57,470
there's a reasonable probability of 
getting from the bottom to the top.

951
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,600
So you have hope,
let's say.

952
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,720
Then the males at the bottom don't get 
very aggressive,

953
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,790
but if you get the damn thing pointed up
so that there's almost no possibility of

954
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:10,970
moving forward.
Even if you use competence,

955
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:12,343
then the males at the bottom,
especially the ones that are 

956
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:16,670
disagreeable,
so they would be more warrior types.

957
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,040
Man,
they get aggressive right away and there

958
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,540
are there gangs.

959
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,420
They dominate the gangs and they go to 
war with each other,

960
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,433
and the reason for that is that the 
successful gang members are far more 

961
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:29,504
successful as successful gang members.
Then they would be successful as low 

962
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:38,210
end,
poorly paid conformists.

963
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,990
Now most of the guys in the gang,
or worse off actually,

964
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:42,824
so some of the best dancer,
biological evidence that's been 

965
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:48,050
collected suggest that most people in a 
drug ring.

966
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,003
So there are the people at the bottom 
make less than they would if they were 

967
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:54,410
working for minimum wage,
but it's a lottery.

968
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,273
You know,
partly the violence helps because that 

969
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,220
top of the dam hierarchies being peeled 
off by deaths all the time.

970
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,970
So there's always the possibility that 
you're going to pop yourself up three or

971
00:53:04,971 --> 00:53:08,930
four levels and then you'll have a 
riotous old time for the next five years

972
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:09,764
till you die,
which would be a lot better than having 

973
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,670
a chaotic existence with nothing for the
next five years until you die.

974
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,650
So,
you know,

975
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:19,513
part of,
part of what society is always have to 

976
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:25,230
do is to make sure the damn dominance 
hierarchy doesn't get so steep and climb

977
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,073
a bowl that all the ordinary men at the 
bottom start to get hypervisor is well 

978
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:34,470
documented and the best work on that was
done at mcmaster.

979
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:35,803
I'm

980
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,973
can,
I can never remember the people who did 

981
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,060
the work,
unfortunately,

982
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:41,760
I can never remember their name.
It'll come to me.

983
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,983
So.
Yep.

984
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,023
So then I guess the best strategy then 
decided later to assess the potential 

985
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,863
payoff.
The manifest for her as opposed to the 

986
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,253
APP.

987
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:03,381
Right?
Right.

988
00:54:03,381 --> 00:54:04,214
But you know,
people generally don't do that 

989
00:54:05,031 --> 00:54:06,260
calculation.
You know,

990
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:08,630
remember when the Americans went into 
Iraq,

991
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:09,883
what did they think?
What was the theory will be welcomed as 

992
00:54:13,671 --> 00:54:15,320
liberator's.
Well,

993
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,240
that was actually true in some cases for
about a week,

994
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:24,740
but the problem was they wiped out the 
power structure.

995
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,560
They dismantled the army and you can see
why,

996
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:30,950
but then what the hell are all those 
soldiers going to do their soldiers.

997
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,160
They know where the weapons are.
They're not just going to sit around,

998
00:54:34,161 --> 00:54:37,760
especially not the hyper aggressive guys
who are already soldiers.

999
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,560
They're going to think to hell with 
this.

1000
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,933
You know,
it's chaos and I'm going to get what I 

1001
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:44,420
want.
It was so interesting when,

1002
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:49,280
when I saw that happening because they 
went and wiped out so damn,

1003
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,503
and then there was all these people 
stealing computers and things from the 

1004
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,390
government offices and the western media
kept saying looting,

1005
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:58,040
looting,
and I thought,

1006
00:54:58,730 --> 00:54:59,720
it's not looting.

1007
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,100
You just wiped out the legal system.
There's no legal system anymore.

1008
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,980
It's not looting because that would be 
against the law.

1009
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,710
There's no law.
You just wiped it out.

1010
00:55:09,711 --> 00:55:11,840
He was a dictator.
Now you could say,

1011
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,674
well,
those people should have followed the 

1012
00:55:13,341 --> 00:55:14,780
laws.
If it was there.

1013
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:15,823
It's like,
well you wouldn't have gone into that 

1014
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:18,884
country if it was true because that 
would only be true if the law was just 

1015
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:23,443
because if it wasn't just then why the 
hell should people are bad and if you'd 

1016
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:30,860
been tyrannized by people for 30 years 
and you could take a computer.

1017
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,620
It's like,
who's to say that isn't exactly what you

1018
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,330
should do.
You know the,

1019
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,193
the West acted like,
well actually natural law governs this 

1020
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:43,070
and Hussein is just a,
what do you call an anomaly,

1021
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,083
and so you take him out and then there's
natural law and you should follow it 

1022
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,543
because I wasn't.
Looting is no looting when there's no 

1023
00:55:49,761 --> 00:55:50,594
law

1024
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,603
like for when of like voluntarily 
yourself rather than letting the world 

1025
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,980
presented your doorstep and it's kind of
like.

1026
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,720
I think it's kind of exemplified in this
case,

1027
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:13,290
like you have to do it voluntarily,
volunteer,

1028
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,283
that you'll do it in a way that like the
fact that you care about yourself and 

1029
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:21,420
you want to have to integrate these 
things later.

1030
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,510
You just say your own dictator.

1031
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,680
You can take the care to reintegrate 
with.

1032
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,440
That's exactly.
That's exactly right.

1033
00:56:31,441 --> 00:56:32,274
So

1034
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:36,923
well they almost,
they also might blow it apart at such a 

1035
00:56:38,881 --> 00:56:42,960
high level in the hierarchy that there's
no bloody way you're going to be able to

1036
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,440
bite off and digest the huge pieces of 
that that happened to be laying around,

1037
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:51,060
you know,
so one of the,

1038
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,003
one of the,
because part of the reason I was trying 

1039
00:56:54,871 --> 00:56:55,704
to lay this out over these years is 
because I was trying to figure out 

1040
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:04,140
citizens or relationship between the 
adversarial element of the individual.

1041
00:57:04,141 --> 00:57:04,974
So that would be the park.
It's willfully blind and likes to lie 

1042
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:12,170
and tyranny and the abolition of the 
pause,

1043
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:14,730
development of,
of chaos,

1044
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,193
you know,
and the tendency for deep for things to 

1045
00:57:17,671 --> 00:57:18,504
deteriorate.
Those are all causally link and it 

1046
00:57:19,861 --> 00:57:21,780
really tight manner.
That's soldier and instance,

1047
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:25,350
observation and Frankel's observation 
and handles observation.

1048
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,470
It's the whole essence of existentialist
thought,

1049
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,753
okay,
what the hell are you supposed to do 

1050
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:36,240
about that?
And the answer seems to be don't have it

1051
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,280
happen.
And so you say,

1052
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,114
well,
when should you stand up against 

1053
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,210
tyranny?
Well,

1054
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:43,044
you should stand up against tyranny when
it manifests itself at micro levels 

1055
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:48,630
right in front of you.

1056
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,133
That's what you have to do,
and so that means you have to be awake 

1057
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,594
all the time for transgressions against 
the positive element of the individual 

1058
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:00,830
and the pause,
development of culture,

1059
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,920
and you have to do it right then and 
there and you can say,

1060
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:05,240
and people say this all the time,
well,

1061
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:08,000
I can take my boss on at work.
It's like,

1062
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:09,140
well,
what's going to happen to you?

1063
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,120
Well,
I won't get the next raise,

1064
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:13,250
or maybe they won't like me.
It's like,

1065
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,120
well,
that's fine.

1066
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:15,200
So that's,
that's.

1067
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,300
That's your courage.

1068
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,020
What are you going to do when there's a 
real tyrant?

1069
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,580
Well,
we already know the answer to that.

1070
00:58:23,581 --> 00:58:24,414
If you're not even going to stand up 
when you're protected beyond belief by 

1071
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:31,380
the structure and you have everything 
you possibly need and you could probably

1072
00:58:31,381 --> 00:58:33,870
even stand up without with and get away 
with it,

1073
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,973
or you could even stand up and you would
be more respected and the probability 

1074
00:58:38,071 --> 00:58:40,650
that your career would go properly would
increase.

1075
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:45,270
If you're not going to do it then while 
you're certainly not going to do it when

1076
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,730
it's Sadam Hussein or Adolf Hitler,
like,

1077
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,340
forget it man.
It's wait too late for that.

1078
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,013
Now the problem with that is that 
there's not a lot of self evident 

1079
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:55,930
heroism in it,
so you know,

1080
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,700
you don't get to go party in the streets
about how brave you are,

1081
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,283
but,

1082
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,193
but one of Solzhenitsyn's claims and 
Frankl as well was that it was the 

1083
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:12,891
accumulation of micro lies that built up
to produce the Nazis and the Stalinists.

1084
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,400
So it was bottom up and top down at the 
same time.

1085
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,830
Lots of causal interconnections in 
loops,

1086
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,120
but basically put up with the first 
imposition.

1087
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:26,660
It was only this big and then they put 
up with this acronym position.

1088
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,593
Then they put up with the third 
imposition and by the time they noticed 

1089
00:59:30,051 --> 00:59:34,250
that it was really like a major league 
imposition pointing it out would get you

1090
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:38,240
arrested while van man.
Then the stakes,

1091
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,860
like when does it end?
Well,

1092
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,020
it doesn't.
It doesn't end.

1093
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:45,470
It just gets worse and worse and worse 
and worse and worse.

1094
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,723
You know?
And it almost got so bad in 1962 and in 

1095
00:59:49,801 --> 00:59:50,634
1984,
it almost got so bad that we had the 

1096
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:56,120
third World War,
like it was that close.

1097
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,433
So what where it ends is apocalypse.
And so that's why you see very often in 

1098
01:00:01,191 --> 01:00:06,191
religious writings that the sins of the 
individual are linked to the apocalypse.

1099
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,700
The reason for that is their link to the
apocalypse.

1100
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:14,150
That's why it's just that you don't see 
the causal connections.

1101
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,550
So.
Okay.

1102
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,910
So any questions about that too?

1103
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:21,903
Okay.
So there's the representations in a bit 

1104
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,550
more visible for.
So you know,

1105
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,393
this is,
you're trying to get the thing on the 

1106
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:29,434
left to be working properly and you're 
trying to stop the thing on the right 

1107
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:33,100
from taking over completely.
And it's,

1108
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,350
it's a real balance because you don't 
know,

1109
01:00:35,351 --> 01:00:37,120
for example,
even with your own children,

1110
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,430
how the hell do you know when you're 
tyrannizing them?

1111
01:00:39,431 --> 01:00:41,170
And how do you know when you're 
socializing them?

1112
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,900
One of the things that I noticed with my
kids,

1113
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:44,734
and this was much to my Chagrin,
was lots of times I was confining them 

1114
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,590
in a tyrannical manner because they were
having too much fun,

1115
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:55,223
you know,
because you always think you're 

1116
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:56,740
punishing your kid,
so to speak.

1117
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:58,270
When they're doing something bad,
it's like,

1118
01:00:58,330 --> 01:00:58,931
no,
you're not,

1119
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:01,150
you're yelling at them because they're 
running about like,

1120
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,370
you know,
completely insane,

1121
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:04,204
impulsive,
manic hyenas and they're having a great 

1122
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:07,810
time.
And so you say,

1123
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:08,980
calm down,
you know,

1124
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,960
what do you treat,
what are you going to turn them into?

1125
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,003
Some kid that can sit there and their 
desk for eight hours when they're in 

1126
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:16,450
grade two and not complaint.
It's like,

1127
01:01:16,451 --> 01:01:19,360
is that an improvement?
Well,

1128
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,500
yes and no.
So

1129
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:26,843
I also noticed with my kids that when I 
was more tyrannical than might be 

1130
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:33,810
popular now,
especially with my son,

1131
01:01:34,470 --> 01:01:37,890
I cracked down on them now and then 
because he's been a little rodent and he

1132
01:01:37,891 --> 01:01:39,710
was really,
he was really pushy.

1133
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,160
He's a dominant kid,
you know,

1134
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,050
and I don't know if you've ever had a 
dominant dog,

1135
01:01:43,051 --> 01:01:45,620
but you have to flip those things over,
you know,

1136
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,553
on their back all the time because 
otherwise they just push and push and 

1137
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:54,051
push and he was sort of like that and so
he'd get all uppity and then I talked to

1138
01:01:54,151 --> 01:01:55,590
my wife and we'd say,
all right,

1139
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,030
so we're not going to let him get away 
with.

1140
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:59,490
He can't even breathe wrong for the next
two weeks,

1141
01:01:59,491 --> 01:02:00,324
you know.
So every time he did a micro mistake we 

1142
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:04,180
were on him and I thought,
you know,

1143
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,273
this is a bit much.
But what was so bloody weird about that 

1144
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:09,600
was every time I did that he liked me 
better.

1145
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,690
It was so interesting,
you know,

1146
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:15,300
but I think it's very much like the 
situation with the dominant dog.

1147
01:02:15,301 --> 01:02:16,134
It's like partly what the dog wants to 
know is who the hell is in and if it's 

1148
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,780
you,
he's perfectly happy about that.

1149
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,150
But he doesn't want there to be any 
ambivalence about it.

1150
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:25,433
So.

1151
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:29,251
Oh,
well,

1152
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:30,240
like if he,
if he,

1153
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,253
if he did anything that I thought was a 
little crooked or a little dab into a 

1154
01:02:33,571 --> 01:02:36,720
little too pushy,
what I would usually do with him is make

1155
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:38,550
them sit on the steps,
you know,

1156
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:39,061
I'd say,
okay,

1157
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:39,894
here's the deal.
He could communicate more or less at 

1158
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:44,370
this point because he was around two and
a half to three.

1159
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,533
The deal was you sit there until you've 
got yourself controlled and you're 

1160
01:02:50,251 --> 01:02:51,084
willing to be a civilized human being 
and then you can come back to me and 

1161
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:57,840
tell me that and if I like you then I'll
let you come up.

1162
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,610
So.
Because you know,

1163
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:03,600
sometimes you'll have a kid do that and 
they'll come back and they say what they

1164
01:03:03,601 --> 01:03:06,330
think you want to hear,
but they don't mean it.

1165
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:07,980
And so you think,
oh,

1166
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,080
I'll give him a chance,
but that you can't do that.

1167
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:15,080
You have to see if you like the kid now 
because if they come up properly and say

1168
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:18,870
things so that it's,
it's true all the way down instantly.

1169
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,380
If you have any sense,
you're not angry at them anymore,

1170
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:21,871
you think?
Yeah,

1171
01:03:21,871 --> 01:03:24,750
I like that kid and then so,
so,

1172
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:25,643
so you know,
if your goal is to produce a kid that 

1173
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:29,550
you really like,
which I think is a really good goal,

1174
01:03:29,551 --> 01:03:33,030
then you don't let them off the damn 
hook until he's that kid.

1175
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,073
And so it was really interesting to 
watch what that did to him and I think 

1176
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:37,044
it was part of cortical integration and 
cortical integration of hypothalamic 

1177
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:42,690
impulses.
He'd sit on the damn steps like this.

1178
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:47,850
No,
just enraged and I go over to,

1179
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:48,451
I mean,
I'd say,

1180
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:49,020
well,
you know,

1181
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:51,540
are you ready to get off the steps yet?
And he'd go,

1182
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:53,820
no.

1183
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,653
And then he'd get himself together and 
then he'd come and talk to me and then 

1184
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,050
I'm like,
my rule was it's,

1185
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,500
as soon as he did it right,
it was over,

1186
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,180
no grudges,
nothing.

1187
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,670
It was done,
you know.

1188
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,563
And so that was also very rewarding for 
him because he could specify the length 

1189
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:10,164
of punishment,
the length of punishment was as long as 

1190
01:04:11,701 --> 01:04:13,770
it took them,
just start acting like a civilized human

1191
01:04:13,771 --> 01:04:14,604
being again.
And the consequence of that was end of 

1192
01:04:17,081 --> 01:04:18,720
problem.
So that's,

1193
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,620
you know,
that seems to,

1194
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:23,550
that's like tit for tat fundamentally 
bug me whack.

1195
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,670
But as soon as your straight again,
poof,

1196
01:04:26,671 --> 01:04:28,110
we'll,
we'll try it again.

1197
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,150
So,
and you know,

1198
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:33,300
what I noticed about him in particular,
and he was a dominant kid,

1199
01:04:33,301 --> 01:04:34,134
was

1200
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,680
you know,
you'd set a rule,

1201
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,290
whatever the rule was,
like you had to be,

1202
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,270
maybe you had to go to bed at eight or 
something.

1203
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,580
It was like,
well what happens if I wait until eight,

1204
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:44,720
15,
you know,

1205
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:46,400
or eight,
oh five or eight,

1206
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:47,234
10.
Like he,

1207
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:52,250
he just push until he knew exactly where
the line was very pushy,

1208
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:54,590
but it was also extraordinarily 
exploratory,

1209
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:57,680
right?
Because someone says there's a rule,

1210
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,010
but you don't know what that means.
So what do you do?

1211
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:01,993
You harass and push and push and 
harassed until you find out where the 

1212
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:05,804
boundary actually is.
And if it's nice and firm and doesn't 

1213
01:05:08,211 --> 01:05:09,980
move around,
then you think,

1214
01:05:09,981 --> 01:05:11,540
oh,
that's like a table.

1215
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,700
And if I stand up underneath it,
I going to whack my head.

1216
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:16,550
So I won't do that.
And then you move onto something else.

1217
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:19,090
But if the boundaries are going like 
this all the time,

1218
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:23,800
the kid will just torture you forever.
So which is exactly what he should do.

1219
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:25,543
So

1220
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:27,893
I think whether or not you are going to 
tyrannized your child in the final 

1221
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:37,530
analysis depends on exactly what acting 
ethically in general depends on which is

1222
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:39,023
in the final analysis.
Do you want to make things better or 

1223
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:45,870
worse?
What he aimed at and you know you,

1224
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:48,540
there isn't a way of.
There isn't really a way of

1225
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,590
managing that unless you get the whole 
hierarchy clear in your head.

1226
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,983
You know,
do you want to make the world a better 

1227
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:57,160
place?
Well part of that is,

1228
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:57,994
do you think it should exist at all?
Are you resentful because it's tragic 

1229
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,223
and limited?
Are you angry because you're not as 

1230
01:06:03,881 --> 01:06:04,714
successful as you could be?
Do you have 85 unresolved things with 

1231
01:06:07,811 --> 01:06:09,040
your wife?
You know,

1232
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,250
are you intimidated by your child?
If he happens to be successful,

1233
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,380
maybe he's going to be more successful 
than you.

1234
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:15,773
You know,
you think you're going to be able to 

1235
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,940
tolerate that.
No.

1236
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,870
Those are all questions you have to 
think through.

1237
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:21,940
And you need answers to them,
you know,

1238
01:06:21,941 --> 01:06:25,840
and if your goal is I'm trying to 
produce a child who's better than me,

1239
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,423
first of all,
then you have to admit that there could 

1240
01:06:28,391 --> 01:06:30,880
possibly be something that would be 
better than you,

1241
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,193
you know,
and then you have to think that it's 

1242
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:33,814
actually your responsibility to 
facilitate that and you have to be 

1243
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:37,684
committed to it and without that,
well to the degree that you haven't got 

1244
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:45,134
that formulated and articulated and 
embedded in you and acting it out in 

1245
01:06:48,801 --> 01:06:50,660
your household,
you're going to be a tyrant,

1246
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:54,800
especially when you're tired and upset 
and hungry and you know,

1247
01:06:54,801 --> 01:06:57,800
maybe you failed at something and you've
had an argument with your wife or.

1248
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,473
So

1249
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:02,120
I don't think there's any general rules 
except,

1250
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:02,954
you know,
have a relationship with the kid and 

1251
01:07:03,681 --> 01:07:04,514
keep your eyes open and made sure that 
you're aiming at what's best for that 

1252
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:08,683
child.
And you have to love the child to do 

1253
01:07:11,601 --> 01:07:12,434
that.
And then you have to figure out which 

1254
01:07:13,341 --> 01:07:14,930
part of the child you actually love.

1255
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:16,803
So,

1256
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:18,741
you know,
in,

1257
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:21,150
in therapy,
I always envisioned myself rogers.

1258
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:25,170
It was unconditional positive regard.
That isn't the way I look at it.

1259
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:29,550
It's like if you come for me to therapy,
I'm on the side of you that wants things

1260
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:30,384
to be good.
I am not on this side of you that does 

1261
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,530
not want things to be good.
You know,

1262
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:35,364
and we have to sort that out and I'm 
assuming that the reason that you're 

1263
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:41,160
coming for therapy is because you would 
rather than things were going to be good

1264
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,743
and so I don't even think it's 
appropriate to be on the side of the 

1265
01:07:44,521 --> 01:07:47,520
client that is aimed at death and 
misery.

1266
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:48,863
You know,
the fact that it's there means doesn't 

1267
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:54,870
mean you should throw the person back 
out on the street,

1268
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,580
you know,
because it's there.

1269
01:07:56,670 --> 01:07:57,503
So in that sense,
the regard in some sense is 

1270
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:00,540
unconditional.

1271
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:04,230
It isn't done conditional.
It's not the right way of thinking about

1272
01:08:04,231 --> 01:08:07,590
it.
You make a contract which is okay.

1273
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,783
Our purpose is to narrow the influence 
of evil and expand the influence of 

1274
01:08:13,081 --> 01:08:13,914
good,
and we're going to tell the truth each 

1275
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:16,214
other and an attempt to figure out how 
we do that and we're not going to blow 

1276
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,120
the relationship apart if horrible 
things come up,

1277
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,133
as long as we're both convinced that 
that's what we're aiming for and the 

1278
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,374
communication is actually honest and so 
it's unconditional in that you won't 

1279
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:34,640
break it if things happen that are 
pretty unseemly,

1280
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,040
but it's conditional in that no,
no.

1281
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:37,874
I'm on the side of you that's going to 
tell the truth and that's going to aim 

1282
01:08:39,831 --> 01:08:43,250
towards the good and that's actually 
what you want from me.

1283
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,900
You know,
it's sort of impartial.

1284
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,460
What time is it?
Okay,

1285
01:08:50,461 --> 01:08:52,140
let's,
let's stop for 10 minutes.
