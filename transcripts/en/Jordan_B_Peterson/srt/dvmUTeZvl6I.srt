1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,630
Welcome,
my name is Barbara.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm the president of blue matter 
project,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,040
uft chapter.
On behalf of my team,

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,560
we thank you for deciding to spend your 
night with us.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,083
Our mission at the matter project has 
been to provide the resources that we 

6
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:21,734
believe would be beneficial to the 
mental health of our fellow students at 

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,833
u of c because a healthy mind is crucial
for success at this university and I 

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,940
think we all know that maintaining such 
as fade is no easy task.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,493
I'm going to be asking you a few 
questions and I hope that you 

10
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,450
participate by simply raising your hand.
If the question applies to you,

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,940
how many of your currently undergraduate
students,

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,873
how many of you have had a radical 
change in your core beliefs after 

13
00:00:49,851 --> 00:00:50,684
entering university?
How many of you have been reasonably 

14
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,960
stressed out throughout your university 
life?

15
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,043
How many of you have wondered at least 
once in your life what the point of it 

16
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,990
all is our confused about how you should
deal with the situation?

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,283
If most of these questions apply to you,
then you have at least I hope come to 

18
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:18,190
the right place.
If they don't apply to you personally,

19
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,700
get some coffee with you on me to see 
how the hell you do what you do,

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,330
just getting on Brooks,
so probably have to split the company.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,403
The person who I have the honor of 
introducing tonight that I considered 

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,340
with significant influence on me,
I most likely on any of you who are also

23
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,860
familiar with his work.
If you don't believe me,

24
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,023
you can check the rate my prospect site 
or did you have some comments on these 

25
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,094
lectures you said you you will see the 
words such as mind boggling and life 

26
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:44,944
changing very frequently.
I was first introduced to him in the 

27
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:53,290
first TEDX UFC event back in 2015 when I
was in my first year of study at UFT.

28
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,283
He was the first speaker at Tedx and the
title of his talk was potential as a 

29
00:01:59,141 --> 00:01:59,974
life science.
As students just finished a series of 

30
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:03,310
courses in biology,
chemistry,

31
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,144
and mathematics.
I could immediately see that his 

32
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:10,930
perspective on life was radically 
different compared to the perspective of

33
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,610
other lecturers I had listened to 
before.

34
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,190
As a result,
I found it difficult to connect with the

35
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:18,024
content of his talk at first,
but it was nevertheless interested in 

36
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,520
his perspective.
Fast forward two years later,

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,593
Dan,
which I didn't hear any talk even 

38
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:29,400
remotely similar to that are facing the 
Tedx talk and I took a psychology course

39
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,234
called personality and its 
transformations without initially 

40
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
knowing that he was taught by him and 
how fortunate I consider myself to have 

41
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,820
decided to take that course.
This course,

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,130
along with his other course called maps 
of meaning,

43
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,173
how far being among the select your 
courses that I genuinely have enjoyed 

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,553
trying to extent that I have watched 
some victories over and over solely out 

45
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,394
of interest.
I presume by now you're have your 

46
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,110
constant.
What's the word?

47
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,943
Obsessed means?
Our speaker tonight has a bachelor of 

48
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,014
arts in political science and a bachelor
of arts in psychology from the 

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
University of Alberta.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,390
He received his phd in clinical 
psychology from Mcgill University.

51
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,763
He taught at Harvard University as an 
assistant and an associate professor 

52
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,544
from 1993 to 1998.
He then returned to Canada and took a 

53
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:13,514
tenured position at the University of 
Toronto and has been teaching here ever 

54
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,820
since.
He's the author of maps of meaning,

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,540
the architecture of belief as more than 
96 published articles,

56
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,963
he stocks are sincere and eloquence and 
presenting content of unfathomable 

57
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,430
depth.
He has attempted to present the forms of

58
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,264
untruth that we should both pay 
attention and not fall prey to in order 

59
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:39,130
to find truth and ultimately leaning,
leading a meaningful life.

60
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,830
I'm sure you are.
As excited as I am.

61
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,530
So we sent you to stock tonight and 
without further ado,

62
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,270
please join me in welcoming Dr Peterson.

63
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,580
Thank you.

64
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,690
Thanks.
That was

65
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,963
one of the things that struck me
asking those questions is how many of 

66
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,880
you have been,
you know,

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,550
pretty stressed out by your university 
experience and I killed them.

68
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,473
Really.
Think,

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,210
how many of you were second year 
students?

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,630
Okay.
How many are third year?

71
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,130
First Year of their.
They're too busy.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,150
So.
So anyways,

73
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,310
that was the case when I was an 
undergraduate.

74
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,420
I enjoyed my undergraduate degree and 
um,

75
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,103
I went to a small place to begin with,
which was just a community college in 

76
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,674
northern Alberta.
That was actually a huge advantage 

77
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:54,211
because I had the small classes,
the big classes at 38 and the people who

78
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,023
were teaching there really liked to 
teach and although they might not have 

79
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:04,951
known as much as might conceivably be,
they were excellent teachers and they do

80
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,120
a lot more than me and that was 
sufficient and so I really liked that.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,073
I learned a lot in the first year that I
did in my entire school career prior to 

82
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:17,560
that,
which is partly to do with me and partly

83
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,394
to do with the schools.
And then when I went to the University 

84
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,383
of Alberta I,
it was less enjoyable because it got 

85
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:27,540
more formulaic,
but I still have a good time.

86
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,820
I wouldn't say that I was stressed 
particular,

87
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,380
you know what I mean?
No,

88
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,810
I wouldn't say that.
I would say I was probably less stressed

89
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:38,220
in the university that I was in.
High school pays better and I think that

90
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,063
that was.
I think that was probably the case for 

91
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:46,020
most of my peers,
the people I knew with the score,

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,913
so you know,
things have changed since then and I 

93
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:56,600
think
some of those changes put undue stress.

94
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,283
I mean the first is that your ability to
access careers of certainty has 

95
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,034
declined.

96
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,240
Like for those of you who want to become
a clinical psychologist for example,

97
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:14,510
or who wants to go to medical school,
it's insanely difficult.

98
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,373
It's no wonder you're stressed.
My nephew tried to get into medical 

99
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:20,950
school three years ago and I mean that 
kids,

100
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,960
bright man I was watching him do those
is that online set of exercises that are

101
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,854
supposed to make you more intelligent 
but the mosby and he was doing amazing 

102
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,710
exercise where you have to maneuver his 
way through a maze as well.

103
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,573
It was rotating.
You're treating them and that guy could 

104
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,900
do that just like in the standing still.
It was really amazing.

105
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,070
We had a four point zero average from 
queens and he had.

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,400
He was a like a really high level soccer
player and he was a,

107
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,600
he's a good guy,
you know,

108
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:51,434
he's the sort of person you just hate 
because not only are they good at 

109
00:06:53,391 --> 00:06:56,090
everything,
they're actually great people

110
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,740
and a medical school.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,153
What the hell?
He had 99th percentile and he couldn't 

112
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,880
get into medical school.
I thought,

113
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,950
what the hell?
How stupid is that?

114
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Because obviously that's a wasted 
talent,

115
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:13,274
right?
It's obviously a waste of talent and 

116
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,403
it's a betrayal as well,
people's because he hit the ball out of 

117
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,484
the park on multiple dimensions and 
still had to walk through three extra 

118
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:25,010
two extra years of hoops.
He finally got into medical school,

119
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:25,844
but man,
he shouldn't be in a shoe in and by 

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,613
getting into clinical psychology,
which is another one that I'm very 

121
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,500
familiar with it,
you know,

122
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,033
I can tell you how to do it.
You have to have a higher grade point 

123
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,010
average because otherwise you have to 
have good gres.

124
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,780
In fact,
you probably have to have great juniors,

125
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:45,614
but then what you have to do is you have
to apply it everywhere because it's a 

126
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,300
laundry.

127
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,300
So you have to apply to 30 place and so 
remember that because it's a water and a

128
00:07:57,051 --> 00:07:57,884
lot of these things are lot of reasons.
So what you do in the base rate of 

129
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,000
rejection is extremely high.
It's first of all,

130
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:02,834
don't beat yourself up about it because 
it's the base rate of rejection is 

131
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:09,410
really high and you'll get rejected.
It has nothing to do with you,

132
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,350
the base rate taught and you really have
to learn that in life.

133
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,213
You know that the base rate of rejection
for most worthwhile things is like 95 

134
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:22,031
percent and it's hitting I think in many
situations it's getting the odds against

135
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:25,064
you or actually increased.
Now there's some other positive things 

136
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,090
about the way things are going.
You know what I mean?

137
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,453
Maybe you have access to the forms of 
opportunities that would have been 

138
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:33,794
unimaginable to me,
but a lot of those are also wanting to 

139
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,860
monetize.

140
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,470
So that's,
that's an increasing problem,

141
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,460
especially if you're a creative person.
So,

142
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,193
so you know,
there's been this ramp up and 

143
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:49,160
competition and it's partly because the 
certain jobs,

144
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,994
as I said,
are difficult to obtain law laws the 

145
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,740
same way and increasingly even having a 
career as a lawyer is more risky than it

146
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,574
was say 20 years ago because a lot of 
lies being nibbled to death by 

147
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,923
technological transformation.
And of course journalism that's out to 

148
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,250
most creative enterprises are out 
because he can't monetize.

149
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,360
You guys also look forward to a job 
career trajectory.

150
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:14,550
What are you going to be changing jobs 
very often.

151
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,750
And so one of the things that I would 
recommend is get used to that it good at

152
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,653
it.
Have you been CP it used to doing 

153
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,313
interviews.
He ready to move at the drop of a hat 

154
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,343
and keep your options open because a lot
of you in order to rush yourself up the 

155
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:29,814
career ladder where to have to be 
partners and you're going to have to 

156
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,820
have options at hap.

157
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,043
And so whenever you're employed you 
might want to be looking for other 

158
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,674
opportunities that you can use as 
bargaining chips so that you need to 

159
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,810
transfer.
You know,

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,673
cross it up or you can use that as a 
hammer to lap your employers on the 

161
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:49,800
heads way because you're going to have 
to be candy and tough and you know,

162
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:53,670
the upper end rewards insanely odd,
but it's a lot higher,

163
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,533
harder to climb into that category.
So I think that's part of the reason 

164
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:58,430
that you're stressed,
you know,

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,273
is that your future is more variable and
more uncertain than people's future was 

166
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,550
when I was in university.
So that would have been in,

167
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,443
in the early eighties and certainly much
more uncertain than people in the 

168
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,200
sixties.
People's,

169
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,303
the people in the sixties,
their concern was that they were going 

170
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:21,420
to graduate.
They have a job that would last the rest

171
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,080
of their life that would pay well and 
know and then they're concerned with how

172
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,430
oppressive that was going to be.

173
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,853
No,
it looks pretty damn pathetic in 

174
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:30,600
retrospect.
So,

175
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,750
but you guys don't have that worry.
So we're even with that.

176
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:36,060
So you know,
part of the reason I'm telling you,

177
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,483
because if your stress,
the first thing you gotta do is figure 

178
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:41,904
out how much of that to you and how much
of it is situation because it isn't 

179
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:49,530
necessarily going to make it less 
stressful to know that it's situational,

180
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:54,000
but at least you could dispense with 
some of the guilt and self criticism.

181
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,100
And also,
for example,

182
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,200
in publishing just for scientific 
articles.

183
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,930
If you want to publish in a journal,
there's a one percent acceptance rate.

184
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,240
So you have to assume that you're going 
to get it a lot

185
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,813
and the best things you ever get.
If you're trying to publish papers that 

186
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,123
that paper really sucks.
But if you do a lot of work on it and 

187
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,123
maybe rewrite it,
rewrite it completely and do a few more 

188
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:22,620
studies of the same sort and they will 
tend to really send it out for review.

189
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,933
And that's like time for a party.
And a lot of the things that you're 

190
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:28,650
going to do in your life.
We're going to be like that.

191
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,180
Like they're very low probability events
and there'll be able to gradually.

192
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,103
But they are so you need to know that 
because otherwise you will take 

193
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:38,004
responsibility for that onto yourself 
and normally taking responsibility is a 

194
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:42,504
good thing,
but you want to take responsibility for 

195
00:11:44,611 --> 00:11:47,020
the things that you're responsible for 
and you know,

196
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,903
parcel out external circumstances,
could they external work and so with 

197
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,154
conscientious people and you know a 
fairly large number of you are going to 

198
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,520
be above average and conscientiousness 
are,

199
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,363
you wouldn't have gotten to where you 
are because you're above average in 

200
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,780
intelligence and above average in 
conscientiousness.

201
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,853
Is it conscientious?
People often feel guilty and also if 

202
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,260
they're not doing as well as they 
expected,

203
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,720
they automatically assume that there's 
something wrong with them.

204
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,360
Now that can be a useful adaptive style 
because generally if things aren't going

205
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:24,361
your way the way it changed this to 
change things that you can control,

206
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,380
right?
So if you're thinking it's situational,

207
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,214
there's not much you can do about that.
And so sometimes there's utility in 

208
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:33,670
focusing in on your micro path said I'm 
all for that.

209
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,320
You know,
you got to take responsibility.

210
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:39,310
But it's easy for conscientious people 
to take excess responsibility.

211
00:12:39,311 --> 00:12:41,860
And so for example,
they do very badly if they're unemployed

212
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,790
and because they feel like losers,
you know,

213
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,903
and then they attributed that to 
themselves and that can easily go too 

214
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:53,470
far.
So the first thing is,

215
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:57,730
you know,
you have reason to be stressed.

216
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,653
Now another thing that's happened is no.
One of the things you might ask 

217
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:02,824
yourself,
is it better to be a little a big fish 

218
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:06,010
in a little pond,
little fish in a big pond.

219
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,450
And I would say generally speaking,
it's better to be a big fish in a little

220
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,910
point.
And you guys made a mistake by coming to

221
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:15,550
the University of Toronto on that 
diminished.

222
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,600
And I saw this when I worked in schools 
in the United States.

223
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,490
It was quite interesting watching the 
students there.

224
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:24,050
So those were the Harvard students 
because you know,

225
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:24,884
the diabetic students have a reputation 
for being arrogant and I think that's 

226
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,690
more or less something that's carried 
over from the time,

227
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,360
you know,
schools we're really interested,

228
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,480
chronic,
you know,

229
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,280
and it was mostly based on economic 
factors and familial connections.

230
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:38,910
It's not like that anymore.
The Saudi agreement.

231
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,683
The thing that was interesting about the
Harvard students is that they were the 

232
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:43,714
top of the class wherever they were,
and maybe they get the smartest people 

233
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:49,150
they knew and when they came to her and 
they were,

234
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,260
they were in the middle for almost 
everything in the bottom for some things

235
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,094
and the days of being the smartest 
person in the room were seriously over 

236
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,030
and so it was really hard,
you know,

237
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,710
but it was.

238
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,543
It was alluded to some degrees because 
they were now with the non 

239
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:04,044
representative sample of people and so 
you're also with the non representative 

240
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,224
sample of people and so average in a 
high school is that's it's nothing if 

241
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,334
you're thinking about it from an 
actuarial perspective and a 

242
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,514
probabilistic perspective than not.
There's nothing to be surprised about 

243
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,430
and that's something else to keep in 
mind.

244
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,743
Now,
the downside of course is that wherever 

245
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,220
you go in your life,
what will happen is you keep quiet until

246
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,054
the people.
You're competing with her approximately 

247
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:32,874
as good at things as you are,
and so that that performance tension 

248
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,840
that you feel is something that probably
will never go away.

249
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,590
Hopefully you'll end up playing games 
that are fair where if you work hard and

250
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,443
you do a good job,
that'll actually translated into 

251
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,304
success,
but I suspect that that's going to be 

252
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:49,630
the case.

253
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,720
The majority of you know,
because intelligence is a good predictor

254
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:55,610
of longterm outcome and so it's 
conscientious.

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,350
People who can do things are rare,
really rare and one of the things you'll

256
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,640
find in the workplace is that if you can
do things and you're reliable and honest

257
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:08,510
and all those things and someone finally
notices that opened doors for you,

258
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,353
like math and that's something about 
especially I would say especially 

259
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:16,670
entrepreneurial enterprises that are 
functioning well.

260
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:20,200
It's something that's underplaying when 
they were described.

261
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,373
People who do a good job with things 
almost always want to create 

262
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:26,910
opportunities for other people who do a 
good job at things.

263
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,950
It's actually a part of the.
If you're a successful,

264
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,150
one of the perks of being successful is 
that you get to mentor young people have

265
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,523
opportunity and possibility and help 
them and that's rewarding in and of 

266
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:40,310
itself.

267
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,210
And all the people I know who are high 
performing people who are powerful,

268
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:47,740
they all love doing that.
So know.

269
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,673
So there's places you're going to find 
that are going to be relatively 

270
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,060
inviting.
But having said all that,

271
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,983
you know,
there's a lot of uncertainty in the 

272
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:56,114
future.
There's a lot of technological 

273
00:15:56,841 --> 00:16:01,070
transformation and it isn't obvious 
what's going on in the future.

274
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,440
So,
so a lot of,

275
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,210
a lot of it's situational.
And then you know,

276
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,653
the other thing that's happened to some 
degree is that there's an undue amount 

277
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:16,571
of emphasis placed on let's say,
grades as the criteria that we'll select

278
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,644
you for the next level of attainment 
because I think it starts to become a 

279
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:25,520
mistake.
So I think people purely on the basis of

280
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,560
race,
once you're above about say a,

281
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:29,660
b plus or a minus,
something like that,

282
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,523
because people start to gerrymander 
their education so that they increase 

283
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,260
the probability that it'll get straight 
a's.

284
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,093
And so they don't take the courses that 
are interested in a course to still get 

285
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:40,214
a's in logically,
so they twist and untangle their 

286
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,290
interaction with the educational system 
so that they get the output,

287
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,290
the system demands.
And I think that's really not good.

288
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,700
You know,
I think an optimal level academic record

289
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,773
is actually one where there's a fair bit
of high attainment with some outliers 

290
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,573
now because it kind of indicates that 
you're not obsessively focused on your 

291
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:07,280
grades because you shouldn't be on 
sensitively focused on them.

292
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,114
You should be focused on them.
And also maybe that you're willing to 

293
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:10,754
take the chance to step outside of your 
domain of comfort in hope of getting 

294
00:17:14,661 --> 00:17:17,180
educated.
But of course that isn't how it is.

295
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,190
So you're,
you're also stuck with that.

296
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,220
So I'm from a practical perspective,
I mean,

297
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,054
one of the things that I've done that 
you guys could probably take advantage 

298
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,054
of if you wanted to,
I'd be interested for a long time on 

299
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,930
what interventions might help people 
obtain the awkward in motivation to move

300
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:42,440
forward and the minimum of uncertainty 
and stress.

301
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,273
And I could tell you some things that 
you can engage in that are going to 

302
00:17:46,611 --> 00:17:48,290
help.
They're going to help optimize,

303
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,390
you're going to help optimize your life
and there's some exercises you can do.

304
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,900
This exercise called the future 
authoring program,

305
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,734
which is online at [inaudible] dot com 
and we've used that now with thousands 

306
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,590
of university students,
mostly in Europe,

307
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,760
but we also just random Mohawk college 
intro students at Mohawk college through

308
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:10,594
it,
and it raises their grade point average 

309
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,210
25 percent drop out rate by about the 
same.

310
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,630
And so what the future authoring program
does is help you.

311
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,453
It fills a niche in your education that 
is pathologically underfilled for 

312
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:26,940
reasons that I can't really quite 
comprehend,

313
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:31,260
but I've looked into to some degree
which is,

314
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,750
and it's really the purpose of the 
humanities,

315
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,210
which is I think in many ways speak for 
God.

316
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,370
The issue is who the hell are you and 
where you would go,

317
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,243
where are you going?

318
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,850
And then the subsidiary issues are why,
why are you doing that?

319
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,910
And those are not optional us,
like they're philosophical questions but

320
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:50,874
true philosophical questions.
They're not decoration on the business 

321
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:55,044
of life.
There are the most fundamental possible 

322
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,110
issues that you can grapple with and if 
you don't grapple with them property,

323
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,213
you'll get flattened because you'll be 
wheat and wheat means you won't be able 

324
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,290
to express without falling apart and 
life is full and stress.

325
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,303
And so if you can't tolerate it,
you'll fall apart and that's just not 

326
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:15,240
good.
And so,

327
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:16,074
you know,
part of what you need to figure out is 

328
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:17,934
what makes you
condition optimally in some sense for 

329
00:19:22,951 --> 00:19:23,784
battle.
It's not just that because it's also 

330
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:25,734
cooperation,

331
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,230
but

332
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,480
you need both of those metaphors in 
order to,

333
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,570
to consider the situation properly.
The future authoring program asks

334
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,693
people

335
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,520
to formulate a vision of themselves to 
formulate an ideal for themselves.

336
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,413
And it's not a Nietzschean kind of 
formulation under the things that need 

337
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,134
to discuss when he was describing the 
collapse of values first in western 

338
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,980
civilization and then maybe around the 
world,

339
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:57,730
the classic traditional balance.
So as that,

340
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,050
people would have to create their own 
values as a replacement,

341
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,610
but it's,
uh,

342
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,783
it's too good.
It's an erroneous demand in some sense 

343
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:08,010
because first of all,
you can't create.

344
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,490
You're smart enough and you don't live 
long.

345
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,330
You have to rely on your culture
and second,

346
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,630
you just can't create your own values 
because you can't cost yourself around.

347
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,590
You are a certain way who have certain 
interests.

348
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,433
You had what prophylaxis.
You have certain inadequacies and 

349
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:25,734
weaknesses that may be very tightly 
aligned with your strengths is 

350
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,753
complicated and so basically what you 
have to do is discovered in some sense 

351
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:38,760
what your values are and aligning 
yourself with the property.

352
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,340
And so the future authoring program does
that basically asks you to envision.

353
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,663
Look,
one thing I've observed about people is 

354
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:54,080
that part of the reason people don't get
what they want to do that and you're not

355
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,800
going to get something with it.
That's for sure,

356
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,340
and the more precisely targeted your 
vision is and more clearly laid out what

357
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:05,764
you want is the higher the probability 
that you're going to get it and it's 

358
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:13,090
partly because you'll be moving ahead 
like an organized and crystalline entity

359
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,493
and you'll be basically moving through 
much because other people are much less 

360
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:18,574
concerned about stopping you.
Then you are concerned about going 

361
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:21,244
forward and so things will move away 
from you and they do that quite 

362
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,200
dramatically,
so it's.

363
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,073
It's a nontrivial,
a nontrivial utility to get your act 

364
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,100
together,
point yourself in the proper direction.

365
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,870
The question might be,
well,

366
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:35,650
how do you do that?

367
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,680
And I've tried to think about that from 
a practical perspective.

368
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:42,310
I mean the first thing is
what do you want,

369
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,283
and that doesn't mean it actually 
doesn't mean what you want because when 

370
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:47,914
people think that they can,
because we're in the theory of the 

371
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:50,964
stick,
they tend to think about that in terms 

372
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:53,430
of acquisition.
It's like,

373
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,303
what do you want for Christmas?
And that's it's understandable and it's 

374
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,300
not wrong.
It's just second rate.

375
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,240
It isn't.
It isn't as good as it could be and it's

376
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,370
not good enough.
Really what you should be thinking about

377
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:07,204
is what sort of character you want to 
have and the reason we want to think 

378
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:14,311
about that is because your character is 
your motive force forward and your armor

379
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,103
and if it's not well developed then 
you're weak and you're going to get run 

380
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:21,814
over and so you're.
The primary purpose of education is the 

381
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:28,930
development of character and it's not.

382
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,710
It's not the sort of you should be like 
this if you're a good person.

383
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,470
It's not prescriptive,
not if it's not.

384
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,300
If it's deep,
it's,

385
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,893
it's what are what,
what under what conditions would you be 

386
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:42,604
willing to be satisfied with your life?
And this is a very important question 

387
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:47,284
because it's not that easy to be 
satisfied with your life and this is 

388
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,663
partly where our education system leaves
people terribly astray because you know 

389
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,343
the bone headed noise,
it's all about being happy and that is 

390
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:03,931
not good because life is suffering.
It is.

391
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,890
And then having established that you can
say,

392
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:09,671
Oh yeah,
okay,

393
00:23:09,671 --> 00:23:10,650
I get it.
I see.

394
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,493
That's why things are like this.
Then you can start thinking about what 

395
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:14,464
you might do about that,
but if you start from the earliest 

396
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,980
presupposition that the default 
condition of human experiences,

397
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,823
happiness,
you're just done from the start because 

398
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:23,764
every time you're unhappy,
you're going to think you're not going 

399
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:28,060
to conclude that you're inadequate,
so you're not inadequate.

400
00:23:28,061 --> 00:23:29,320
That's just how it is.

401
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,170
The question is how do you deal with 
them and so we'll just say,

402
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:36,420
well,
you're destined to suffer.

403
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:37,254
You destined to lose your parents.
You're destined to be unhappy in your 

404
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,350
career,
at least from time to time.

405
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:42,184
You're destined to fight with your 
closest intimate friends and perhaps to 

406
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:45,604
be divorced and have sick children and 
could develop some sort of horrible 

407
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:48,884
disease yourself and like there's a lot 
of things coming forward at you and 

408
00:23:52,671 --> 00:23:54,290
Lauren have you are experienced those 
things.

409
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,230
So like giving all that.
Why don't people are.

410
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,810
This was just hopeless.
There's nothing new about it,

411
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,703
but the problem is is that isn't going 
to help and it's also gonna make it 

412
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,624
worse and that's just the beginnings of 
the problem because if you take that 

413
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:08,834
attitude,
not only does it not help and make it 

414
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:11,474
worse for you,
you will then turn and naked way worse 

415
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,760
for other people,
and so that's just a nonstarter.

416
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,250
You don't go there.
That's inappropriate.

417
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,140
It's novelistic technically

418
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,533
and

419
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,620
nihilism leads directly to have as far 
as I can tell,

420
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,700
and I mean that metaphysically and 
technically so because not always is one

421
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,750
of the root causes of terrible social 
psychopathology and societies can get so

422
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:40,670
far out of whack that they can do things
that are absolutely unimaginable and you

423
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,760
probably don't want to be part of that.
And if you do well then you should think

424
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:46,934
hard about exactly what you're doing 
because there's something about it 

425
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,000
that's corrupt.
So.

426
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,833
So forget about the nanoscale issue.
But the other thing that you shouldn't 

427
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:56,924
do,
and this is another place where I think 

428
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,203
our education system fails you,
is that you should not learn to parent 

429
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,190
ideologies and almost everything that 
students are taught as far as I can tell

430
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,024
now in the humanities,
is basically the paradigm of both the 

431
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,320
head of the chiefs and there's ways of 
identifying ideologies.

432
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,670
And one of them is it's always someone 
else's fault that's one of the hallmarks

433
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:20,504
or it's society's fault.
And the other hallmark is everything 

434
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:28,130
that's complex can be explained by one 
principal because that's wrong.

435
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,520
It's just no one's sophisticated.
Everything stuff.

436
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,803
It's like you're looking at the card 
isn't working and all you know is that 

437
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:40,380
the fan belt might be loose.
And so no matter what the car is doing,

438
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,940
the reason is,
is the fan belts,

439
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:42,411
loops.
It's,

440
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,030
you're not going to fix the van,
the car,

441
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,490
because sometimes there's other things 
that are wrong.

442
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,910
So any alarms over simplify and they're 
very,

443
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:53,300
very rigid and they're also resentful.
And so.

444
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,840
And that's in some sense that's the 
easiest alternative denialism right?

445
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,440
Because it's false certainty and it's,
it's,

446
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,293
it's rigid.
And the breakable and also takes you in 

447
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:05,500
a terrible direction because if you're 
rigidly,

448
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,070
if you originally identified with your 
radiology,

449
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,070
anyone who challenges,
it's instantly your enemy

450
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,563
and

451
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,410
what you want to do with your enemies.
It's not pleasant.

452
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,070
So that's also not a very good route to 
take if you're,

453
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,820
if you grab not end up in an absolutely 
terrible place.

454
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,520
Okay.
So then you think,

455
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,363
well what are the alternatives to that?
That's where it gets hard because 

456
00:26:30,261 --> 00:26:31,094
sometimes it doesn't like there is much 
of an alternative and it's like things 

457
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:34,904
are pointless obviously because look at 
all the suffering and the shortness of 

458
00:26:37,701 --> 00:26:41,180
life and all of that and nothing's 
really turned.

459
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:42,014
So you have to take refuge in some 
arbitrary set of rules and concepts and 

460
00:26:46,081 --> 00:26:49,050
you know like postmodern relativism 
basically.

461
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:51,020
That's basically it's completion,
you know,

462
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,640
mind system and other system.
It doesn't really matter.

463
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,280
They're all predicated on power girl,
basically arbitrary.

464
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,780
And so there is nothing else there 
that's not right.

465
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,870
It's seriously not running and it 
shouldn't be taught to people.

466
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,740
I really think that's a bad thing.
I think it hurts people's mental health.

467
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,350
And actually I actually think that 
that's the point,

468
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,053
so because malevolence is a motivator 
and so his resentment and not everyone 

469
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,513
is trying to make things better and lots
of people would rather have the misery 

470
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,050
shared that hasn't disappeared.
Okay.

471
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,740
So then let's say potentially there's a 
middle road and what is that?

472
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
Well,
I think some of it's empirical,

473
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:32,150
like there's this idea in behavioral 
therapy of,

474
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,243
of collaborative empiricism.
And basically what happens is a person 

475
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,413
comes into therapy and they say things 
aren't going the way I would like them 

476
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:42,894
to be,
which basically means I can't bear the 

477
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,204
tragedy of my own life.
That's basically what that statement 

478
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:49,710
piece.
And the therapist says,

479
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,030
okay,
well fair enough.

480
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:51,864
That's not so good.
You're willing to change obviously 

481
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:55,200
because here you are.

482
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,690
How should you change?
And the answer is,

483
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:58,680
well,
we don't know.

484
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,293
So the first thing to do is find out and
so you go and then maybe ask the person 

485
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:04,944
to watch their life for a the while and 
see when things are going well and see 

486
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:10,230
when things are not going well.
And that's,

487
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,050
that's not the same thing as creating 
your own values,

488
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,690
right?
That's more a process of observation.

489
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,273
And so like I could say,
I noticed some exercises like this that 

490
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,720
can be ridiculously powerful.
One of them is,

491
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,233
well,
watch when you're miserable and see if 

492
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:27,330
you can figure out why,
but more importantly,

493
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:30,540
notice when you're not miserable and see
if you could figure out why.

494
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:31,374
Because at least in part what that 
indicates is that you're in the right 

495
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:36,240
place at the right time,
right?

496
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:40,320
Then that's when you shouldn't be.
Now where do you should be?

497
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,820
It's partly in time and partly in space,
right?

498
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,703
Because things progressed.
So you're always trying to locate 

499
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:47,160
yourself in prime,
new space.

500
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:50,910
And now I'm in your nervous system 
reports that all systems are go,

501
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:52,700
okay,
so that's a hit.

502
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,341
It's like,
okay,

503
00:28:53,341 --> 00:28:54,810
I don't know,
I'm doing something right now.

504
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:56,460
And that seems to be working.
Now.

505
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:59,610
It's not,
it's not an a mississippian hint,

506
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,610
but it's a start.
Okay?

507
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,500
So then one thing you can think of is,
right,

508
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,250
let's see if I can figure out what those
places where I shouldn't be looked like.

509
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,030
And then let's see if I can start making
those places bigger and you know,

510
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:14,520
if you could make them one percent a 
week,

511
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,383
if you do that for three years,
it's like they hold from maybe two 

512
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:18,264
percent or five percent of your 
experience to 85 percent of your 

513
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:22,860
experience.
That's really useful.

514
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,470
So,
and that means humility,

515
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,420
you know,
that's actually a classical virtue.

516
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:28,463
Humility means you don't know what the 
hell you're doing and you better pay 

517
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,214
attention because you might learn 
something and then you're training 

518
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,150
ignorant even with regards to yourself 
and.

519
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,073
But it also means that you treat 
yourself with a certain respect because 

520
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:40,854
it means all of a sudden that know the 
autonomy of your own experience has a 

521
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,890
real reality and it's an observable 
reality.

522
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,180
And so,
you know,

523
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,850
people talk about this sometimes in 
terms of the flow,

524
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,773
which is not a bad concept,
but basically what it means is that you 

525
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,440
could find yourself engaged in business 
in life.

526
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,540
It didn't matter that sufficiently 
meaningful.

527
00:30:01,541 --> 00:30:03,930
So the fact that life is tragic at that 
moment,

528
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,480
that's not matter or maybe even better,
it's acceptable.

529
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,223
You know,
you might see this when you have 

530
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:11,380
children,
if you're lucky,

531
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,603
and I think this is one of those 
experiences where people get close to 

532
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:15,844
that.

533
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,560
Children exposed the tragedy of life 
like nothing else,

534
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,860
but if your relationship with them is 
what it shouldn't be,

535
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,090
you think,
oh yeah,

536
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,650
that they're terribly vulnerable and 
it's so worth it,

537
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,620
and that's what you want.
That's what you want.

538
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,573
You want to see your terribly vulnerable
and so is everyone you love and so it 

539
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:42,351
was everything that you have around you,
but there's a way of comporting yourself

540
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,600
that makes that worthwhile and that's 
what you're after.

541
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,733
And I would say that's actually the goal
of any genuine religious practice 

542
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,683
because,
and the reason I'm I'm using the 

543
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:55,054
religious example is because
if something is truly religious 

544
00:31:00,371 --> 00:31:01,204
significance,
what it means is that it deals with the 

545
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,950
deepest elements of human existence.
By definition,

546
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,070
that's what it is.
If it isn't that it's not,

547
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,980
it's not in the category of religious 
experience or knowledge.

548
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,080
So you need a path of being justifies 
the suffering of life.

549
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,540
Then the next question is,
well,

550
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,660
can you find such a thing and the answer
that is you've got your whole life.

551
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,330
Find out and under the doing it,
that's the answer.

552
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,910
It really is the answer.
It's the prime question.

553
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,953
Can you conduct yourself in a way that 
justifies the tragedy of the now in 

554
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:38,590
order to do that?
Part of it is he can't be too arrogant,

555
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:39,424
man.
You can't think you know what you're 

556
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,970
doing now.
If you're all happy and things are going

557
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,970
wonderfully and you have a perfect 
relationship with being,

558
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,350
hey,
no problem,

559
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,213
but you guys don't put up your hands 
when you said you're stressed out and 

560
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,520
you know you're doubtful and you don't 
know what's going on and you know,

561
00:31:53,521 --> 00:31:55,720
so you're teetering between nihilism in 
India,

562
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:58,760
logical possession and so you have a 
problem.

563
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,130
Well that's a good thing to notice.

564
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,410
I have a problem.
Then you can know this.

565
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,333
Maybe I'm not correct because that would
be lovely if the reason that you have a 

566
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:09,280
problem is because there are things you 
don't know.

567
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,233
That's such a good deal because the 
alternative is things are terrible 

568
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:15,160
because they're terrible.
There's nothing you can do about it,

569
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,960
and then it's like not only were there 
no bloody wonder,

570
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,523
so you could start with the possibility 
that perhaps the reason that things 

571
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:24,724
aren't as good as they could be or as 
good as is necessary is that there are 

572
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:32,740
fundamental things that you need to 
observe and learn and change and then if

573
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:33,574
you really careful and sufficiently 
terrified because that's also a 

574
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:37,294
necessity.
If you're going to be sufficiently 

575
00:32:38,411 --> 00:32:39,244
careful,
maybe you can figure out how would 

576
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:41,954
conduct yourself so that you get to be 
strong enough so that you can tolerate 

577
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:47,210
to tolerate that and maybe even more.

578
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,073
Maybe you could put yourself together so
that you're so strongly the other we 

579
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,563
can.
You could say it's okay that things are 

580
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,930
this way or maybe even that.
It's good that this girl,

581
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,980
so when I learned that in part by having
kids,

582
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:04,130
because kids are unbelievably 
vulnerable,

583
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,180
you know,
and be really.

584
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,043
They're so cute and so perfect in a 
certain way that there are 

585
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,990
vulnerabilities also even more painful,
you know,

586
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,730
but you think about them and you think,
well,

587
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:17,564
let's,
let's eradicate some of that 

588
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:19,964
vulnerability.
You cannot take a little three year old 

589
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:24,344
and they're wandering around and you 
know they're subject to any number of 

590
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,350
potential catastrophes at any moment and
you think,

591
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,090
well,
you know,

592
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:31,923
you can enclose them in Styrofoam and 
you then you could roll them down the 

593
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,190
stairs and that wouldn't be a problem,
but then be enclosed.

594
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:38,024
It's powerful,
which is really what we're trying to do 

595
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:40,124
with kids.

596
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,890
Or You could make them 20 feet tall and 
making a buyer and then,

597
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:43,581
you know,
cars.

598
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:44,414
We've heard them all.
But the thing that's so strange is that 

599
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,400
every step you take to,
to,

600
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,360
to eradicate the vulnerability is 
simultaneously a step that would involve

601
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:57,650
the destruction of the person.
So that's so interesting because what it

602
00:33:57,651 --> 00:33:58,484
means is that the vulnerabilities,
that central element of what it is that 

603
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:01,503
you love,
that's pretty interesting because it 

604
00:34:03,261 --> 00:34:04,094
means that you could love something 
that's truly vulnerable is something 

605
00:34:05,901 --> 00:34:06,680
that's,
you know,

606
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,513
that's,
that's susceptible to tragedy and it's 

607
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,610
and it's mortal and fragile and all of 
those things.

608
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,453
Okay?
So that's interesting because if you 

609
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:15,044
love someone,
you make the judgment that their 

610
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:18,320
existence is,
is good,

611
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,420
and that's cool because it shows that 
well that happens to you spontaneously.

612
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:25,460
You can spontaneously make that 
judgment.

613
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,500
You know,
maybe you could make that judgment about

614
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,334
yourself.

615
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,260
Now I don't think you can just,
you can't just do that.

616
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,520
That doesn't work.
People are like,

617
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,383
you can't really fool yourself,
and so you can learn to not judge 

618
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:41,990
yourself with unnecessary harshness.
That's really useful.

619
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,110
And even learn to be compassionate with 
yourself,

620
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,973
which basically means to treat yourself 
as if you're someone who care about 

621
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:51,500
because that's where true compassion 
means.

622
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,860
And so you could modify to your,
your capital,

623
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:55,694
logical self criticism,
but in order to establish a positive 

624
00:34:59,361 --> 00:35:02,120
relationship with yourself,
you also have to respect yourself.

625
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,983
And I think to do that you have,
there's a bunch of things that go along 

626
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:06,074
with that.
You have to be good for something good 

627
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:10,540
for you.
That would be good.

628
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,010
Good for other people that'd be even 
better,

629
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,300
good for other people in a crisis that 
would even be better,

630
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,603
you know?
And so that way you can have some 

631
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,990
respect for yourself because although 
you're full of flaws and vulnerable,

632
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:25,600
you know,
if there's a storm coming,

633
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,810
you can still stand up in it.

634
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,960
And that's a good thing.
And No.

635
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,620
So I've observed people on surrounding a
deathbed,

636
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,610
let's say,
you know,

637
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,490
just it's easy thing for people to be 
terrified of but doesn't help.

638
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,890
Like the person is dying.
You're in the room,

639
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,570
you're terrified and upset.
It's like,

640
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,310
Hey,
it's not your turn.

641
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:48,863
It's their turn.
And so hopefully when you're in that 

642
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,340
situation,
you've got yourself together now so that

643
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:55,200
you're actually going to be helpful 
then.

644
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,100
And then if you're not,
you know,

645
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:58,163
really terrible things happen.
So families often tear themselves apart 

646
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:04,700
when you know a major part of the family
guys,

647
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,573
you know,
father and mother because there were so 

648
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,160
mangled up in 15 different ways that,
well,

649
00:36:11,161 --> 00:36:14,880
the tragedy is unfolding may turn on 
each other like carnivorous wolves.

650
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,570
And so they take something that's just a
tragedy and they turned it into hale.

651
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,120
And I would say generally you can 
tolerate tragedy,

652
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,133
but you cannot tolerate health.
So part of your life is part of what 

653
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,750
you're doing in your life is to stop 
tragedy from deteriorating into hell.

654
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,280
And if you can do that,
man,

655
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,114
like you're worth having around.
And that's actually grounds for some 

656
00:36:34,831 --> 00:36:37,650
self respect because that's hard.
It's really hard.

657
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:40,410
But consider the alternative,

658
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,630
you know,
it makes everything that's sad.

659
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,160
Absolutely unbearable in every possible 
way.

660
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,723
You know?
And I've seen families who were coping 

661
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:56,270
with the death say of a mother who were 
courageous people.

662
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,530
You know,
there were people who had,

663
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,200
for example,
worked as palliative care nurses.

664
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,123
That's pretty tough for a man.
And you know what they did while their 

665
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,220
mother was dying was held.

666
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,003
Yeah.

667
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,960
That makes the whole situation 
different.

668
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,540
If it transforms the whole situation and
you know,

669
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,190
you just don't know how much your 
situation can be transformed.

670
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,633
You don't know.
And you can take very terrible 

671
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:24,264
situations that mean don't get me wrong.
Like I know what terrible situations 

672
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,164
are,
like I'm not trying to offer you some 

673
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,173
naive response,
but you can take situations that could 

674
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:37,650
be honored imaginably pool and terrible 
and you can transform them at least into

675
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,990
bearable tragedy.
And that's,

676
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,213
that's,
that's the transmutation that someone 

677
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:48,441
with real character can manage.
And so those things are real.

678
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,703
You know,
a lot of what you hear about is about 

679
00:37:52,981 --> 00:37:56,430
the fragility of representations of the 
world,

680
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,883
you know,
and about their arbitrary ness and 

681
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,113
falseness that,
that there isn't that belief system in 

682
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:09,250
some sense that is rotten to the core 
and questionable.

683
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,713
And I think part of that is just because
it's the wrong questions that are being 

684
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,730
asked.
Like if,

685
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:21,250
if the manner in which you addressed the
world makes you stronger,

686
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,330
then there was no.
That puts us beyond question,

687
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:29,060
if you want a question at that point,
and

688
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,213
even if you come up can come up with a 
rational way of criticizing it because 

689
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,260
you couldn't say,
well,

690
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:38,160
who cares how he wrote to you are on 
your mother's death bed.

691
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,150
We need a trillion years.
You know,

692
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,030
all the stores have exploded in.
The galaxies are extinguished.

693
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,600
When I hear objections that anyone 
parody,

694
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,883
that's such a stupid question,
like you're just missing the point 

695
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,364
completely and it's a pathological 
objection because you could say you're 

696
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,210
one of the first soldiers that lays eyes
on Auschwitz and the first thing you say

697
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:02,050
is at,
it doesn't matter who's going to know in

698
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:03,070
a million years.

699
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,730
Sorry,
I get,

700
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,930
I get the rationale,
you know,

701
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,350
get the impeccable logic,
but it's,

702
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,353
it's,
it's the logic that only someone who's 

703
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:20,270
corrupt beyond measure would dare to use
in a situation like that.

704
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,910
And so there's a simple way alternative 
to that.

705
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:25,580
It's like if you're engaged in 
something,

706
00:39:25,581 --> 00:39:29,120
say that reduces suffering.
We'll just start with that and something

707
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:32,690
pops into your mind like who's really 
going to carry in a million years?

708
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:33,524
The first thing you should conclude,
is that the wrong time for that thought 

709
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,200
because you can criticize either thing,
right?

710
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,063
You can say that art is paramount and 
the conclusion is irrefutable or 

711
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:48,740
anything say anymore on any chattering,
devil can come up with that objection.

712
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:51,620
Why in the world would anyone with any 
sense ever listened to it?

713
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,410
And that's a much more.
That's a deeper response.

714
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,460
It's an embodied response.
It's not a,

715
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,340
it's not a rational response.
There are deeper responses than rational

716
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,193
responses.
Their responses that involve your whole 

717
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,060
being and those are the kind of 
responses you're after.

718
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,040
You know,
because rationality,

719
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,750
it's a,
it's a,

720
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,110
it's a states note and it's the highest 
spirit and God's heavenly kingdom.

721
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,973
Yes it is.
It's the most powerful psychological 

722
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:26,320
forest we have at our disposal
that you and it shouldn't be lost and if

723
00:40:29,571 --> 00:40:31,970
it is you and it's awesome that it's not
good.

724
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,843
So.

725
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,460
So there's no reason to let that happen.
You can just,

726
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,410
you can just refer to your own 
experience.

727
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,520
I mean there's other exercises and do.
This is a really good one.

728
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:45,330
This is terrifying though if you do it 
right,

729
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,933
detach yourself from yourself.
So that's sort of a Buddhist faith 

730
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,633
subset so you become a watcher of 
yourself and so you have to watch 

731
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:57,400
yourself like you don't know who you are
because you don't,

732
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:00,100
so you might as well do that.
And then

733
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,253
watch what happens when you taught,
kind of have to watch with your whole 

734
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,880
body and notice that sometimes when you 
say something,

735
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,780
you align and you come together,
you get stronger.

736
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:16,790
And sometimes when you say something,
you get weaker,

737
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,140
you fragmented,
you get weaker,

738
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,850
and you know,
you could notice,

739
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:23,670
sometimes you'll get weaker if you say 
something to impress someone you know,

740
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,583
you'll get weaker if you falsify your 
own experience because you're trying to 

741
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,500
manipulate the situation in order for 
something to happen.

742
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,540
Um,
you'll get weak if act on it.

743
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,730
Act as if an intellectual principle is 
something of your creation when it is,

744
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,523
you know,
because lots of great ideas you can't 

745
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:46,370
really use unless you,
unless you've made them your own,

746
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,293
you know,
when we've had an attack to take 

747
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,494
responsibility for them,
you have to be bought into because 

748
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:54,760
otherwise you'd just chattering,
chattering

749
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,830
like a tape recorder.
You were chatting with tape recorder.

750
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,360
Nobody is crowded and you don't have the
right to know.

751
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,693
Um,
you'll notice sometimes this is a good 

752
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:07,254
one.
You'll be involved in an argument with 

753
00:42:07,921 --> 00:42:10,770
someone and you'll feel stupid because 
you're arguing.

754
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,740
Shut up there,
you know,

755
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,300
and that's often what will happen if you
do this

756
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,970
a whole bunch of very many occasions.
You just have to shut up because there's

757
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,990
nothing you could say that won't make 
you feel weak.

758
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,333
And then you can start to feel yourself 
around your words and you'll see that 

759
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,460
here's something you could say,
your solidity hair,

760
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:33,294
you know,
it's like you're standing on a rock in 

761
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:37,110
the middle of the swamp.
And if you deviate from that,

762
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,000
come apart and start,
feel weak.

763
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:41,070
And so we practice that.
You say,

764
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,083
all right,
I'm going to see what happens if I only 

765
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:47,610
say things that make me feel strong 
while you do that for five years and see

766
00:42:47,611 --> 00:42:48,444
what happens,
and it's partly it's fleeting reference 

767
00:42:50,551 --> 00:42:51,384
to a very old idea.
It's an idea that's at the heart of 

768
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:54,594
humanity,
which is that the idea that there's an 

769
00:42:57,211 --> 00:42:58,044
idea that conscious human interaction 
with the ground with the va has 

770
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,430
something to do with that.
It reveals it

771
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,183
conscious human interaction with the 
ground of being is what makes potential 

772
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:15,220
transformed into reality.
It's something like that.

773
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,100
It's an unbelievably powerful idea and I
believe it's.

774
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,710
I believe it's as true as anything can 
be true.

775
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:25,263
That means to some degree that you speak
to yourself in the va and so that being 

776
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,910
said,
if you want to make yourself strong,

777
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:31,744
you speak truth so that you could bring 
yourself into being in truth and the 

778
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:38,410
reason you want to do that because you 
shouldn't be truthful.

779
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:39,244
Like in some sort of external,
external sense of being in accordance 

780
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:50,250
with the traditional route rule.
Although if you really pay are real,

781
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,530
him is a lot better than just the AI.
It's more than that.

782
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:54,364
It's your attempt to construct yourself 
into something that can react to the 

783
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:01,630
manifestation manifestation of b 
property.

784
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:02,703
That's true.
You're matching yourself to be and why 

785
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:09,940
would you not want to do that?
You have to contend with it.

786
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,920
Who knows how powerful you can be.
If you contend property people can be so

787
00:44:14,921 --> 00:44:16,840
powerful.
It's just unbelievable.

788
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:17,763
And you see this even in minor
for dinner with this guy a while back 

789
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:23,440
and he,
he,

790
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:24,790
he'd been an athletic guy.

791
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,090
He a lot of biking qualifications,
that sort of thing.

792
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:33,091
He got hit by a car just wipe out,
so he's still recovering and he's.

793
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,470
He's pretty disabled,
pretty.

794
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,960
Went back to work.
He's aligned with mine.

795
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:39,390
It's a hard job,
right?

796
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:40,224
You've got to climb up power splice 
cables together and you have to do it 

797
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,630
under employment conditions because 
that's been the standard,

798
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,593
the,
it's demanding and dangerous and all of 

799
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,404
that,
and he's pretty screwed up because he 

800
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:53,520
got hit by a car.
So he was telling me just just to casual

801
00:44:53,521 --> 00:44:54,354
a story.
He was telling me about the last day 

802
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:56,594
that he had worked and he was working 
with somebody who his partner had 

803
00:44:58,321 --> 00:45:01,290
Parkinson's disease and really could use
one of his arms very well,

804
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:02,124
so I don't know.
He could use his left arm and the other 

805
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:04,914
guy could use his right arm and so they 
were on the ladder trying to fix this 

806
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:08,730
and it's like,
no,

807
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,340
it just made my jaw drop because how 
ridiculous is that?

808
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,110
He's not run over by a car and then this
other guy has Parkinson's disease,

809
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:16,944
which is just as miserable as clean as 
you could hope to have nearly our their 

810
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,313
ladder.
No freezing rain or fixing the power 

811
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:23,634
lines.
It's like people can be unbelievably 

812
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,390
tough,
you know.

813
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,224
And the other thing that you get 
universities now that just drives me 

814
00:45:30,121 --> 00:45:30,954
crazy is it's like you can't be racist.
You can't say anything bad about black 

815
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:38,580
people or Mexicans or white people or 
Jews or whoever.

816
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:39,843
You can't do that.
But even expressed as much hatred for 

817
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:45,000
the entire human race as you want.
And so that's just.

818
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,140
To me,
that's just like,

819
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:49,350
it's really bad if you only take one 
sort of person,

820
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,880
but if you hate everyone,
well that just comes into your life.

821
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,330
You know,
you hear about this all the time.

822
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,173
We're screwing up the planet and the 
planet will be better off if there were 

823
00:45:57,571 --> 00:45:58,260
people on it.

824
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,420
Then all this thing,
I think man,

825
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,230
never give the keys to the nuclear 
arsenal to someone who thinks that way,

826
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,310
you know,
it's a despicable way of thinking and it

827
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:10,800
would be nice if we could develop some 
respect for people.

828
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,210
I mean,
you know,

829
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,044
we,
we labor along under the burden that 

830
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:16,434
exceeds the burden of anything we know.
We're the only creatures there are who 

831
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:23,670
are conscious of their own vulnerability
and its ultimate vulnerability.

832
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:25,230
Man,
you're going to die.

833
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:28,320
That's where it talks out and look at,
here you are.

834
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:30,830
Now you're standing up,
you're in here learning.

835
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,720
You're trying to have a life.
You're maybe some of you are even trying

836
00:46:33,721 --> 00:46:34,554
to be good.
That's a hell of a thing to do under 

837
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:38,190
those conditions.
And so,

838
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:40,010
you know,
when you started thinking that way,

839
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:40,883
well first of all,
you can have a little more compassion 

840
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:42,490
for people.

841
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:43,323
It's a little hard on the environment,
but it's understand it's role in 

842
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,320
returning the favor,
you know,

843
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:53,250
I mean we're at war with mother nature,
but she's going to win,

844
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,413
you know,
we all die and we're doing our best to 

845
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:59,070
protect ourselves from that.
And obviously there's some stupidity and

846
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,904
foolishness and you know,
malevolence and ravenous and this and 

847
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:03,174
greed that goes along with that.
But asking someone to solve an 

848
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:11,481
impossible problem perfectly,
it's like you're just the ultimate tired

849
00:47:12,001 --> 00:47:13,770
when you demand that.
So you could think,

850
00:47:13,771 --> 00:47:15,660
well,
we could give ourselves a bit of a break

851
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,630
and that's something to apply your 
sending.

852
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
And I went to this thing at Queen's 
university.

853
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:22,770
It was a tedx thing,
was so appalling.

854
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,133
If a professor came out and he was 
supposed to be talking about these 

855
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,110
computerized surfaces that he was 
inventing,

856
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,020
which were pretty cool.

857
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:32,913
No,
but he came out and he went into a 

858
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,960
tirade to the students about how they 
should not reproduce because he said him

859
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:42,494
and his wife going limited themselves to
one child and I thought personally that 

860
00:47:45,621 --> 00:47:47,350
was one more child and he should've 
passed.

861
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,033
No,
he didn't even notice that what he was 

862
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,104
doing,
he was addressing a whole room full of 

863
00:47:52,221 --> 00:47:54,920
people like you who are just entering 
into the,

864
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,880
into the beginnings up there,
up there,

865
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,520
truly adult life,
which is about children.

866
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,070
Is that what makes these adult and he's 
telling them,

867
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:06,470
you are so despicable that you're tight,
shouldn't breed.

868
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,990
And then he thought that was more just 
like,

869
00:48:08,991 --> 00:48:09,824
what the hell?
I told him it was great horror because 

870
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,223
really,
really nervous because I really don't 

871
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:16,850
like doing that,
but you know,

872
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,193
I told him that I thought that what he 
did was pathological beyond belief and 

873
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:22,370
that she should be ashamed of 
themselves,

874
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,740
but you know,
I freaked my wife out,

875
00:48:24,741 --> 00:48:25,574
completely
panicked and he just hopped off the 

876
00:48:30,351 --> 00:48:32,870
stage saying that's what happens when 
you talk about things.

877
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,700
It's like,
no,

878
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,340
that's what happens when you have 
genocide in your soul.

879
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,790
That's not the same thing.
So you know,

880
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,930
hatred for humanity.
That's not a good thing man.

881
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:46,773
We know where that leads.
So why would say you could start having 

882
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:50,503
a relationship to yourself and have a 
little bit of respect for people can 

883
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,810
older like mangled up and chewed up and 
spit out and work in.

884
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,140
It's no wonder.
No.

885
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:00,993
One of the things I've noticed about 
psychology is that we always get things 

886
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:03,784
backwards.
Why did people manifest their abnormal 

887
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,410
behavior?
Jesus,

888
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,640
a stupid question.
It's like,

889
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,593
what would you expect?
It's why people are ever normal about 

890
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,600
anything.
That's step one in this history.

891
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:17,443
You know,
people come in to my office and we're 

892
00:49:18,621 --> 00:49:21,530
having a phobia.
I'm afraid that I,

893
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:22,364
if I go outside,
I might die and we'll get to the 

894
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:27,770
hospital with todd having heart 
palpitations and they're getting older.

895
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:29,240
I think.
Oh yeah,

896
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:31,800
that's not surprising.
You have tax surprises in it.

897
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:32,883
Like all the other 50 year olds don't 
happen because of course what you were 

898
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:36,494
afraid of and then you don't know with
the idea that the idea that it's a 

899
00:49:43,191 --> 00:49:47,900
mystery that people engage in abnormal,
no personality

900
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,330
mystery.
It's no mystery why people are afraid.

901
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,600
It's no mystery why people have low self
esteem,

902
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:59,020
which is a work by the way I hate and 
why people are depressed and anxious and

903
00:49:59,021 --> 00:50:01,400
in pain and confused and uncertain and 
all those things.

904
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,550
It's like tap doesn't require any 
explanation,

905
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:09,390
so if you were any of those things,
it's like so and then the issue is,

906
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:10,570
well,
what do you do about it?

907
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:18,263
You need to know.
You know how you would say your right 

908
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:21,603
heel should be informed by your 
knowledge of the greatest happiness of 

909
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,940
the past because there's all that 
knowledge city around your waist back.

910
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,320
Don't waste it,
use it,

911
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,380
and even ideal and ideal is a target and
it's a judge at the same time and it's a

912
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:38,160
motivator because you can be like that 
and yeah,

913
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,003
as you move towards your ideal,
it will transform because otherwise it 

914
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:45,200
wouldn't be anything to do.
Somebody's ideal will receive,

915
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:46,034
but we needed an ideal need to construct
it some sense or discovered ideal that 

916
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:50,744
you believed in.
You have to inform that with your 

917
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:54,584
knowledge of the past.
That's partly why you need to get 

918
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:58,160
educated and that's why the humanities 
are so important.

919
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,940
If the humanities still be universities 
and they're going to go,

920
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,893
I think because
because they committed Harry Carey 

921
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,040
fundamentally and of resentment as far 
as I can tell,

922
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,990
and so it's really not good,
but the terror of it is that it deprives

923
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:15,860
you of what you mean.

924
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,053
You need to be able to extract from the 
past the ideal and then you put that in 

925
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:24,680
front of us about it and it has to be an
ideal that you believe is valuable.

926
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,311
You think,
look,

927
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,660
man,
if I could pull that off,

928
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,523
if I could do that,
if I could be that all this trouble 

929
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:32,180
would be worthwhile,
and so we do this practically.

930
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:32,841
We say,
okay,

931
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,674
look,
three to five years in the future 

932
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:38,350
because after that it gets kind of 
blurry for France.

933
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,210
Who Do you want your friends to be?
Because you can pick your friends,

934
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:42,044
you know,
you can pick people who like you and 

935
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:46,730
want the best for you.
That'd be good.

936
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,810
If you're willing to extend that 
courtesy to yourself.

937
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:54,490
What do you want for your education?
Why do you think?

938
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,630
Let's talk about education.
What does it mean?

939
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:57,860
Here's what it means.

940
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,350
If you're educated,
you get your land,

941
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:01,184
which is great.
You know how to speak and you know how 

942
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:05,810
to write.
If you know how to speak and write,

943
00:52:05,811 --> 00:52:06,644
you are unstoppable.
That's why you're supposed to get 

944
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,330
educated.
No one ever tells you that.

945
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:11,781
It's like,
well,

946
00:52:11,781 --> 00:52:12,614
why are you running this so well?
It's a class assignment or maybe I'm 

947
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:16,911
learning too,
right?

948
00:52:16,911 --> 00:52:18,050
It's like,
why bother?

949
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,790
Why is that important?
It's hard.

950
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,790
Why bother?
Can write the reason you can't write.

951
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:26,330
It's because he can't think and again,
hey,

952
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,420
then you run into things and if you run 
into things,

953
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:32,800
then your life is horrible.
So the reason that you get educated this

954
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,643
so that you can fake and not run into 
horrible things and your life expanse 

955
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:42,200
and it makes you powerful.
You know,

956
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,600
part of what I'm doing in my therapy 
sessions all the time,

957
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:49,601
if someone comes in with a problem and 
we articulate the problem fully and then

958
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:50,804
we can get rid of most of it because 
once it's articulated to you can see 

959
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:53,744
what's the problem and what isn't,
and then we can focus on a few key 

960
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,880
things and make an articulate what a 
solution would look like.

961
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,030
Then we can go war.
It's like,

962
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:03,560
okay,
this is the problem.

963
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:06,050
This is what you want.
How can you get it?

964
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,600
That's all articulation.
Here's strategy one,

965
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,593
strategy two.
Here's the rationales for all those 

966
00:53:11,151 --> 00:53:12,830
strategies.
Here's what you do.

967
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,110
If they fail,
you do that.

968
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:17,323
You do that.
Continuing things just move away and 

969
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:22,880
front could be like they're not even 
there because the people in like systems

970
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:26,310
that are stupid or stupid and weak,
otherwise he wouldn't be.

971
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:29,500
He wouldn't be stupid and weak if they 
weren't stupid and weak.

972
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,670
And so if you're,
you know,

973
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:33,360
a straight Arrow,
let's say,

974
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,403
then that stuff just disappears in front
of you because there's no commitment to 

975
00:53:37,641 --> 00:53:40,250
it.
And language you're,

976
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:43,050
you want to be a master of language.
That's why you're getting educated.

977
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:43,943
That's why university.
And so I would say not only should you 

978
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:50,640
not say anything,
it makes you weak.

979
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,623
You shouldn't write anything.
You don't believe I was talking to one 

980
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,540
I,
my daughters

981
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,890
phrase this are great because I can't 
drink coffee.

982
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:06,960
I actually hate it.
But for a drug that

983
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,630
might compromise with my own stupidity.
So

984
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,893
she was complaining about this sociology
class that she was taking half 

985
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:16,923
Concordia.
I thought that was a sign for mental 

986
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:19,570
health.
Yeah.

987
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,140
And then she said she had to wrote her 
essay so that you know,

988
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:29,020
feed back to the professors with that 
particular professor one of the year.

989
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,010
And so she was irritated about that.
Couldn't get me to do it,

990
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,593
to notice that the reason she couldn't 
get motivated to do it was because she 

991
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:38,794
had set herself up to the store for her,
her logos to just start her being in 

992
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:49,530
order to please some person.
She had no respect for what's going on.

993
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,290
How could you be motivated to do that?
I said to her,

994
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,400
look,
you can't do that.

995
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,430
You can't do that.
You have to take your lumps.

996
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,653
You write the best essay you can.
He make it something you believe it and 

997
00:55:02,021 --> 00:55:04,330
if it doesn't fly,
tough luck for you,

998
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:08,710
but at least you haven't corrupted your 
character and she's sort of my door.

999
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:09,603
Well,
can you just don't understand how the 

1000
00:55:10,361 --> 00:55:11,440
university has changed?

1001
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,800
That's
maybe true,

1002
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:19,803
but it's not relevant.
The problem is is once you write 

1003
00:55:21,611 --> 00:55:25,540
something you believe,
if you can't tell them the data,

1004
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:26,374
and that's actually.
If you can come here and let's say 

1005
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:31,330
you're a radical left wing or on some 
viewpoint or radical wreck when you're,

1006
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,010
it doesn't matter,
and then I say,

1007
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:33,844
okay,
you have to write an essay countering 

1008
00:55:36,011 --> 00:55:37,290
that position.
Now,

1009
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:38,223
to renew in a week later,
you shifted weight close to your 

1010
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:43,660
argument,
and the reason is is that the belief you

1011
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:46,660
have to begin with is shallow.
You've never really articulated it.

1012
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,380
You just have it.
It's like a heuristic.

1013
00:55:48,381 --> 00:55:52,060
It's probably based on your temperature.
You articulated revival,

1014
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,273
you have a weighting or a well developed
argument for the repellent they need to 

1015
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:58,090
do for the original proposition so you 
ship,

1016
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,150
so every time you write something to 
please someone,

1017
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,170
then you're damaging your character.
You might say,

1018
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,941
well,
who cares?

1019
00:56:06,941 --> 00:56:11,150
Like the honest dope Friday anyways,
which is wrong.

1020
00:56:11,151 --> 00:56:11,984
By the way,

1021
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,780
that's what you've got is your 
character,

1022
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:18,610
because nothing else will defend you 
against suffering.

1023
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,140
That's what you've got.
So you sacrifice that,

1024
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:25,683
you sacrifice it everything.
And it's worse than that because once 

1025
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:32,970
you sacrifice that,
you get weak and when you get weak,

1026
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,340
the tragedy mouth and as the tragedy 
mouse,

1027
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:37,174
you get resentful and then you get cruel
and they get vicious and there's no 

1028
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,110
stopping.
And that's just the beginning.

1029
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:48,880
I mean there's no end to the downside 
with that and like we already saw in the

1030
00:56:48,881 --> 00:56:50,830
20th century what happens when people do
that.

1031
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,373
It's not good and all of those deaths 
should have taught us a lesson and the 

1032
00:56:59,021 --> 00:56:59,854
lesson is don't do that.
It leads to it least the worst possible 

1033
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:05,704
situation that you could imagine.
No matter how well you can imagine 

1034
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:13,081
impossible situations and maybe you want
to partake in that maybe don't,

1035
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,540
and in fact maybe you do not want to 
partake in it.

1036
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:17,383
You want to do exactly whatever is 
necessary to decrease the probability 

1037
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:26,701
that that will happen and we know it can
happen and we know it doesn't have to,

1038
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,250
and so obviously there must be things 
that you could do to ensure that doesn't

1039
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,160
happen,
so those things are hard to discover.

1040
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,053
You know,
it's easier to see where something is 

1041
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:38,770
wrong than where it isn't wrong.
It's just simpler.

1042
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,050
But,
and I think that's very tightly aligned,

1043
00:57:43,051 --> 00:57:43,884
you'll find that stereotype type in your
life at the same set of phenomena that 

1044
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,320
you will discover.
If you know this day to day,

1045
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:51,580
week to week,
month to month,

1046
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,000
what makes you weak and what makes it 
meaningful,

1047
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:56,703
so weakness.
If you speak in a way that makes you 

1048
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:00,880
weak,
you'll be curated into that domain.

1049
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,060
If you don't and you watch what makes 
your life meaningful,

1050
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,690
then you'll get stronger and stronger 
and we get farther and farther away from

1051
00:58:07,691 --> 00:58:11,500
that and you'll be more and more likely 
to manifest yourself in a way that makes

1052
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,600
those things less and less likely.

1053
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,610
And you know,
even like,

1054
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:19,250
here's a,
here's the proposition for nihilists.

1055
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,940
It's,
I think these are good propositions.

1056
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,740
Okay?
Argue yourself out of pe.

1057
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,860
Oh look,
you can't do it well so much.

1058
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,470
The deliberate steer rationality,
and this isn't the things that are maybe

1059
00:58:30,471 --> 00:58:34,330
less because there's pain and that's a 
form of meaning.

1060
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,253
It's not a form of media you want,
but it's there and you can't argue 

1061
00:58:38,201 --> 00:58:40,240
yourself out of it.
So the next thing you might say,

1062
00:58:40,241 --> 00:58:41,710
well,
how about a little less pain?

1063
00:58:41,711 --> 00:58:44,620
How would that be?
And then you say,

1064
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:45,940
well,
what difference has been made?

1065
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:46,803
It's like get away from that person
because I think some things are self 

1066
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,460
evident.
Don't torture kittens to death,

1067
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,680
but who's going to care in a million 
years?

1068
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,753
It's the wrong level of analysis,
so that's just a trick of the rational 

1069
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:06,730
mind so you don't play along with that.

1070
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,370
You notice and that's upsetting.
That's horrible.

1071
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:12,040
That's terrible.
I don't want to go anywhere near that.

1072
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,470
Great.
Don't go anywhere near it.

1073
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:18,550
That would be a good thing.
And so you can start by avoiding.

1074
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,380
That's the way to bring meaning into 
your life.

1075
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,810
You start by avoiding hell
and then if you're lucky you,

1076
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:26,990
well,
if you avoided enough,

1077
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,030
then maybe you can start thinking about 
how you might,

1078
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,740
you know,
climate stairway to heaven,

1079
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,293
but the first is the first is the first 
because it's really easy to believe in 

1080
00:59:36,141 --> 00:59:41,141
pain and so all you have to notice is 
that you believe in and that maybe you'd

1081
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,640
rather not have any more of it than 
necessary.

1082
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:45,980
And perhaps that that would also be good
for other people.

1083
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,870
Hey,
that gives you a starting point

1084
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,560
and once you have the starting point,
it's like our communities.

1085
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:52,101
He said,
you know,

1086
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:54,760
if you gave them a lever and the proper 
fulcrum,

1087
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,700
you could move the world.

1088
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,440
Well,
as far as I can tell,

1089
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,520
that piece of knowledge is precisely 
that because I don't think he couldn't.

1090
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:02,563
You can't dismiss it,
not without in instantaneously 

1091
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:12,430
establishing yourself as an agent of 
malevolence so,

1092
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,420
so
that's that.

1093
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:23,240
So I would say you Orient Yourself,
you Orient Yourself,

1094
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:24,074
you have to do that.
You have to Orient Yourself towards an 

1095
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:26,264
ideal and you'll have to dinner out with
your ideal is you can figure out what 

1096
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:31,760
your ideal is by noticing who you 
admire,

1097
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,433
because the phenomena of aberration is 
the attempt of your psyche to construct 

1098
01:00:38,711 --> 01:00:41,660
an ideal that you can fall and it's 
involuntary,

1099
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:43,970
which is another thing that's 
interesting to notice,

1100
01:00:43,971 --> 01:00:46,310
right?
It's like you don't pick who you admire,

1101
01:00:46,311 --> 01:00:47,144
it just manifests itself and so it's an 
unconscious manifestation of your 

1102
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:52,664
psyche.
Or You could say it's a revelation of 

1103
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:55,520
Ba.
It's the same basic idea,

1104
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:57,320
and so you think,
well,

1105
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,430
I fire this person.

1106
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:00,350
Okay,
well now it's like day.

1107
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,360
There's an ideal nest in that.
What is it that you want for match?

1108
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:05,203
What is it you want to derive from that 
and you derive that and then ride the 

1109
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:11,690
old ship and so it's a moving target in 
some sense,

1110
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,950
but it's well worth following.
So and again,

1111
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:19,040
it's nothing that you can rationally 
undermined as far as I can tell any more

1112
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,320
than you can rationally on your mind,
being in love with someone you know,

1113
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,213
being trapped,
being in love with someone either can't 

1114
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:25,934
control it so you can accept it as an 
existential Faq and then you can work 

1115
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:34,970
forward on that basis.
So then I would say,

1116
01:01:34,971 --> 01:01:35,804
well,
part of the ideals Orient Yourself 

1117
01:01:36,921 --> 01:01:40,490
towards the improvement of being.
So the idea is,

1118
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,860
and it can be vague because what the 
hell do you know?

1119
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,053
But the issue is you've got to decide 
you want things to be worse or do you 

1120
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,260
want them to be better?

1121
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,350
That's the first decision.
And you might say,

1122
01:01:51,351 --> 01:01:52,970
well obviously one of the things to be 
better,

1123
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,550
it's like don't,
don't be thinking that's obvious because

1124
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:56,384
it's not.
And people are always working to make 

1125
01:01:58,371 --> 01:01:59,204
things worse.
And there's a part of everyone that 

1126
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:01,364
works to make things worse.
So if you think that that's not part of 

1127
01:02:04,911 --> 01:02:05,744
you,
then you're not even in the game yet 

1128
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,233
because you,
because you're naive fundamentally and 

1129
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:13,210
you're going to get walloped and walt 
enough,

1130
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,460
you won't be dying and then you'll start
seeing this and that will be painful.

1131
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,980
So it'd be better just to circumvent 
that completely.

1132
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,930
You could.
So you think,

1133
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,620
well,
how am I going to make things worse?

1134
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,200
I'm going to make them better.
Well,

1135
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:26,250
what's works?
Milo?

1136
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,850
Milo is China.
That was bad Soviet Union.

1137
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,520
That was fat Nazi Germany.
That was bad.

1138
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,440
Let's not go there.
Okay?

1139
01:02:34,441 --> 01:02:36,930
So we thought how great things were.

1140
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,120
Staff,
we get away from that.

1141
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,460
How to make things better.
Comfort question.

1142
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:45,270
At least stop making the worse you.
And then I would say,

1143
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,680
you know,
one of the,

1144
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,613
the other exercise that I think is very 
useful apart from watching your speech 

1145
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:57,160
and don't write things you don't believe
now that is really dangerous.

1146
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:58,103
It's,
you're working your character and once 

1147
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:02,220
you do that,
it's very difficult to get to work stuff

1148
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,980
because you actually rewiring yourself,
writing does that.

1149
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:08,170
You're changing your memory structures.
Would you?

1150
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,013
Right.
So I think that's even more indication 

1151
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,980
when you,
when you see the same thing happens with

1152
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:19,981
you speak,
the next thing is in part,

1153
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:25,130
notice what you could make better,
you would make better,

1154
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:29,780
and then make it better because you 
might say,

1155
01:03:29,781 --> 01:03:31,160
well,
I don't know what's good,

1156
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,080
what's not good.
So that's a start.

1157
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,820
That's really useful.
That doesn't.

1158
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,680
Just because you specify the end one end
of a continuum,

1159
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,750
it doesn't mean you necessarily specify 
know.

1160
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:43,640
So it's fuzzy.
What's the opposite of being a Nazi?

1161
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,960
Well,
we don't really know.

1162
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,610
We don't know exactly,

1163
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:53,740
but you get glimmers and I think that's 
the right way of thinking about it.

1164
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:58,050
There are things that glimmer glimmer is
this is right and I can fix it.

1165
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,790
And then it's like,
you know,

1166
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,770
it's not right.
You don't have to question.

1167
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,350
These are grandiose states.
These are small things.

1168
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,940
They're really,
they're small things like,

1169
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,600
um,
there's,

1170
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,660
there's some things I should attend to 
today.

1171
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,390
Little tasks,
you know,

1172
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,593
things that you know,
that if you don't do your life will be 

1173
01:04:15,311 --> 01:04:16,144
worse at the end of the day.
Then it was at the beginning who enough 

1174
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,620
and some of those things you might say,
well,

1175
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:23,590
I'm not going to do those and okay fine,
or I don't know why,

1176
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,140
but some of them will be the things that
you could do that,

1177
01:04:26,141 --> 01:04:29,770
you know you should do them.
They're little things,

1178
01:04:29,771 --> 01:04:30,604
they're little things,
but if you do 100,000 of those states 

1179
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:37,120
and everything will get pristine and 
beautiful around you and that makes life

1180
01:04:37,121 --> 01:04:37,954
a lot more bearable and then you can 
kind of start distributing that around 

1181
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,190
and that's really,
really helpful.

1182
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,470
It's really helpful.
So,

1183
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:49,660
so he need to know where you're going 
and hopefully up rather than down.

1184
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:53,290
And if you've got desire for doubt in 
you then

1185
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:56,223
well then the first stream to do is 
notice at least to know that that's the 

1186
01:04:58,751 --> 01:05:00,400
case.
If people are very destructive,

1187
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,443
you know,
and they will hurt and they need to 

1188
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,530
destroy it and so that's part of you and
you have to.

1189
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:10,570
You have to grapple with that and you 
have to decide if that's what you want.

1190
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,220
I would say
that's all there is to it.

1191
01:05:15,221 --> 01:05:16,900
You have to decide if that's what you 
want.

1192
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:18,183
What does you notice?
What did you decide that and you tried 

1193
01:05:20,101 --> 01:05:22,840
it or anything so that and start 
watching,

1194
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,890
watching what makes you strong,
what makes you.

1195
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,733
We'd do the things that make you strong.
He stopped doing the things that make 

1196
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,420
you wait and while you're doing that,
try to make things better.

1197
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:35,733
Now,
not in a grandiose way because what the 

1198
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:38,374
hell do you know if you don't want us to
fix everything because you're just 

1199
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:44,410
screwed up.
You want to fix a few things around that

1200
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:45,244
are within your realm of competence that
you know absolutely that you could make 

1201
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:50,170
better.
Now you might not move.

1202
01:05:50,171 --> 01:05:51,670
Why?
It doesn't matter.

1203
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:53,580
You have the confidence.
You know how to do it.

1204
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:56,540
A child comes up in their car or maybe 
they tell down,

1205
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,580
you give them a hug and pat them on the 
head and you know that works.

1206
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,631
It works.
Okay,

1207
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,280
so that's something that you're 
competent to do,

1208
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:05,230
so that's the right thing to do in that 
situation.

1209
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,373
You know
you don't have a discussion about that 

1210
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,624
because it's already established and 
there's lots of things that you guys 

1211
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:13,523
already know that are like that,
so you do that micro steps and sunsets 

1212
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,153
and then you stand back and you have 
some faith and faith is the willingness 

1213
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:29,791
to try that to see little while that's 
all because there's no proof like,

1214
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:35,020
I can tell you about this but I can't 
prove it within the confines of your own

1215
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:35,854
experience,
and so you have to manage faith that 

1216
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,700
things could possibly be right
and that's an act of courage and then

1217
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,433
the things around you sort themselves 
out and hopefully they sort themselves 

1218
01:06:52,330 --> 01:06:53,163
out for you in a way that also sorts 
them out for other people and then 

1219
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:59,560
things get better and maybe as they get 
better,

1220
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:00,394
we won't be so concerned about how 
horrible things are because you've got 

1221
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:06,910
to say was so bloody creative and 
amazing.

1222
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:08,493
If everybody on the planet was like 
laying things out as fast and hard as 

1223
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:12,830
they can,
man,

1224
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:15,070
we'd solve every problem.
There is no time flat.

1225
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,053
So
seems like a good deal for beats 

1226
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,633
complaining about how miserable,
wretched and destructive human beings 

1227
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,580
are.
No,

1228
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,510
it's not good.
It's not good.

1229
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:33,170
It's not a sign of ethics to do that.
It's quite the contrary.

1230
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:38,700
So
I have to save all of that.

1231
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,510
So we're going to have questions.
Right?

1232
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,623
Okay.

1233
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,500
Thank
you.

1234
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:56,063
What I'm going to do,
I'm going to answer questions that I 

1235
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:02,630
haven't answered the question.
It's either because

1236
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:09,540
I'm too tired or I can't formulate 
reasonable as

1237
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,443
morally right to bring people into 
existence without consent and knowing 

1238
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:18,500
that they will inevitably injured or 
suffering during their life.

1239
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,570
Isn't it selfish?
Good question.

1240
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:22,173
Um,
tolstoy asked that question in his 

1241
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,103
confessions.
So if you're interested in an answer to 

1242
01:08:29,131 --> 01:08:29,964
that question,
one of the things I would recommend you 

1243
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:35,590
read that book because that was Kinda 
historically should be looked at life.

1244
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,600
And he taught
and he tells this story.

1245
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:51,050
It's a story about this guy in the field
and he's being chased by people who want

1246
01:08:51,051 --> 01:08:51,884
to kill him.
So he jumps into this hole and he's 

1247
01:08:54,561 --> 01:08:56,390
hanging on.
It's like an old.

1248
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,224
Well,
he's hanging on for dear life is 

1249
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,673
scratching and at the bottom of the hole
there's a crocodile and so he's heading 

1250
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,520
on there will always had you gone.

1251
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,580
He noticed there's two things.
There's some grapes on the vine and then

1252
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:11,414
there's about two nice ones,
the black mouths and one's white Nelson 

1253
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:17,930
and they're on either side if the and 
they're chewing through it so he knows

1254
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,470
he can get out and detail.
Taylor,

1255
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:23,440
you can fall and get killed or he could 
wait.

1256
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:25,523
So what do you guys eat?
The grapes and it's a Buddhist story 

1257
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:30,363
that was story because the white mouse 
is chaos or order in a black house is 

1258
01:09:33,471 --> 01:09:36,740
chaos and there's always things working 
at the of being.

1259
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:40,940
There's no doubt about it and you know 
you're screwed no matter what you do,

1260
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:43,790
which is the moral of that story.
I told a story,

1261
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,050
looked at that story and said,
look,

1262
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:45,884
the only logical conclusion that you can
draw from that is that life is so 

1263
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:53,801
terrible that it shouldn't exist,
and hey,

1264
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:59,130
dusty dsts the same question in probably
just chromosome.

1265
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:02,870
You have this character named Ivan.
It was a smart goodwill being tough guy,

1266
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,240
good intellect,
perceptive,

1267
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,710
and he has this revenue down the Osha 
who's kind of.

1268
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:12,860
He's a soft diet in some ways.
He's not an intellect,

1269
01:10:12,861 --> 01:10:13,694
but it was really a good person.
Now the just kind of classically 

1270
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:16,724
religious and he's.
He wants to be a novitiate in the 

1271
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:23,511
monastery and I just to bed because he 
can blow over with his intellect,

1272
01:10:23,931 --> 01:10:24,764
you know,
and I can tell us the story about the 

1273
01:10:29,961 --> 01:10:31,590
Gospel.
He took the newspaper,

1274
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:33,860
this family,
mother and father,

1275
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:35,893
they were angry at their four year old 
daughter and a locked her house 

1276
01:10:38,780 --> 01:10:42,460
overnight and she was screaming out 
there and she froze to death.

1277
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:43,843
It was news and in Moscow,
and I can basically says to Leo should 

1278
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:50,763
know who's making the case for the 
goodness of being of the goodness of 

1279
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:53,880
God.

1280
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:55,180
Anyhow,
you want to look at it,

1281
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,083
and I've been so you bothered,
how can you even dare to make $9 like 

1282
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:00,020
that?
It's like

1283
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,730
this is the sort of thing that happens 
in the brain all the time,

1284
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,050
and then you ask somebody,
oh,

1285
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:09,470
should look when you be willing,
voluntary departure,

1286
01:11:09,471 --> 01:11:14,070
that girl to death to ensure that things
would continue.

1287
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,490
Well,
no,

1288
01:11:16,490 --> 01:11:19,140
I what I know you wouldn't do it.
So it's like,

1289
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:23,400
what's your conclusion about that being 
shouldn't exist?

1290
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:24,683
And then that asks the same question in 
a firehouse is character in that have 

1291
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,110
met the software,
these,

1292
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,013
this.
He's kind of the intellectual ankle of 

1293
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,220
statement.
That's one way of thinking about it

1294
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,790
and he says the same thing.
He's talking about his motivations.

1295
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,361
He says,
well,

1296
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:45,050
what motivates the great adversary of 
mankind?

1297
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,273
And if it says it's straightforward,
being so terrible that it should be 

1298
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:52,530
eradicated.
Okay,

1299
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,990
fair enough.
Strong

1300
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:57,660
people try it.

1301
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,890
It's not clear to me that that's where 
we should go.

1302
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:04,873
So because as far as I can tell,
when people work for the eradication of 

1303
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:08,154
being,
it makes everything that they're 

1304
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,850
complaining about way,
worst,

1305
01:12:10,851 --> 01:12:11,684
really fast.
And so then the other thing you might 

1306
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:16,260
ask yourself is,
do you think that's the motivation?

1307
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:21,740
It's really so purehearted no,
they're going to destroy mankind to save

1308
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:23,603
and then making a judgment.
The judgment is being is so terrible 

1309
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:27,120
that it shouldn't do exist.
Now,

1310
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:27,983
don't get me wrong.
I get the rationale for that is either 

1311
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:31,373
his rationale.
It was never put more strongly than in 

1312
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:34,980
the brothers Karamazov.
It's a famous passage and writing.

1313
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:35,814
So
the question here was with regards to 

1314
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:40,180
bringing children into the world.
Well,

1315
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,450
it's a variation of the same question.
No,

1316
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:46,620
the question is what do you have to 
conclude if you're not going to do it,

1317
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:50,750
you're completely with but is not with 
the being is not justifiable.

1318
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:54,900
Well,
that's a hell of a conclusion.

1319
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:56,833
I would be very careful before I made it
because there are places it takes you 

1320
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:02,190
that a not good.
So.

1321
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:03,133
And then you might also ask yourself,
are you so sure that you're asking that 

1322
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:09,960
question just because you're a good 
person or you maybe asking that question

1323
01:13:09,961 --> 01:13:14,961
because you don't want to say of having 
a child in his finger and said are maybe

1324
01:13:15,481 --> 01:13:18,210
you're afraid that you won't know how to
fortify the child property.

1325
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,520
So you're withdrawing fair,
fair enough.

1326
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,390
Look,
what do you do with children?

1327
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,233
Does you encouraged them?
And I mean that literally it's like a 

1328
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,040
little kid and he'd say,
look man,

1329
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:31,883
you can take on the world.
And you don't sugarcoat it just like 

1330
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,550
it's not.
It's all

1331
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:41,710
fairy tales and roses.
It's not the old Sheila is.

1332
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,560
She opens enough so you don't damage 
them.

1333
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,393
It's a really tight because you don't 
want to know why overwhelmed someone 

1334
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,163
hurt them while you're teaching them.
You have to expose him gradually and 

1335
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:52,164
with intelligence,
you do that by having a relationship 

1336
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:54,443
with a kid.
You don't want to shield them from 

1337
01:13:55,471 --> 01:13:58,290
existence.
We want to show them just what it's like

1338
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:00,510
and then you want to tell them it 
doesn't matter,

1339
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,070
man,
you're tough enough.

1340
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,030
You can do it and you can do it right 
and it's true.

1341
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,340
It can.
And if you,

1342
01:14:07,470 --> 01:14:11,290
if you fortify them with that knowledge 
matter are,

1343
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,313
they're being is not characterized by 
the kind of suffering that makes 

1344
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:16,623
existence intolerable.
And so the answer is not to have 

1345
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:21,100
children.
The answer is

1346
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,650
cooperative and encourage them,
and that's tough because you don't.

1347
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,950
You're kind of fragment had been broken 
and if you treat your child right,

1348
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,520
they might exceed me and that's 
annoying,

1349
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:36,180
so you made you everything.

1350
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,013
You can bloody well made sure that your 
kid is broken enough so there's no way 

1351
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:40,660
they're going to do it any better than 
you,

1352
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:44,650
and so I wouldn't recommend that,
but people do it all the time,

1353
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,010
but that doesn't mean that existence 
itself is insufficient.

1354
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,033
It just means that you're not handling 
the property and you're making it far 

1355
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:52,933
worse than it has been.
One of the things I asked myself a long 

1356
01:14:55,301 --> 01:14:57,580
time ago,
first of all,

1357
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:58,414
I know there's a distinction between 
tragedy and that's an important 

1358
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:01,834
distinction.
Tragedy is when things happen that 

1359
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:07,590
aren't good,
someone gets canceled.

1360
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,533
No,
I'm your child slips and breaks his or 

1361
01:15:11,981 --> 01:15:14,830
her leg.
You know your parents die.

1362
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:15,843
That's true.
Evil is when something tragic happens 

1363
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:22,390
because someone wanted to tap.
Okay,

1364
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:24,230
so we can distinguish between your 
students.

1365
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:25,293
The first thing I would say is people 
can have a tragedy like you can get 

1366
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,590
tough enough so you can have.

1367
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,980
In fact,
I think you can get tough enough so that

1368
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,220
you even get tougher if you're exposed 
to trash.

1369
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,210
That sort of statement about,
you know,

1370
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:38,890
whatever doesn't kill me,
makes me stronger.

1371
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,430
Obviously itself,
it's an overstatement.

1372
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:46,390
It's very hard for people to tolerate 
evil level ones.

1373
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:48,880
So like I've seen people,
for example,

1374
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,970
because that adolescent clients with 
posttraumatic stress disorder there very

1375
01:15:51,971 --> 01:15:54,480
often traumatized by malevolence,
not trashy.

1376
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:55,783
They fall victim to someone who wants to
hurt and maybe it's even been self that 

1377
01:15:59,741 --> 01:16:01,600
wants to hurt them and that's revealed 
to them,

1378
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:02,493
you know,
but sometimes it's that they come into 

1379
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:04,883
their often naive people,
they come into contact with someone 

1380
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:07,444
whose purpose is to hurt them and that 
shadows so badly they can't put 

1381
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:13,900
themselves back together.
Evils really devastating.

1382
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:14,973
I think human beings can tolerate 
tragedy and I also think that if people 

1383
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,130
oriented themselves towards the 
improvement of being,

1384
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:24,700
we could continually ameliorate tragedy.

1385
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:29,440
And I do also believe that being a 
striving to perfect itself.

1386
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,290
Now that's obviously a metaphysical 
statement,

1387
01:16:32,291 --> 01:16:34,990
but I don't really care if it's a 
medical metaphysical statement.

1388
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:35,824
I have my reasons for for bleeding and I
think that the purpose of human life is 

1389
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:46,180
to participate in that process and 
because again,

1390
01:16:46,181 --> 01:16:47,014
the alternatives,
things are quite list and life is 

1391
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:52,570
suffering and it should be eradicated.
It's like that leads nowhere.

1392
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:55,030
Good really leads nowhere.
Good,

1393
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,850
so I can dispense with it.
It's better tasting.

1394
01:16:59,980 --> 01:17:03,800
It's like a bad roadmap because most 
profound it is our roadmap.

1395
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,680
They tell you how to get from one point 
to another.

1396
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,903
You know,
if you want to get to the depths of 

1397
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:09,154
infernal chaos or do you want to move 
towards something that approximates 

1398
01:17:13,371 --> 01:17:14,660
paradise,
well,

1399
01:17:14,661 --> 01:17:18,980
he'd better make sure you have the right
map and so and most belief systems,

1400
01:17:18,981 --> 01:17:19,814
our roadmaps,
they're descriptions of reality 

1401
01:17:21,630 --> 01:17:23,240
description,
objective reality.

1402
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:24,103
There
are so have kids say it's one third of 

1403
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:31,940
your life,
you will bloody won't regret it.

1404
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:34,900
If you don't do it.
You're not going to make 20 or 30.

1405
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:39,350
Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 
and maybe it will be alone.

1406
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,880
That's not so good and so you're a fool 
if you don't have kids.

1407
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,390
Now,
I mean,

1408
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:47,900
I know people have their reasons and 
some people have appropriate reasons and

1409
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,180
all that,
but if somebody ideological hang up that

1410
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:51,170
stopping you,
Ms Dot Donna,

1411
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:55,220
you better dispense with that instead 
instead of dispensing with the kids.

1412
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,270
Is there a book you could consider 
essential reading?

1413
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:03,403
Oh yeah.
You have to ask that because after all 

1414
01:18:06,321 --> 01:18:07,154
you are at university,
you should read Dostoyevsky's five 

1415
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,310
grades.
They're unparalleled.

1416
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:17,000
So that's notes from underground crime 
and punishment.

1417
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:19,790
The possessor of the devils,
it depends on the translation.

1418
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:23,380
The brothers grounds off the idiot.
There's also one called the adolescence,

1419
01:18:23,381 --> 01:18:28,381
so I missed there sits,
so any of Dostoyevsky's great novels.

1420
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:29,383
They're not.
You can't not read their key pieces in 

1421
01:18:34,311 --> 01:18:38,110
the.
In the psychology of I'm

1422
01:18:40,430 --> 01:18:45,380
Solzhenitsyn's Gulag archipelago.
That's a nature book.

1423
01:18:45,381 --> 01:18:46,214
Math and that's the description of his 
experiences inside the prison camps and 

1424
01:18:50,271 --> 01:18:52,250
that book helped bring down the Soviet 
Union.

1425
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:55,730
It destroyed the intellectual and moral 
credibility of communism.

1426
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:56,833
It was an atom bomb,
that thing and he memorized it 2,700 

1427
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:01,724
pages long,
so it's hard to manage because it's 

1428
01:19:05,811 --> 01:19:09,610
nothing but atrocity in terror,
but there's.

1429
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,380
There's no shying away,
you know,

1430
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:14,040
like,
and this is one thing that I really like

1431
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:19,041
about it most of the time,
like the novels or intellectual or moral

1432
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:21,104
doubts,
that's a better way of thinking about 

1433
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:23,660
it.
And you know,

1434
01:19:23,661 --> 01:19:25,910
most of the time when you hear people 
have an argument,

1435
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:27,523
they do tricks.
Like let's say you and I are going to 

1436
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:29,744
happen on argument about something,
the first thing I'm going to do is 

1437
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,593
listen to what you say and then I'm 
going to create a stupid form of it and 

1438
01:19:35,091 --> 01:19:37,010
then I'm going to destroy that stupid 
form.

1439
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,350
And when you try to object,
I'm going to into Robert.

1440
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:41,090
No,
that's the,

1441
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:43,100
that's the straw man argument,
right?

1442
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:48,120
What I should be doing is I shouldn't be
listening to and if you're not very good

1443
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:50,810
at formulating your arguments,
I should help you formulate them.

1444
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:51,644
So they come out as clearly as they 
possibly can and then we should have a 

1445
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:55,940
discussion to see where we go.

1446
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,170
And that's what does doc does.
He takes like his.

1447
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,750
He was an Orthodox Christian and Russian
Orthodox Christian,

1448
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,220
his atheists man,
those are deadly atheists.

1449
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,460
You know,
they make it's look like a piker.

1450
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:11,750
Dorsey esd takes Ivan is a really good 
example.

1451
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:14,130
That guy saw everything going for him.
He's really good looking.

1452
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:16,980
He's really strong.
He's your courageous like he's sharp,

1453
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:20,520
he's admirable,
he's fearless.

1454
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,533
He's a major contender and he formulates
arguments in favor of atheism that are 

1455
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,060
almost.
They're almost,

1456
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:30,360
in fact,
our actually cannot write your rejoinder

1457
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:31,893
while he does instead is he.
He plays out the consequences of the 

1458
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:36,114
ideas,
you know as the characteristics and he 

1459
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:39,114
takes his other characters like that who
don't adopt that way of being and then 

1460
01:20:43,561 --> 01:20:47,070
plays that out and shows them what the 
consequences are,

1461
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:51,120
which is brilliant.
It's like if you read brothers Karamazov

1462
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:55,660
and then the possessed with the devil,
and then you read who let her go,

1463
01:20:56,040 --> 01:21:00,770
you have the perfect merging of literary
or veterans

1464
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,633
literature.
You have the perfect marriage of 

1465
01:21:04,841 --> 01:21:05,674
literature and history because what 
Dostoevsky says will happen and why it 

1466
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:12,900
happens is exactly what happens.
So it's just fun.

1467
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:13,753
Broken sequence of moral revelation.
So Nike camp under you can hardly 

1468
01:21:19,901 --> 01:21:22,140
overestimate the impact of soldier nets 
is for.

1469
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,770
First of all,
we wanted to know the price for it,

1470
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:27,510
but more importantly he did more than 
over.

1471
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:31,210
Took out a tarion communism.
Then the American,

1472
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,580
the American military.
No,

1473
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,493
no.
I'm not saying necessarily that the 

1474
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:40,220
American military was a major player.
That boy,

1475
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,073
I certainly think they work because 
Stalin was perfectly willing to drop 

1476
01:21:44,331 --> 01:21:47,320
into Europe with hydrogen bonds.
You know,

1477
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,530
he's a seriously.
He was seriously not a good guy.

1478
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,470
So
when.

1479
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,740
Okay.
So those like,

1480
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,593
those are absolutely necessary books.
Most books written by people who are 

1481
01:21:58,631 --> 01:22:03,420
universally regarded as great.
This

1482
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:06,110
here,
you know,

1483
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,943
you hear this again on the edges of 
literary criticism said the canonical 

1484
01:22:11,171 --> 01:22:12,004
writings were selected because of the 
desires of the oppressive class or some 

1485
01:22:15,491 --> 01:22:18,300
sort of absolute rubbish like that.
It's like

1486
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:24,723
partly,
but it's not relevant because all these 

1487
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,673
people like pages and pages full of
derogatory comments about women know 

1488
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,320
they're not full of them,
but they happen now.

1489
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,310
Well,
who's writing by yourself?

1490
01:22:42,311 --> 01:22:43,440
He was really,
really sick.

1491
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:46,440
Never sold any books.
He was so ill,

1492
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,480
he could hardly write it.
All confined is reading.

1493
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,650
Took like 10 minute bursts and he was 
isolated and alone,

1494
01:22:53,860 --> 01:22:57,590
so now I'm tired to resentful and wrote 
something rude.

1495
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:00,450
The guy had his off time.
He,

1496
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,380
Darlene was like for me.
You know what I mean?

1497
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,210
He was a genius.
He was a full professor when he was here

1498
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:06,900
as John.
It's like,

1499
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:09,790
you know,
it's not pleasant,

1500
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:13,410
but what you're supposed to do when you 
read a grit work is

1501
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:16,713
from the.
We know we're not supposed to noticed 

1502
01:23:18,660 --> 01:23:20,050
one stupid thing and say,
oh,

1503
01:23:20,051 --> 01:23:22,340
the whole thing is rocking.
That's as fast.

1504
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:23,730
Really.
That's faster.

1505
01:23:24,990 --> 01:23:26,530
Here's so pathetic.
If you do that,

1506
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,960
you know when you read Freud and like,
yeah,

1507
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:32,470
he wrote in the 80 90 [inaudible] and 
some of his ideas are outdated,

1508
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:34,350
but what do you expect?
The 80,

1509
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:36,580
what do you expect?
It's like,

1510
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:37,983
so you say,
well you have to discard 20 percent of 

1511
01:23:39,611 --> 01:23:42,370
it and you pulled in the other 80 
percent of your bloody lucky that the 80

1512
01:23:42,371 --> 01:23:45,790
percent is there.
You're supposed to be reading not to get

1513
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:46,953
rid of things,
but you take the things that are 

1514
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:51,760
valuable.
And so I would say,

1515
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:53,610
you know,
I learned a lot from reading Freud,

1516
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,463
I learned a lot,
a tremendous amount from reading your 

1517
01:23:56,320 --> 01:24:00,040
bio is so profound that it's through 
unspeakable.

1518
01:24:00,130 --> 01:24:03,580
It's no wonder they don't teach it in 
universities like I'm serious,

1519
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,443
man,
that guy was,

1520
01:24:04,460 --> 01:24:05,293
he was a whole different form of life.
So he's terrifying you only as the 

1521
01:24:10,391 --> 01:24:11,224
person who will convince you that there 
are things going on in your head that 

1522
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:15,790
have nothing to do with you.
And that is not

1523
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,303
a very,

1524
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,210
that isn't one of those things that's 
designed to make you sleep easily.

1525
01:24:24,211 --> 01:24:27,170
At night.
Rogers,

1526
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,380
I learned a lot from Carl Rogers,
like all the great clinicians,

1527
01:24:31,381 --> 01:24:32,214
they already have something to say and,
and practical to say that will help you 

1528
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:37,470
live your life.
George Orwell,

1529
01:24:37,530 --> 01:24:38,550
Elvis,
Huxley.

1530
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,073
Um,

1531
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:48,320
well that's not that start.
But like,

1532
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,910
if it's part of the Canon,
this,

1533
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:52,720
especially the literary Canon,
you can assume that there's something to

1534
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,150
it.
And if you could also assume that if you

1535
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:57,730
read it and you don't get it,
it's probably you.

1536
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,133
So fucking.
So that's what does forgiving yourself 

1537
01:25:01,811 --> 01:25:06,811
look like?
That's a good one,

1538
01:25:11,571 --> 01:25:15,780
but I'm not going to answer it.
What's the best strategy?

1539
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,633
Can help people

1540
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,560
get your act together,
lead by example,

1541
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,050
and then if somebody comes and asks you 
for your opinion,

1542
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,040
tell them the truth.
That's.

1543
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:32,180
That's one thing I never liked someone 
listen,

1544
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:35,090
psychological trouble.
You'll just make it worse,

1545
01:25:35,091 --> 01:25:35,924
especially if they're of on the 
schizophrenia ends up things do not lie 

1546
01:25:38,811 --> 01:25:42,540
to them because they're very clinging to
the reality as it is and if you,

1547
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:43,833
you know,
they're already courtney structured in 

1548
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:49,980
some sense he dropped a little bit more 
sensitive to that,

1549
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,500
you know,
and it's hard to tell the truth.

1550
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:55,373
It's,
it's tricky because you have to be 

1551
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,630
telling the truth sort of at all levels 
at the same time.

1552
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,820
And also it has to be reworded.
It has to be right.

1553
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:03,750
The phrase has to be right in the 
semester.

1554
01:26:03,751 --> 01:26:07,910
We write paragraphs to be right.
The dialogue between the two of us to be

1555
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:08,744
right,
you have to be oriented in the right 

1556
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:10,334
direction.
Like all of those things have to be 

1557
01:26:11,301 --> 01:26:13,450
happening at the same time for it to be 
true,

1558
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:14,383
because otherwise you could say 
something that's destructive just so 

1559
01:26:17,411 --> 01:26:18,244
that you know,
filled the demands of the darkest part 

1560
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:23,090
of your being and then you can say,
well was true.

1561
01:26:23,091 --> 01:26:23,601
It's like,
no,

1562
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:24,950
it wasn't.
It was true.

1563
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:25,784
I had one tiny level of analysis and 
what you're doing is usually off the 

1564
01:26:28,311 --> 01:26:29,144
street to demonstrate your moral 
superiority would actually interacting 

1565
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:37,031
in a Mrs. Steve messed up
bad.

1566
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:43,250
So
listening is really useful too.

1567
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:44,510
That's great.

1568
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,700
So you mentioned that part of us wants 
to make things worse.

1569
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:54,701
What exactly do you mean?
Is there anybody here in this room who's

1570
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:01,900
actually never wanted to hurt someone?
Look,

1571
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,750
people
look deeper.

1572
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,130
How about yourself?
It's okay.

1573
01:27:10,131 --> 01:27:15,131
You don't have to answer that.
The reason that there are people,

1574
01:27:15,951 --> 01:27:16,784
one make things worse fundamentally is 
because they get irritated that the 

1575
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:21,320
structure of being,
you know,

1576
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,213
we get tortured by da because this 
soccer and then they get resentful and 

1577
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:27,800
angry and then they want to take it out 
on someone.

1578
01:27:28,190 --> 01:27:29,840
You know,
when you really see that,

1579
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,660
you know,
the US has an epidemic of mass shootings

1580
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,330
were happening so often I need to record
them,

1581
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:41,500
was doing that resentful people who want
to make things worse and they're people,

1582
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,220
they're like,
you know exactly like you,

1583
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:52,260
but they're quite a bit like you.
And so if you can't imagine what they're

1584
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:53,630
doing and why that.

1585
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:54,553
Well,
one thing I would say is you don't know 

1586
01:27:55,131 --> 01:27:55,964
very much about yourself and you're 
actually not watching very carefully 

1587
01:27:58,071 --> 01:28:01,260
because I mean I think I might have a 
darker side,

1588
01:28:01,261 --> 01:28:02,094
but most people,
I mean be inclined to believe that from 

1589
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,350
time to time.
Oh,

1590
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:11,420
I'm not sure if it's true,
but if you watch yourself,

1591
01:28:11,631 --> 01:28:13,550
you can see how you want to hurt all the
time.

1592
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,850
It happens.
I bet it happens 50 times a week.

1593
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:21,560
You know,
you want to win an argument with someone

1594
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:23,060
you love.
That's a good example.

1595
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,430
You don't listen,
you're not trying to solve the problem.

1596
01:28:25,431 --> 01:28:29,030
You just want to win an argument.
Well that's not very helpful.

1597
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,650
It makes things worse.
So,

1598
01:28:31,490 --> 01:28:35,210
and this isn't my opinion,
although it is my opinion,

1599
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,520
I mean one of the oldest stories,
you know,

1600
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,373
there's a few very old stories of 
mankind and one of them is that there's 

1601
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:45,680
a battle between good and evil going on 
in the human soul.

1602
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:46,723
And that's exactly right.
As right as people can make as it's as 

1603
01:28:51,111 --> 01:28:53,420
right as people can state it,
you don't,

1604
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:54,231
you might say,
well,

1605
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:59,231
you know how you define good
Auschwitz.

1606
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,170
We don't have to have that discussion 
anymore.

1607
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:11,520
I'd like to know a bit about your 
personal ideal.

1608
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:14,310
What are your longterm goals?
What motivates you in your life?

1609
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,880
Well,
my mind,

1610
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:31,190
what motivates us,
that's I think fairly strict.

1611
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,690
All sorts of motivations.
But I mean,

1612
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,700
nate,
major motivations.

1613
01:29:37,340 --> 01:29:41,030
I like to figure out what the hell is 
going on and communicate it.

1614
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:43,370
You know,
I really,

1615
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,940
I believe that I've done my best to 
actually pursue the truth and,

1616
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:54,990
and it's so useful.
It's so useful.

1617
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:59,070
It's so fun to communicate to people 
because one of the things I see,

1618
01:29:59,071 --> 01:30:01,320
and this is gonna be fun.
So when I talked to the audience,

1619
01:30:01,321 --> 01:30:03,830
it's so cool because lights go on it.

1620
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:09,180
That's really fun.
So when I see that all the time,

1621
01:30:09,181 --> 01:30:11,320
if I really communicating to an audience
because someone,

1622
01:30:11,350 --> 01:30:13,620
people like that and then the nod and 
you think yes,

1623
01:30:13,621 --> 01:30:15,060
right?
Or a bunch of connections,

1624
01:30:15,061 --> 01:30:15,894
just throwing stuff together.
Then the person got a little blast 

1625
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:20,710
that's like turning on lights,
you know.

1626
01:30:20,711 --> 01:30:23,100
And so that's fun.
That's fun.

1627
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:26,480
So that's my longterm goal,
man.

1628
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:30,280
Turn on lots of lights.
Yeah.

1629
01:30:31,050 --> 01:30:31,883
What motivates me in my life.
I would really rather than things 

1630
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:39,751
couldn't get as bad as they could.
So that's motivated me

1631
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:44,000
since like 19,
I don't know how long,

1632
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:44,641
19.
80.

1633
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:47,340
Probably because it was in the height of
the Cold War,

1634
01:30:47,341 --> 01:30:48,174
you know,
and things did not look good and I just 

1635
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:52,880
started to read about the history of the
20th century.

1636
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:56,940
God
so terrible.

1637
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:00,870
And like I would just wrap it up in 
half.

1638
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,550
It seems unnecessary.

1639
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:08,180
So whatever I could do to make that even
somewhat less likely to happen again,

1640
01:31:08,701 --> 01:31:10,050
that's fine.
That's fine.

1641
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:15,051
And I don't question that
because it seems so wrong.

1642
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:17,993
You know,
I remember the story that really stuck 

1643
01:31:20,551 --> 01:31:24,090
with me and there was this story about,
you know,

1644
01:31:24,091 --> 01:31:24,924
our switch was a big city basically,
it was a huge place and one of the 

1645
01:31:28,831 --> 01:31:32,190
things that gardens used to do was when 
the people were unloaded,

1646
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,333
you know,
they were separating families and 

1647
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:36,443
anybody who didn't look like they were 
going to be useful to do a bunch of 

1648
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:41,760
useful score before they died would be 
just sent off to the gas chambers.

1649
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:48,120
And so that's pretty
imaginative and uh,

1650
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:52,910
but that wasn't bad enough,
you know,

1651
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:53,783
because if you did survive
even after having lost everything like 

1652
01:31:57,781 --> 01:32:00,430
that,
then there was always the opportunity to

1653
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,353
purchase you with useless work.
So one of the tricks of the guards was 

1654
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:05,524
to make people pick up a sack of salt.
We are 100 pounds and carry it from one 

1655
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,760
side of the camp to be up and then back.

1656
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:15,380
Brilliant,
brilliant.

1657
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:21,580
You know what evil is an aesthetic and 
it has a sense of humor.

1658
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:23,783
I mean,
the sign over Auschwitz read work will 

1659
01:32:25,961 --> 01:32:26,560
make

1660
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,393
great.

1661
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:31,293
That's a joke by the way.
It's like the mutual assured 

1662
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:35,194
destruction.
The geopolitical idea in the 19 sixties 

1663
01:32:43,191 --> 01:32:45,100
and fifties was mutual assured 
destruction.

1664
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,510
When you launched your weapon,
you're done,

1665
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:50,570
you're done.
There's nothing left in the afternoon is

1666
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:52,910
math.
It's like that's a joke.

1667
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:58,310
It's a joke,
but it's not funny and you know that's.

1668
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,430
That's a place where you see the art,
the archetype of evil,

1669
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:06,110
urge in the midst of the geopolitical 
debate to emerge from the pit,

1670
01:33:06,111 --> 01:33:08,090
so to speak,
in your job like that,

1671
01:33:08,091 --> 01:33:11,630
and then to retrieve.
It's not.

1672
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,720
That's the thing.
Worth the fight.

1673
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:30,380
We should decide someone.
When do we stop?

1674
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:32,110
One more question.
Okay.

1675
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:32,993
One more question.

1676
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,433
How do you compromise making it?
Are you becoming successful while being 

1677
01:33:53,071 --> 01:33:55,330
true to yourself and not falling into 
the system?

1678
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,190
Pretty question.
That's an existential question.

1679
01:34:00,191 --> 01:34:01,024
By the way.
The reason I framed it that way just 

1680
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:03,783
because it's an eternal question.
I think that's the question that human 

1681
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:09,730
beings have always had to face no matter
when,

1682
01:34:09,731 --> 01:34:12,730
no matter where,
because the system is always corrupt.

1683
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,943
It's always corrupt.
That's an archetype stuck to the old 

1684
01:34:16,421 --> 01:34:20,590
dead evil and the reason it's corrupt.
There's two reasons,

1685
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:24,790
one is it started with Dave and because 
it's lighting behind the present and the

1686
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:25,624
future,
so it's,

1687
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:26,493
it's just design for the wrong era.
That's part of it and they never part 

1688
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:31,073
is.
People aren't updating it because they 

1689
01:34:32,031 --> 01:34:35,450
were willfully blind tartar away,
but,

1690
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,470
and so now if you align with it too 
tightly,

1691
01:34:38,471 --> 01:34:41,770
then you risk becoming a carbon copy of 
that.

1692
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:45,520
But by the same token,
the thing is it's one side who's upset.

1693
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:47,380
So this is a really important thing to 
learn.

1694
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:51,990
He first he is the culture is that the 
tyrannical cane,

1695
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:54,220
but it's also the vice kate and at the 
same time,

1696
01:34:54,221 --> 01:34:55,054
and you know,
you're obviously the press by the 

1697
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,490
University of Toronto,
but you know,

1698
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:03,490
here you are and so you're unbelievably 
privileged at the same time you're being

1699
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:07,190
torn apart and that's exactly what it's 
like to live within a culture.

1700
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,980
You know,
you're lucky if you're lucky,

1701
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:14,090
if all that's happening is that you're 
not being torn apart because the typical

1702
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:17,550
tyrannical system,
all it does is to create a lot.

1703
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:18,413
It doesn't do anything good for him.
At least you can sit here and relevant 

1704
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:23,000
piece and say what you want lights are 
on and it's warm,

1705
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:25,130
you know,
so that's actually pretty good.

1706
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,113
So the first thing you have to 
understand is that you need to be 

1707
01:35:28,401 --> 01:35:29,690
grateful to the system.

1708
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:33,770
It's given you everything.
Now it's taking away a lot too.

1709
01:35:33,771 --> 01:35:35,470
But that's just like,
yeah,

1710
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:36,403
that's the existential issue is games 
with one hand and takes away with the 

1711
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:39,854
other.
So the trick is how to not become 

1712
01:35:41,601 --> 01:35:43,700
corrupt by identification with the 
system.

1713
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:46,570
It's how to balance balance gratitude 
with the,

1714
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:49,670
with the awareness and the desire to 
make change.

1715
01:35:50,210 --> 01:35:54,830
And that actually is being represented 
in religious thought in many ways.

1716
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:56,690
So with the ancient Egyptians,
for example,

1717
01:35:56,691 --> 01:36:00,650
they,
they represented the system with the god

1718
01:36:00,651 --> 01:36:05,651
or Cyrus who was old and blind and and 
likely to fall under evil influenced and

1719
01:36:06,411 --> 01:36:09,410
the different dog named horace who is 
the art of Egypt,

1720
01:36:09,411 --> 01:36:11,750
you know,
and horace.

1721
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:15,390
His job was to see evil because I'm 
serious,

1722
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:18,440
was blind to it.
And then to enter into combat with it,

1723
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,040
even though that's very difficult,
and the horror said,

1724
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,000
one of his eyes,
pour it out when we did that.

1725
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,490
And then to go bring your side of the 
stack.

1726
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,900
The death basically will.
That's what you're supposed to do.

1727
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:32,700
You're supposed to you,
you've got an old dead came

1728
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:39,730
and your job is to pay attention.
See where things are not right.

1729
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,090
Fix it.
And if you do that,

1730
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:44,953
then you can align yourself with the 
positive element of the culture while 

1731
01:36:47,931 --> 01:36:52,670
you're simultaneously act as the living 
corrected to its accesses.

1732
01:36:53,180 --> 01:36:55,130
And you can do that.
Here's one way to do it.

1733
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:59,630
You could start new university.
Well one is don't write things you don't

1734
01:36:59,631 --> 01:37:00,464
believe.
I would also say this is where you're 

1735
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:05,480
supposed to challenge things.
University.

1736
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:08,840
Don't act like you believe things don't 
bleed.

1737
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,990
No,
because.

1738
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:10,823
And it happens.
You're not going to fight about the 

1739
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,213
culture.
You're going to find 100,000 micro 

1740
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:15,824
battles with the culture.
And you have to decide with each micro 

1741
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:20,960
battle what you're going to do.

1742
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:23,780
And it's really important.
So I can give you an example.

1743
01:37:23,781 --> 01:37:24,614
So let's say you go to work and there's 
a bone there because there will be and 

1744
01:37:29,571 --> 01:37:33,050
the boy comes into your office and you 
have 10 seconds to make yourself make it

1745
01:37:33,051 --> 01:37:34,600
clear whether or not you're going to be 
bullied.

1746
01:37:35,070 --> 01:37:38,990
That's all 10 sentence because he's 
going to figure it out that well.

1747
01:37:38,991 --> 01:37:41,030
So how,
how have you been in not being bullied?

1748
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,193
You have to transform yourself into the 
sort of person that isn't going to be 

1749
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:45,734
bullying and the bullies will figure 
that out right away and he'll go find 

1750
01:37:47,781 --> 01:37:52,070
someone easier to pick on him and you 
win and you'll hardly even notice.

1751
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:57,840
So
if you continue to fight against,

1752
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,630
if you continue to fight,

1753
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:03,620
yeah,

1754
01:38:03,620 --> 01:38:08,620
and I'm wait and colorful way
against things that we didn't press you,

1755
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:10,403
but it will become strong and if you 
become strong but you won't be co-opted 

1756
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:16,080
into the evil of the system.
And a lot of that has to do.

1757
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,820
The Egyptians have this right?
The mesopotamians had the same idea.

1758
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,920
They're gone.
They're chaos.

1759
01:38:22,090 --> 01:38:24,970
Eliminating God had eyes all the way 
around it's head.

1760
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:28,090
Whereas the Egyptians just worshiped 
the.

1761
01:38:28,091 --> 01:38:28,924
I naturally we're thinking about,
because I don't think you fight 

1762
01:38:31,211 --> 01:38:34,780
corruption with rationality and 
intelligence.

1763
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:35,703
There's no correlation between 
intelligence and conscientiousness by 

1764
01:38:37,481 --> 01:38:39,370
the way,
so it's not a moral,

1765
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:44,110
so what our moral faculty,
it might be a discriminating factor,

1766
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:48,190
but it's not an olfactory attention.
That's what you fight against.

1767
01:38:48,191 --> 01:38:50,110
Corruption.
You Watch,

1768
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:51,003
you pay attention because paying 
attention means I'm willing to see 

1769
01:38:53,891 --> 01:38:54,724
what's happening and if something 
happens that you find objectionable and 

1770
01:38:59,230 --> 01:39:03,100
you know what to do about it and you 
could do it and you would do it,

1771
01:39:03,101 --> 01:39:03,870
and that's about it.

1772
01:39:03,870 --> 01:39:04,703
We feel you should engage in that 
invasion right down there because that 

1773
01:39:07,381 --> 01:39:11,470
made you start the system.
It's Michael Michael Challenges.

1774
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,793
Stop the system from degenerating into 
corruption and actually that's not a 

1775
01:39:16,061 --> 01:39:16,894
theory.
You already know that if you read the 

1776
01:39:17,741 --> 01:39:18,574
Gulag archipelago.
One of this things that social hits and 

1777
01:39:20,531 --> 01:39:21,790
does is say,
okay,

1778
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:26,860
how did the Soviet Union developed into 
something that ate its own children?

1779
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,710
That's his question,
and what he said was

1780
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:32,920
people lied about everything all the 
time.

1781
01:39:34,240 --> 01:39:37,930
They so they would claim to be happy and
satisfied with.

1782
01:39:37,931 --> 01:39:41,770
They were terrified and angry and they 
were micro decisions,

1783
01:39:41,771 --> 01:39:44,880
you know,
it's like little things like big lie now

1784
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:49,000
happily for three hours to get bread.
Now that's not a great example,

1785
01:39:49,001 --> 01:39:52,300
but.
But I can't.

1786
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:54,470
I'm sorry.
I can't conjure up a great example right

1787
01:39:54,471 --> 01:39:58,520
at the moment.
The bullying example is not a bad one.

1788
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,190
And then I guess the other thing would 
be it's associated with the ideal.

1789
01:40:07,191 --> 01:40:09,110
So if you're an idealist to make things 
better,

1790
01:40:12,110 --> 01:40:14,720
then you put that above whatever else it
is that you're doing.

1791
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,353
And if you're offered the opportunity to
engage in something corrupt for short 

1792
01:40:19,311 --> 01:40:21,950
term material gain or even to avoid 
conflict,

1793
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:25,740
you shouldn't take it.
You should say no,

1794
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:29,820
but you have to be ready.
Say No and I don't think you'll be ready

1795
01:40:29,821 --> 01:40:31,740
to say no unless you know what the 
consequences are.

1796
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,140
Not Said No.
Does our,

1797
01:40:34,170 --> 01:40:37,430
you'll get weak.
Things will go downhill,

1798
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:40,840
they'll get worse and worse,
and then you'll start.

1799
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:42,703
You'll,
you'll be increasingly motivated to 

1800
01:40:44,321 --> 01:40:47,800
start hurting people.
So if you don't want to go there,

1801
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:50,890
then when you're offered the chance to 
build their own little bit,

1802
01:40:51,180 --> 01:40:52,013
don't go there and you have to be 
terrified because the thing is going to 

1803
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:56,260
be conflict,
right?

1804
01:40:56,261 --> 01:40:58,810
If you say no about something,
first of all,

1805
01:40:58,811 --> 01:40:59,644
if it's a moral request,
you were exposing the corruption of the 

1806
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:02,224
person who's making the request and 
they're not going to be happy about 

1807
01:41:04,271 --> 01:41:05,104
that.

1808
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:05,943
And the second thing is you have to 
engage in some cars like that's not 

1809
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:08,884
pleasant.
So you've got to think what's going to 

1810
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:12,970
fortify you enough to do that?
And that's easy.

1811
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,760
All you have to do is know where the 
hell you could end up.

1812
01:41:16,370 --> 01:41:18,620
And if you really know that,
if you really know it,

1813
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,500
you have man,
I'm not going there.

1814
01:41:20,650 --> 01:41:24,850
I knocked go there and if it means we 
have to have a bit of an argument for an

1815
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:26,410
hour,
no problem,

1816
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:29,380
no problem.
And you'll find it's pretty cool.

1817
01:41:29,410 --> 01:41:30,243
It's what you'll find is that people 
just don't know that much about those 

1818
01:41:33,531 --> 01:41:34,364
sorts of things.
They just don't come and do that to you 

1819
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:38,833
because it just doesn't work.
They'll go find someone who's either 

1820
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:44,883
corrupt,
but you know you have to know the 

1821
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:52,250
difference and you have to want to know 
and then then you can do it.

1822
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,083
I think you could do it because I think 
that I think the truth is more powerful 

1823
01:41:55,881 --> 01:41:56,714
than deception and I think the good is 
more powerful than evil and I really 

1824
01:41:59,391 --> 01:42:03,170
mean that.
I think evil and deceit are weak and so

1825
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,820
big.
How could they withstand the truth?

1826
01:42:07,821 --> 01:42:10,400
How would that even be possible?
The truth is reality.

1827
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:13,080
How do you withstand reality?
Have a sad reality.

1828
01:42:13,081 --> 01:42:13,914
It just rolls over you and so people who
are devoted towards malevolence and he 

1829
01:42:18,041 --> 01:42:21,230
used deception,
pathologists to relationship with being,

1830
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:23,360
you've got to be strong.
If you do that,

1831
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:24,733
it's not probably possible.
It's like you're driving a rickety car 

1832
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:30,230
across a really bumpy landscape,
so

1833
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:40,630
thank you.
