1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,870
All right.
So

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,760
we've been talking about
a code of representations in some sense

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,383
of symbolic representation and I've been
trying to guide you through some 

4
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,454
developing understanding of that code of
symbolic representation so that as we 

5
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:26,474
progress through the course,
you'll have the ground rules in some 

6
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:33,470
sense for interpreting all the different
theories that we encounter.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,380
And uh,
we're going to continue that today.

8
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:37,214
This is the last lecture on sort of pre 
psychoanalytic conceptions of 

9
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,594
personality.
And then we moved to piaget and then to 

10
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:45,950
you.
So

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,773
the first thing I tried to point out to 
you was that social primates like us 

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,820
likely have a cognitive structure that's
based on social categories.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,380
And that when our cognitive systems 
elaborate it up enough to start thinking

14
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:06,460
about the world in more abstract terms 
beyond our immediate environment,

15
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,560
there's a high probability that we 
learned,

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,620
we used the same cognitive structures 
that had evolved to begin the process of

17
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,963
abstract conceptualization.
And so in some sense you could say we 

18
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:19,324
used our knowledge of personality to 
start to understand the external world 

19
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,340
based on the initial axiomatic 
assumption.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,563
It's not a cognitive assumption.
It was a perceptual assumption that the 

21
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:35,470
world was like a personality.
And we do this automatically.

22
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:38,170
So I want to show you a little video 
here that's quite a famous video.

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,070
Um,
it shows you how easily you can abstract

24
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:46,450
out and narrative from the most abstract
of events.

25
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,110
Okay.
So watch what happens.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,953
Okay.

27
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,680
Okay,
let's watch that one more time.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,300
So it's something like,
we'll go over it again.

29
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,134
It's something like the little circle,
the poor little circle is trying to 

30
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:25,854
escape and when it does,
the bad gray triangle comes up and sort 

31
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,764
of steals it.
And then a blue triangle has a little 

32
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:33,550
scrap with the gray triangle and you 
know,

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,930
puts the little yellow or the little 
circle back into its safe and closure.

34
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,560
Right?
And so the,

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,563
the reason that that demonstration was 
developed was to indicate or two and 

36
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,710
also to task how little information you 
really needed,

37
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:51,690
how low resolution the information was 
that you needed in order to perceive,

38
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:54,150
to directly perceive something that was 
like a narrative.

39
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,201
So,
you know,

40
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,600
and that's a relatively complicated 
narrative.

41
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:01,390
All things considered for a square at 
two triangles.

42
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,150
And a circle interacting for maybe three
or four seconds.

43
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,240
So you know,
the,

44
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,163
the point of this demonstration is to 
indicate just exactly how prepared you 

45
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,220
are to read the world in narrative 
terms.

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,503
So

47
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,540
yeah,

48
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,373
Laurie,

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,193
okay.

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,530
Now I had talked to you about these 
figures before and I was trying to make,

51
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:25,364
so here,
here's kind of an overview of what I'm 

52
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:29,330
attempting to describe to you.
So the one,

53
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,613
there's one category of representation 
that has to do with the territory that 

54
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:37,490
you inhabit and that you understand 
that's primarily social territory and it

55
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:42,380
tends to be symbolized by masculine and 
usually like older male symbols.

56
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,370
So that's the patriarchal structure.
I really think what it is is a,

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,720
it's a personified representation of the
dominance hierarchy structure.

58
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,100
So if remember the lion king,
you know the pride rock thing.

59
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
So the pride rock is sort of associated 
with the,

60
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:00,590
with the symbols father.
And so that's,

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,770
that's that category of symbol is the 
symbol that I'm talking about.

62
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,604
So he used that,
that high place on a mountain as an 

63
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:09,080
indicator of dominance structure.

64
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,500
You saw that at the opening of the lion 
king movie where all the animals come,

65
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,070
they gather around,
they all bow before the,

66
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,750
the rock with the king on top of it.
And the king,

67
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,584
like the lion is a symbol generally a 
symbol of something like solar power 

68
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,873
because the lion is a top Predator,
it's apex Predator and it lives in 

69
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,270
Africa under the sun and it has a main,
that's sort of like a son.

70
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:30,104
And then later in the lion king will 
actually see this today you'll see the 

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,860
father lion who fossa.
Yes,

72
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,020
he appears in the sky with a solar halo 
around him.

73
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,700
So,
so that's the masculine category.

74
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,020
And then the feminine category I told 
you a little about a bit about is a more

75
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:48,854
chaotic category and it's a,
it's a chaotic and plastic category out 

76
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,320
of which new forms emerge.

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,543
And then one of the categories that we 
haven't talked about is the category of 

78
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:58,934
the individual and the individual is the
hero and hero stories and is the 

79
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,014
initiate and initiatory routines.
And so the hero is the person who is 

80
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:08,024
attempting to become a complete 
biological and historical entity 

81
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,190
personality so that they're capable not 
only of,

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,050
of,
of um,

83
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,813
adopting independent existence,
but if adopting independent existence 

84
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,223
that's productive and that's productive 
in a way that's also a benefit to the 

85
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:28,424
community.
So it's a particular pattern of 

86
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:30,944
development and that that needs to be 
catalyzed by human societies because in 

87
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,134
order for a society to,
to maintain its structure and for the 

88
00:05:39,531 --> 00:05:40,364
people within it to thrive,
the developing individuals have to 

89
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:46,790
mature to the point where they can take 
care of themselves in a way that doesn't

90
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:50,000
disrupt the whole social structure.
And so that's the path.

91
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,390
It's a natural path for human beings.
I would say to some degree because we're

92
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:54,224
such intensely social creatures,
but because we're also quite malleable 

93
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:01,640
and complex and also grounded in history
and cultural creatures,

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,623
it's also something that has to be 
taught both from the perspective of 

95
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:09,740
invitation and explicitly.
And so a lot of initiation rights,

96
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,590
for example,
are predicated on the idea that you take

97
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:15,380
the person out of their childhood 
context,

98
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,720
you destroy their personality usually as
a consequence of some cause,

99
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:20,554
a traumatic encounter and then you 
refill them with the cultural norms and 

100
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:27,260
that makes them an adult.
And so,

101
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,094
you know,
to some degree that's what you guys are 

102
00:06:29,091 --> 00:06:29,924
doing in a very slow way.
When you make the transition from high 

103
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,510
school say to university or that 
transition from high school to a,

104
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,460
to a job.
We don't,

105
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,294
in our culture,
we don't have the kind of abrupt 

106
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:43,130
ceremonies though that are designed to 
catalyze that transformation.

107
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,990
And you know,
maybe that's an okay thing and,

108
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,423
and then maybe it's not an okay thing.
I mean one of the things that Freud 

109
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,080
pointed out,
and he's absolutely right about this,

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,180
is that because human beings have such a
long dependency period,

111
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,103
it's not that easy for us to grow up.
And sometimes it takes a shock in order 

112
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,454
for that to happen.
And so one of the potential problems 

113
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:05,564
with having a dependency period as long 
as the human dependency period is that 

114
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:13,610
it never ends and that you stay immature
forever.

115
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,713
And really I believe that that's the 
central old problem that Freud talked 

116
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,514
about.
And I believe also that it's a real 

117
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,880
problem.
Now whether Freud formulated it,

118
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,770
you know,
with precise accuracy,

119
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,300
that's a different story.
But you know,

120
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:29,060
you've got to give the guy a break.
At least he formulated and it,

121
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,923
and it's,
I mean I was much more impressed with 

122
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:33,104
Freud and eda pull theorizing after I 
did clinical work for a long time 

123
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:36,884
because a large number of my patients,
their primary problem is getting the 

124
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,390
hell out of their family.

125
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,680
They just can't do it.
And so for them the world is the family.

126
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:48,650
It's the only thing that matters.
It's often parental opinion or something

127
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,660
like that and they just cannot break 
free of it.

128
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,913
So you know,
initiation ceremonies in part were 

129
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:57,620
designed to catalyze that,
that break so that your,

130
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,530
your mother in particular,
but also your father to some degree,

131
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,820
we're no longer the dominant figures of 
influenced your,

132
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:08,060
your personal mother and father were no 
longer the dominant figures of influence

133
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:08,894
in your life.
So because really that's what he 

134
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,650
maturation means in some sense is that 
when you become an adult,

135
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,693
the opinions of your parents are as 
important as the opinions of any other 

136
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,390
reasonable people that hypothetically 
care for you.

137
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:26,030
But no more important than that.
So,

138
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,093
and I told you about some of the 
symbolic associations that that gather 

139
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,350
around say images of the unknown.

140
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,230
You could also think of the unknown as 
unexplored territory.

141
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:37,064
But it's a tricky kind of territory 
because if the person beside you does 

142
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,054
something spectacularly weird,
you move from explored territory to 

143
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:47,960
unexplored territory as soon as you 
don't understand what they're doing.

144
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,990
So it's not exactly spacial temper 
territory.

145
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,033
It's more like,
it's more like temporal spacial 

146
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,733
territory.
It's time and space because the same 

147
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,840
place can be a different place from one 
moment to the next.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,833
Now it happens all the time when some 
event that you don't expect occurs in 

149
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:10,251
the place that you are so and your body 
is prepared to react,

150
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,970
it's instinctively prepared to react to 
the emergence of chaotic circumstances.

151
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,804
It basically does that by hyper 
activating your preparation for action 

152
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:23,370
and increasing your capacity to pay 
attention and preparing you to do a very

153
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:26,310
large number of things at once because 
you don't know what to do.

154
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,100
It's a high stress reaction,
but it's built into you.

155
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:29,963
And it's so interesting because what 
that means that is part of what's built 

156
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,550
into people is the ability to deal with 
what they don't understand,

157
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,050
which is a real paradox,
right?

158
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:39,510
Because how can you deal with what you 
don't understand?

159
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,910
You don't understand it.
So,

160
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,260
but the answer is,
well,

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,113
you,
you ramp up your ability to react in a 

162
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:50,400
very large number of ways and you do 
that by increasing your general level of

163
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:52,860
arousal and your attention.
And it's a good,

164
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,903
that also increases the probability that
you're going to be attentive to new 

165
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,684
information and pull it in and utilize 
it so that you can decide how to act 

166
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,750
rapidly.
So other things happen.

167
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,430
For example,
you know,

168
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,264
some of you may have been in car 
accidents or events like that where you 

169
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,821
knew for a few seconds that the event 
was going to occur and time slowed down.

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,910
It's quite a common,
uh,

171
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,773
commonly reported phenomena.
I've experienced it a number of times 

172
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,280
actually.
And,

173
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:23,700
uh,
it was actually experimentally tested.

174
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,863
They,
uh,

175
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,130
threw people off Bungee cord 
apparatuses,

176
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:30,630
you know,
so apparatuses,

177
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,730
so they were plummeting down,
you know,

178
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:33,564
in a quite frightening manner and had 
them look at digital timers that were 

179
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:38,310
flashing information while they were 
falling.

180
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,144
And it turned out that the people who 
are falling could process the digital 

181
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:42,564
information faster than people who are 
just standing there under normal 

182
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,760
circumstances.
How they got that passed.

183
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:49,320
An ethics committee is beyond me,
but,

184
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,200
but it's a brilliant,
it really is a brilliant experiment.

185
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,190
So I went through some of the symbolism 
of the unknown.

186
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,323
I want to go through some of the 
symbolism that's associated with the 

187
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:01,770
known today.
So give you some sense.

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,940
Flags are definitely patriarchal symbols
there.

189
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,180
Their cultural symbols.

190
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,390
And here's some,
I'll just lay out a variety of terms.

191
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:10,224
And so that'll give you some indication 
of the network of associations that's 

192
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:17,280
associated with the symbol of the 
dominance hierarchy.

193
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,330
Fundamentally culture,
Apple Linnaean control.

194
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,690
That's after Apollo,
the god Super Ego,

195
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:25,860
the conscious,
the king,

196
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:27,450
the patriarch,
the plow.

197
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,433
Cause the plow opens up the earth,
the fellas order and authority and the 

198
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:36,660
crushing weight of tradition,
the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,

199
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,460
the day sky,
the country man,

200
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:39,480
the island,
the heights,

201
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,720
the ancestral spirits,
and the activity of the dead.

202
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,190
Now these symbolic realms or are kind of
there,

203
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,250
there's there
situationally transformable.

204
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,420
So if you look across very frequently in
stories,

205
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:58,570
you see characters that exemplify each 
of these categories,

206
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,510
but the characters can shift to some 
degree.

207
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,380
For example,
so often if the story involves the ocean

208
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:09,370
and an island than the ocean will be 
feminine in Ireland will be masculine.

209
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,630
But if the story utilizes an island and 
the air,

210
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:16,390
then the island will be feminine and in 
the air will be masculine.

211
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:17,224
So it isn't as if there's a one to one 
correspondence between the entities in 

212
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,984
the story and these archetipal 
categories because their definition 

213
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:29,410
depends on,
they can't be defined in isolation.

214
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,000
So it's,
it's,

215
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,880
it's sort of like does this really 
stupid example,

216
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,530
but it's the best one I can come up with
at the moment.

217
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,690
If you're trying to interpret 
statistics,

218
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,524
you can't understand what a given 
statistic means unless you know the 

219
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:45,040
number of people in the experiment,
the effect size and the probability that

220
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,510
that affects size is that at emerged at 
a better than chance level.

221
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,993
Any of those pieces of information 
without the other two are actually 

222
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:56,650
meaningless.
And it's the same situation here.

223
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,663
You have to have the representation of 
culture and you have to have the 

224
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:00,424
representation of nature and you have to
have the representation of the 

225
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:03,970
individual.

226
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,223
And then you can figure out what,
what entities are being used in those 

227
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,154
different categories.
Even though there's some similarity 

228
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:11,374
across stories,
which is partly why you could actually 

229
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:14,660
understand stories,
right?

230
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,480
Because if there was no similarity 
across them,

231
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,340
then you wouldn't be able to understand 
them.

232
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,300
So,
um,

233
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,330
there's some representations of the 
great father.

234
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,510
Um,
the,

235
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,380
the one on the left,
which is on the right,

236
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,820
was quite a horrifying image,
you know,

237
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:33,070
and that's a kind of a devouring father 
figure.

238
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,870
And you know,
here,

239
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,800
here's a,
here's a way of thinking about that,

240
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,500
which I think is extremely useful.
So you,

241
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,940
here,
you guys are in university,

242
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:41,080
you know,
and so,

243
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,243
um,
university is one of those patriarchal 

244
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,880
institution that's gives with one hand 
and takes away with another,

245
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,320
right?
So when you come here,

246
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,570
there's thousands of you.
There's tens of thousands of view.

247
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,613
So in some sense as an individual,
you're rather faceless and you're also 

248
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,740
in some sense at the bottom of the power
hierarchy in the university,

249
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,700
I think more than you should be,
but whatever you,

250
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,130
you are at the bottom of it.

251
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,173
And so there's,
there's a crushing institutional weight 

252
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:09,640
that comes along with being part of such
a big university in particular.

253
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,474
You know,
that's really hard on students in their 

254
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,170
first year.
You know,

255
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,013
it's always seemed to me that it's 
better for first year students to go to 

256
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,110
a smaller place where the institutional 
weight is not so heavy.

257
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,273
And you know,
I've tested u of t students in their 

258
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:24,214
first year with things like the Beck 
depression inventory and about 30% of u 

259
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:31,330
of t students meet criteria for 
hospitalized depression.

260
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,771
They do,
you know,

261
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,604
but,
but that's also because the back is way 

262
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,450
more sensitive to that then it should be
at least that,

263
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,373
you know,
because I don't think its criteria for 

264
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,950
when you should be hospitalized are 
reasonable.

265
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:45,580
But the point is is that the depression 
and the anxiety is quite high.

266
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,960
And so,
but on the other hand,

267
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,210
of course you're benefiting from going 
to university.

268
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,310
And so that's the kind of bipolar nature
of the symbol.

269
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,920
It's the tire in town,
it's benevolent tradition.

270
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:56,570
At the same time,
you know,

271
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,463
it's molding you.
You could even say it's crushing you 

272
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,110
because an educational system does that.
But at the same time it's like,

273
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,390
well,
unless you allow yourself to get crushed

274
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,640
by it,
you're not going to get the benefit.

275
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,713
And that's the paradoxical relationship 
that individuals have with culture 

276
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,370
everywhere.
And at all time.

277
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,653
You know,
without culture you're nothing but with 

278
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:18,830
culture you have to be a cog in some 
sense.

279
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,880
And so the tension between those two 
things is continual and constant.

280
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,714
You could think about it as an 
existential constant ever since there's 

281
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,194
been complex human societies and maybe 
even when there were only tribal human 

282
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:31,754
societies,
that's been a problem for the 

283
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,090
individual.
So culture,

284
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,073
tradition,
the dominance hierarchy is a solution 

285
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,130
and a problem and nature,
the unknown,

286
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:43,760
unexplored territory is a solution and a
problem.

287
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,950
And then the third category,
while you see,

288
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,960
I'll just tell you a couple of things 
about these images.

289
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,690
So the one in the right,
that's the devouring father,

290
00:15:50,691 --> 00:15:51,524
that's also giving birth.
So in some sense your personalities are 

291
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:58,250
being devoured by the university,
but at the same time a new personalities

292
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,190
coming,
you know,

293
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,163
emerging as a consequence of that.
And hopefully it's a better personality 

294
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:05,690
than the previous one.
If you can tolerate the tension of being

295
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,820
transformed,
the heat and the pressure,

296
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,710
then hopefully you come out,
you know,

297
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,050
you come out though,
it's worth it.

298
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:13,880
The process is worth it.
Okay.

299
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,953
Now you know,
you see on the left there at the top on 

300
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:17,480
the,
sorry,

301
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,313
on the right at the top you see a 
picture of an old man kissing Joseph 

302
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,260
Stalin,
which is quite a weird thing to do.

303
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,410
Given that Joseph Stalin was probably 
responsible for the deaths of,

304
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,473
you know,
some number of people in excess of 10 

305
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,453
million,
perhaps in excess of 30 million people 

306
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,160
argue about this all the time.

307
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,173
He certainly starved 6 million 
Ukrainians to death in the 1930s which 

308
00:16:38,421 --> 00:16:39,254
is something that you know,
for some reason you don't hear much 

309
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:41,864
about your education but you know,
6 million Ukrainians probably worth 

310
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:45,883
noticing a little bit,
but it doesn't matter because this old 

311
00:16:49,011 --> 00:16:49,844
man,
this was taken after the fall of the 

312
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,903
Berlin Wall.
He's nostalgic for the times when 

313
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:56,600
everything was certain,
you know,

314
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,434
and the the gold statue of Stella and 
his representation in some sense of a 

315
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,710
day of five leader.
And the old man is there,

316
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:04,544
is in a position of worship.
And then Captain Hook there at the 

317
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:07,934
bottom on the right hand side.
He's quite an interesting character 

318
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:10,964
because he's basically a tyrant.
And the Peter Pan Story is very 

319
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,430
interesting because Peter Pan Pan sorta 
means everything.

320
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,910
And Peter Pan is the sort of person who 
wants to retain the dynamic potential of

321
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:24,734
childhood.
Because when you're a child you're not 

322
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,940
anything but you couldn't be anything.

323
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,030
So you're pretty much only potential.
And then you might say,

324
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:36,410
well why should you sacrifice that 
potential to become something actual?

325
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,140
Cause in some sense it's actually a 
limiting process.

326
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,070
So,
for example,

327
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:43,760
and I mean this in the most concrete 
possible way,

328
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,103
you have more neural connections when 
you're born than you do at any other 

329
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,930
time in life.
And most of those die by the time you're

330
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:52,764
too.
So you go through this tremendous 

331
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:57,780
pruning process from when you're born,
from when,

332
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,440
til two so it's like you're dying into 
your childhood personality.

333
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,453
And then again,
the same thing happens at the end of 

334
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,374
adolescence between say 16 and 21 which 
is also the peak time for risk for the 

335
00:18:09,781 --> 00:18:12,570
emergence of schizophrenia.
And some people think that's the pruning

336
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,490
process gone wrong.
But you know,

337
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,324
as an adolescent you also shed childhood
potential to become the limited but 

338
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:24,660
specialized in potentially useful thing 
that you will become.

339
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,980
And so you might say,
well,

340
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,590
is it worth it?
Is it worth shedding that potential?

341
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,470
And Peter Pan's answer to that is,
well no,

342
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,010
he wants to remain in Neverland as a 
magical boy forever.

343
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,130
And he's king of the lost boys,
which I would say is not a very,

344
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,960
it's not much of a dominance hierarchy,
right?

345
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
It's like you're,
you're the king,

346
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,240
King of the King of the losers,
so to speak.

347
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:49,320
People who can't get their act together 
and mature now.

348
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:51,930
And you notice in Peter Pan,
peter pan doesn't grow up.

349
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:56,280
He doesn't establish a relationship with
Wendy who's actually real.

350
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,230
He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you 
know is a ferry and they don't exist.

351
00:19:01,231 --> 00:19:02,064
And so she's really in some sense of 
figure of his imagination because he 

352
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:05,874
won't mature,
he can't have an actual relationship 

353
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:09,060
with,
with a genuine person.

354
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,050
So he has to satisfy himself with,
while it's something like a pornographic

355
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,100
fantasy actually.

356
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,350
So seriously it is,
it is like that.

357
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,460
I mean it's,
it's,

358
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,270
it's a toned down a lot in the movie 
version obviously,

359
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,770
but still,
that's what's underlying it.

360
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,633
Now you might say,
well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow 

361
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:26,094
up?
And answer is the only figure of 

362
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:29,580
authority that's around for him.
His P,

363
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,160
his captain hook and he doesn't like 
Captain Hook.

364
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:34,140
And that's because captain hook is a 
tyrant.

365
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:36,090
He's brutal,
you know,

366
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:36,924
and he's also a coward because he's,
he's lost a hand already to a crocodile 

367
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,440
with a clock in its stomach.
That's chaos and time,

368
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,653
you know,
that's the dragon that lives underneath 

369
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:46,884
everything.
It's like the basilisk can Harry Potter 

370
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,910
and now Damn Crocodile's already got a 
piece of him,

371
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,863
which is exactly the case.
Like that crocodile has got a piece of 

372
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:54,660
me,
you know,

373
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,350
I'm older than 50 and so time is already
God,

374
00:19:58,351 --> 00:19:59,550
its grip on me.

375
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,383
And you know part of the problem of 
being adult is that you also have to 

376
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,374
take the fact that your finite and 
limited into account and if you're 

377
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:09,930
terrified by that,
which people tend to be,

378
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:10,764
then it can easily turn you into a 
tyrant because you're afraid of 

379
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:14,094
everything or disgusted by everything 
and you have to ramp up the amount you 

380
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:17,154
control it.
And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook 

381
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:22,260
and he thinks there's no damn way.
That's what I want to end up as.

382
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,390
She's got a bad role model,
you know.

383
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,224
So Captain Hook and Stalin in this sort 
of devouring monster are good 

384
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:33,370
representations of the negative or 
tyrannical element of the great father.

385
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,030
So that's the tyrannical element of the 
dominance hierarchy.

386
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,540
So same thing here.
There's Stellan,

387
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,573
you know,
he's the great father of the family and 

388
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,150
these,
these kids are,

389
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,800
they're kind of like the Soviet 
equivalent of cub scouts.

390
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,800
They're sort of worshiping him.
And then I really liked the other one on

391
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:51,634
the right because I mean you could 
hardly find a more hellish 

392
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,670
representation of a tyrant than that,
right?

393
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,520
I mean it looks,
and this is quite interesting,

394
00:21:00,521 --> 00:21:04,090
it looks like Stellan is standing in 
front of a man.

395
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:07,450
Door lock is Amanda Mandela is a shape 
like this and allman shape.

396
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,310
You see that renaissance art all the 
time.

397
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,323
It's an extremely old symbol.
It's the oldest symbol that people have 

398
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,030
ever found evidence for.
And the thing is on fire,

399
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:19,060
it's like Stella there he is King of 
hell.

400
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,950
And it's exactly right.
You know,

401
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:21,481
it's,
it's,

402
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:25,660
it's eerie that that's the mode of 
representation that emerged for them,

403
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:27,370
but it's certainly accurate.

404
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,213
So you know,
the whole tyrannical end of the great 

405
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,373
fathers,
this is the sort of thing that results 

406
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:35,860
from it.
You know,

407
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,420
it's like the,
the

408
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,060
elevation of the person at the top of 
the dominance hierarchy to the status of

409
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:46,450
some kind of cause identity certainly 
happened in Hitler's case.

410
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,360
And then the brutal murderousness that 
can emerge from that.

411
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:50,194
Those are pictures from the 
concentration camps at the end of World 

412
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,250
War II.
So,

413
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,980
you know,
so I told you that the fee,

414
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,850
the feminine can be rep that terrible 
unknown things can be represented by the

415
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,770
feminine,
sort of a monstrous figure,

416
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:03,604
you know,
but it's certainly the case that the 

417
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:10,351
monstrosity of culture is roughly 
equivalent to the monstrosity of nature.

418
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,393
You know?
And one of the things you might think 

419
00:22:13,301 --> 00:22:17,440
about is that common etiologies tend to 
utilize these symbolic categories.

420
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:19,030
It's almost as if they appropriate them.

421
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,340
So the environmental movement,
for example,

422
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,100
basically says benevolent nature,
right?

423
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:26,710
So that's the positive feminine negative
culture.

424
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:27,544
Cause that's cultures out there.
Rapaciously destroying the pristine 

425
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:34,060
wilderness of Mother Nature and the 
negative individual too.

426
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,894
Because you know,
human beings are part of that as 

427
00:22:36,341 --> 00:22:40,900
individuals and we're kind of a cancer 
on the face of the planet if you know,

428
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,540
I mean that's a pretty dark way of 
looking at it obviously,

429
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,090
but it's one sided because you can 
easily say,

430
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:46,811
yeah,
well,

431
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:47,644
you know,
we're in a war with nature because 

432
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:51,940
obviously she's trying to kill us as 
fast as possible and we better have some

433
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:55,450
culture because otherwise we'd be 
sitting outside in the freezing snow and

434
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,970
you know,
you might be a rapacious consumer,

435
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:01,600
but on the other hand you're just trying
to survive and it's not that easy.

436
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:02,470
And so,
you know,

437
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:03,304
you need to have both of those stories 
together before you have a reasonable 

438
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:07,840
representation of the world.

439
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,210
It's not easy to cope with something 
like,

440
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,253
well like that.
It's not easy to cope with something 

441
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,434
like that in every institution has this 
potential and this element because 

442
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:20,074
institutions tend towards 
bureaucratization and tyranny as they 

443
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,750
develop,
they close up and become rigid.

444
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,651
And so,
you know,

445
00:23:26,651 --> 00:23:29,710
that's a rough thing to deal with.
And then of course this is a rough thing

446
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:31,270
to deal with too.
So you might think,

447
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:34,570
well you could have a little bit of 
sympathy for human beings,

448
00:23:34,571 --> 00:23:37,930
not just throw them in the horrible 
rapacious creature category,

449
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:38,764
which I think is an extraordinarily 
pathological and also a pre genocidal 

450
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:43,810
thing to do.
You know,

451
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:44,644
cause you hear environment to lists for 
example now and then say the planet 

452
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,360
would be better off without people on.
It's like,

453
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,373
well,
you know,

454
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,753
that's kind of what Hitler thought as 
well about certain kinds of people 

455
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:55,610
anyways.

456
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,500
And God only knows where he would have 
stopped.

457
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,140
So you know,
when someone says something like that,

458
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,213
one of the things you might think is you
should take a good look at your 

459
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:06,950
unconscious structure there.
Bucko because fundamentally you're,

460
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:07,784
you know,
there is a genocidal ideology at the 

461
00:24:10,671 --> 00:24:12,470
bottom of your thoughts structure.
And you know,

462
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,304
you might think that you're an 
environmentalist but you're actually 

463
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,794
possessed by a genocidal etiology and 
you better do something about that 

464
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,244
because if you ever get any power,
you're going to be one dangerous 

465
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:22,784
creature.
So one of the things that's really 

466
00:24:25,011 --> 00:24:25,844
interesting about psychoanalysis or one 
of the things I love about it is that 

467
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,013
psychoanalysts tell you,
if someone says I'm good or I stand for 

468
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,134
a good thing,
the first thing you want to look for is 

469
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:39,170
the opposite of that.
It's like,

470
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:40,910
okay,
that's what you say.

471
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,583
What might really be going on?
Or is it actually the case that you're 

472
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,120
Jesus Christ and all the saints 
combined?

473
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:47,954
You know,
you're this perfect person or there are 

474
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:54,391
other dark motives for what you're doing
that you claim to be doing for the good.

475
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,330
So guy named George Orwell,
who was one of the world's most creative

476
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,540
essayists in,
in,

477
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,930
in in the 20th century.
He was a,

478
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:03,764
he was a left winger.
He wrote some things that were very 

479
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:08,040
criticism,
critical of socialist movements and what

480
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:08,874
did,
it was one of the early critics of 

481
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,453
Soviet Russia when it was sort of in 
vogue among intellectuals to be 

482
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,814
supportive of the Soviets.
One of the things he said about left 

483
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,800
wing socialist was that they didn't 
really like the poor.

484
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,110
He was talking about middleclass left 
wing socialist,

485
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:26,990
not the working class guys who were in 
the unions and you know,

486
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:27,824
had some justification for their 
struggle against those who are at the 

487
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:32,090
top of the power higher.

488
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,953
He was more looking at people that were 
already at the top of the power 

489
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,550
hierarchy,
who are claiming to be advocates for the

490
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:38,960
working class.
You know,

491
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:42,290
and his claim fundamentally was that 
those people didn't like the poor.

492
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,330
They just hated the rich.
And you know,

493
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:45,164
that's the,
it was difficult for the publisher who 

494
00:25:48,441 --> 00:25:50,750
was publishing that book,
which was called,

495
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,860
um,
road to Wigan pier,

496
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:55,694
which is an amazing book.
It's a book about coal miners in 

497
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,240
northern,
in northern Britain,

498
00:25:59,241 --> 00:26:00,260
and it's,
it's brutal.

499
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:01,820
Those people at brutal lives,
man.

500
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,860
So,
but anyways,

501
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,180
uh,
you know,

502
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,430
the publisher,
which was the left book club,

503
00:26:07,431 --> 00:26:08,264
if I remember correctly,
was very low to publish the essay that 

504
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:11,894
went along with that book because it was
such a devastating criticism of sort of 

505
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:17,510
middleclass socialism anyways.
Anyways,

506
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,610
so the psychoanalysts are always telling
you,

507
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,900
look,
you know,

508
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,180
there you are,
there's no monster.

509
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,141
It's like,
okay,

510
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:26,060
where's the monster?
Because it's somewhere,

511
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,060
it's somewhere because there's a monster
in everyone.

512
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:32,180
And if you're hiding it or covering it 
up or pretending that you know,

513
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,014
you only stand for the good.
It's like all that means is that you're 

514
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:37,640
ignorant and naive about your own 
possibility.

515
00:26:37,641 --> 00:26:39,290
There's a monster around there 
somewhere.

516
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,110
So
yeah.

517
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,260
And that's partly because,
you know,

518
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:44,094
if you're not a monster,
it's pretty hard to stay alive because 

519
00:26:46,681 --> 00:26:48,750
you know you have to contend with things
like this.

520
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,103
Yeah,

521
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,093
sorry.
Things like this and things like this 

522
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,420
and things like this and things like 
this,

523
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:57,560
you know,
that's your life.

524
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,394
You contend with that nature is brutal,
culture is brutal and other people can 

525
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:02,954
be brutal too.
And so if you're not prepared for that 

526
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:05,834
and able to withstand it,
then you're just going to get rolled 

527
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:08,324
over.
So you better get the old inner monster 

528
00:27:10,551 --> 00:27:13,190
developed because that under conscious 
control,

529
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:15,170
because even though it's a terrible 
thing,

530
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:17,600
you need it.
So the Taoists for example,

531
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:18,434
they represent the world
and terms that are quite similar to 

532
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:24,800
those that I just described for you.
So the,

533
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,500
the doubt central Dow assemble is this 
one,

534
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,080
the Yin Yang symbol and Yang.

535
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,060
Okay.

536
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,430
Basically stands for order.
That's what it means,

537
00:27:33,431 --> 00:27:35,620
but it means all the things that I've 
listed there.

538
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,250
It means order masculinity,
the daytime,

539
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,093
the known,
it also means authoritarianism and 

540
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:41,554
fascism.
And then yen on the opposite side is 

541
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:45,280
chaos.
Femininity,

542
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:46,480
the night,
the unknown,

543
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:49,300
decadence denialism.
And it's also a relationship between the

544
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:53,080
conscious and unconscious.
The current consciousness is represented

545
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:55,270
by light.
And the reason for that is,

546
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,970
well,
when are you conscious?

547
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,170
Your conscious during the day,
right?

548
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:01,420
Because we're,
we're,

549
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:04,300
we're creatures that live in the day,
unlike rats,

550
00:28:04,301 --> 00:28:05,200
for example,
you know,

551
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:08,140
they live at night.
So for us,

552
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,003
consciousness is associated with 
enlightenment and illumination and 

553
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,490
daytime and sunrise and the,
and the bright noon sky.

554
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:17,860
And the unconscious is associated with 
the nighttime.

555
00:28:17,861 --> 00:28:18,694
And the reason for that partly too,
is that your unconscious is actually a 

556
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:22,870
lot more active at night.
First of all,

557
00:28:22,871 --> 00:28:23,950
that's when you dream.

558
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,353
And it's also the time when,
if you're a frightened of something or 

559
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:28,474
if you're depressed and ruminative the 
frightening thoughts and the depressing 

560
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:33,520
and ruminative thoughts are going to 
come up.

561
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,563
So many,
many people have the experience of 

562
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,130
waking up in a kind of,
cause.

563
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:40,210
I cold sweat at three in the morning and
having,

564
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,213
you know,
nothing but it continual stream of 

565
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:43,234
worries run through their head.
And there's pretty good evidence that a 

566
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:48,070
lot of what you're doing at night when 
you sleep,

567
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,910
when you're dreaming and when you're not
dreaming is actually processing threat,

568
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,040
you know?
But most of the time you were asleep for

569
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,960
that.
Sometimes you wake up during it and it's

570
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:56,794
like,
yeah,

571
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,930
it's not something you really want to be
conscious about.

572
00:28:58,931 --> 00:28:59,770
You know,
it's,

573
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,660
it's hard on you.
And it's very,

574
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:03,520
very common among people who are 
depressed,

575
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,503
you know?

576
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,850
So if you want to diagnose someone for 
depression,

577
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:08,590
one of the things you ask them is,
well,

578
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:10,750
is your sleep chopped up?
You know,

579
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,810
do you wake up multiple times at night 
and when you wake up,

580
00:29:13,811 --> 00:29:15,460
what happens if they say,
well you know,

581
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:17,890
I have worries running through my head 
and I can't stop them.

582
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,950
That's rumination cause it's an 
automatic process.

583
00:29:20,951 --> 00:29:21,784
It's an unconscious process.
Then you know that the balance between 

584
00:29:24,191 --> 00:29:27,760
positive and negative emotion has 
shifted too far for that person.

585
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:31,930
There's so much chaos and pain in their 
life or their,

586
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,883
their emotional systems have become 
dysregulated that it starting to pop up 

587
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:37,354
into consciousness and dominated.
So now the end Yang symbol is 

588
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,850
interesting for a variety of other 
reasons too because um,

589
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,273
the Dow was believed that that symbol 
represents being now being is not the 

590
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:50,554
same thing as objective reality being is
what you experience as a conscious 

591
00:29:54,671 --> 00:29:57,970
creature that's being and for the Dow is
being,

592
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:01,000
is made up of these two elements,
order in chaos.

593
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,220
And the reason for that,
it's quite straight forward.

594
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,054
The reason for that is wherever you go 
and whenever you live and whoever you 

595
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,344
are,
each environment that you're in is 

596
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:14,710
composed of things you understand and 
things that work the way you expect them

597
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,160
to and things you do not understand.
And that can be,

598
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,530
that can pull the rug out from you at 
any moment.

599
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:21,603
And so you can say in some sense that 
these symbolic representations are 

600
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:28,830
representations of the most unchanging 
elements of [inaudible].

601
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,620
So the most real things,
because you know,

602
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,670
a typical modern person look at this and
think,

603
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:36,100
well those aren't real.
It's like they are real.

604
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:36,963
In fact they're hyper real.
Because one of the things that defines 

605
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,910
real is that it's permanent and it is 
permanent.

606
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:45,010
No matter where you go.
There are things you know and things you

607
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,840
don't know.
And it doesn't matter who you are,

608
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:47,674
it's permanent.

609
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,580
So it's part of the existential 
landscape of human being.

610
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,923
Now the other thing that's,
there's two other things that are quite 

611
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:57,520
cool about the and Yang symbol in one is
that the,

612
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,490
each of the black pays,
he has little white dots in it.

613
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,260
And White Paisley has a little black.in 
it.

614
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,333
And the reason for that is the Dow is 
also recognized quite well that chaos 

615
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:08,800
could turn to order at any moment.
You know,

616
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:12,200
so a new order can arise out of a 
chaotic structure that's like a,

617
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,910
that's a revolution in some sense.
But by the same token,

618
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,370
if you're in a place that's orderly and 
predictable,

619
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:21,790
something can happen that casts you into
a chaotic situation right away.

620
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,060
So there's a dynamic,
even though these two things oppose each

621
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:26,020
other,
in some sense,

622
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,840
there's a continual dynamic interplay 
between them.

623
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,140
And then the final thing that's quite 
interesting about this symbol,

624
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,153
this is mindbogglingly brilliant idea,
is that because the dao also means the 

625
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:40,870
way and the way is the line between the 
two.

626
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,980
And so what that indicates is,
this is a brilliant idea,

627
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:49,981
is that the optimal position for a human
being isn't in chaos or in order.

628
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:52,324
Because if it's too much order,
then it's totalitarian and if it's too 

629
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:59,230
much chaos than it's disgust and fear 
and emotional pain and depression.

630
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,453
So where's the proper place and the 
dallas dancers right on the line where 

631
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:05,824
you have one foot in order so that 
you're fairly stable and you have 

632
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,154
another foot in chaos.
So that new and interesting and 

633
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:13,900
compelling and transforming things are 
happening to you.

634
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,063
And one of the things that you might 
note is that your nervous system 

635
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:19,504
basically tells you when you're there 
and the way it tells you is by making 

636
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:25,780
you interested in whatever it is that 
you're engaged in.

637
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:29,920
Because the fact that the thing that 
you're engaged in grips you,

638
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,910
which is really an unconscious process,
you can't really control that.

639
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,490
It's something that happens to you is 
because your nervous system,

640
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,324
which is actually adapted to the 
environment of chaos and order is 

641
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,580
telling you that if you're engaged and 
interested,

642
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:47,580
you are at in the place where the 
balance between chaos and order is,

643
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,940
is perfect.
Now you think about that,

644
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,620
it's no use reading a paper that you 
cannot understand at all.

645
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:57,440
Even though hypothetically,
that would be a tremendously informative

646
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:58,580
paper,
right?

647
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,580
But you can't understand it because it's
all chaos to you.

648
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,030
And then there's absolutely no reason 
reading a paper,

649
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,043
that tense time.
If you've already extracted the 

650
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:10,280
information out of it,
it's going to be boring.

651
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,840
Okay,
so what do you want?

652
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,123
Well,
you want a paper that you can almost 

653
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,920
understand.
So there's,

654
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,551
you know,
you're,

655
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:17,384
you're the frameworks,
the cognitive frameworks that you have 

656
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,144
at hand are sufficient for you to take 
the next step into the unknown and the 

657
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:26,600
paper will,
will inform you of that.

658
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:28,820
And so those are the sorts of things.
Books do that.

659
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:32,660
Movies do that conversations do that 
even lines of thought do that.

660
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,340
If they're exactly at the right level of
complexity for you,

661
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,700
they're going to engage you.
And people know this man.

662
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,710
They know it.
So here's an example.

663
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,210
Let's say you're trying to,
you know,

664
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,180
we could say you're trying to teach your
child to talk,

665
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:52,820
which of course you don't do what you do
to a child,

666
00:33:52,821 --> 00:33:53,654
just talk to it.
But it's very interesting because there 

667
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:56,414
have been studies of how parents talk to
children and what they do is always use 

668
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,220
language that slightly more complex than
the child can understand.

669
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,220
And they do it automatically.
It's part of our,

670
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,960
what a,
in some sense,

671
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:11,240
our innate knowledge structure about 
language.

672
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,690
So you don't only use words that the 
child understands,

673
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,793
use words that they understand plus a 
few words and phrases and sentence 

674
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:19,214
constructions that they don't.
And so that's sort of pulling them 

675
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:22,214
along.
And a Russian psychologist named the 

676
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,773
Gonski called that the zone of proximal 
development and the zone of proximal 

677
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:29,384
development is that place.
Cause it's a place in the environment 

678
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:35,960
where information flow into the psyche 
is maximized.

679
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,060
And that has to be.
So it has to be,

680
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,340
cause I comprehensible,
you know,

681
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:42,080
it's something I tried to do in my 
lectures.

682
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:42,914
You know,
I tried to tell you things that you 

683
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:44,984
know,
and associate them with things that you 

684
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:49,490
don't know,
so that you're not swamped,

685
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:52,490
hopefully by an excess of 
incomprehensible information,

686
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,050
but you don't think,
Oh God,

687
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,790
he's saying that again.
I already know that,

688
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:56,611
you know,
et Cetera,

689
00:34:56,611 --> 00:35:00,410
et Cetera,
and anything that's dramatic instructure

690
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,970
is doing that for you.
It's keeping them,

691
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
it's keeping you on the edge of 
attention.

692
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,443
And that place is where your adaptation 
is maximized because not only are you 

693
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,130
firming up the structure that's 
underneath your feet,

694
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:13,964
you're relying on it and you know it's,
it's part of the platform on which you 

695
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:17,384
stand,
but you're absorbing information at a 

696
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:19,754
rate that allows you to increase the 
solidity and area of that solid ground 

697
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,990
without undermining you so much that it 
falls apart beneath you.

698
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,423
So it's lovely.
It's such a good idea because think 

699
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:34,754
about what it would mean if it was true.
It would mean that if you pay attention 

700
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,520
to what captures your interest and you 
follow that,

701
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,160
that means you're going to always be 
interested in what you're doing.

702
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:44,994
But even better than that,
it's going to mean that you're going to 

703
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:51,621
maximize your adaptive capacity as much 
as possible at exactly the same time,

704
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,123
man,
that'd be a great deal if it actually 

705
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:54,864
happened to be true.
Now it's a bit complicated because what 

706
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:02,910
culture wants from you and what is 
intrinsically interesting to you,

707
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,830
there's going to be a conflict there,
right?

708
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,910
Because culture wants you to do what a 
good cultural entities should do,

709
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:12,450
which is to do what you're told to do,
but you're not,

710
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,770
you know,
you're not a robot.

711
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,693
And so part of the existential problem 
that you have in life is trying to 

712
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:18,354
figure out some compromise between what 
you find personally engaging and that 

713
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:27,840
develops and supports you and what the 
culture will provide,

714
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,200
uh,
resources to you for pursuing.

715
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,900
And it's hard.
There's no simple answer to it.

716
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:39,260
But I would say that if you sacrifice 
your,

717
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,553
your capacity to engage in meaningful 
activity to the security of a given 

718
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:48,030
position in a dominance hierarchy,
then you turn into something that's like

719
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,380
a soul,
a slave.

720
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,483
And that's a really bad idea because 
there's no way you can do that for any 

721
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:56,130
length of time without getting bored and
resentful.

722
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,263
And once your board and resentful,
the move from that to dangerous is a 

723
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:02,280
very,
very small step.

724
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,623
So it's hard and it isn't even 
necessarily the case that you're going 

725
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:07,014
to make the balance.
You know you're going to be able to 

726
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:10,380
manage it,
but if you don't,

727
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:12,390
you're going to pay a massive price for 
it.

728
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,340
So I would say,
you know,

729
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,263
let,
don't let people mess around with what 

730
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:20,310
you find compelling any more than is 
absolutely necessary.

731
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,593
You know,
so because it's very dangerous to do 

732
00:37:24,121 --> 00:37:25,620
that,
it's very dangerous to do that.

733
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,633
Just like it's dangerous not to find a 
position in the dominance hierarchy at 

734
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,220
all because then you end up in a chaotic
place.

735
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:35,130
And my experiences being you,
you might wonder about this,

736
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:39,240
it's like what's the probability that 
someone can live a healthy life,

737
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,650
healthy,
productive,

738
00:37:40,651 --> 00:37:43,620
and stable life outside a dominance 
hierarchy.

739
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:47,700
So without external structure.
And the answer to that is there might be

740
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,980
one person in this class that could do 
that.

741
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,510
It's really hard because what happens to
most people is that if they don't have a

742
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:57,720
substantial amount of external structure
and routine,

743
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,720
they just fall apart.
They don't sleep properly,

744
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,580
they don't eat properly,
you know,

745
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,414
they're depressed.
It's tremendously effortful to 

746
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,250
continually reinvent yourself day after 
day.

747
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,450
And so there's some real,
there's some real utility in routine and

748
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,290
social identity,
you know,

749
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,124
and young would say the part of you that
has adapted to re routine and social 

750
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:19,824
identity is the persona and sort of the 
mask you wear in public and might even 

751
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,990
be who you think you are.

752
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,690
And he thought that people who were only
persona,

753
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,793
we're dangerous because they were only 
thoughtless advocates of the system for 

754
00:38:32,521 --> 00:38:35,800
which they stood.
But he also believed that people who had

755
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:36,634
no persona,
we're in an equally terrible situation 

756
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:39,814
because they're psychologically chaotic 
and they don't have a social structure 

757
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,404
around them to hem them in and 
continually remind them how to be sane 

758
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:50,530
and productive.
So it's a matter of balance.

759
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:51,430
You know,
there's,

760
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,660
there's horrors on both sides and 
there's advantages on both sides.

761
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:56,494
And the trick is to place yourself in a 
location where you're deriving maximum 

762
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,144
advantage from both.
And you'll be able to tell if you do 

763
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,480
that.
Because if you are doing that,

764
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,140
you're going to find your life engaging 
and meaningful enough.

765
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:09,123
So the fact that it's also tragic and 
potentially composed at least partially 

766
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:15,520
of slavery is going to be acceptable.

767
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,370
And that's what,
that's the goal in some sense.

768
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:20,410
It's a hard to do that,
but you know,

769
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,620
it's hard not to do it too.
So you're screwed either way.

770
00:39:23,621 --> 00:39:26,860
So you might as well pick the path 
that's going to be of maximum utility to

771
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,150
you,
you know,

772
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,720
so and hopefully to everyone else.
Okay,

773
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:35,710
so this is the individual instead.
So we have explored territory,

774
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,360
unexplored territory or the known and 
the unknown or order and chaos.

775
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:43,690
And then we have the thing that mediates
between them.

776
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,480
And that's the individual.
And this is no medieval representation,

777
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:48,400
which I really love.
You know,

778
00:39:48,401 --> 00:39:49,234
there's the dome of the sky there.
It's a very archaic idea that the earth 

779
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:55,510
is a dome because it kind of looks like 
that if you go out into a flat field,

780
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:56,740
you know,
if you're out in the ocean,

781
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:00,310
the way the world looks like a dome on a
disk.

782
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,230
And so that's sort of the representation
here.

783
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,064
It's a very ancient idea.
And this guy at the bottom left of the 

784
00:40:06,701 --> 00:40:07,534
picture is poking his head through the 
comprehensible world and looking at the 

785
00:40:11,471 --> 00:40:14,800
chaos beyond.
And so he's a heroic figure.

786
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,880
So the knower is,
the individual is always the hero of his

787
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:19,631
story,
right?

788
00:40:19,631 --> 00:40:22,360
The protagonist of historic.
Now it can be an antihero too,

789
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:27,100
because just like the known has a 
negative element and a pause development

790
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:29,710
and the unknown has a negative element 
and a positive element.

791
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,040
The individual has a negative element 
and a positive element.

792
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,410
And so there's the hero and the 
adversary,

793
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:36,910
roughly speaking.
And you know,

794
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:41,230
there's all sorts of movies where the 
protagonist is an anti hero,

795
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,093
you know?
And those movies are usually there to 

796
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,284
show you bad examples in some sense.
Or you get mixed characters like Batman 

797
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,200
and he's tangled up with the joker.

798
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,740
And as the joker points out in that 
brilliant performance,

799
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,770
they're mirror images of one another.
And so

800
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,110
the jokers and adversary,
it's,

801
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,990
it's,
it's more complicated than that.

802
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:02,824
But so some of the symbols that commonly
represent the individual in symbolic 

803
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:07,894
representations are while,
and also conceptual representations are 

804
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:11,704
ego consciousness.
The trickster bugs bunny is a good 

805
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,500
example of a trickster,
the fool,

806
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,843
the hero,
the coward spirit as opposed to matter 

807
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:23,590
or as opposed to dogma,
the son,

808
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:27,280
the son of the unknown,
and the son of the king.

809
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,170
So,
and those are very,

810
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:30,004
very common fingers.
And I'll walk you through some of that 

811
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:33,530
as we progress today.
So,

812
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,390
and then there's the figure of the 
adversary.

813
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:38,480
So you see on the right hand,
left hand side there,

814
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:42,230
you see Horus,
who's the bird headed god of Egypt,

815
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:43,064
who I told you about,
who represents the capacity to pay 

816
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:45,554
attention.

817
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:49,250
Very important concept because the 
Egyptians realized,

818
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,084
and really it's brilliant.
It is something modern people do not 

819
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:56,160
understand because we tend to make 
rationality the highest God that's,

820
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,420
that's not a good thing.
That's a pathway to totalitarianism.

821
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,493
What the Egyptians knew,
but they only knew it in symbolic form 

822
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,243
was it was the capacity to attend to 
things that in some sense was the 

823
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:08,444
highest psychological function because 
it's the capacity to pay attention that 

824
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:13,850
actually moves you beyond what you only 
know.

825
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,550
And rationality tends to make,
you know,

826
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:17,384
integral systems that are coherent,
that are boxlike and then claim that 

827
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:21,824
they're absolutely right.
Whereas the tension has always looking 

828
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,464
beyond what you know and,
and attention is an unbelievably 

829
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:29,830
powerful force.
You know,

830
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:33,710
that's why advertisers pay for it.
That's why people demand it.

831
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,600
That's why children can't live without 
it.

832
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,240
That's why it's what you want from your 
friends and your family.

833
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,590
You want them to pay attention to you.
It's an unbelievably valuable resource.

834
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,440
And so one of the things I always tell 
my clients,

835
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,210
for example,
if they're socially anxious,

836
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:48,044
I say,
look,

837
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,950
pay more attention to the person you're 
talking to.

838
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,203
If you pay,
if you really pay close attention to 

839
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:55,874
them,
then the thoughts that are making you 

840
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:57,794
anxious will be suppressed.
And because you're paying close 

841
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:00,674
attention to them,
you'll match your movements to theirs 

842
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,090
and you'll match your conversation to 
them.

843
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,180
And then there's no reason for you to be
socially anxious cause socially anxious.

844
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,890
People will go like this when they're 
talking,

845
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,290
you know,
they don't want to look at you.

846
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,433
Of course,
how the hell can you engage anyone if 

847
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,640
you're not in a little dance with them?
You know,

848
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,710
you can't.
And a lot of it's nonverbal,

849
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:22,400
it's physical and it's embodied and 
without paying attention,

850
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,990
then you lose people.

851
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,120
And you see this with speakers all the 
time too.

852
00:43:26,121 --> 00:43:26,954
There in front of audiences,
they have their paper and they're going 

853
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:29,774
like this.
And usually they're talking like this 

854
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,420
too.
And you know,

855
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:34,580
the logical thing to do in that case,
it's like,

856
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:37,970
look at facebook or get the hell out of 
there or something.

857
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,700
But they're not paying attention to the 
audience.

858
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,713
And so there's no power in the,
there's no power in the dynamic 

859
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:47,570
conversation at all.
So anyway,

860
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:50,720
so there's horace and then there's uh,
the guy on the,

861
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,123
on the right there is set and he's like 
the precursor of the Christian 

862
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:57,140
representation of Satan.
In fact,

863
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:57,974
the namesake and seems to have been a 
transformation of the name set and set 

864
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:02,954
is actually,
he's like the God of totalitarian 

865
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:10,040
possibility because in Egyptian 
mythology he represents the brother,

866
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:10,933
the evil brother of the rightful king 
who's always plotting to overthrow the 

867
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:15,224
rightful king.

868
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,380
And Horace is his natural enemy.
And what this means,

869
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,210
our Italian man,
it's really important.

870
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,313
So I have in my clinical practice 
frequently people who are stuck in the 

871
00:44:24,081 --> 00:44:26,360
middle of absolutely moronic 
bureaucracy.

872
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:29,150
So I can give you an example of this.
I just love this.

873
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:32,070
One of my clients who worked for large 
corporation,

874
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,820
who's pretty sensible woman,
she is being driven mad by the political

875
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:37,930
correctness that didn't detected the 
organization.

876
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:38,764
And she sent me a 30 to 32 email letter 
exchanges that were circulating around 

877
00:44:46,471 --> 00:44:47,304
the word flip chart.
I don't know if any of you have heard 

878
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:51,700
the flip chart conver controversy,
but it's Kurt pretty mind.

879
00:44:51,701 --> 00:44:56,490
Bogglingly moronic and,
and so the deal was that somebody,

880
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,780
you know what a flip chart is,
right?

881
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,020
It's one of those paper pads that you 
flip the paper over.

882
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,790
Well it turns out hypothetically that 
flip is a pejorative term for Filipinos.

883
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,923
And so they believe that the idea,
the flip chart phrase was no longer 

884
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,180
acceptable because it was potentially 
offensive to Filipinos,

885
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,023
although I bet they would have had to 
like vacuum up the whole planet to find 

886
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:21,750
one Filipino who actually cared whether 
or not someone called that a flip chart,

887
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:23,940
you know?
And that person would have had plenty of

888
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:26,190
problems that were worse than that.
Anyway,

889
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:27,024
there was like a 32 serious email 
exchanges about what terminology should 

890
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:34,080
be used instead of flip chart,
you know.

891
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:34,923
So that's what people were doing.
Instead of trying to actually have a 

892
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:40,470
life and do something useful.
And it was driving her completely mad.

893
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,110
They did rename them and made it,
um,

894
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,013
it made part of corporate policy that it
was inappropriate to use the word flip 

895
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:48,924
chart.
I don't remember what the hell they 

896
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:51,210
called them.
Who knows.

897
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,553
But,
but the reason I'm telling you this 

898
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,254
story is Lada you are going to find 
yourself in bedded in bureaucracies and 

899
00:45:59,071 --> 00:45:59,904
you know,
and there's that for better or for 

900
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:00,780
worse.

901
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,660
And one of the things that are going to,
is going to happen to you is that people

902
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:04,494
are going to ask you to do stupid and 
ridiculous things and the fact that 

903
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,920
they're asking you to do stupid and 
ridiculous things,

904
00:46:10,921 --> 00:46:12,960
it's going to do two things,
three things to you.

905
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:13,943
One is it a warp you so that you'll 
pretend that you agree with it and then 

906
00:46:16,921 --> 00:46:20,580
eventually you will and like good so 
much for your soul.

907
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,653
And then the other thing is,
is that it will demotivate you because 

908
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:24,924
you'll think,
why should I be s like slaving away at 

909
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:31,980
this job when you know I'm being pecked 
to death by morons with stupid rules.

910
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:33,680
And,
um,

911
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,380
the third thing that it will do is make 
you resentful and irritated,

912
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,340
and then that will also undermine your 
motivation and make your life miserable.

913
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,480
And so you might think,
well,

914
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,460
what should you do about that?

915
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,413
And the answer to that is you should 
object at the earliest possible point 

916
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,620
because first of all,
you'll find that if you do,

917
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,580
if you object to radical stupidity when 
it first emerges,

918
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,593
you kind of make people aware of the 
fact that what they're doing is 

919
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:02,250
radically stupid and they'll usually 
back off.

920
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,680
And so then they won't torture you to 
death.

921
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,000
So,
you know,

922
00:47:06,001 --> 00:47:07,590
you have to take a risk,
which is,

923
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,690
oh no,
what happens if I complain about this?

924
00:47:09,691 --> 00:47:10,524
But you know,
it's another one of those situations 

925
00:47:12,151 --> 00:47:14,490
where you're damned if you do and you're
damned if you don't.

926
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:16,950
So if you complain,
that'll cause some trouble.

927
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,933
Although usually it causes way less 
trouble than you'd think because people 

928
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:21,624
are generally not very courageous.
And if you push them with some strength 

929
00:47:24,961 --> 00:47:27,450
on when they're doing something,
absolutely moronic,

930
00:47:27,451 --> 00:47:30,100
they'll usually back off because they 
don't know what to do when they're being

931
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:30,934
challenged.

932
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,640
And then you won't have to put up with 
it for the rest of your life.

933
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,200
And so why I'm telling you this is 
because all sorts of bureaucratic

934
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,920
entities,
corporations,

935
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,080
government institutions,
um,

936
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,670
nonprofit organizations,
anything that's above a certain size,

937
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:50,560
cause it doesn't matter if it's 
government or corporate,

938
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:52,960
it's all the same bloody foolishness.
When it gets too big.

939
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,890
It's like those things,
10 towards totalitarian structures.

940
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,020
It's part of,
it's part of their,

941
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:02,140
the innate danger that's associated with
social organization.

942
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:05,740
And so then you might say,
well how do you keep the enterprise that

943
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:06,574
you're part of alive and dynamic and 
also keep it a place that a sensible 

944
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:11,734
person who's got,
who's got a proper orientation could 

945
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:17,770
stand to work.
And the answer is do not do things.

946
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,120
You know,
to be stupid.

947
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,920
Stand up and say,
look,

948
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:22,210
that's dumb.
I'm not doing it.

949
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,040
And if they ask you why,
then you can say,

950
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:25,840
well a,
I think it's stupid.

951
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,980
B,
if I do it,

952
00:48:26,981 --> 00:48:28,810
I'm going to get irritated and 
resentful.

953
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,793
And also if I do it,
it's going to decrease my motivation so 

954
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:34,540
I'm not doing it.
And then if they push you too hard,

955
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:35,590
it's like,
hey,

956
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,483
it's time for a different job and that 
might be the best thing that ever 

957
00:48:39,431 --> 00:48:42,760
happened to you because if the,
the structure you're in is going in that

958
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:43,594
direction and you can't stop it,
it's like get the hell out of there and 

959
00:48:46,451 --> 00:48:49,900
find something else.
So it's not that hard to find a job when

960
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:50,734
you already have a job.
That's another thing to keep in mind 

961
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:53,950
too.
You know,

962
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:55,900
when ever you're working and you will 
be,

963
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,453
especially in the world that the world 
of today where jobs are relatively 

964
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:01,234
uncertain is you should always have an 
escape route plant and it should be 

965
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:09,520
active because if you don't have an 
escape route and you can't get away,

966
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:10,960
you can't say no.

967
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:13,750
And if you can't say no,
you can't bargain.

968
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,300
And if you can't bargain,
you're a slave.

969
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,790
So those,
that's how it,

970
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,653
that's how the world is set out at the 
moment is probably always been like 

971
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:23,044
that.
But it's something that you really need 

972
00:49:23,831 --> 00:49:25,990
to know cause you got to watch if 
you're,

973
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:31,150
if you're being is objecting to someone 
to something that someone is forcing you

974
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:33,670
to do,
maybe you're right,

975
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,193
maybe you shouldn't be doing it.
And lots of people end up living 

976
00:49:37,571 --> 00:49:38,404
meaningless lives and that that's a,
that's not a very good term because 

977
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:46,030
there's no such thing as a meaningless 
life because one of the meanings of life

978
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:49,780
is suffering and there's no bloody way 
you're going to escape that.

979
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,614
So you will not have a meaningless life.
You'll have a life that's only 

980
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:57,440
suffering.
And I wouldn't recommend that because it

981
00:49:57,441 --> 00:49:58,274
will make you one miserable creature and
plus you'll warp everyone around you 

982
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:02,050
because you'll be vengeful.

983
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,480
So it,
these things are really important.

984
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:07,210
They're really important.
So all right,

985
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:08,044
so the individual as like culture and 
like nature also has its negative 

986
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:13,570
element.
You would call that the shadow.

987
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:14,823
You know,
and we're going to,

988
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:15,783
we're going to discuss the shadow in 
some detail because one of the things 

989
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:19,264
that you believed and he kind of got 
this idea from nature was that when you 

990
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:26,710
grow up and maybe as a consequence of 
your temperament,

991
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:30,050
you tend to think that some of your 
attributes are good and some of them are

992
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:30,980
negative,
you know,

993
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,740
so you make moral judgements about them.
And Fair enough.

994
00:50:33,741 --> 00:50:36,950
So you know,
you might think for the psychoanalysts,

995
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:41,951
the two elements of human being that 
we're commonly regarded as negative from

996
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:43,754
a moral perspective where sexuality and 
aggression and but humans of notion is 

997
00:50:48,411 --> 00:50:49,131
that,
well,

998
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:49,964
you know,
you might be someone who's modest and 

999
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,990
careful and never causes any conflict.

1000
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,630
And then we might say,
well you're a well socialized person,

1001
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:58,310
but humans point would be,
yeah,

1002
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,830
but you've got no power,
you've got no power.

1003
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,260
And so people are just going to roll 
right over you.

1004
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:04,303
So you'd better dive into that morass of
sexuality and aggression and pull out 

1005
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:08,774
those powers and integrate them into 
your psyche so that you can use them 

1006
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:14,690
consciously.
Because without that you're harmless.

1007
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:15,883
But you know,
I don't think that's a very good 

1008
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:18,200
ambition.
You know,

1009
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,850
what do you want to be when you're 30 
well,

1010
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:21,380
I want to be harmless.
It's like,

1011
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,990
you know,
really that's what you want to be.

1012
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,570
It's like you might as well not even be 
if that's your goal.

1013
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,370
So,
so,

1014
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,233
you know,
this dichotomy between the positive 

1015
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:32,420
individual and the negative individuals,
very,

1016
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:33,254
very complex because what's positive and
what's negative is not obvious from the 

1017
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:37,100
beginning.

1018
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:37,933
And arbitrary judgments don't help.
It's very difficult for a given 

1019
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,910
individual to look at themselves and 
say,

1020
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,013
well,
what is it about me that's actually 

1021
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,860
worth developing?
And I can tie this into some degree into

1022
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,713
big five theory.
So one of the big five characteristics 

1023
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:58,310
is
agreeableness safe.

1024
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,160
And people tend to think of 
agreeableness has a virtue,

1025
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:01,994
which is a complete,
it's completely idiotic to think that 

1026
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:08,540
because every virtue has its vice.
But agreeable people are sympathetic and

1027
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:11,810
empathetic and compassionate and polite.
And those all sound like good things.

1028
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,900
But they're also part of being an 
[inaudible] parent by the way.

1029
00:52:14,901 --> 00:52:16,190
But,
but anyways,

1030
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:17,024
the problem with being agreeable is that
people take advantage of you and then 

1031
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:20,744
you get resentful.
So I'm sure there's a whole pile of you 

1032
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,130
in here that are agreeable and 
resentful.

1033
00:52:25,131 --> 00:52:26,900
You know,
I'm sure you know who you are.

1034
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:27,973
And one of the things I would mention,
and you should think about this cause 

1035
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:33,620
it'll help you a lot if you do it,
is that resentment is your best friend.

1036
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,270
If something makes you resentful,
do not do it.

1037
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,880
So,
or there's a more sophisticated rule,

1038
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,100
which is if something makes you 
resentful,

1039
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:43,934
there's only two possibilities.
One is that you're sniffling and 

1040
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:47,414
immature and you won't adopt your 
responsibilities and you're whining 

1041
00:52:49,551 --> 00:52:50,384
about it.
The other is that you're being pushed 

1042
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:54,440
around and people are attempting to 
enslave you.

1043
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:58,280
So you want to eliminate the first 
possibility,

1044
00:52:58,281 --> 00:52:59,120
right?
You've got to think,

1045
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:00,980
well,
it might just be an immature and whining

1046
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:01,814
about this.
Is it something that people are 

1047
00:53:03,561 --> 00:53:04,394
reasonably demanding of me?
And if you think that through and maybe 

1048
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:08,840
you talked to some people about it and 
you think,

1049
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:09,171
no,
no,

1050
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:12,980
this isn't reasonable,
then the resentment is telling you act,

1051
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:16,010
act cause otherwise that's what you'll 
be.

1052
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:16,843
You'll end up 15 years,
especially if you're married or 

1053
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:23,330
something like that with 8,000 things 
you're resentful about and then you know

1054
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:26,130
you'll be in some kind of painful 
divorce that lasts for 10 years.

1055
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:26,964
So better to nip it in the bud.
If someone is after you to do something 

1056
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:31,703
and you don't feel like you're getting 
proper regard or proper response or you 

1057
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:35,544
don't think it's fair,
it's like have some courage and get 

1058
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:43,290
ahold of your anger and use it.
Doesn't mean you're right,

1059
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,453
but at least it means you can push the 
person hard enough so they have to 

1060
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:49,650
engage in a dialogue with you and you 
know this is,

1061
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:52,620
these are necessary skills.
Like if you cannot do this,

1062
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,840
you have to be able to say no to 
negotiate.

1063
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:55,943
You have to be able to say no.
So you always want to put yourself in a 

1064
00:53:57,811 --> 00:54:00,420
position where you can do that.
That's part of being,

1065
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,313
that's part of power and the other thing
is do not let people push you around 

1066
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,693
because you'll get pushed right into a 
corner and you'll end up as a slave and 

1067
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:11,670
that's because there's tyranny,
slavery or negotiation.

1068
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,560
That's what you've got.
Yes.

1069
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,200
Then you're looking at it from the wrong
perspective.

1070
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,550
Your,
your,

1071
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:28,550
your level of analysis is wrong because,
so you know it is society as a whole,

1072
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,200
but what the hell good is that going to 
do you,

1073
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,210
you can't complain to society as a 
whole.

1074
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,253
You have to look for the micro 
manifestations that actually occur in 

1075
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:39,744
your realm and work on those and that's 
the only level of analysis you have any 

1076
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,053
control over anyways.
Fix the things that are within your 

1077
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:48,654
realm of power and what will happen as a
consequence of that is that your realm 

1078
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:55,800
of power will grow but you start local 
because like what the hell do you know?

1079
00:54:55,801 --> 00:54:58,410
You're 19 or 20 or whatever it is,
like have,

1080
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,393
you'll have a scrap with society.
It's like that's just an architectural 

1081
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:03,720
problem.
That's all it is.

1082
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,540
Because you don't know enough about 
society to have that opinion.

1083
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,430
You know?
And I'm not being,

1084
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,390
I'm not being like,
I'm not trying to be cynical about this.

1085
00:55:12,391 --> 00:55:14,400
I am telling you that it's an 
architectural problem.

1086
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,391
You know?
Of course,

1087
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:17,430
everybody who is young has a problem 
with society.

1088
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:20,880
You're all at the bottom of the bloody 
dominance hierarchy unless you count the

1089
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:21,714
entire rest of the world,
in which case you're already in the top 

1090
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,150
1% right?
So,

1091
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:28,710
you know,
that's where thinking about too.

1092
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,930
So when you know,
if you,

1093
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:35,430
if you are in involved in a battle,
in some sense with society,

1094
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,713
you,
you're dominated by the figure of the 

1095
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,650
great father,
the negative figure of the great father.

1096
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:43,740
You also have to a lot of what you 
should do about that.

1097
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:46,530
It's increased your level of gratitude.
You know,

1098
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,660
here you are.
It's warm.

1099
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,360
The chair works.
The floor isn't going to fall apart,

1100
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:53,550
right?
You're at a prestigious institution.

1101
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:57,810
You're well on your way to being one of 
the top 1% in society.

1102
00:55:57,811 --> 00:56:00,030
You're just too damn in the young right 
now for that to happen.

1103
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:02,100
You're smart,
you're healthy.

1104
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,053
You're good looking except for that 
weird thing you're wearing around your 

1105
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:08,580
head.
So like,

1106
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:10,800
you know what the hell,
it's,

1107
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,620
everything's good for you.
So I mean,

1108
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,320
I know there's a tyrannical element 
there is.

1109
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:18,510
It's real,
but,

1110
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,720
but if that's all you see,
you're,

1111
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:24,430
you're blinded and that's not good.
It'll warp you.

1112
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:26,830
So,
okay,

1113
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,860
so here's an example of how people 
automatically see the world as animated.

1114
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:32,920
So it makes sense.
So,

1115
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:33,754
you know,
cause I said we automatically perceive 

1116
00:56:34,871 --> 00:56:38,410
the world in personifies category.
So let's look at this.

1117
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:05,343
Okay.

1118
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Okay.
Okay.

1119
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:30,040
So I would say that's the beginning of 
the journey into the unconscious.

1120
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,870
So that's there.
He's going,

1121
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,150
what would you say into the underworld 
fundamentally.

1122
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:18,993
Okay.
So the first thing you notice that you 

1123
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:21,220
can all understand that,
right?

1124
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:22,870
It's sort of like the world of 
childhood,

1125
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,030
but it makes sense for all those things 
to be,

1126
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:25,893
to be animated,
to manifest themselves in personified 

1127
00:58:27,911 --> 00:58:29,020
form.
It's a way,

1128
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:29,913
it's a way of looking at the world that 
we can really understand and it's a 

1129
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,110
natural way.
Sorry about that.

1130
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,710
It's a natural way for children to,
to look at the world.

1131
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,890
All their books are like that.
Everything's animated because that's,

1132
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:42,993
that's what they assume about the world.
That's the first understanding of the 

1133
00:58:45,281 --> 00:58:46,114
world,
is the world of a place of 

1134
00:58:46,601 --> 00:58:47,434
personalities.
And they have to move beyond that to 

1135
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,850
start developing some concept of the 
objective world.

1136
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,190
And it isn't even clear that that's 
necessary.

1137
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,130
So
okay,

1138
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:01,540
so now I would say that that's,
what would you call,

1139
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:06,541
that's part of the symbolic structure 
that represents the shamanic initiation.

1140
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,250
So I'm going to read something for male 
Iata,

1141
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:10,810
which is one of the readings that you 
have,

1142
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:11,913
I should like even now to stress the 
fact that the psychopathology of the 

1143
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:14,914
shamanic vocation is not profane.
It does not belong to ordinary 

1144
00:59:17,741 --> 00:59:18,574
symptomatology.
So what he's saying is that it's not 

1145
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:21,283
psychopathological,
it's part of normative personalities 

1146
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:26,000
development.
It has an initiatory structure,

1147
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:28,790
significant and signification.
In short,

1148
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:31,280
it reproduces a traditional mystical 
pattern.

1149
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,503
The total crisis of the future.
Sharman sometimes leading to complete 

1150
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,374
disintegration of the personality and to
madness can be evaluated not only as an 

1151
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,940
initiatory death,
but also as a symbolic return to the pre

1152
00:59:43,941 --> 00:59:44,774
cosmic gornick chaos to the amorphous 
and indescribable state that precedes 

1153
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:53,300
any cosmogony cause.
Margariney is the account of the initial

1154
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:56,390
creation of being.
So in the Judeo Christian tradition,

1155
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:59,000
for example,
that would be the emergence of order out

1156
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:00,560
of the initial state of chaos.

1157
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,890
That's,
that's produced by God's words.

1158
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:03,724
So,
and that's another symbolic 

1159
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:06,770
representation.
There's chaos,

1160
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:09,140
there's the active word and there's 
order.

1161
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:11,870
And those are the three initial elements
of being.

1162
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,063
And so the Sharman in some senses,
reducing himself as a consequence of 

1163
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:20,270
exposure to something radical to the 
initial components of his being.

1164
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,400
And then being reconstructed out of 
that.

1165
01:00:22,401 --> 01:00:24,890
And that happens to you all the time.
In some sense,

1166
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,873
when you encounter an obstacle that 
really sets you back because you know 

1167
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:30,194
you've ordered the world and then what 
you find out is the ordering of the 

1168
01:00:32,781 --> 01:00:33,614
world is incorrect.
And before you can reorder it has to 

1169
01:00:36,291 --> 01:00:38,690
become chaotic.
It does become chaotic.

1170
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:39,733
That's what sets you back.
And then out of that chaos you have to 

1171
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:44,450
bring out a new order.
If you can't,

1172
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,070
you know.
So for example,

1173
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:47,870
you get betrayed by someone that you 
love.

1174
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:48,710
It's like,
okay,

1175
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,190
it's time to update your world model now
can you,

1176
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,380
well maybe not,
you know,

1177
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:57,260
because if you really update it,
you have to come.

1178
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:01,340
You have to come to terms with the fact 
that the individual,

1179
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:02,174
which would also include you is capable 
of radically immoral act because 

1180
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,710
betrayal is a radically immoral,
locked,

1181
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:10,544
right.
If there's any thing that's actually a 

1182
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:12,734
moral,
it's people telling you one thing and 

1183
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:16,790
then doing a whole bunch of other things
behind your back.

1184
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,250
And then that brings up a question,
which is,

1185
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:21,320
well,
how the hell can people be like that?

1186
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:22,483
Especially because I'm also a person.
And then also how can I be so naive and 

1187
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:28,190
moronic that that can happen to me?
So,

1188
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,140
and those are not trivial questions.
You know,

1189
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,213
if you can't,
if you don't have an answer to them at 

1190
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:33,614
hand,
what it means is that there's half the 

1191
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,090
world you haven't mapped out,
which would be the negative half.

1192
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,163
And you may have to revisit and revise 
and destroy virtually all of your 

1193
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,770
assumptions about the world.
So that's a reduction to chaos.

1194
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:46,723
It is not fun,
especially if it happens accidentally 

1195
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:52,430
and it can be traumatic enough so you 
never recover from it.

1196
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,830
Post traumatic stress disorders like 
that,

1197
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:58,370
like if you watch soldiers in battle and
they get post traumatic stress disorder,

1198
01:01:58,550 --> 01:01:59,383
it's very frequent that they get it 
because of something they did not 

1199
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,800
because of something that happened to 
them.

1200
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,500
You know,
so they're out on a mission of some sort

1201
01:02:06,501 --> 01:02:08,540
and they shoot a three year old child.
It's like,

1202
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:11,570
and maybe they do it consciously and 
then you know,

1203
01:02:11,571 --> 01:02:13,850
they wake up after they do it and they 
think,

1204
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:15,920
well that's not me.
It's like,

1205
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:19,320
Oh yes it is.
It's just not the you that you think you

1206
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:23,130
are and the you that did that man in 
countering,

1207
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,410
that's going to be enough to damage your
consciousness.

1208
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,050
And that is what happened to people with
post traumatic stress disorder.

1209
01:02:28,051 --> 01:02:32,410
Like it blows them apart so badly and 
not just psychologically right?

1210
01:02:32,411 --> 01:02:35,010
It,
it radically alters them physiologically

1211
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:38,010
their amygdalas grow in their 
hippocampus by shrink.

1212
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,690
If you have post traumatic stress 
disorder,

1213
01:02:39,691 --> 01:02:43,050
it's a whole brain transformation.
It's like it's no joke.

1214
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:46,020
And the human capacity for evil is so 
deep that,

1215
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,430
well young,
for example,

1216
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,680
he thought that that,
uh,

1217
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,583
you know,
an accidental encounter with it was 

1218
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:54,960
enough to well enough to lead to madness
in some cases.

1219
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:57,450
And it's,
it's no joke.

1220
01:02:58,570 --> 01:02:59,403
All right,
so here's the way of thinking about 

1221
01:03:01,021 --> 01:03:01,854
things.
I'm going to move through it relatively 

1222
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:03,624
quickly.
So,

1223
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,910
um,
you look through the world,

1224
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:07,980
you look at the world through a frame of
reference,

1225
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:08,814
and the reason you do that in part is 
because there's more to the world than 

1226
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:11,700
you can understand.

1227
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:14,370
And so that would be the actual chaos of
the world.

1228
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:16,230
It's like the world is very,
very,

1229
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,041
very,
very,

1230
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:18,870
very complicated.
And you know,

1231
01:03:18,871 --> 01:03:19,704
you're a very complicated too,
but you're not as complicated as the 

1232
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:22,674
world.
So you're continually surrounded by a 

1233
01:03:24,271 --> 01:03:26,430
chaotic structure that you don't really 
understand.

1234
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:31,670
And you have to frame it in with a frame
of reference that only allows you to see

1235
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,060
those things that are necessary for you 
to see at the time of your given action.

1236
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:36,894
And as far as I can tell,
this is a cybernetic model of 

1237
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:39,264
personality.
The elements of that frame or something 

1238
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:44,880
like this is a basic story.
You are somewhere,

1239
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,430
you're located somewhere in time and 
space,

1240
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,860
always.
You know where that is and you have some

1241
01:03:49,861 --> 01:03:52,440
sense of the qualities of that 
localization.

1242
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:55,470
So people ask you about that because 
they ask you,

1243
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,700
well,
how are you doing?

1244
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:59,040
And what they're asking is,
you know,

1245
01:03:59,070 --> 01:04:01,770
what's your representation of your 
current state of being?

1246
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:05,100
And the answer to that is generally for 
people,

1247
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:06,360
um,
it's okay,

1248
01:04:06,361 --> 01:04:09,450
but it's insufficient because if it 
wasn't insufficient,

1249
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,590
while what,
why,

1250
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,453
why would you be doing anything in any,
in principle now isn't good enough 

1251
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:17,490
because there's something else that 
could be better.

1252
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:18,324
And that's what you're pursuing.
And if it's kind of a weird thing 

1253
01:04:20,371 --> 01:04:25,290
because it means in some sense that if 
you weren't dissatisfied permanently,

1254
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,540
you wouldn't be motivated to do 
anything.

1255
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,374
And so that's also part of the reason 
that a lot of human being human 

1256
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:34,530
experience is characterized by somewhat 
negative emotions.

1257
01:04:34,531 --> 01:04:36,780
It's like this,
we're permanently dissatisfied.

1258
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,490
Why?
Well,

1259
01:04:38,491 --> 01:04:42,630
because we can act to change things.
So if you're not dissatisfied,

1260
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:44,640
you don't want it to be better.
So in some sense,

1261
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:45,474
what you're doing is looking at the 
world through a frame that says this is 

1262
01:04:47,731 --> 01:04:52,731
what there is and here's how I evaluated
and here's what could be and that's what

1263
01:04:52,891 --> 01:04:53,430
I want.

1264
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,400
I would like to bring that about.
And so that's uh,

1265
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,473
that's what gives things value.
It gives things value because things 

1266
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:02,490
that will move you to where you want to 
go,

1267
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:03,473
they have a positive value and things 
that get in your way when you're trying 

1268
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:08,640
to get to where you want to go,
they have a negative value.

1269
01:05:08,910 --> 01:05:10,980
And so that's partly how your emotions 
work.

1270
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,440
So,
and you can put almost anything in the,

1271
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,770
in the box of what should be,
it's weird because normally animals,

1272
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:19,360
what would be in the box of what should 
be,

1273
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:23,410
would be deep motivational states that 
are biological in origin.

1274
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,510
So maybe an animal hasn't had enough to 
eat.

1275
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:27,580
And so park,
it's feeling hungry.

1276
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:30,490
That's undesirable.
It wants to have something to eat.

1277
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,533
And so these different underlying 
biological systems like hunger and 

1278
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:35,074
thirst and,
and sexual lost and aggression and 

1279
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:38,650
temperature regulation and so on.

1280
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,800
There are what set the goals and the 
perceptual frame.

1281
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:44,080
So,
and the emotional responses.

1282
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,130
But in human beings we're so damn 
abstract that we can take that structure

1283
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,590
and we can put almost anything in that 
goal box.

1284
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:51,933
So for example,
you can go to a soccer game and you can 

1285
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:54,904
say,
well,

1286
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:55,893
I'm going to identify with my team.
So you expand the boundaries of your 

1287
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,690
current state of existence to 
incorporate the team.

1288
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,980
And then you say,
well,

1289
01:06:02,981 --> 01:06:03,814
it's really important to me that these 
kicked that little round sphere through 

1290
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:08,410
that net.
And so your whole nervous system says,

1291
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:10,030
okay,
well if that's the goal,

1292
01:06:10,031 --> 01:06:12,340
we're going to align our emotions with 
that.

1293
01:06:12,341 --> 01:06:14,500
And then you know,
guys you don't know,

1294
01:06:14,501 --> 01:06:15,334
run down the field and kick a little 
sphere through a nat and you're like up 

1295
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:19,840
there,
you know,

1296
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:23,050
and celebrating in a way that you'd 
never do in your actual life.

1297
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,830
It's like you don't do that when you get
a good grade on an exam,

1298
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:27,664
you know,
jump up in the air and hug all your 

1299
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:29,500
friends.
It's,

1300
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:30,333
you'll do that at a soccer game.
It's like what the Hell is wrong with 

1301
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,150
you?
So,

1302
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,133
but you do that because this is a very 
malleable and extendable frame and 

1303
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:43,210
you're using it for everything.
When you go into a movie theater and you

1304
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:44,044
watched the protagonist,
you basically adopt his or her frame of 

1305
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:47,824
reference and then you see the whole 
world that's portrayed on the screen 

1306
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,363
through the eyes of the person that 
you're identifying with as part of our 

1307
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:56,840
capacity for imitation.
So basically what you do,

1308
01:06:56,841 --> 01:06:57,674
what it seems,
what you do there is like if you're 

1309
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:02,320
talking to someone else and you adopt 
their frame of reference,

1310
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:07,500
it's not exactly a cognitive operation.
What you seem to do is first of all come

1311
01:07:07,521 --> 01:07:11,350
with to some understanding about what it
is that they want.

1312
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:14,260
And so that's the goal.
Once you know what they want,

1313
01:07:14,261 --> 01:07:15,094
you can represent them in your body.
So it's almost like you're playing them 

1314
01:07:18,251 --> 01:07:21,160
as a simulation on your own biological 
plot form.

1315
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:26,080
And then you can infer from your own 
emotional responses if you also simulate

1316
01:07:26,081 --> 01:07:28,690
the situation that they're in,
what their emotions are.

1317
01:07:28,691 --> 01:07:30,590
And that enables you to understand other
people's.

1318
01:07:30,591 --> 01:07:31,424
So were these weird biological computers
that are capable of running other 

1319
01:07:35,111 --> 01:07:35,944
psyches on our biological platform.
And that makes us able to imitate and 

1320
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:42,640
also to understand each other.
So that's a basic narrative.

1321
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:43,713
I was here and I'm trying to go there.
And so if you're asking your 

1322
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:47,794
kindergarten kid what they did today at 
school and teaching them to tell a 

1323
01:07:50,591 --> 01:07:51,790
story,
they might say,

1324
01:07:51,791 --> 01:07:52,624
well,
I was at home and then mom took me to 

1325
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:56,950
kindergarten.
It's like not a very exciting story,

1326
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:57,820
but it's a story.

1327
01:07:58,090 --> 01:07:59,830
And then a little more exciting story 
might be,

1328
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:02,253
I was at home,
my mom took me to school and on the way 

1329
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:04,954
there a big dog ran up to the fence and 
barked out me and the right question 

1330
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,380
that would follow that story is,
okay,

1331
01:08:11,381 --> 01:08:12,214
what did you do?
And that's a real story because the kid 

1332
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:15,231
says,
well look,

1333
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,064
I was in this frame of reference and I 
was aiming at goal a b actually I was 

1334
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:21,584
aiming at point b and while I was aiming
at point b an acting out the processes 

1335
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:29,000
that would lead me there,
something unexpected happened.

1336
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:31,580
That's a story.
And then you say,

1337
01:08:31,581 --> 01:08:33,740
well what did you do?
And the kid might say,

1338
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,161
well,
you know,

1339
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:38,480
I was really scared and I hid behind mum
or so that would be one response.

1340
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:41,450
And we still went to kindergarten and I 
was okay,

1341
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,770
it's pretty good,
pretty good.

1342
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,813
Or The kid might say,
well I wasn't scared at all because I 

1343
01:08:45,591 --> 01:08:48,230
know that if you stand up to dogs,
they usually leave you alone.

1344
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:50,270
And we went to kindergarten and that was
okay.

1345
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:52,970
And you know,
the kid is trying to tell really they're

1346
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:53,804
trying to tell a little hero story and 
if they're successful in the accounter 

1347
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:57,883
with the thing that's unknown,
then they try on as a consequence of 

1348
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:02,750
their encounter with the unexpected and 
Poof,

1349
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,260
you know,
that's successful out of pace.

1350
01:09:04,261 --> 01:09:05,720
You Pat them on the head and you say,
yeah,

1351
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:08,410
no that's really good.
They kind of smile and you know,

1352
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:09,253
you're teaching them,
you're teaching them how to comprehend 

1353
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:13,963
their existence in a narrative structure
and you're also teaching them what that 

1354
01:09:16,491 --> 01:09:20,150
narrative structure should be.
So this is like a Meta narrative and the

1355
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:23,450
Meta narrative says you were going from 
point a to point b.

1356
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,403
That's the oval on the left.
And then something completely bizarre 

1357
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:28,304
happened.
Like I was betrayed and then I was in 

1358
01:09:31,191 --> 01:09:34,040
this terrible place for quite a long 
period of time,

1359
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:35,053
a chaotic place.
But I learned a bunch and I put myself 

1360
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:42,350
back together and I'm a wiser person as 
a consequence of the encounter.

1361
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,530
Right?
Everyone knows that story.

1362
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:48,380
And that's paradise.
Paradise lost,

1363
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,500
paradise regained.
It's a cultural meta-narrative and,

1364
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:56,090
and it's a story that every,
like it's a human story.

1365
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:57,103
It's an apocalyptic story.
That's why everybody's always all 

1366
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,340
apocalyptic about everything,
right?

1367
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,280
Apocalypse of the week,
we're going to run out of oil.

1368
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:07,250
We're going to run out of gas.
There's too much carbon dioxide.

1369
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,050
The Chinese are going to take over the 
world.

1370
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,540
We're ruining the,
we're ruining the ecology,

1371
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,670
the oceans running out of fish.
You know,

1372
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:14,504
the world is getting too hot.
It was getting too cold in 1970 when I 

1373
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:18,320
was about your age.

1374
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,470
It's like apocalypse of the week.
Why?

1375
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,753
Because things fall apart and because 
they can fall apart completely and they 

1376
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:27,494
often do.
And so everyone's always on the alert 

1377
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:32,750
for like the next potential apocalypse 
and it's no wonder,

1378
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:33,733
you know,
it's a permanent characteristic of life 

1379
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:36,883
that things can radically fallen apart.
Now Luckily it's a permanent 

1380
01:10:39,801 --> 01:10:40,634
characteristic of life that they can 
actually also radically come back 

1381
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:44,114
together.
And it turns out that whether or not 

1382
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:49,670
they radically come together,
depends to some degree on how you choose

1383
01:10:49,671 --> 01:10:54,671
to act when they fall apart.
What is the pre cosmic Garnett chaos.

1384
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,940
This is from,
um,

1385
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,110
William James,
who was a pragmatist,

1386
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:03,140
lived on the east coast at about the end
of the 18 hundreds.

1387
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,240
He was one of the founders of modern 
psychology.

1388
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:09,170
He likes to sniff nitric nitrous oxide,
which is a hallucinogen.

1389
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:13,290
He was sort of like the world's first 
major league hippie and he wrote sort of

1390
01:11:13,291 --> 01:11:17,190
hippie poetry as a consequence of his 
nitrous oxide experimentation.

1391
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:20,910
And here's part of what a he derived 
from his experiences.

1392
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:22,120
So,
um,

1393
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:23,063
pure experience is the name which I give
to the original flux of life before 

1394
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:27,894
reflection has categorized it only 
newborn babes and persons in semi coma 

1395
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:32,400
from sleep,
drugs,

1396
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:33,234
illnesses,
or blows can have an experience pure in 

1397
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:36,234
the literal sense of awe that which is 
not yet any definite what potential 

1398
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,210
potential cause he might think,
well,

1399
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:48,270
what's the world made of?
It's made out of actuality,

1400
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,400
right?
That's not how you act.

1401
01:11:50,401 --> 01:11:51,234
You Act as if the world's made out of 
potential and you interact with that 

1402
01:11:53,971 --> 01:11:54,804
potential.
And what James is saying is that there 

1403
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:57,324
are times when you experience something 
that's akin to relatively pure 

1404
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:02,094
potential,
and then you might ask yourself whether 

1405
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:06,930
or not potential is real,
which is a really interesting question,

1406
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,170
but I can say regardless of how you 
answer that question,

1407
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:14,490
you act as if it's real and you'll also 
feel guilty of someone that you love,

1408
01:12:14,491 --> 01:12:18,150
comes up to you and says,
you're not living up to your potential.

1409
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,980
It's like,
what the hell does that mean?

1410
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,203
What does it mean?
It means you're not becoming that which 

1411
01:12:23,821 --> 01:12:25,710
you could be.
Well,

1412
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,910
what is that?
It's like,

1413
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:28,050
you know,
we're materialists.

1414
01:12:28,051 --> 01:12:30,150
How are we going to measure that?
You can't touch it.

1415
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,890
You can't taste it.
You can't see it.

1416
01:12:31,891 --> 01:12:33,960
You can't measure it.
Right?

1417
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:35,090
But,
but nonetheless,

1418
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:35,963
it's like the substance of being and 
being his potential as well as 

1419
01:12:39,631 --> 01:12:40,464
actuality.
And we're grappling always with the 

1420
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,074
potential.
And so that's what James is talking 

1421
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:45,810
about.
Pure potential.

1422
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:46,823
I like to think of it as latent 
information full both of oneness and 

1423
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:51,513
menace,
but in respects that don't appear 

1424
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:56,610
changing throughout yet.
So confusedly that it's phases.

1425
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:57,444
Interpenetrate sounds like the Yin and 
Yang symbol and no points either of 

1426
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,660
distinction or of identity can be 
caught.

1427
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,263
Here's his poem.
No verbiage can give it because the 

1428
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:10,074
verbiage is other incoherent,
coherent the same and it fades and it's 

1429
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:17,790
infinite.
It's infinite.

1430
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:21,810
Don't you see the difference?
Don't you see the identity constantly?

1431
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:22,644
Opposites united the same.
Me telling you to write and not to 

1432
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:26,730
right.
Extreme,

1433
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,950
extreme,
extreme something.

1434
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:29,784
And other than that thing,
intoxication and otherness than 

1435
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:34,920
intoxication.
Every attempted betterment,

1436
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:36,233
every attempted other men is a,
it fades and it fades forever and 

1437
01:13:40,561 --> 01:13:41,730
forever as we move.

1438
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,863
Elliot says now,
as we know for archaic and traditional 

1439
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:48,564
cultures,
the symbolic return to chaos is 

1440
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:50,454
equivalent to preparing a new creation.
So the death of your current state of 

1441
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:56,310
being can be the preparation for a new 
being.

1442
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:58,770
Now one of the things the psychoanalysts
say,

1443
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:02,340
and this is implicit in Elliot's 
discussion of the show transformation,

1444
01:14:02,341 --> 01:14:03,174
is if you do this voluntarily,
you have a much better chance of doing 

1445
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:10,260
it successfully.
So the rule is,

1446
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,213
well,
if you go to hunt for a dragon and 

1447
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:15,610
you're in pretty good shape while you're
doing it and you're all prepared,

1448
01:14:15,611 --> 01:14:16,444
then the damn thing might not eat you.
But if you're lying in bed and you know 

1449
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:20,560
you're covered with cheesy dust and 
you've,

1450
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,050
you're hung over from three days worth 
of drinking,

1451
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,670
then the dragon,
we'll just eat you.

1452
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:26,800
And it's probably a good thing for 
everyone that it did.

1453
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,340
So,
so the point is be prepared.

1454
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:34,690
And part of the way that you're prepared
is by being awake and having the,

1455
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:35,623
uh,
uh,

1456
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:36,633
many sources of power that are at your 
fingertips that are part of your 

1457
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:45,610
biological and cultural inheritance at,
at the ready so that you can respond.

1458
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:47,480
Yeah,

1459
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,330
it follows that we may interpret the 
psychic chaos of the future.

1460
01:14:50,331 --> 01:14:53,930
Sharman has a sign that the profane man 
is being dissolved and a new personality

1461
01:14:53,931 --> 01:14:58,931
being prepared for birth transformation,
constant theme,

1462
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,800
Paradise,
Paradise,

1463
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:04,610
lost and redemption.
That's the story of mankind.

1464
01:15:04,611 --> 01:15:06,470
We're in a fallen state.
Why is that?

1465
01:15:06,471 --> 01:15:07,304
While,
because things aren't perfect and they 

1466
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:10,280
could be better and everyone's 
suffering.

1467
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,503
So things have fallen apart.
They're always in the state of being 

1468
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:16,670
fallen apart.
And what are we trying to do?

1469
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,740
What we're trying to put them back 
together.

1470
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:21,590
That's the eternal story of mankind 
that,

1471
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,683
yeah.

1472
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:31,120
Now on [inaudible] who was an 
existentialist psychotherapist,

1473
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:32,563
um,
and who is a leader of the 

1474
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:34,784
existentialist movement in the 1950s and
also a profound student of 

1475
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:40,880
psychoanalysts.
Psychoanalysis talked about something he

1476
01:15:40,881 --> 01:15:41,714
characterized as a creative illness,
which was something that manifested 

1477
01:15:44,451 --> 01:15:45,284
itself in Freud and in [inaudible] and 
in other people like Viktor Frankl for 

1478
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:50,324
example,
who went through periods of extreme and 

1479
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:53,114
Darwin,
extreme periods of chaotic disruption 

1480
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:59,480
has their new theories were manifesting 
themselves because the new theories tore

1481
01:15:59,481 --> 01:16:00,314
them apart as they were being developed.
And they paid a tremendous personal 

1482
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:03,974
price for that.
But generally they were able to 

1483
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:08,390
reorganize themselves within the context
of the new theory.

1484
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:09,433
And that made their stance more powerful
and more complete than it was before he 

1485
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:16,340
described the characteristic elements of
the creative illnesses follows.

1486
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:17,503
It succeeds a period of intense 
preoccupation with an idea and search 

1487
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:21,884
for a certain truth.
It's a polymorphous condition that can 

1488
01:16:24,531 --> 01:16:26,630
take the shape of depression,
neurosis,

1489
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,780
psychosomatic ailments,
or even psychosis,

1490
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,420
whatever the symptoms they are felt as 
painful,

1491
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:33,254
if not agonizing by the subject with 
alternating periods of alleviation and 

1492
01:16:36,411 --> 01:16:37,244
worsening throughout the illness.
The subject never loses the thread of 

1493
01:16:40,611 --> 01:16:41,444
his dominating preoccupation.
It's often compatible with normal 

1494
01:16:44,511 --> 01:16:46,460
professional activity and family life,

1495
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,740
but even if he keeps to his social 
activities,

1496
01:16:50,741 --> 01:16:52,900
he's almost entirely absorbed with 
himself.

1497
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,303
He suffers from feelings of isolation,
even when he has a mentor who guides 

1498
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:02,170
them through the ordeal like the showman
apprentice with his master,

1499
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:06,580
the termination is often rapid and 
marked by a phase of exhilaration.

1500
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,833
The subject emerges from his ordeal with
a permanent transformation in his 

1501
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:11,174
personality and the conviction that he 
has discovered a great truth or a new 

1502
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,490
spiritual world.
Also happened to piaget.

1503
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:18,163
Many of the 19th and 20th century 
figures recognized universally is great 

1504
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:23,450
niche,
a Darwin,

1505
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:24,680
Dostoevsky,
tolstoy,

1506
01:17:24,681 --> 01:17:27,440
Freud Young.
We're also additionally characterized by

1507
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:30,830
lengthy periods of profound 
psychological unrest and uncertainty.

1508
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,730
Here's our dream that my daughter had 
when she was three,

1509
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,380
and this is quite a cool dream.
I caught it.

1510
01:17:36,381 --> 01:17:39,350
I was able to write it down verbatim 
because I was writing at the time.

1511
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,183
So she came in to tell me this dream.
So I typed it out because it's not that 

1512
01:17:42,831 --> 01:17:45,740
easy to catch a kid's dream.
So here was the situation.

1513
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,160
So when we brought her brother home from
the hospital,

1514
01:17:49,161 --> 01:17:51,700
he is two years younger than her.
We didn't know,

1515
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,593
you know,
if there's less than a three year gap 

1516
01:17:53,871 --> 01:17:54,704
between siblings,
there's a high probability of sibling 

1517
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:59,510
rivalry because the old siblings still 
needs a lot of attention.

1518
01:17:59,511 --> 01:18:02,480
But you know when you have a two year 
old you think man that's a baby.

1519
01:18:02,481 --> 01:18:05,750
But when you bring a newborn baby home,
that two year olds in adult,

1520
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:09,290
like there's such a radical difference 
between a newborn and a two year old.

1521
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,030
And so it's hard on the two year old,
right?

1522
01:18:11,031 --> 01:18:11,864
Cause they have to grow up right away 
and maybe they don't get as much 

1523
01:18:13,251 --> 01:18:15,470
attention.
So we taught her to,

1524
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:19,460
we taught her to come for a hug when she
needed to by practicing that.

1525
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:21,530
And we also prepared her and told her 
that,

1526
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:22,393
you know,
there was going to be some trouble but 

1527
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,280
she could get some attention from this 
new baby.

1528
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:27,890
And that was also her baby.
So she was all prepared for that.

1529
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,783
So she took a lot of care of that baby 
and she thought it was her baby and she 

1530
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:35,870
liked this baby.
And so she called him baby and then,

1531
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:37,760
you know,
he started to toddle around and,

1532
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,220
and uh,
and we told her one day,

1533
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:41,910
well,
he was being toilet trained.

1534
01:18:41,940 --> 01:18:42,830
We said,
look,

1535
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,350
Mckayla,
he's not really a baby anymore.

1536
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:47,300
And she didn't like that because she 
thought,

1537
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:48,740
hmm,
I like that baby.

1538
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,400
And now whatever this creature is 
apparently is not that baby.

1539
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,170
And so what am I supposed to do about 
that?

1540
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:55,004
And not as a profound question because 
there are lots of parents who don't let 

1541
01:18:57,981 --> 01:18:58,814
their children progressed past the stage
of baby because they don't want to lose 

1542
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:03,134
the baby.

1543
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:06,260
And so it's like she was onto something 
major.

1544
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,970
So,
um,

1545
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:13,880
so this is what she said.
This is your dream.

1546
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,280
Julian is the name of her little 
brother.

1547
01:19:16,281 --> 01:19:17,114
Julian's eyes fall down.
And then he falled into pieces and I 

1548
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:20,711
said,
what,

1549
01:19:20,711 --> 01:19:23,660
what sort of piece is?
And she said Julian pieces.

1550
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:24,613
It's like,
yeah.

1551
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:29,390
And then his bones falled out too.
Then a whole goddess and there was water

1552
01:19:29,391 --> 01:19:30,224
in it.
And when he came out he was big and my 

1553
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:34,280
wife said,
Julian isn't a baby anymore.

1554
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,630
And Mckinley said,
no,

1555
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,493
he's a big boy and above with legs.
Got Him out cause bugs can swim and the 

1556
01:19:39,831 --> 01:19:40,664
hole was in the park and the park and it
moved into the backyard and he felt he 

1557
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:47,180
falled in it.
A tree burned and left the hole.

1558
01:19:47,930 --> 01:19:51,160
So that was pretty cool.
Like grade three,

1559
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,340
you know,
three year old kid.

1560
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:54,090
And so the park,
they started,

1561
01:19:54,091 --> 01:19:57,170
her place was 42 acres and it was like a
real forest and park.

1562
01:19:57,171 --> 01:19:59,570
And I used to take the kids there like 
at twilight and you know,

1563
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:03,380
we'd creep around in there and it was 
pretty scary and exciting for them.

1564
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,360
So it was sort of an ex gary and 
exciting place.

1565
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:08,730
It was full of trees.
And so it was the unknown outside of our

1566
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:11,130
little house.
And so her dream said,

1567
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:11,964
well the unknown had moved into the 
backyard in the form of a tree and the 

1568
01:20:14,491 --> 01:20:15,324
tree burned down.
And a tree is often a symbol of the 

1569
01:20:17,551 --> 01:20:18,384
psyche.
And it left the hall and the hall was 

1570
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:22,140
full of water and then the little baby 
went into the water,

1571
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,580
dissolved and went into the water.
And then this weird bug got him out.

1572
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:30,810
So it was some alive thing bug.
It's actually,

1573
01:20:30,811 --> 01:20:32,970
it was a bug like Jimminy cricket in 
Pinocchio,

1574
01:20:32,971 --> 01:20:33,804
You know,
cause that's a bug and it's a bug that 

1575
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:37,170
leads transformation by the way.
So anyways,

1576
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,004
the bug got him out and then he was a 
big boy and what she was dealing with 

1577
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:42,420
was the nature of radical 
transformation.

1578
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,433
How one thing could turn into something 
different and then reconstitute itself 

1579
01:20:47,431 --> 01:20:49,770
as something else.
And she did that on a symbolic level.

1580
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:55,020
So what time is it?
Three rats.

1581
01:20:58,950 --> 01:21:00,900
All right,
well I'll tell you this little story for

1582
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:01,734
one minute.
So I had a five year old nephew and he 

1583
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:05,004
was having night terrors.
So we'd wake up at night screaming and 

1584
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,930
having a lot.
And uh,

1585
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,130
there was some trouble in his family at 
that point.

1586
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,350
His parents ended up getting divorced,
but anyways,

1587
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,620
he'd wake up screaming.
And so he also was running around during

1588
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,650
the day with a little night hat on and 
like a plastic sword.

1589
01:21:19,651 --> 01:21:21,390
And so he goes like Joe night,
you know,

1590
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:22,620
and,
and then when he went to bed,

1591
01:21:22,621 --> 01:21:25,830
he had the little night hat by him and 
also the sword.

1592
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,800
And so one night when I was there,
he had one of these night terrors.

1593
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,020
And so I will,
I was there that morning and I said,

1594
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:32,340
well,
did you dream anything?

1595
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,520
And this is what he said,
dwarf like beat creatures who came up to

1596
01:21:37,711 --> 01:21:38,544
his knees,
had he was out in the field and they 

1597
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:41,670
were like,
so these little things about this big,

1598
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,653
they had no arms,
they just had a big head that was beaky 

1599
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:48,770
a beak and they were jumping at him with
the beak and like chomping him.

1600
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:49,613
And on the top of their head they had,
it was all hairy and greasy and on the 

1601
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:55,260
top of their head they had a cross 
shaved in it.

1602
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,990
So it was like everybody shut up at that
breakfast,

1603
01:21:57,991 --> 01:21:58,680
I can tell.
It's like,

1604
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,420
oh that's what's happening.
It's no one to wonder.

1605
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:01,254
You're screaming.
And then so he is fighting away with 

1606
01:22:03,661 --> 01:22:05,070
these things and they're jumping on 
them.

1607
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:09,540
But the problem was he said he,
there was a dragon in the background and

1608
01:22:09,541 --> 01:22:10,374
what was happening was the dragon was 
breathing out fire all the time and the 

1609
01:22:12,811 --> 01:22:16,080
fire and the smoke,
we're turning into these dwarfed,

1610
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,063
you know,
little dwarf bird things that were 

1611
01:22:18,211 --> 01:22:19,770
biting them and it's like perfect.
Right.

1612
01:22:19,771 --> 01:22:24,771
It's such a perfect representation.
He can't fight off any one problem cause

1613
01:22:25,141 --> 01:22:25,974
it's sort of pointless because there's 
something in the background generating 

1614
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:29,220
problems like mad.

1615
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,160
It's like a hydro cut off one head,
seven more grow.

1616
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,640
So I said,
what could you do about that?

1617
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,380
Which is a leading question,
right?

1618
01:22:37,381 --> 01:22:39,390
Because it implies that he could do 
something about that.

1619
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,403
So then he said,
I would take my dad and we would go 

1620
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:44,274
after the dragon.
I jumped on his head and poke his eyes 

1621
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:50,400
out with my sword and then I go down its
belly to where the fire comes out.

1622
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,030
And I'd carve out a piece of the firebox
and I'd make a shield out of it.

1623
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,490
And I thought,
yes,

1624
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,070
that's right.
So,

1625
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,980
and one of the things that's very 
interesting,

1626
01:23:01,981 --> 01:23:04,320
and I know this is hard to believe,
but it's absolutely true.

1627
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:08,620
He did not have any night terrors after 
that was extra cool.

1628
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,320
And it was the leading question.
It's cause he's like victim,

1629
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:11,741
right?
It's like,

1630
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:15,040
oh my God,
horrible bird headed biting things,

1631
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,570
you know,
which is pretty good.

1632
01:23:16,571 --> 01:23:17,404
It's like that's what the world's like.
And then there's something in the 

1633
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:22,270
background generating these things.
What do you do?

1634
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,950
You go to the source of the trouble and 
you find something that shields yourself

1635
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:29,890
from it in the encounter.
Brilliant.

1636
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:30,963
All right.
