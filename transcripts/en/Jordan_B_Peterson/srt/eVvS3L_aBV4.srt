1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
Jordan peterson,
psychology professor at the University 

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:04,771
of Western Ontario,
but no,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,070
University of Toronto.
I'm been there,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,053
uh,
some years a SAF Scott involved because 

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,833
we,
uh,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
we were sent the letters that,
uh,

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,810
Dr Peterson's Dean and then a vice provo
I believe,

8
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,560
uh,
uh,

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,030
had sent him and uh,
they,

10
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,010
uh,
they worried us so tremendously as,

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,893
as,
as people concerned about academic 

12
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,870
freedom and the integrity of teaching.
Um,

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,341
the,
uh,

14
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,930
the letters warned Dr Peterson,
uh,

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,803
to stop saying publicly that he would 
refuse requests to use a non gendered 

16
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,130
or,
or,

17
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,711
um,
you know,

18
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,340
additional pronouns.
Um,

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,840
and this is,
uh,

20
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,880
uh,
uh,

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,280
uh,
for us.

22
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:55,281
So it was a very serious matter very 
seriously in an incursion on the freedom

23
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:56,994
of teachers to teach as they will.
Teaching has a lot to do with the 

24
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:06,561
rapport between the professor and the 
student between a classroom dynamics and

25
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,274
the honesty and sincerity that to 
teaching requires we thought were 

26
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:12,594
infringed by,
by these orders and especially orders 

27
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:16,340
coming from,
uh,

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,020
from deans and department to department 
heads.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,730
Um,
and,

30
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:22,480
uh,
so we wrote letters,

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,280
uh,
to a University of Toronto about this.

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,383
So we're very privileged to have Dr 
Peterson with us today to talk to us 

33
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,610
about these things.
Um,

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,473
maybe also a,
some more theoretical and abstract 

35
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,090
things.
Then his own their particular case.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,373
He's going to talk to us about why 
freedom of speech is not just another 

37
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:47,370
value.
Peterson.

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,090
Thanks.

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,393
So I thought I'd start.
I'm going to approach this from three 

40
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,880
directions,
but I are in three sections.

41
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:08,881
I thought I'd start by just letting you 
know why I was objecting specifically to

42
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,770
build [inaudible].
Um,

43
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:17,010
I made three videos in late September 
and uh,

44
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,843
one of them criticized,
built see 16 and one of them criticize 

45
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,880
the University of Toronto 
Administrations,

46
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:25,714
the human resources peoples decision to 
make so called anti unconscious anti 

47
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:36,190
bias training,
mandatory for their HR staff,

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,130
which I thought was and still think was 
reprehensible.

49
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,720
And uh,
I

50
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,390
don't even remember what the other one 
was about,

51
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:47,710
but it doesn't really matter.
Those are,

52
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,773
that was the first one,
the one on bill [inaudible] that caused 

53
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,590
most of the fewer surprisingly enough.
And I said I wouldn't use the made up.

54
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,210
What I consider you a isms that purport 
to describe the status,

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,890
the status of people whose sexual 
identity is ambiguous because that isn't

56
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,270
how it looked to me.

57
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,103
It looked to me like these words like 
CSI and xer and so forth were the 

58
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:19,834
linguistic vanguard of a intellectual 
movement that I would say detest is 

59
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:25,774
probably the right description and 
that's strange blend of postmodernism 

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,344
and Marxism that has emerged to occupy 
the bulk of the humanities and a good 

61
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:38,344
chunk of the social sciences,
and so that was the first thing is that 

62
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,633
I'm not using those words.
That was the first thing that was 

63
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,030
personal,
right?

64
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:51,031
Is that that's not a form of linguistic 
game that I'm willing to play and I have

65
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,760
my reasons for that.
The second was I regard the ledge.

66
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Any legislation that compels people to 
use a certain kind of language as a very

67
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,830
dangerous,
first of all,

68
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:07,240
dangerous piece of legislation directly,
but also a very dangerous precedent.

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,050
I mean,
there are limits on free speech that are

70
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,600
already reasonably well instantiated in 
the law.

71
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,643
You can't incite a crime.
You can't threaten someone bodily and 

72
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,024
unbelievable manner.
You can't libel someone we already have 

73
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:27,670
reasonable restrictions on,
on what you can't say,

74
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:28,504
but we've never had legislation that 
required you to use a certain language 

75
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:34,450
except in certain commercial 
applications.

76
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,220
So for example,
if you sell tobacco,

77
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:37,810
you have to put a warning on it.
But,

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,200
um,
the United States Supreme Court decided,

79
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,034
I believe it was in the 19 forties,
that similar attempts to compel speech 

80
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,723
on the part of individuals in 
noncommercial settings was 

81
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:49,990
unconstitutional.
And,

82
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,070
and,
uh,

83
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,800
I know that that doesn't have any direct
bearing on Canadian law,

84
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:58,801
but certainly the principal does.
And then I was also very see,

85
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:01,060
one of the problems with a piece of 
legislation,

86
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:01,894
and this is,
I suppose the problem with interpreting 

87
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:04,474
a text as the postmodernists would say,
is that it's not easy to get the level 

88
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:08,620
of interpretation right,
right.

89
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,000
Because you're interpreting a text.
You can look at the,

90
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,710
you can look at the letters that happens
with biblical interpretation.

91
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,720
Very often you can look at the 
individual words,

92
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:18,430
you can look at the phrases,
you're going to get,

93
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,320
the sentences,
you can look at the paragraphs,

94
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,543
you could look at the work as a whole,
and then you also have to look at the 

95
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,904
context within which the work is being 
interpreted in order to come up with an 

96
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,370
interpretation of anything that's 
complex.

97
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,260
And so when you see a piece of 
legislation,

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,753
it isn't obvious what the legislation is
actually intended to do despite what 

99
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:39,934
it's purported to do.
And it isn't obvious what level of 

100
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,650
analysis to pick when you're going to 
criticize it.

101
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:49,360
And in some ways bill [inaudible],
you could regard it as innocuous just as

102
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:52,900
an extension of rights that have already
been granted to certain,

103
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,400
let's say,
protected groups.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,233
Although I'm not so thrilled about the 
whole notion of ascribing rights to 

105
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,590
groups to begin with.
We're already far down that path.

106
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,963
But,
um,

107
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,493
and you know,
I've been accused of making a mountain 

108
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,210
out of a mole hill,
but happily enough,

109
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,890
the University of Toronto,
after I made the videos,

110
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:10,724
immediately produced two letters that 
were informed by their legal 

111
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,330
departments.
Wisdom,

112
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,063
I'm stating that what I had done with 
the video was perhaps in conflict with 

113
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,824
the university ethical guidelines,
if you forget the ones that had to do 

114
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,110
with freedom of expression and that they
might,

115
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,243
that my actions and even in making the 
video might have violated that the 

116
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,113
tenants of the Ontario Human Rights Act 
as it's or they at least as it's 

117
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,030
interpreted by the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission.

118
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,864
And so that helped put to rest any 
suggestion that I was actually 

119
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:50,351
scaremongering because as soon as I,
as soon as I made the videos,

120
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,230
the legal department at the uft 
immediately validated my fears.

121
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,140
And so that was a perverse,
was a perverse effect of their,

122
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,810
of the letters they sent to me.
So,

123
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,570
um,
the other thing that I,

124
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,463
there was other elements of the 
legislation that I object to and 

125
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,543
objected to and still do.
And if you read the policies within 

126
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,270
which the legislation will be 
interpreted as the federal justice,

127
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,573
a website indicated that it would be 
interpreted in within the policies that 

128
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,140
the Ontario Human Rights Commission is 
already established.

129
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,003
Of course there's close cross talk 
between Ontario and the federal 

130
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:28,220
government because the liberals are in 
power in both and the radical end of the

131
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:32,980
liberal party's in power in both 
situations and know it.

132
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,100
It turns out that it's illegal for like 
you're liable as an employer.

133
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:37,934
For example,
if any of your employees say anything 

134
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:44,120
that can be construed as harassment,
say on the grounds of sexual

135
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
or gender identity,
even if what they say has unintended 

136
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,350
consequences and even if you don't know 
that they said it.

137
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,243
And so that kind of legislation I just 
think is just absolutely reprehensible 

138
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,893
and then because it's designed to cast 
the broadest possible net to catch the 

139
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:04,064
most fish and it's clearly being 
implemented by people who are not 

140
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,060
precisely pro employer.
Let's put it that way.

141
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,223
And then there's another little ugly 
secret hidden underneath the policies 

142
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,174
and that's manifests most clearly in the
form of what's come to be known as the 

143
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,813
Gender Unicorn.
Which I would recommend that you look 

144
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:24,404
up,
which is an animated character designed 

145
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:31,940
to indoctrinate small children into the 
social constructionist worldview.

146
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:36,941
Which claims that biological sex,
gender identity,

147
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,144
gender expression,
and sexual proclivity very 

148
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:43,370
independently,
which they most certainly do,

149
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,800
not now.
And that's what I said in the video.

150
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,530
That's partly why I've been accused of 
say,

151
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,413
being a transphobic.
I also complained that the university 

152
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:55,710
was taking policy advice from the people
who started black lives matter.

153
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:58,470
And I don't have anything against black 
lives matter particularly,

154
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,910
but the two people who started it are,
are not,

155
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,130
uh,
uh,

156
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,143
this sorts of individuals,
let's say that the university should be 

157
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:05,904
basing its policy decisions that the 
advice they shouldn't be taking advice 

158
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:11,460
from those people with regards to their 
policy.

159
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,294
And apparently that makes me a racist.
So the first part of the argument about 

160
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,650
what happened with my videos was 
actually whether or not I was racist and

161
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,653
Trans phobic and all of that.
But the point that I was making the 

162
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,624
technical,
specific technical point was that the 

163
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:28,370
claim that,
uh,

164
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,660
those four phenomena very independently 
was just patently false.

165
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,080
And it is by any reasonable definition 
of false.

166
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,510
And I know that it's part of a much 
broader propaganda exercise as evidenced

167
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,280
by the Gender Unicorn,
for example,

168
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,281
which gets children to indicate on four 
sliders their sex assigned at birth,

169
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,290
their gender identity,
their gender expression,

170
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,730
and their sexual proclivity.

171
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,030
And you can look at the animation and,
or at the,

172
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,570
at the cartoon and decide for yourself 
by its graphic style,

173
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,810
what Ange people it's aimed at.
So,

174
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,143
um,
is this a bill to protect transexual 

175
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,930
rights?
Or is it a bill to further a postmodern,

176
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:15,030
Neo Marxist agenda?
Well,

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,370
God only knows,
but as far as I'm concerned,

178
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:22,371
having analyzed the context within which
this bill arose and within which it will

179
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,054
be interpreted,
I'm going to go for the furthering the 

180
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,550
postmodern Neil Marxist agenda until 
I'm.

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,533
Until that's thoroughly disproved.
I would also like to inform you that 

182
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,150
I've had plenty of letters from 
transgender people,

183
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,860
at least 30 and only one of them was 
critical of what I'm doing because they,

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,873
they claim and as happy as have many of 
the people I've talked to that the idea 

185
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:48,804
that a group of activists self can self 
nominate as the representatives of a 

186
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:55,734
given group and then speak for them as 
if they have a homogenous voice is 

187
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,900
absolutely absurd.

188
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,450
And it is.
It is completely ridiculous.

189
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,673
And most of the transsexual people that 
have been contacting me have said the 

190
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:09,324
same thing,
which is these people don't speak for 

191
00:11:11,101 --> 00:11:11,934
me.
I wish they'd shut up because they're 

192
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:18,441
doing a lot more harm than good and I 
don't buy what they're doing anyways.

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,340
So,
you know,

194
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:21,893
I think that the claim of the activist 
types to speak on behalf of the groups 

195
00:11:26,011 --> 00:11:28,560
that they purport to represent is weak 
at best.

196
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,560
And I don't know why we ever assumed 
that it,

197
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,733
it,
that their representation is valid 

198
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,600
except that we're afraid to criticize 
that particular presupposition.

199
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,411
You know?
I mean,

200
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:40,490
there's nothing more ridiculous than 
assuming that someone is.

201
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,560
Because someone is black that they speak
for black people.

202
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:44,760
I mean,
I think,

203
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,623
I can't think of anything that's more 
particularly indicative of a 

204
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:50,990
fundamentally racist attitude than that,
you know?

205
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
Well those people,
they're all the same.

206
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,801
It's like,
yeah,

207
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:54,760
well,
sorry,

208
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,770
it doesn't work out that way.
So I wanted to clarify all that so that,

209
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:02,680
you know,
you have a little bit clearer idea about

210
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:07,150
why I was doing what I was doing and 
people have asked so to speak,

211
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:09,790
why I chose to die on that particular 
hale.

212
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,740
And the answer is every,
every massive conflict of ideas,

213
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:17,530
let's say manifests itself in the 
minute.

214
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,230
And that's why it's often difficult to 
gain any headway because no matter where

215
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:25,090
you draw the line,
it's arbitrary.

216
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:27,760
And,
and subject to criticism and you know,

217
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:30,480
the fact that this happens to be about,
um,

218
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,200
gender neutral pronouns regarding 
transgender people to me is just more or

219
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,034
less an accident.
It would have been about almost any 

220
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:38,524
number of other things.
But I would also like to suggest that 

221
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,870
what should have happened with what I 
did was nothing.

222
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,273
I made some videos that are on board,
relatively obscure academic and I made 

223
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:50,854
some videos in my private time that were
pretty badly produced because they're 

224
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,383
just amateur and I was trying to 
straighten out my thinking about a 

225
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,134
couple of issues,
the anti unconscious bias training for 

226
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:02,254
example,
and also this legislative mess and 

227
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,023
obviously it struck a major chord and 
that to me is indication that my 

228
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:11,674
original supposition was correct and 
that there was far more going on under 

229
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:17,380
the surface than there was at the 
surface.

230
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:18,220
I mean,
you know,

231
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,443
like I said,
it's very difficult to pick the proper 

232
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,394
level of analysis,
but one of the ways you justify your 

233
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:25,264
choices by observing the impact of your 
choice of level of analysis and seeing 

234
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:29,734
if it's.
If the consequences are commensurate 

235
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,194
with your original hypothesis.
And I thought well just because people 

236
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:37,684
say they're doing one thing with a piece
of legislation doesn't mean that that's 

237
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:42,220
what they're doing.

238
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,400
And of course a lead piece of 
legislation is a hydra.

239
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,623
In any case.
It does all sorts of things that people 

240
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:48,994
don't intend it to do.
So that's a little background and I'll 

241
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,604
leave the background at that and then 
I'll talk to you now from a practical 

242
00:13:58,361 --> 00:14:02,890
perspective why I believe that the idea 
of freedom of speech is not just another

243
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:07,540
value among other values.
I would say that the simplest reason for

244
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:12,180
that is that speech isn't precisely a 
mechanism.

245
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,020
It,
it's a,

246
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,860
it's a process.
It's a,

247
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,270
it's a,
it's a,

248
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,570
it's a,
it's a generative process.

249
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,590
Speech free speech is the process by 
which all ideas are generated and I want

250
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:27,204
to make it clear why I believe that to 
be the case with speech specifically 

251
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:32,560
because you might say,
well no,

252
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,360
that's thought but,
but,

253
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,373
but I don't think that's right.
Because thing is that thought is a far 

254
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,610
more collective enterprise than people 
generally understand.

255
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,443
First of all,
most of the thoughts you have aren't 

256
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:46,900
your thoughts.
You know,

257
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:47,734
I don't remember who it was that said 
that everyone is the unconscious 

258
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:56,180
exponent of a dead philosopher.
But that's definitely the case.

259
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:57,014
You know,
are very linguistic mechanisms by which 

260
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:03,440
we formulate our,
our grip on the world,

261
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,690
our collective constructs.
And,

262
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,643
and in some cases almost entirely 
because creative thought is far rarer 

263
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:10,994
than people generally presume.
And what that means is that when we're 

264
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,910
speaking and when we're thinking we're 
usually using,

265
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,910
if not cliches,
which is very frequently the case,

266
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,744
as you know perfectly well if you've 
ever a graded a particularly bad 

267
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,154
undergraduate essay,
but even among more sophisticated 

268
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:28,424
people,
it's generally the case that they're 

269
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,140
acting as avatars of ideas that they did
not produce.

270
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,490
And so that doesn't mean they can't 
further the ideas,

271
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,810
but the point is,
is that,

272
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,353
you know,
we're born into a linguistically 

273
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,404
mediated culture and it's,
it's mediated at all of the multiple 

274
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:46,724
levels of analysis that I already 
described and were shaped in the way 

275
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:54,110
that we view the world with regards to 
the input that,

276
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,490
that,
that we received.

277
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,710
That's collective.
We learn language from other people.

278
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:58,544
We use the words that other people use,
we use the phrases that other people 

279
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,770
use.
It's an intensely collective exercise,

280
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:07,880
but even more specifically.
So that's from a general perspective,

281
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:10,610
let's say,
but even more specifically,

282
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,980
the problem with thinking is that you're
a very narrow channel,

283
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,790
right?
I mean,

284
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,623
there's a lot of world and there isn't 
very much of you and that means that 

285
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:21,134
there's a lot more that you filter out.
Then there is that you take in and 

286
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,600
you're filtering is very,
very intensive.

287
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,940
It's dependent to some degree on your 
embodiment.

288
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:29,774
It's dependent to some degree,
far more than people generally realize 

289
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,940
on your motivations and your and your 
temperament,

290
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,803
which is a topic we'll return to and 
then it's further narrowed by your 

291
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,594
position in society and by the people 
that you have around you and by your 

292
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:47,420
particular domain of expertise or lack 
thereof.

293
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:48,763
Um,
and then there are sets of darker 

294
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,944
motivations as well that blind you to 
certain things that you should be able 

295
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:59,321
to see but either don't or won't.
And so the problem with thinking is that

296
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,060
a,
you're a narrow channel B,

297
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,923
you're not very good at it and see your 
incredibly biased and there isn't much 

298
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,734
you can do about that except
listen and talk to other people because 

299
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,910
they're,
I mean,

300
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,460
they're not the only source of 
correction,

301
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,780
but there are pretty intense source of 
correction.

302
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:21,080
And I mean,
we're blasting corrective information at

303
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,280
each other all the time,
right?

304
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,620
I mean,
even in a situation like this,

305
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:27,320
which you could think of as a monologue 
but isn't.

306
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:30,200
It's a dialogue.
The reason I'm watching all of you is to

307
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,340
see,
you know,

308
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,130
are you paying attention?
And if not,

309
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:37,400
I better adjust what I'm saying.
Do your facial expressions,

310
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,743
uh,
indicate that you're understanding what 

311
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:41,720
I'm saying and following it.

312
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,640
Maybe you're nodding your,
your eyes are open,

313
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,440
you know,
in some specific way you're,

314
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,900
you're actually facing me.
Your eyes are on me.

315
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,943
I can read your facial expressions,
which is always why I'm looking at 

316
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:51,864
individuals in the audience.
And I'm constantly calibrating what I'm 

317
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,900
saying.
If it's a dynamic conversation to ensure

318
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,734
that the information flow is maximized.
And the reason I look at your eyes is 

319
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,880
because I can tell where they're 
pointing.

320
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:06,330
And the reason I look at your face is 
because you're broadcasting motivational

321
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,030
and emotional information nonstop at me.
Well,

322
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,570
I'm speaking.
And so even in a situation like this,

323
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,730
which like I said,
is more more analog than,

324
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,863
than otherwise.
There's a tremendous amount of 

325
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:22,080
corrective information continually 
flowing between speaker and listener,

326
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,600
and if that stops,
you know,

327
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,434
if,
if you hear a speaker who's detached 

328
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:27,840
from the audience,
often someone who's reading,

329
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:28,674
for example,
it's much more difficult to listen to 

330
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:30,894
them as everyone knows,
and that's because there's a deadness 

331
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,000
about reading something in front of an 
audience.

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,250
And I think the reason for that is that 
that living,

333
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,413
let's call it spirit,
isn't manifesting itself in the same 

334
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:42,714
manner as it is when,
when the speech is both spontaneous and 

335
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,933
self correcting.
And so the thing about free speech is 

336
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:52,770
that like I'm not a free speech 
advocate.

337
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:53,604
Let's say I'm a true speech advocate,
which is to say that I believe that 

338
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:00,450
people should say what they believe to 
be true.

339
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,540
I think that's.
That's your obligation.

340
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
It's also,
you're right,

341
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,903
but it comes with an obligation,
but I don't believe that true speech as 

342
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,564
possible without free speech because 
you're just not very good at thinking 

343
00:19:12,841 --> 00:19:13,674
and so you have to stumble around when 
you're first formulating ideas and 

344
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,610
wander into territory that's not 
necessarily productive and manifest your

345
00:19:20,611 --> 00:19:21,444
biases and in short you have to be a 
fool and the only way that you you 

346
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:28,080
improve upon that performances by well 
first of all,

347
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:30,300
stumbling through it to begin with and 
then second,

348
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,433
by observing carefully what sort of 
reactions you're getting and having a 

349
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,214
dialogue around it so that you can start
to sharpen up your ideas and improve 

350
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,910
their focus and find out where you've 
made a mistake and all of those things.

351
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,743
So a lot of what's necessary with 
regards to thinking is the freedom to 

352
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:47,034
make mistakes.
Because what are you going to do it 

353
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,970
right the first time?
I don't think so.

354
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,570
And you know,
that's why for Carl Young,

355
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:57,360
for example,
the fool was a mythological precursor to

356
00:19:57,361 --> 00:19:58,350
the,
to the hero,

357
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,720
the tricksters and mythological 
precursor to the hero.

358
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:03,600
Because unless you're willing to stumble
around badly to begin with,

359
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,873
I want to be a fool.
When you first start doing something 

360
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,850
which is always the case.
When you're learning something new,

361
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,090
then you're not gonna make any progress,
and so practically speaking,

362
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,250
free speech has to be as untrammeled as 
possible so that people can be wrong and

363
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,950
they can be biased and they can still 
express their opinions,

364
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:20,784
including their darker ones,
and then allow themselves to be subject 

365
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,393
partly to improvement by the world 
because if you say things that are too 

366
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,100
stupid and then act the mouth,
the world smacks you a good one.

367
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,340
But there's also the social 
intermediaries,

368
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,174
the other people that you're 
communicating with who will also do the 

369
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:39,280
same thing.
You know,

370
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,690
and we're always broadcasting 
information at each other.

371
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,180
Constantly trying to shake each other's 
behavior.

372
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:46,014
And what we're trying to do is to bring 
forth from other people that which we 

373
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:55,360
would like to see them manifest.
And so there's an implicit ideal as well

374
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:57,730
that people are broadcasting in each 
other all the time.

375
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,570
And there's tremendous social pressure 
generally speaking,

376
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,643
to manifest that implicit ideal as 
closely as possible because otherwise 

377
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:06,604
people disapprove of viewer lack 
interest in what you're saying or 

378
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,790
criticize you or and so on.
And you have to be allowed to be exposed

379
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:18,310
to that kind of corrective feedback 
because otherwise you drift and,

380
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,660
and you'll become subject to your own 
idiosyncratic insanity.

381
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:23,421
And I mean,
I,

382
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:26,170
I've seen that very many times in my 
clinical practice because,

383
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,041
well,
first of all,

384
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,460
I have some isolated people that come to
see me and all they do is talk.

385
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,833
I just listen.
I mean because they don't have anyone 

386
00:21:33,941 --> 00:21:37,810
else around and they need someone to run
their narrative by,

387
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,140
to keep their minds organized.
They can't do it themselves.

388
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,340
And they can't do it without listening 
to themselves talk even because for most

389
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:47,770
people talking is how they think.
And,

390
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,080
and talking socially is even more how 
they think.

391
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:50,914
And I mean that literally.
I don't mean that metaphorically is 

392
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:53,614
that.
And I think that's true for almost 

393
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:55,830
everyone.
You know,

394
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,550
I mean there are people who are trained 
academically who can actually think.

395
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:04,120
But to think you have to divide yourself
into sub personalities,

396
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:07,390
I suppose,
each of which has a differing opinion,

397
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,283
uh,
well elucidated differing opinion and 

398
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:10,894
then you have to let those different 
elements of your personality have an 

399
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,700
internal dialogue and you have to draw 
conclusions from that.

400
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,160
It's very,
very difficult for people to do that and

401
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,040
we radically overestimate the degree to 
which they do.

402
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,483
I'm young said at one point that people 
don't think so much as thoughts appear 

403
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,574
in their head and they believe that the,
which I think is a much more accurate 

404
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:31,384
way of describing the,
the general because true thought is not 

405
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,270
only that the thoughts arise in your 
mind,

406
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,270
it's that you look at the thought and 
then you critique it,

407
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,153
right?
You have to separate yourself from the 

408
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,710
thought and decide whether or not it's,
it's,

409
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,450
it's valuable.
Now that's more like an editing function

410
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:47,284
and you know,
it takes a long time to be a good 

411
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:49,354
editor,
a tremendous amount of time and it just 

412
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:55,180
doesn't happen generally speaking so 
well.

413
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,280
So I would say,
well without free speech there's no true

414
00:22:58,281 --> 00:22:59,560
thought.
And then you might say,

415
00:22:59,561 --> 00:23:00,394
well,
who the hell cares whether or not we 

416
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:04,810
think?
And I think the answer to that is fairly

417
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,653
straightforward,
mean you might think it's so obvious 

418
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:07,954
that it doesn't need explanation,
but there are very few things that are 

419
00:23:10,091 --> 00:23:12,070
so obvious they don't need explanation.

420
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,263
So the reason you think is so that the 
world doesn't smack you as hard as it 

421
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,560
might fundamentally,
you know,

422
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:19,394
and,
and I really mean this technically 

423
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,880
because the way that people evolved the 
capacity to thought for thought was that

424
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,730
the prefrontal cortex which mediates a 
lot of,

425
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,940
of,
of voluntary linguistic ability actually

426
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:34,600
emerged over the course of evolutionary 
history out of the motor cortex.

427
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:38,140
And so that's a very interesting thing 
to understand because it means that,

428
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,960
you know,
animals basically think by moving.

429
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,213
And the problem with that is if you 
think by moving and you make the wrong 

430
00:23:44,321 --> 00:23:47,540
move than your.
Whereas what human beings can do is they

431
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,374
can generate fictional avatars of 
themselves in fictional worlds and they 

432
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,450
can run the avatars as simulations and 
the ones that get killed,

433
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:59,090
they don't express in behavior.
And I mean,

434
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,983
you could do that with words too,
although people you know originally 

435
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:03,650
would have done it mostly with images.

436
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,090
They do the same thing with drama.
And so the reason that you think,

437
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,953
and I think it was George,
was it Alfred North Whitehead that said 

438
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,101
this,
I think,

439
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:13,934
but I'm not absolutely sure.
The reason you think is so that your 

440
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,310
thoughts can die instead of you.
And that's a brilliant,

441
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,233
brilliant,
brilliant phrase and absolutely the 

442
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:25,340
case.
So if you think properly,

443
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,270
then you kill off.
The idea is that if you act it out would

444
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:30,104
kill you or at least cause you suffering
or perhaps caused suffering to the 

445
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:37,010
people around you.
And since it's more or less obvious,

446
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:37,844
a priority,
that suffering is worse than not 

447
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,510
suffering.
Under most circumstances.

448
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,010
It seems reasonable to act in a manner 
that will minimize it to the degree that

449
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:46,844
that's possible.
And so you need clarity of thought 

450
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,260
because that helps guide you through a 
world that's in shrouded in fog and full

451
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,400
of sharp objects.

452
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,570
And if you don't want to stumble into 
them and impale yourself,

453
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,650
then you should have sharp vision and 
sharp capacity to communicate.

454
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,930
You know?
That's one of the things I tell students

455
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,764
when I'm trying to teach them to write 
because they no one ever tells them why 

456
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:09,704
they should learn to write.
It's like you learn to write so you can 

457
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:15,830
think and you learn to think so that the
world doesn't treat you any more harshly

458
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:18,770
than it absolutely has to.
And that's no joke.

459
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,000
You know?
And if you,

460
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,830
if you're a person who's been around a 
bit,

461
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:26,000
you see very rapidly that people who 
sharpen their arguments properly and can

462
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,600
articulate their position and defend it 
are always,

463
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,643
always the people who are most 
successful and most compelling and that 

464
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,260
and that changed the way structures 
function.

465
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,103
And that also helped things continue in 
the proper path when they're running 

466
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:41,510
down the proper path.

467
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,343
It's no joke to be articulate and to be 
able to think there isn't anything 

468
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:46,934
that's more powerful than that.
And that's a good segue into the second 

469
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,660
or the third part of what I wanted to 
talk to you about.

470
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,380
See
since I made those videos,

471
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,940
I've become,
I guess the word is popular on.

472
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,440
Yeah,
well in many ways,

473
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,530
by about November,
by the end of November last year,

474
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:10,364
there were more than 200 newspaper 
articles about the consequences of the 

475
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:14,984
videos that I've produced.
And those were like in press printed 

476
00:26:18,051 --> 00:26:18,884
articles.
I'm not talking about anything that 

477
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:23,840
happened on Youtube.
And Youtube is a very strange phenomena.

478
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,630
Let me tell you,
it's a far more powerful than you think.

479
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,580
So just as an aside,
I was on a program last week hosted by a

480
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:32,414
guy named Joe Rogan.
I don't know how many of you know who 

481
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:36,650
joe Rogan.
Joe Rogan gets one point,

482
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:39,470
2 billion downloads of his podcast a 
year.

483
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,220
You just think about that,
like that's absolutely unparalleled.

484
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,483
And everybody under 30 years getting 
their news from either facebook or from 

485
00:26:47,311 --> 00:26:49,650
Youtube and the whole conventional media
sources,

486
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,440
they're dead is there are so dead,
you can hardly believe it.

487
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,813
So Youtube,
and one of the reasons I'm bringing it 

488
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:56,904
up is because youtube is the first 
platform that's produced for people the 

489
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,244
capacity to make the spoken word as far 
reaching and permanent as the written 

490
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,130
word.
Right?

491
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,580
That's a complete cultural revolution.
It's the first time it's ever happened.

492
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:13,470
I mean,
it wouldn't have to be youtube,

493
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:16,770
it just turns out that that's the 
platform that got there first,

494
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,100
but it's a big deal.
And anyways,

495
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:23,760
um,
the,

496
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,490
the reason that,
that,

497
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,380
that my,
that I became popular,

498
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,214
I think was partly because of the,
of the political philosophical videos 

499
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:33,864
that I made.
But then when people came to my website 

500
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:36,804
to watch them,
they stayed generally speaking to watch 

501
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:43,500
the lectures that I had been posting on 
there since 2013.

502
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,993
And,
uh,

503
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,070
those were derived from work I did on a 
book called maps of meaning,

504
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,143
which I published in 1999.
And see what I was trying to do with 

505
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:57,720
that book was to sort something out that
was very complex.

506
00:27:57,721 --> 00:28:02,580
And that was when I was growing up in 
the Cold War was raging.

507
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,753
I couldn't understand precisely why we 
had divided into two armed camps around 

508
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:09,894
our respective ideological positions,
either why those ideological positions 

509
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:14,514
were so important that people would risk
the destruction of the world to protect 

510
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:18,774
them,
let's say,

511
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,063
or why it was those two particular 
ideologies or whether or not this was 

512
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,920
just a difference of opinion.
Right?

513
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,783
Which would be.
That would be a more postmodern view is 

514
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,350
there's multiple ways that you can 
organize societies in the west.

515
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,270
We happened to organize our society one 
way,

516
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,960
but that's one of a plethora of 
potential ways of organizing society and

517
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,940
let's say the Communists had decided to 
organize their society and other way and

518
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,610
human beings are infinitely malleable 
and so you know,

519
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:45,444
the social structures that we occupy are
arbitrary in some sense and matter of 

520
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:50,904
opinion and maybe collective opinion,
but nonetheless still a matter of 

521
00:28:53,611 --> 00:28:54,444
opinion.

522
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,650
And I thought,
well,

523
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,484
is it the case that the values that we 
hold to be true in the West are merely 

524
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:05,040
based upon opinion?
And so I started to investigate that and

525
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,240
and the conclusion that I came to as a 
consequence of hitting the question from

526
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:12,294
multiple different perspectives was that
that was not a reasonable way of 

527
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:16,860
formulating,
of,

528
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,960
of,
of interpreting the evidence.

529
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:23,961
And so I looked at neuroscience evidence
from neuropsychology and neuroscience,

530
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,420
mostly mostly
based,

531
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:31,950
at least in part on the work of someone 
named Jeffrey Gray.

532
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,710
It was a very good psychologist,
very interested in anxiety.

533
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,310
I looked at general behavioral 
psychology,

534
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,353
looked at literature,
and I looked at mythology and I could 

535
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,730
see a pattern emerging across all of 
those,

536
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,713
which I think is a nice way of 
determining whether or not something 

537
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,144
exists.
Like it's one thing to see a pattern in 

538
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,214
one set of data,
but if you can see the same pattern and 

539
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,980
another set that's quite historically 
distinct from the first and then see the

540
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:59,440
same pattern in another set and another 
set,

541
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,663
then the probability that that's a 
spurious pattern starts to decrease 

542
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,534
quite radically.
And so I don't think the pattern was 

543
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,713
spurious.
And so I'm going to tell you what I 

544
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,090
think I.

545
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,673
What would you say extracted?
This is very complicated and makes a 

546
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:23,810
difficult transition in the talk,
so I'm going to read something first.

547
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,700
This is from the,
from the gospel of John.

548
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,030
It's one of the most famous lines in the
Bible.

549
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,520
In the beginning was the word and the 
word was with God and the word was God.

550
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,350
It's very strange idea because from a 
cosmological perspective,

551
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:44,184
because it pauses that there's something
I'm conscious or cognitive about the 

552
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:49,644
origin,
that there's a necessary cognitive 

553
00:30:52,021 --> 00:30:57,021
element to the origin and I think about 
that essentially as something associated

554
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:00,720
with consciousness and of course we 
don't really understand the relationship

555
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:01,554
between consciousness and being.
We don't understand consciousness at 

556
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:07,170
all,
but it seems integrally associated,

557
00:31:07,171 --> 00:31:08,004
at least with our individual beings 
because one of the things that we seem 

558
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:11,634
to not doubt is that we are in fact 
conscious and that so are other people 

559
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:17,010
and if I treat someone as if they're not
conscious,

560
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:18,990
while they tend not to be very happy 
about that.

561
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,190
So it will certainly object to it.
So despite what we might say,

562
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:24,024
we believe,
we certainly act as if we regard all 

563
00:31:26,131 --> 00:31:26,964
other human beings as conscious.
And and the consciousness is a 

564
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,190
prerequisite for their,
for the existence of their experience.

565
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,330
So
anyways,

566
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:44,331
so that there's this emphasis in this 
book that is at the root of our culture,

567
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,973
that there's something about verbal 
communication in particular that has to 

568
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:52,254
be regarded as foundational.
And I think that's actually to some 

569
00:31:55,111 --> 00:31:55,944
degree in keeping with the postmodernist
claims that everything is a language 

570
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:00,750
game.
Let's say that everything is constructed

571
00:32:00,751 --> 00:32:01,471
by language.
Now,

572
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:04,290
I don't believe that everything is 
constructed by language,

573
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:09,600
but I'm just pointing that out because 
you can take this particular perspective

574
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:13,410
and you can look at it from a variety of
different intellectual sources and still

575
00:32:13,411 --> 00:32:16,650
derive an analog of the,
of the claim from it.

576
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,210
So
and then our so that,

577
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,233
that was so.
So I want you to keep that in the back 

578
00:32:23,011 --> 00:32:24,210
of your mind for a moment.
Now,

579
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,900
that idea that,
that the word was there at the beginning

580
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:28,411
of creation,
that's a very,

581
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:29,420
very old idea.
It's,

582
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,460
it's older than the Judeo Christian.
A context from which I extracted it.

583
00:32:34,861 --> 00:32:37,790
So for example,
in Egypt there was a god named Patah who

584
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,640
was a major.
God,

585
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:39,474
I may be that wrong,
but as far as the Egyptians were 

586
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:42,674
concerned,
he was the original creator and he 

587
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,044
created as a consequence of thinking,
but more specifically as a consequence 

588
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:49,370
of speaking.
So again,

589
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:53,270
there was this idea that there was this 
primacy of speaking as a,

590
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,193
as a force that brings being into 
existence and then you see the same 

591
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,470
thing in the Mesopotamian context to 
their creation.

592
00:33:00,471 --> 00:33:01,304
Myth was called the Enuma elish and 
there's a god in that story and that 

593
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:07,334
story apparently is one of the places 
from which the creation story in the in 

594
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:11,534
the Bible was extracted that God is 
named Martin and Martin is a god that 

595
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:20,480
fights chaos and creates the world out 
of the consequences.

596
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,613
And He.
He has a variety of different 

597
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:23,624
attributes.
One of which is head is ringed with 

598
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,930
eyes.
So we can see in all directions.

599
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:27,764
So there's very much emphasis among the 
Mesopotamians on the primacy of 

600
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,300
attention,
let's say.

601
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,283
But he can also speak magic words and 
it's the fact that he's equipped with 

602
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,244
this massive capacity for attention and 
the ability to speak magic words that 

603
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:43,220
enables him to go and fight the dragon 
of chaos,

604
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:46,130
roughly speaking into cutter into pieces
and make up the world.

605
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,200
One of [inaudible] names,
for example,

606
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,034
is he who makes ingenious things out of 
the combat with ty Matt and time at is 

607
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:58,541
this got primordial goddess of chaos 
that represents the sort of the formless

608
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,140
prodo matter of things from which 
consciousness extract structure.

609
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,730
That's one way of thinking about it.
So that idea is quite widespread.

610
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,260
It's a very,
in fact,

611
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:10,094
it's an idea that informs mythological 
structures everywhere as far as I can 

612
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:13,610
tell.

613
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,610
There's this idea that there's a dynamic
between what you know and what you don't

614
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,924
know.
You can think about those as different 

615
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,200
domains of reality,
what you know and what you don't know,

616
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:27,950
and the thing that mediates between what
you know and what you don't know is this

617
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:31,430
thing that has the attribute of have 
spoken wisdom.

618
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:33,380
It's something like that.
And here's,

619
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,450
here's a way that's a very complicated 
idea.

620
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,284
It's very difficult to understand.
It's extraordinarily difficult to 

621
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,040
understand,
but the,

622
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,630
I can give you some sense of it.
It's a phenomenal logical idea.

623
00:34:44,631 --> 00:34:46,910
I suppose.
Imagine that you are,

624
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,250
that um,
I don't know.

625
00:34:49,251 --> 00:34:51,150
Maybe you have it.
Yeah.

626
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,890
Yeah.
Maybe you're a medical student,

627
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:54,560
a medical premed students,
right?

628
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,394
Do you want to go to medical school?
And so you're easily beating away on 

629
00:34:58,311 --> 00:34:59,460
your,
on your courses.

630
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,620
You're doing all right.
You know,

631
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,730
then you go take them cat and you score 
it the say 20th percentile,

632
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,850
which of course 20 percent of people do.

633
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,170
And that will come as quite a shock to 
you,

634
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,093
no doubt,
because you go in there in the world 

635
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:18,860
that you understand and in that world,
your competence,

636
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:19,723
let's say to become a medical doctor and
when you open the envelope and you look 

637
00:35:23,781 --> 00:35:24,614
at the number then,
well then your world crumbles and 

638
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,124
collapses and collapses into,
I would say is equivalent to this 

639
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:35,700
formless chaos that the ancients 
believed was the ground of being.

640
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:38,400
And it's this place where reigns,
right?

641
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,473
In fact,
the word for the chaos that God orders 

642
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:42,534
with the word at the beginning of 
genesis is often translated as chaos or 

643
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:48,600
confusion now and you think,
well,

644
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,673
you've formulated a world that you 
inhabit with a particular linguistic 

645
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,360
rational,
logical structure.

646
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,373
It's predicated on certain axioms of 
belief like that you're competent to be 

647
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:04,070
a medical doctor and then you receive a 
piece of information that makes not only

648
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:09,480
your present understanding of yourself,
no longer relevant or correct,

649
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:10,314
but also your past understanding of 
yourself and also your future who've 

650
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,510
gone right or gone were gone into what 
well gone into chaos roughly speaking,

651
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:25,800
and then you're in very rough shape as a
consequence of that,

652
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,873
and if you do manage to lever yourself 
out of that chaotic condition that you 

653
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:30,843
now find yourself in,
you're going to essentially do it with 

654
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,770
thought and dialogue,
right?

655
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
Because you're going to talk to people,
what did I do wrong?

656
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,823
What's wrong with the way I thought?
How could I have been so misled by what 

657
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,780
I believe?
What should I do now?

658
00:36:42,781 --> 00:36:43,614
Who actually am I?
All of that is a way of reconstructing 

659
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,320
yourself from the ashes,
so to speak.

660
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,630
I would say that,
and you do that with,

661
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,650
with,
with,

662
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,483
with speech,
and you do that with true speech and so 

663
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,480
true speeches,
what,

664
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,850
what redeemed you from the chaos of 
unstructured being and so,

665
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,743
so then that.
That's another thing to think about for 

666
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:09,750
a moment and then I'm going to bring up 
this final piece and

667
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:16,670
we can think about it too.
So

668
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,440
I've been trying to figure out how these
ideas came to be because they came to be

669
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:31,770
over a very long period of time.
So the God Marduk for example,

670
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,143
he was assembled,
you could say as the empires of the 

671
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,853
ancient Middle East,
as the tribal people of the ancient 

672
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,183
Middle East came together and they each 
had their own daddies that represented 

673
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:45,084
their highest values and when they came 
together those deities had to be 

674
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:47,994
amalgamated and so try bay has its 
highest value and try B has its highest 

675
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,604
value in their embodied.
That's the day of the element and they 

676
00:37:55,741 --> 00:37:56,574
come together and then the day at east 
in some sense have to have a war to 

677
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:04,371
figure out who's the top God and so if 
you assemble a few hundred tribes out of

678
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:08,270
that comes a conceptualization of the 
top God that was Marduk,

679
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,113
for example in Mesopotamia,
and he usually absorbs the names of all 

680
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:16,560
the previous gods as he sort of emerged 
as the king of a hierarchy.

681
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,310
And so so you think about this.
If you think about the expression of the

682
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:24,120
daddy as the projection of the highest 
ideal of the tribe,

683
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,443
and that's something that's been worked 
out over perhaps millennia and 

684
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:29,214
especially with people who have an oral 
tradition and then you bring those 

685
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:32,034
different tribes together.
What happens is the highest ideals in 

686
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:38,260
their embodied form have what you could 
think of metaphorically as a war,

687
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:40,150
and the war of God's in heaven,
by the way,

688
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,780
is a very ancient and widespread 
mythological motif.

689
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,830
And out of that war arises what you 
might describe as a matter of value.

690
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,320
And so the metta value would be the 
highest value among a set of values.

691
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,670
And the question would be,
what,

692
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,070
what would that value be?
What would that highest fail you be?

693
00:38:57,071 --> 00:38:57,904
Is there something about it that's,
that's recognizable and say somewhat 

694
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:01,504
constant so that if you took 100 tribes 
here and amalgamated their ideals and 

695
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:07,420
you took 100 tribes here at amalgamated,
their ideals,

696
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,493
if the two sets of amalgamations would 
have a structural similarity to one 

697
00:39:11,561 --> 00:39:12,310
another.

698
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,680
And as far as I can tell the answer to 
that is yes.

699
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,723
And it's a logical answer because you'd 
expect structural similarity if you 

700
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,400
extract out a common,
um,

701
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,340
a common element from a very large 
number of constituent representatives.

702
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,000
So for example,
if you take a,

703
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,390
a large number of female faces and 
average them.

704
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,340
So I'm not talking about the average 
face,

705
00:39:33,341 --> 00:39:36,820
I'm talking about the averaged face.
It's not the same thing.

706
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,060
The averaged female face is attractive 
and so is the average male face.

707
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,533
And so because it kind of constitutes 
the central human form and if you take 

708
00:39:46,481 --> 00:39:51,481
64 women and you extract out an average 
face and you take another 64,

709
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,420
you get the same face,
well maybe it takes more than 64,

710
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:57,460
but you get the point.
And so.

711
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,380
Well,
so I was,

712
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,350
I was thinking about how that process 
came to be.

713
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,283
I decided to look at it,
even like to go back farther in time to 

714
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:13,861
try to understand how it is that we 
formulated our values per se.

715
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,850
And especially given that at some point 
we weren't linguistic creatures at all.

716
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:19,684
Right?
We separated from the common ancestors 

717
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:24,600
between us and chimpanzees about 6 
million years ago.

718
00:40:24,601 --> 00:40:29,110
And sometime during that 6 million year 
process we started to be able to imitate

719
00:40:29,111 --> 00:40:33,730
ourselves first and then represent 
ourselves in image and action.

720
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,280
And then only after that to start to 
articulate ourselves.

721
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,300
And so a lot of the knowledge that we 
have is grounded in our embodiment,

722
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,233
but also in the shaping of that 
embodiment across extraordinary long 

723
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:51,160
periods of time.
So like there's an implicit way of being

724
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,580
in your form,
in your embodied form,

725
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,423
but more importantly,
there's an implicit way of being that's 

726
00:40:56,891 --> 00:40:57,724
a consequence of the fact that we've 
existed within hierarchical social 

727
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:07,561
structures for far longer than we were 
even sharing a common ancestors say with

728
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,070
great apes.

729
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,903
So that's for maybe hundreds of millions
of years with regards to being embedded 

730
00:41:13,451 --> 00:41:17,050
in a hierarchy.
So then the question is something like,

731
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,843
well,
for embedded in a hierarchy and we have 

732
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:23,590
been forever,
that's about $350 million years,

733
00:41:23,591 --> 00:41:24,424
by the way,
is there a set of attributes that tends 

734
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:30,250
reliably to move you up the hierarchy?
Because if there is,

735
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,103
you see being going up the hierarchy 
increases the probability of 

736
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:34,964
reproductive success.
So there's actually nothing more 

737
00:41:37,401 --> 00:41:38,234
important to determine over the course 
of $350 million years inside a 

738
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,080
hierarchy.
Then how it is that you ratchet yourself

739
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:45,914
up the hierarchy reliably and you could 
think about that in some sense as the 

740
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,384
source of ideals here.
Here's a kind of a concrete way of 

741
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:55,350
thinking about that.
You know,

742
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,580
if you get 100 men together,
they're going to,

743
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,630
they're going to organize themselves 
into a hierarchical structure.

744
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,600
They have to or they're gonna stay 
chaotic and fight that.

745
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,510
That's the other alternative and so,
but the the way that that,

746
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,890
that the people who are going to rise to
the top,

747
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:17,210
they might rise to the top because of 
their sheer physical prowess and power,

748
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,403
but they also might rise to the top 
because they're very competent at 

749
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:21,494
certain things and it's as if all the 
men are going to get together and vote 

750
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,573
and maybe that would actually happen to 
determine who best embodies the spirit 

751
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:30,614
of the group and who should be granted 
leadership and in an evolutionary 

752
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:33,860
context,
by the way,

753
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:34,694
that would also help ensure that that 
person would propagate their genes into 

754
00:42:38,331 --> 00:42:41,150
the next generation and it's not a 
trivial effect,

755
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,343
especially among men.
It's a big effect because roughly 

756
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,560
speaking half half of all manner or not 
reproductively successful,

757
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:50,750
so there's a wicked.
There's a wicked,

758
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,270
a calling,
let's say among men.

759
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,973
Well,
you can see this among chimpanzees as 

760
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:56,660
well.

761
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,493
They have dominance hierarchies.
Some sort of chimps rise to the top and 

762
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:01,491
you might think,
well,

763
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,550
that's the like caveman chimp who's best
at pounding out all the,

764
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,310
all the rivals,
but it turns out that that's not exactly

765
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:11,420
the case in France to wall has done a 
very good job of detailing this with his

766
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:16,421
work on chimpanzees in particular and 
he's found that the power hungry tyrants

767
00:43:16,551 --> 00:43:17,384
sort of chimp can rule for awhile,
but he tends to have a very unstable 

768
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:21,944
kingdom and the reason for that is is 
he's not very good at mutually grooming 

769
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,383
is not good at socially connecting with 
other males and he isn't popular among 

770
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:33,770
the females and doesn't attend to the to
the young essentially.

771
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,350
And so what happens is even if he's like
the meanest,

772
00:43:36,351 --> 00:43:39,830
toughest guy on the block to subordinate
chimps,

773
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:41,570
team up,
they make friends.

774
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,523
They groom each other and they have each
other's backs and in a one day he's 

775
00:43:44,931 --> 00:43:45,764
having an off day because he ate too 
many fermented bananas the night before 

776
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,094
and like they just tear them into pieces
and chimps are unbelievably strong and 

777
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,320
unbelievably brutal.

778
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:55,483
They seem to have absolutely no internal
regulation whatsoever of the regression 

779
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:03,710
that all seems to be manifested outside 
in terms of dominance,

780
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,553
hierarchy control,
and we know that because they go on 

781
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:07,034
raiding parties into other chimp 
territories and when they find chimps 

782
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:13,280
that aren't part of their hierarchy,
they just rip them into pieces.

783
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,533
And so that's a scary thing if you think
about our similarity with chimpanzees 

784
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:21,080
because we like to think we have 
internal controls over our aggression,

785
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,750
but it's not so bloody obvious I can 
tell you that.

786
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,170
Anyways.
What duwall found was that it's actually

787
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:28,990
chimps that are more,
um,

788
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,490
you might say humane,
although Champaign,

789
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,350
I don't know what the equivalent it is,
let's say humane that managed to produce

790
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,760
hierarchies that are more stable and 
actually managed to stay alive on top of

791
00:44:41,761 --> 00:44:42,594
them for much longer periods of time.
And he thinks about that as the 

792
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:47,730
emergence of an implicit morality,
right?

793
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,370
So morality that's acted out.
So then you think,

794
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:51,140
well,
there,

795
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,580
there are different ways of climbing up 
a hierarchy.

796
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,450
There are worse and better ways.
The better ways allow you to live longer

797
00:44:57,451 --> 00:45:00,960
in a more stable hierarchy and the 
evolutionary payoff for that is that you

798
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,794
leave more,
more descendants and so the hierarchy 

799
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:09,930
itself becomes a very powerful shaping 
mechanism that determines how it is that

800
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:13,650
people are going to adapt because it's 
the primary method of selection,

801
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,813
so there's an ethic in there.
There's an ethic that emerges from the 

802
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:17,964
social interactions,
but that's rapidly transformed into a 

803
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:20,994
biological selection device and so were 
selected and that's especially true 

804
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:30,111
among human beings because with chimps,
the females are indiscriminant maters,

805
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:36,180
which is to say that a female champion 
heat will meet with any mail chimp.

806
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:37,733
Now,
this dominant males chase the 

807
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:40,494
subordinate males away,
so there's still more likely to leave 

808
00:45:42,421 --> 00:45:45,360
offspring than the subordinates,
but it's not because of the females,

809
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,130
but human females are different.

810
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,110
Human females exert choice and quite 
brutal choice.

811
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:52,944
You might put it that way.
They're very choosy and it's one of the 

812
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:55,884
things that seems to have distinguished 
us from chimpanzees and what roughly 

813
00:45:58,981 --> 00:45:59,814
seems to happen is that the male 
dominance hierarchy elects men to the 

814
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:07,800
higher say rungs of the hierarchy.
And then the females peel from the top,

815
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:12,240
and so that means that what you can say 
is that human beings are the consequence

816
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,820
of intense male dominance,
competition.

817
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,450
It's not necessarily dominance,
but it's competition for the upper rungs

818
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:21,240
of the hierarchy mediated by female 
selection.

819
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,240
And so that's produced as far as I can 
tell,

820
00:46:24,241 --> 00:46:27,300
a powerful,
a powerful pattern of behavior.

821
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,850
Now the question is,
what's that pattern of behavior?

822
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,950
I would say,
well,

823
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,140
it's encapsulated in mythology in two 
forms and the question is,

824
00:46:37,141 --> 00:46:38,310
well,
who should lead?

825
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:39,570
Let's say that's the question.

826
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:41,580
Who should lead?
That is the question,

827
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,990
who should be sovereign or maybe when it
becomes abstracted,

828
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:46,824
what should be sovereign?
Because the first question from an 

829
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:52,260
evolutionary perspective is who should 
be sovereign?

830
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:57,480
But once you could abstract,
then the principle of sovereignty can be

831
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,314
detached from the leader and become a 
principal all on its own and that might 

832
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:06,730
be first expressed in mythological or 
images stick form dramatic form like the

833
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,900
the good guys versus the bad guys are 
good versus evil.

834
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:10,734
We could say it like that,
but obviously it's embodied and acted 

835
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:14,454
out far before it's extracted.
And turned into an abstract 

836
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:19,740
representation.
What would seems to have happened is,

837
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,730
so one of the common themes,
for example in mythology,

838
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,250
is what's roughly been described as a 
hero myth.

839
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:29,790
And a hero myth involves someone who's 
part of a,

840
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:30,873
uh,
demolished community community under 

841
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:33,400
threat.

842
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,670
The threat's usually signified by 
something vaguely like a dragon,

843
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,370
and the dragon comes out,
it's eternal.

844
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,204
It comes out to attack the village.
The hero comes out and confronts the 

845
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,730
Dragon and then freeze the virgin,
for example,

846
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:47,830
or gets the gold.
And to me,

847
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:48,850
that's a very,
very well.

848
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:51,790
That is a very old story.
It's in the Enuma elish for example.

849
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,030
It's the story at the basis of very 
many,

850
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,410
what would you call it?
Widely dispersed myths around the world.

851
00:47:59,411 --> 00:48:00,330
The Dragon,
for example,

852
00:48:00,331 --> 00:48:01,164
is a very common symbol.
And I think the reason for that is it's 

853
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,353
so complicated,
but I think the reason for that is 

854
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:10,501
something like this is that human beings
learned to understand over time that the

855
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:16,330
most reliable leader was the person who 
could step outside the structure when it

856
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:17,164
was damaged to confront something that 
was chaotic and dangerous in whatever 

857
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,244
form that might be,
and then to bring something valuable 

858
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:23,944
back as a consequence,
and you see that principle being 

859
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,094
elevated continually and mythological 
stories like the Enuma elish for 

860
00:48:29,651 --> 00:48:30,484
example,
where the main hero Marduk is elevated 

861
00:48:32,531 --> 00:48:33,364
among the other gods and is 
characterized by this intense capacity 

862
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:36,964
for vision which the Greek which the 
Egyptians also worshiped in the form of 

863
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:45,090
horace and this capacity to speak which 
has this ability to,

864
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,890
to,
to formulate and reshape the world.

865
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,450
Well,
that's the thing is that it's as if what

866
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:55,040
we've discovered as a species in some 
senses,

867
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,893
that there's the the person that should 
lead the thing that should be sovereign 

868
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,680
is the thing that can step outside the 
structured order,

869
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:07,023
incorporate something new and dangerous,
and then produce something valuable out 

870
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,600
of it.
That's one phase.

871
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,690
Another phase is another hero myth is 
the person who who,

872
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:17,643
who criticizes the power elite when it 
becomes corrupt and points out the 

873
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:22,864
corruption and then restructures the 
society that happens in the prophetic 

874
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,320
books,
for example,

875
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:27,154
continually in the Old Testament because
you could think that the historical 

876
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:34,150
enemies of humanity are twofold in some 
sense.

877
00:49:34,151 --> 00:49:38,580
One is the chaos that comes from outside
and that disrupts the standard order and

878
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:39,414
that needs to be dealt with and the 
other is the chaos that comes in the 

879
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:46,000
inside when when our institutions and 
hierarchies become corrupt,

880
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,223
and then the thing that transforms that 
is the thing that has enough courage 

881
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:51,244
either to stand up against the chaos or 
to say something about the corrupt 

882
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,000
institutions and what's happened as far 
as I can tell is that over time,

883
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,033
those principles have been extracted out
from this much more embodied domain and 

884
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:07,480
raise to the principle of highest 
sovereignty.

885
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,790
Now,
one of the things that happened in Egypt

886
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,770
with called the dimock democratization 
of Osiris and horus.

887
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,773
What seems to happen,
and this is this is what happened in 

888
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:22,174
Egypt,
is that the power to manifest that 

889
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:25,894
sovereignty.
I'd say is first only regarded as an 

890
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:30,824
attribute of the sovereign like and the 
king is actually only king in so far as 

891
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:37,370
he could manifest that.
So in Mesopotamia,

892
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,500
you're only emperor.
If you were a good Marduk,

893
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,000
you'd go out on New Year's day and 
reenact the entire cosmogony and you had

894
00:50:44,001 --> 00:50:44,834
to be a good representative of Martech.
Otherwise you didn't deserve your 

895
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:51,080
sovereignty and in Egypt,
unless you were a good Avatar,

896
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:53,630
let's say of Horus and Osiris,
the combination,

897
00:50:53,631 --> 00:50:57,620
then you didn't get to be feral,
so you are embodying this principle,

898
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,454
this principle of sovereignty,
and what happened in Egypt was that 

899
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,010
first of all,
the principle of sovereignty,

900
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:04,844
the images of sovereignty could only be 
used by the Pharaoh and then it became 

901
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:11,210
the aristocracy and then what seemed to 
happen after that.

902
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,880
They were using the symbols.
What seemed to happen after that,

903
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:19,130
this was maybe a transmutation and part 
via the Greeks and impart via the Jews,

904
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:19,964
is that the idea that that sovereignty 
that was inherent in the Pharaoh and 

905
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:25,784
then in the aristocracy was actually 
something that could be attributed to 

906
00:51:28,131 --> 00:51:28,964
everyone that was human and that was I 
think that that that manifested itself 

907
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:35,144
most completely in some sense at the 
beginning of the Christian era because 

908
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:38,684
there was an emphasis then on the idea 
that every single individual carried 

909
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:44,960
within them a spark of the divine,
let's say,

910
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,080
and that was the proper source of 
sovereignty,

911
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,580
and so then the question is,
well,

912
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:50,414
what is that source of the divine?
And that's why I read you that section 

913
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:53,744
from John to begin with,
because the source of the divinity is 

914
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:01,901
the capacity to speak and transmute the 
world as a consequence of speaking.

915
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,610
And that's the proper principle of 
sovereignty.

916
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:05,444
And as far as I can tell,
it's also the reason why in the west 

917
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:10,310
people have an inviolable,
right?

918
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:11,683
The reason they have an inviolable right
is because our society figured out and 

919
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,450
based on these unbelievably deep 
antecedents,

920
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:21,590
print precedents that,
that

921
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,343
each individual had the capacity to 
contribute something to the group 

922
00:52:27,111 --> 00:52:30,650
without which the group would be less.
It's something like that.

923
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:31,813
And so you're,
you're regarded at the base of our law 

924
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:35,790
as the,
uh,

925
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:38,420
as the Avatar.
That's exactly right.

926
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,254
As the Avatar of a divine principle.
And that divine principle is the 

927
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:42,644
capacity to use your speech to give 
order to the chaos of the world and to 

928
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:50,300
criticize structures of order that have 
become corrupt and reformulate them.

929
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,733
And so you,
you have this territory that surrounds 

930
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:55,410
you,
that's in violet,

931
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,890
that something about you that transcends
even the reach of the law,

932
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,600
which is a very strange thing,
you know,

933
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:05,090
because in our societies,
even if you're a murderer,

934
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:08,730
even if everyone knows it,
you still have inviolable rights.

935
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,760
You think of all the things that are 
unlikely to have emerged as a concept.

936
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:16,880
That's got to be like number one.
It's been a very long,

937
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:17,714
long struggle for human beings to 
understand that we embodied this 

938
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,370
principle.
Let's say that continually generates the

939
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:31,050
world out of chaos and revitalizes,
it wouldn't becomes corrupt and dead and

940
00:53:31,051 --> 00:53:31,884
that's the key as far as I can tell,
that's what's expressed in John is that 

941
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:40,521
there isn't any difference between that 
and the capacity to carefully articulate

942
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,664
the nature of your experience to other 
people and then to respond to the 

943
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:45,624
corrective feedback.
That's the way that human beings 

944
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,940
progress through the world and that's 
the ultimate principle.

945
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:51,774
That should be at the top of what I 
think of as the set of all human 

946
00:53:55,531 --> 00:53:56,970
dominance hierarchies,
right?

947
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,640
Something will move you up.
Hierarchy,

948
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:03,300
something slightly different will move 
you up a different hierarchy.

949
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,060
You'd take a huge set of hierarchies and
say,

950
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:06,894
well,
what's the principle that's going to 

951
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:11,550
work best over across all those 
hierarchies?

952
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:14,580
It's something like the capacity to 
speak the truth,

953
00:54:15,690 --> 00:54:16,523
and so that's how it looks to me and 
that's why I think apart from the 

954
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:20,490
practical reasons that already 
described,

955
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,533
I know that's a tremendous amount of 
information to process and I hope that 

956
00:54:25,621 --> 00:54:28,440
made some sense.
It's a very difficult thing to boil down

957
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:30,270
in a,
in a short period of time.

958
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:31,104
I mean,
I'd been trying to do that for like 30 

959
00:54:32,071 --> 00:54:36,690
years to get it coherent enough to 
represented in a short period of time,

960
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:37,524
but there's the practical issue which is
that's how we encountered what we don't 

961
00:54:41,671 --> 00:54:42,504
understand and turn it into habitable 
space and how we communicate about it 

962
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:47,184
and reach consensus,
but then there's something much deeper 

963
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:53,790
underneath that which is that we know 
that and we know it really,

964
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:54,624
really deeply.
The whole human race is been aiming at 

965
00:54:56,871 --> 00:54:57,704
that for God only knows how long,
but it's hundreds of thousands of years 

966
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,910
certainly.
And it might be far longer than that.

967
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,373
And so it's not a principle that we can 
dispense with and assume that we'll 

968
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:08,244
construct something.
Okay in this absence because it's 

969
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:11,304
actually an expression of the 
fundamental nature of human beings and 

970
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:17,580
we mess with that are at our extreme 
peril.

971
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:20,730
And as far as I can tell,
that's exactly what we're doing now.

972
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,193
So.

973
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,603
So that's part of the reason why 
objected to bill [inaudible] because I 

974
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:29,554
don't think that it's reasonable for 
government authorities to put their God 

975
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,840
damn words into their citizens mouth and
as simple as that,

976
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:38,674
I think there isn't,
there's almost nothing you could embark 

977
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:42,670
on that would be more dangerous than 
that.

978
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,500
And the fact that this had to do with 
purportedly had to do with the rights of

979
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,900
a small minority of people I think is a 
complete side show.

980
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:55,390
I think it's almost irrelevant in 
relationship to the broader context.

981
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,224
And I think that if that wasn't the case
then there wouldn't have been any fear 

982
00:55:59,501 --> 00:56:03,220
whatsoever about what I said because who
the hell cares what I have to say?

983
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:08,060
So anyways,
that's my take on it.

984
00:56:08,061 --> 00:56:10,340
So that's all I've got to say.

985
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,720
Thank you.
So.

986
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,130
So

987
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,830
you mentioned the form of dialogue.
So when you,

988
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:27,933
when you were giving a lecture,
you mentioned that you're not in fact 

989
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:34,900
engaging in a monologue because by 
looking and seeing her reactions,

990
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,393
you're constantly modifying your speech.
I was wondering if you could speak up 

991
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:45,240
because I'm probably the only millennial
in this room or no,

992
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:45,580
no,
no.

993
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,660
One more,
one more.

994
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,860
Um,
but as someone who's kind of grown up in

995
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:53,260
the Internet and who in fact has social 
media,

996
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:58,261
do you think sites like facebook and not
so much twitter,

997
00:56:58,541 --> 00:56:59,374
but basically facebook,
do they stop this dialogue or how do 

998
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:04,174
you,
what are the ramifications of such 

999
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:06,364
things if people are communicating with 
each other without really being in the 

1000
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:13,900
same room,
what for you is lost?

1001
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,903
I think it's sort of analogous to the 
danger of derivatives in the financial 

1002
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:20,000
market,
you know,

1003
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:24,250
because like a derivative is something 
that can amplify the degree to which the

1004
00:57:24,251 --> 00:57:25,270
market moves,
right?

1005
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,820
Because it's an abstraction from the 
underlying reality.

1006
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:31,630
So it's more powerful for good and it's 
more powerful for evil.

1007
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:33,580
And I would say so to speak,
you know,

1008
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,290
if you're thinking about it 
metaphorically,

1009
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,440
well it's an amplifier and that can be a
good thing,

1010
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,743
but it can also be a bad thing.
And I think it does often amplify the 

1011
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:48,160
proclivity of people to disappear into a
self reflective bubble.

1012
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:52,540
And that's aided by the algorithms that 
feed to you what you want to see.

1013
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,380
So and we don't know exactly what that's
going to do.

1014
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,190
It's not a.
it's,

1015
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,023
it's a very dangerous thing because 
we're building an unconscious into the 

1016
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:01,744
internet and no one's going to 
understand how it works because it gets 

1017
00:58:04,871 --> 00:58:07,990
more and more complex,
especially when ai kicks in in a big way

1018
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:11,020
because you can't understand how those 
systems work even though they work.

1019
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:12,393
And the problem with that unconscious in
the Internet is it filters information 

1020
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,100
and you don't know what the filtering is
mean.

1021
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,630
You don't know what your own filtering 
is,

1022
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:20,583
you know,
because you're not conscious of your 

1023
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:23,404
underlying processes,
but this adds a whole new dimension to 

1024
00:58:25,691 --> 00:58:26,524
it and the fact that it's self 
fulfilling in some sense increases the 

1025
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:33,490
probability of positive feedback loops 
that will go out of control.

1026
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,270
Do you think that it kind of locks you 
into your own,

1027
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:39,383
maybe the story of Your Life?
Because I'm not afraid personally on a 

1028
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:46,871
frequent social media it I see it as no 
people posting about themselves,

1029
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,133
their other relationships.
Do you think it creates a constant 

1030
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,143
feedback loop that it's kind of like I'm
thinking of a would if this is the guy 

1031
00:58:57,681 --> 00:58:59,250
that looks nice,
narcissists,

1032
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,240
narcissists looking at your own 
reflection in the mirror and not.

1033
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:05,863
Well,
I think what happens is that you're not 

1034
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:10,530
allowing other.
I think that is a danger.

1035
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:15,531
I also think though is that you also 
fall prone to the implicit narcissism of

1036
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:18,654
all the other facebook users and and 
well because people generally post 

1037
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,880
glowing reviews of their own life and 
you know,

1038
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:26,743
to some degree that's understandable 
because who wants to be subject to a 

1039
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,064
constant barrage of misery?
I mean there's reasons that people do 

1040
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,930
it.
They post themselves when they're having

1041
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:37,640
fun when they're doing something 
spectacular,

1042
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:38,474
but that also means that you're being 
blasted all the time by these endless 

1043
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:45,110
images of other people having a far 
better time of life than you are.

1044
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,483
And so I think that that we,
we do know that there is some evidence 

1045
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:53,810
that more exposure to facebook means 
more depression.

1046
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:58,370
Now it's hard to pull out correlation 
and causality there,

1047
00:59:58,371 --> 00:59:59,204
but,
but then in the political sphere you 

1048
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:04,880
have the same problem because you're not
being fair and unbiased.

1049
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:05,714
Sample of information and your own 
initial biases are multiplied by the 

1050
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,673
algorithms that select for you what 
you're going to look at and we don't 

1051
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:13,394
know.
We have no idea what the consequence of 

1052
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:15,920
that is,
so

1053
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,930
thank you very much.
A incidentally,

1054
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,930
I have a questions that concern 
something similar,

1055
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,190
but I'm talking about the real face to 
face conversation.

1056
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,024
You said how important it is for us as 
speaker to get some feedback of your 

1057
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:34,010
audience.
Now,

1058
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:39,080
having grown up in east Germany behalf 
learned to look this,

1059
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,093
no expression whatsoever.
It's the most outrageous stupid sinks 

1060
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,533
because the consequences of like rolling
your eyes Wednesday we're talking about 

1061
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,710
us being well ahead economically of 
would be just very negative.

1062
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:54,734
So we didn't do that and I see something
similar happening here in especially in 

1063
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:01,603
certain political lectures.
So if somebody tells you that what you 

1064
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:06,344
are doing or Taltz and audience,
what you are doing is horrible and I'm 

1065
01:01:09,561 --> 01:01:10,394
in that audience.
I wouldn't roll my eyes because I know 

1066
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:17,150
what set.
So the consequences are now,

1067
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:18,380
of course in

1068
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:21,660
those are microaggressions.
Yeah.

1069
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,160
Really.
I'm not kidding.

1070
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,410
I mean,
that's exactly what it is.

1071
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,260
The eye rolling in particular is a sign 
of contempt.

1072
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,550
Exactly.
Yeah.

1073
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:29,300
So,
uh,

1074
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,370
but of course if I,
if I never do that to you,

1075
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:35,300
you now get the impressions that what 
you say.

1076
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:39,460
It's just wonderful.
So you don't get to critical feet at as,

1077
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:42,320
as you pointed out,
a very important for you.

1078
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:45,140
Yes.
Course said goals,

1079
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,850
bolts,
waste.

1080
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,360
So it's actually one of the on the

1081
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,410
mental defenses of free speech is that 
your dish,

1082
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:52,353
if you constrain it,
you're depriving people of corrective 

1083
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:58,360
feedback and that's a very bad thing 
because people,

1084
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:01,480
people cannot maintain sanity in 
isolation.

1085
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,433
You,
you outsource your sanity to other 

1086
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:08,320
people.
If you're vaguely socially acceptable.

1087
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,453
What that means is people can tolerate 
having you around and then they will 

1088
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:16,000
provide you with corrective feedback and
as long as you react to that,

1089
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,500
you don't have to worry about being sane
because they'll keep you way.

1090
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,820
And you might think,
well no,

1091
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:24,000
you can manage your sanity by yourself,
but no,

1092
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,310
it's too complex.
You can't,

1093
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,480
it's not possible.

1094
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,093
So it's a problem.
It's not just inhibiting these speech 

1095
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,950
but also inhibiting a natural reaction 
to speech.

1096
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,190
Absolutely.
Well,

1097
01:02:37,191 --> 01:02:39,140
send the spontaneous reactions,
right?

1098
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:41,240
Because a lot of those facial gestures,
those aren't,

1099
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,373
those aren't precisely conscious and 
that's actually good because they're 

1100
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:48,820
untrammeled expressions of your initial 
instincts.

1101
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:50,150
Something like that,
you know,

1102
01:02:50,151 --> 01:02:52,190
it's like having dogs around,
you know,

1103
01:02:52,191 --> 01:02:55,130
if you're agitated and upset,
the dog will get all nervous.

1104
01:02:55,131 --> 01:02:55,581
It's like,
well,

1105
01:02:55,581 --> 01:02:57,980
you can trust that the dog doesn't have 
an agenda,

1106
01:02:58,460 --> 01:02:59,293
you know,
and people are like that in their 

1107
01:03:00,081 --> 01:03:00,914
initial responses to.
Because that doesn't mean they're 

1108
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:03,674
correct,
but it at least it means that it's not 

1109
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:10,970
mediated by like an ideological bias or 
not so straightforwardly.

1110
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:14,150
Just before we hear from Eva,
I wanted to mention that,

1111
01:03:14,151 --> 01:03:16,860
uh,
we let our hypothesis die in our steps.

1112
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:19,460
Karl Popper,
one of my favorite philosophers.

1113
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,400
Copper.
Yes.

1114
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,053
First of all,
I wanted to say thank you for most 

1115
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:26,423
interesting a presentation and online,
which a lot of us you haven't heard 

1116
01:03:31,951 --> 01:03:34,860
before,
so thank you for that.

1117
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,390
Uh,
and I've,

1118
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:39,300
the two things that I wanted to ask you 
about,

1119
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,523
one,
the concept that you've enunciated of 

1120
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,610
the emergence over an extremely long 
period of time,

1121
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,550
of the idea that we all have somewhat of
the divine in us,

1122
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,730
which I suppose also implies that we 
have someone of the opposite as well.

1123
01:03:57,290 --> 01:03:58,610
Yeah.
It is hard.

1124
01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:03,650
That leads directly to the idea of 
individual rights versus group,

1125
01:04:06,541 --> 01:04:07,680
right?
Yes.

1126
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,083
And a lot of the troubles that all of us
here faced is that we have become the 

1127
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:14,380
target of,
uh,

1128
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,490
these group demands for group,
right?

1129
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,680
Rather than individual rights art or 
attaining or not that

1130
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,303
that march towards the higher 
hierarchies of society based on our own 

1131
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:32,190
effort and our own performances and so 
on.

1132
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,413
So that's one.
But that's also the other side of 

1133
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:36,174
another thing that you raised,
which one really hears in any of these 

1134
01:04:38,851 --> 01:04:42,240
kinds of meetings,
the biological basis of our behavior.

1135
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,413
And I was really interested to hear you 
bring this into the discussion because 

1136
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:49,374
it has seemed to me over the years,
and I've been around this business into 

1137
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,420
the sixties,
I think when it all troubled,

1138
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,263
seemed to have started,
is that a lot of the feminism nonsense 

1139
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,110
is involved with the denial of 
differences between males and females.

1140
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,933
A lot of the problems with the 
performance and affirmative action and 

1141
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:11,004
so on is the denial that there may be a 
biological basis to some of the 

1142
01:05:15,751 --> 01:05:18,490
performance differences that we see in 
various

1143
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:21,960
fields of activity around the world.
Uh,

1144
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,163
and also this idea that we can decide 
what gender we are tomorrow morning and 

1145
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:30,070
that I,
I must say I'd never heard of this.

1146
01:05:30,071 --> 01:05:31,100
So what did you call it,
the,

1147
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:31,993
the Gender Unicorn and I will do when I 
go and the instructor olds and six year 

1148
01:05:37,451 --> 01:05:41,610
old will be subjected to this is 
positively alarming.

1149
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,180
So I just asked you to comment
here.

1150
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,063
Well,
the,

1151
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:48,640
they call that biological essentialism,
right?

1152
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:49,990
And so that's a,
that's a,

1153
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,270
that's a curse word essentially,
right?

1154
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:54,190
If so,
and again,

1155
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:55,024
that's partly why I objected to the 
legislation and surrounding policy 

1156
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:58,624
because it doesn't allow for a 
biological influence and so which is 

1157
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:08,430
preposterous in my estimation and mean 
the biology actually is much more useful

1158
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:12,520
than people even realize.
So you know,

1159
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,413
one of the things we were talking about 
earlier today was say the distinction 

1160
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,080
between conservatives and liberals.

1161
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:25,380
I can tell you one of the things that
produces right wing authoritarianism.

1162
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:29,080
It's very interesting and you wouldn't 
guess this in a million years.

1163
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,843
Prevalence of infectious disease.
So there was a great paper published 

1164
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:35,344
three years ago.
It was brilliant prevalence of 

1165
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:38,224
infectious disease.
So it was published in a journal called 

1166
01:06:41,201 --> 01:06:46,000
plause one and these researchers were 
interested in this hypothesis called the

1167
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
behavioral immune system.
And so you know very frequently when 

1168
01:06:49,901 --> 01:06:50,734
here too,
for isolated human groups come into 

1169
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,300
contact that either one group or the 
other dies,

1170
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,313
like maybe,
maybe all of them are virtually all of 

1171
01:06:58,001 --> 01:06:58,834
them.
That's essentially what happened to the 

1172
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:02,560
native Americans when the Spaniards hit 
Central America.

1173
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:03,423
Right?
Because they didn't have any built in 

1174
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,913
immunity to smallpox or chicken pox or 
mumps or measles and like success of 

1175
01:07:10,541 --> 01:07:13,240
epidemics just wiped them out.
The estimates vary,

1176
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:14,074
but it could be as high as 95 percent 
and so it appears as though the border 

1177
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:22,510
idea,
the idea of thick borders,

1178
01:07:22,511 --> 01:07:23,344
let's say,
which is a fundamentally conservative 

1179
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:25,210
idea.

1180
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:28,510
The liberals want open borders and a lot
of information flow in the conservatives

1181
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,344
want closed borders and more restriction
and protection at every level of the of 

1182
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,250
the conceptual hierarchy.
It's not just political borders,

1183
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:39,700
its borders around everything,
but that seems to be tightly associated,

1184
01:07:39,701 --> 01:07:40,534
at least in part with the prevalence of 
infectious disease both at the country 

1185
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,224
level and at the,
at the local level within countries and 

1186
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:47,314
the correlations like point seven.
It's not trivial and it's not with 

1187
01:07:49,811 --> 01:07:50,644
governmental authoritarian attitudes.
It's with individual authoritarian 

1188
01:07:53,411 --> 01:07:54,244
attitudes at in the locales where 
they're infectious diseases are 

1189
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:01,540
prevalent and it seems to be associated 
with the emotion of disgust,

1190
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,800
so Hitler wasn't afraid of the Jews.
Conservatives aren't afraid of others.

1191
01:08:05,801 --> 01:08:08,200
That isn't how it works.
They're disgusted.

1192
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,470
That's not the same thing.
It's associated with a personality trait

1193
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:12,304
called orderliness and so hit re once 
this has been sorted out by 

1194
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:19,220
psychologists over about the last 10 
years,

1195
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:20,054
let's say,
and what when I was plowing through the 

1196
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:25,130
literature and working on the 
relationship between disgust,

1197
01:08:25,131 --> 01:08:25,964
sensitivity and personality,
I happened to reread Hitler's table 

1198
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:30,164
talk,
which was a collection of his 

1199
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:35,370
spontaneous speeches collected at 
dinnertime,

1200
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:40,390
lunchtimes by secretaries from 1939 to 
1942 and one.

1201
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,970
Once I knew this other information,
it just leapt out at me,

1202
01:08:43,971 --> 01:08:44,804
you know,
so Hitler was a admirer of willpower 

1203
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,880
that makes them a conscientious type of 
person,

1204
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,600
very obsessed with order,
washed his hands,

1205
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,190
continually was hyper clean and disgust 
sensitive.

1206
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:03,490
And his primary metaphor for the German 
people was a body area in body pure body

1207
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,223
under assault by parasites.
It's pure disgust and contamination 

1208
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:13,160
language and it's mediated by disgust 
sensitivity.

1209
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:16,580
And that's one of the things that 
predicts that kind of right wing,

1210
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:17,414
close the border attitude.
And that's also heightened in places 

1211
01:09:20,241 --> 01:09:22,140
where infectious diseases are a real 
problem.

1212
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:24,710
So if you want to eliminate right wing 
authoritarianism,

1213
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:28,940
it actually looks like one of the things
you could do is as promote public health

1214
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:31,280
programs everywhere to rid the world of 
the,

1215
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,040
to the degree that that's possible of 
infectious diseases.

1216
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:35,653
Well you know,
you want to impede the flow between 

1217
01:09:38,031 --> 01:09:41,000
people if there's infectious diseases 
everywhere obviously.

1218
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,700
And that manifests itself in political 
attitudes.

1219
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:44,803
So there's the biology reaches way 
deeper than than people are willing to 

1220
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,463
like to assume.
But some of the things that it tells us 

1221
01:09:53,751 --> 01:09:58,220
are unbelievably useful to know,
being terrible to know in some sense,

1222
01:09:58,221 --> 01:10:02,420
but useful to know.
And so I'd like the walls work on,

1223
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,690
on the stability of,
of primate hierarchies.

1224
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:06,524
Incredibly important.
I mean he's been looking at the 

1225
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:08,713
emergence of protocol morality among 
chimpanzees and that seems to be driven 

1226
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,360
in large part by the dominance hierarchy
structure.

1227
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:16,570
And it's not exactly a dominance 
hierarchy either.

1228
01:10:16,571 --> 01:10:19,280
That's probably not exactly the right 
way to think about it because,

1229
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:22,760
you know,
dominance implies pure power,

1230
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,043
but lots of human hierarchies aren't 
dominance hierarchies and all their 

1231
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:27,950
competence hierarchies or something like
that.

1232
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:29,450
So it's very different.

1233
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,570
I'm a libertarian,
so I favor of freedom,

1234
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:36,404
but unlike a lot of libertarians,
I don't think that there's kind of a 

1235
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:40,214
natural affinity to freedom among human 
beings that evolution has actually 

1236
01:10:45,051 --> 01:10:45,884
trained us to be conformists much more 
than freedom loving individualists 

1237
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,150
absolute.
And,

1238
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:52,890
and as a result of that,
uh,

1239
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:55,490
I mean because,
because in our evolutionary history,

1240
01:10:55,910 --> 01:11:00,200
it was often much more important to row 
all in the same direction.

1241
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:01,180
The clan,
you know,

1242
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:05,000
the roughly
related,

1243
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:08,150
genetically related clans that were 
roaming the,

1244
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:09,393
it was much more important to row in the
same direction than to row in the right 

1245
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:12,794
direction.
As long as you didn't roll off the off 

1246
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,390
the cliff or run off the cliff,
that would be bad.

1247
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:19,224
But,
but as long as you were muddling 

1248
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:21,024
through,
it was better for everyone to be in the 

1249
01:11:22,591 --> 01:11:23,424
same.
And so therefore we evolve to be very 

1250
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,850
much conformists and people like you.

1251
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,313
And to lesser extent,
the rest of us in this room are the 

1252
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:37,710
disruptors were the ones who are 
nonconformist were the ones who say,

1253
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,603
Hey,
wait a minute,

1254
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,030
that doesn't sound right to me.
And,

1255
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:43,800
and we're the ones who want to lead 
society back to chaos,

1256
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,933
the state of chaos where everyone's got 
their own little little view of how 

1257
01:11:48,301 --> 01:11:49,134
things should go instead of following 
the leader and just doing what everyone 

1258
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:52,104
else does.
And that's why people like you attract 

1259
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,333
to meet to my way of thinking.
That's why people like you attract such 

1260
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:03,450
a visceral,
angry reaction is that you're,

1261
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,313
you're leading us back into chaos and if
we don't all ignore you and shut you 

1262
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:10,020
down and you know,
we're all going to be,

1263
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:11,023
you know,
in the state where the clan is fighting 

1264
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,590
amongst each other instead of rowing in 
the same direction.

1265
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,690
If you have any thoughts on that.

1266
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,550
Well,
I think certainly one of the things I've

1267
01:12:21,551 --> 01:12:22,121
learned,
see,

1268
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:22,954
I already knew before all this happened 
that people were primarily conforming 

1269
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:27,723
and I actually don't have much of a 
problem with that because most of the 

1270
01:12:30,761 --> 01:12:35,761
time the tradition is correct,
but sometimes it's not correct at all.

1271
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,590
That's the problem is that.
So you know,

1272
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:39,483
one of the things I always tell my 
clients and my students for that matter 

1273
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:42,634
is you should do what everyone else does
unless you have a really good reason to 

1274
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:48,514
vary.
And one of the things I learned from 

1275
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:52,330
young Carl young was that,
and if you do very,

1276
01:12:52,331 --> 01:12:55,660
you should try to only do it in a couple
of directions because you probably can't

1277
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:56,494
handle doing it more than that.
It's just too much to too much 

1278
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:01,310
psychologically.
But you know,

1279
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:02,163
the problem is,
is that sometimes the group is rolling 

1280
01:13:03,701 --> 01:13:08,701
off a cliff and then it's then you know,
that's partly why the individual in some

1281
01:13:08,741 --> 01:13:12,040
senses the eternal savior of the group 
because the group is.

1282
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:14,830
It has the aspect of sheep,
let's say,

1283
01:13:14,831 --> 01:13:15,664
and the sheep are doing fine.
They've got the whole herd thing going 

1284
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:19,054
for them,
decreases the risk of individual 

1285
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:23,020
predation.
They've got all their nervous systems in

1286
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:25,150
tune.
So there's real utility in the herd,

1287
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:26,283
but they're also subject to all the 
problems that herds have like heard 

1288
01:13:29,021 --> 01:13:30,910
panic or.
And so.

1289
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,940
So that's not good enough.
That's what human beings figured out was

1290
01:13:33,941 --> 01:13:36,700
that being part of the herd,
although necessary,

1291
01:13:36,701 --> 01:13:37,534
isn't good enough.
There has to be a balance between the 

1292
01:13:40,091 --> 01:13:44,350
tradition,
the old dead tradition and the vivifying

1293
01:13:44,351 --> 01:13:45,980
force of the,
of the,

1294
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:50,800
a lot of the living essentially that's 
those are actually how the gods split up

1295
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:51,634
and need you.
Because Horace was roughly a 

1296
01:13:52,871 --> 01:13:53,704
representation of the living and it was 
cyrus was roughly a representation of 

1297
01:13:56,321 --> 01:13:57,154
the dead and it was the combined 
combination of those two that made up 

1298
01:14:00,011 --> 01:14:05,011
the sovereign very intelligent,
like dramatic political philosophy.

1299
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,030
So,
but you know,

1300
01:14:07,031 --> 01:14:09,340
one of the things I have seen since 
September is,

1301
01:14:09,341 --> 01:14:12,250
I mean I knew that people were 
conformance,

1302
01:14:12,251 --> 01:14:15,730
but I really had.
I really had no idea to what degree that

1303
01:14:15,731 --> 01:14:17,260
was true.
You know,

1304
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,950
like,
I mean I've got very,

1305
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:19,793
very,
very few letters of support from people 

1306
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:25,810
who are academics for example.
And they get secret reports.

1307
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:26,411
Really.
You know,

1308
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:29,080
people will come and say,
well we agree with what you're doing,

1309
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:30,940
but we wish you could be a little nicer 
about it.

1310
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,710
Which,
which,

1311
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:33,603
you know,
it's a funny thing for people to say 

1312
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:37,030
because it implies that if they did what
I was doing,

1313
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:39,010
they would do a better job,
you know,

1314
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,690
which is fine,
but you know,

1315
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:42,790
you can always try it out and see how it
goes.

1316
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:43,680
So

1317
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:47,010
when I gave talks in
equity,

1318
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,353
one of the most common comments I would 
get after the thing's over and people 

1319
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:52,830
that are milling around and shaking your
hand is,

1320
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,500
I agree with everything you said that I 
would never say.

1321
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:56,610
Yeah,
yeah.

1322
01:14:56,611 --> 01:14:58,190
Well,
it's no wonder it's not,

1323
01:14:58,191 --> 01:14:59,520
it's not surprising,
you know,

1324
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:00,354
I mean,
there are real reasons not to stick out 

1325
01:15:01,891 --> 01:15:03,750
from the herd.
If you,

1326
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:08,130
if you mark a zebra so that you can 
identify it against the herd,

1327
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:11,130
the lions will kill it.
Right?

1328
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:15,930
And that's that Ban Italia.
No one that you like because they can't,

1329
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:16,793
they can't organize their haunted less.
They can identify the individual lines 

1330
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:21,600
dazzled.
That's right,

1331
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,330
while they're camouflaged against the 
herd zebras.

1332
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:25,950
So that's,
man,

1333
01:15:25,951 --> 01:15:28,050
that's worth knowing.
It explains a lot that.

1334
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:29,903
Oh,
sorry.

1335
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,020
Thanks very much for elaborating.
Very,

1336
01:15:37,021 --> 01:15:38,940
uh,
very compellingly.

1337
01:15:38,941 --> 01:15:43,941
The fundamental significance of thought 
and speech are almost impossible to,

1338
01:15:44,430 --> 01:15:46,650
at our point in development to two 
separate,

1339
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,900
um,
and uh,

1340
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:51,270
the,
the trans issue,

1341
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,850
which is the particularity that isn't 
very important.

1342
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:54,950
And,
you know,

1343
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:55,783
I,
I,

1344
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,560
I would agree with you,
but I'm,

1345
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,160
I'm a,
I'm a sex researcher,

1346
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:01,600
so people are going to ask me,
uh,

1347
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:02,453
the Trans Issue I think is an 
appropriate lightening rod for social 

1348
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,030
constructionism.
Uh,

1349
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,200
and you know,
as a,

1350
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,093
as a researcher in this field,
I can tell you that John Money was 

1351
01:16:12,961 --> 01:16:16,350
wrong.
Kids aren't Tabula Rosa and you know,

1352
01:16:16,351 --> 01:16:18,370
Micky diamond was right and,
you know,

1353
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:21,270
etc. And now you're in trouble.
YeAh.

1354
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:25,800
The presence,
the presence of police officers here was

1355
01:16:25,801 --> 01:16:28,010
actually a very interesting,
um,

1356
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:33,060
uh,
underscoring of the power of thought and

1357
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:37,020
speech and the millennial issue of the 
internet,

1358
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:38,303
uh,
reminds us that we don't choose our 

1359
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:41,454
audience.

1360
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,660
Uh,
in the internet.

1361
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,480
you're basically exposed to the world,
uh,

1362
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:50,481
and you're a tendency to self center to 
avert being trolled is probably great.

1363
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:53,490
At any rate,
um,

1364
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,260
that's just,
just,

1365
01:16:55,261 --> 01:16:57,270
just background.
My colleagues are going to,

1366
01:16:57,350 --> 01:16:57,900
my,
uh,

1367
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,220
my colleague,
ken zucker,

1368
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:01,290
who,
one of your colleagues at the university

1369
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:02,124
of toronto was recently fired for his 
departure from common wisdom and it 

1370
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:08,304
wasn't much of a departure and in fact,
he represents common wisdom on the 

1371
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:14,540
trance phenomena.
Having said all that,

1372
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,420
mY colleagues are going to ask you two 
questions,

1373
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:19,280
uh,
asked me two questions.

1374
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:23,900
If he meT joan who was trans feminine,
you know,

1375
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,200
male to female transsexual,
would you refer to her as joan?

1376
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,890
Okay.
It's simpler.

1377
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,793
And the other issue is midst all the 
garbage and the hype and the let's 

1378
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,500
reassigned a three year old and,
you know,

1379
01:17:36,890 --> 01:17:39,110
stuff that I think all of us would 
regard as nonsense.

1380
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:40,353
Um,
many of us in some of us in this room 

1381
01:17:41,961 --> 01:17:45,080
deal with trans individuals every day.
You know,

1382
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:46,650
like,
uh,

1383
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,950
some gay individuals,
that's just the way they,

1384
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,820
they,
they,

1385
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,360
they emerged in life.
Uh,

1386
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,500
they're genuine.
They're not particularly begging special

1387
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:55,770
privilege.
Uh,

1388
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,360
my colleagues get to say,
would you,

1389
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,720
you know,
you'd call her joan and would you,

1390
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:00,554
would you accord her authenticity or 
reality or whereas she socially 

1391
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:08,150
constructing herself or was she born 
that way?

1392
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,990
Well,
the devil's always in the details.

1393
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:12,880
You know,
I mean,

1394
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:14,950
one of the things that's emerging right 
now,

1395
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:19,360
although this is a fringe viewpoint,
is like imagine that you're dating

1396
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:21,993
while you prejudiced
because people's prejudices shine forth 

1397
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:28,090
most clearly in their choice of 
partners,

1398
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,040
right?
They choose people who are.

1399
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,440
Sorry,
oh,

1400
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:35,930
people's prejudice is shine forth most 
brightly in their choice of,

1401
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,110
of,
of sexual partners,

1402
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,480
right?
We prefer young people.

1403
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:43,030
Generally speaking,
we prefer healthy people.

1404
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:47,530
We prefer people of our own race.
We prefer people of our own religion.

1405
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:48,963
We prefer high,
the highest performing individuals we 

1406
01:18:51,551 --> 01:18:52,384
can get our hands on generally speaking.
And so the whole that steeply 

1407
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,970
prejudicial and one of the things that's
emerging,

1408
01:18:58,330 --> 01:18:59,163
I wouldn't say in the trans community 
because there isn't such a thing as far 

1409
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:04,900
as I can tell,
but among certain individuals is they're

1410
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:08,860
dubious of your right to choose your 
sexual partner based on their genitalia,

1411
01:19:08,861 --> 01:19:09,250
let's say.

1412
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:12,610
Because that's a form of discrimination,
so yeah.

1413
01:19:12,611 --> 01:19:13,360
Well,
you know,

1414
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:14,760
look,
I can tell you in,

1415
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:15,683
in huxley's brave new world,
and this is where thinking about you 

1416
01:19:18,431 --> 01:19:22,210
didn't get to you was,
it was a social full part.

1417
01:19:22,211 --> 01:19:25,120
It turned down as sexual request because
it's discriminatory.

1418
01:19:25,121 --> 01:19:26,080
It's like,
well,

1419
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,390
it is discriminatory.
Really.

1420
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:31,510
I'm not kidding man.
It's the deepest form of discrimination,

1421
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,090
you know,
you're basically saying you're basically

1422
01:19:34,091 --> 01:19:36,370
saying yes,
exactly.

1423
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,204
That's exactly it.
And that's what you had to do in 

1424
01:19:39,791 --> 01:19:40,624
huxley's brave new world.
And you also weren't allowed to have a 

1425
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:46,810
long term monogamous relationship 
because the exclusionary element of that

1426
01:19:46,811 --> 01:19:49,780
was regarded as prejudicial,
which it is.

1427
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,330
That's the thing.
That's the thing.

1428
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,100
And so the question is,
well,

1429
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:55,630
uh,
I could say,

1430
01:19:55,631 --> 01:19:56,200
well,
I would,

1431
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,940
I wouldn't discriminate.
It's like,

1432
01:19:57,941 --> 01:19:58,774
well,
it depends on exactly what you mean by 

1433
01:20:00,131 --> 01:20:02,620
discriminate.
And then of course the argument is about

1434
01:20:02,621 --> 01:20:03,520
exactly what,
right?

1435
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:06,730
I have to discriminate.
And increasingly the answer is none.

1436
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,630
Like we've already sacrificed freedom of
assembly.

1437
01:20:10,020 --> 01:20:12,870
We're pretty much on the way to a 
sacrificing freedom of speech.

1438
01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:15,950
It's a logical conclusion to all of this
that

1439
01:20:19,690 --> 01:20:20,523
I'm going to be asked by colleagues,
what is your view of the authenticity 

1440
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:29,460
that is
always identified as the opposite gender

1441
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,800
now have much better that I've 
transitioned.

1442
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:33,571
Yes.
Well,

1443
01:20:33,571 --> 01:20:34,404
that's a part that I'm more skeptical 
about because the evidence isn't all 

1444
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:37,644
that clear,
that people do feel better when they 

1445
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:40,230
transition.
So,

1446
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:41,470
but it's.
Look,

1447
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,870
it's.
Yes,

1448
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,520
it is.
First of all,

1449
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,593
there's the fact that there are 
categories doesn't mean there aren't 

1450
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:49,314
exceptions.
There's exceptions now what those 

1451
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:52,644
exceptions signify?
Well that's generally to be dealt with 

1452
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:58,050
on an individual to individual basis and
that's fine with me.

1453
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,100
You know,
I'm a clinician,

1454
01:20:59,101 --> 01:21:03,060
I've dealt with all sorts of people who 
don't and who fits in the categories.

1455
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,073
Nobody like to become socialized.
What you do is you mangle your square 

1456
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:08,664
peg into a round hole and,
and I mean for some people it's 

1457
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:14,160
obviously far more of a sacrifice than 
for others,

1458
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,380
but you know,
social being demands,

1459
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,330
what would you call restriction of your,
at least have your individuality and all

1460
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:23,580
sorts of different aspects.
And for some people,

1461
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:25,470
that's much more of a sacrifice than 
others.

1462
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:29,400
The question is,
what does the existence of the exception

1463
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:30,563
imply for the general case?
And I believe that if you're a 

1464
01:21:33,151 --> 01:21:38,151
postmodernist and a marxist underneath 
that it supplies the excuse to take down

1465
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:41,070
the category of gender and why would you
do that?

1466
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:41,933
Well,
It's a category used by the oppressive 

1467
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:45,600
patriarchy to continue.
It's to continue.

1468
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,730
It's pathological power seeking

1469
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,400
distinction between no,
leave me alone.

1470
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:55,401
I want to get on with my life versus
the category so that there's room for

1471
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:57,423
yes precisely,
or I'm going to dismiss the category on 

1472
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,500
behalf of someone else who I claim to 
speak for,

1473
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,180
which is even more commonly the case

1474
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,553
general environment where oppression and
identity are the currency of status and 

1475
01:22:09,831 --> 01:22:10,664
advantage.

1476
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:11,673
Yes.
Right,

1477
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,491
right.
Well,

1478
01:22:12,491 --> 01:22:15,070
and I just don't see that it's going to 
be all that useful.

1479
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,160
Kids are confused enough when they're 
growing up.

1480
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:22,030
I think to add gender confusion to that,
which we're doing very,

1481
01:22:22,031 --> 01:22:25,630
very rapidly is going to destroy 15 
people.

1482
01:22:25,631 --> 01:22:26,464
For every one it saves.
It might be more than that because 

1483
01:22:29,381 --> 01:22:31,240
there's plenty of confused people out 
there,

1484
01:22:31,241 --> 01:22:33,580
I would say like what?
Two out of 30,

1485
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:34,414
something like that are just barely 
clinging onto the to the edges of 

1486
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:37,744
reality and they're looking for 
acceptance and transmutation wherever 

1487
01:22:40,901 --> 01:22:41,734
they can find it and confusing them 
further isn't going to help and these 

1488
01:22:44,861 --> 01:22:45,694
people that were transitioning young,
there's going to be one hell of a 

1489
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:50,410
kickback from that.
I can tell yoU when they hit the,

1490
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,700
when they hit adulthood.

1491
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,870
Let me just follow up on grant brown's 
question.

1492
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:00,873
Jordan is among the top fIve or top 10 
professors in north America during the 

1493
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,903
past year who's been a lightning rod,
a target of collective efforts at 

1494
01:23:11,141 --> 01:23:11,974
humiliation and being disgraced.
And mY question is essentially if you 

1495
01:23:18,701 --> 01:23:22,420
could give as parsimonious answer as you
can,

1496
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,170
which generally isn't very personable,
I've noticed.

1497
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:30,040
Yes,
of why you.

1498
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:33,900
and it's a remarkable phenomenon,
uh,

1499
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,710
when somebody is demonized to the extent
that you have been in mainstream media.

1500
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:44,310
I was reading just lately.
I've picked up in a carpet can ix office

1501
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,740
a copy of toronto life.
Oh yeah.

1502
01:23:47,741 --> 01:23:50,530
There was this nice job by,
by,

1503
01:23:50,531 --> 01:23:52,870
uh,
a kind of wide eyed reporter,

1504
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,000
you know,
he doesn't seem like a demon know,

1505
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:00,940
he seems like a kind of nice guy.
He even seems a little bit on the left,

1506
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:04,120
but he,
he must be a demon there somewhere.

1507
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:08,560
So the question is just as briefly as 
you can why you.

1508
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,260
Because I said there was some

1509
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:13,130
I wouldn't do
right.

1510
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:17,160
I mean because like all these massive 
ideas,

1511
01:24:17,161 --> 01:24:17,994
as I said,
they manifest themselves in micro 

1512
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,330
examples,
you know,

1513
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,433
many micro examples,
but they're micro examples and so 

1514
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:26,303
there's always a certain amount of 
arbitrary penis when you decided to not 

1515
01:24:29,371 --> 01:24:32,610
go along with it.
And the arbitrary ness is like,

1516
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,473
well,
I said that I wouldn't use these words 

1517
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,330
for example,
and had a rationale for it.

1518
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:40,500
And then people test you out when you,
when you put up your hand,

1519
01:24:40,501 --> 01:24:41,550
they test you out.
They think,

1520
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:42,780
well,
are you just a monster?

1521
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:46,590
Well let's throw a bunch of monster 
words at you and see if they stick.

1522
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:47,483
See if you can defend yourself because 
that's a really good way of finding out 

1523
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:52,620
whether you're actually a monster,
and so that was the first,

1524
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:53,543
let's say two months of all of this was 
me just sort of fending off these 

1525
01:24:58,170 --> 01:24:59,250
different accusations.

1526
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:01,560
Now.
I was fortunate in many ways.

1527
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:02,963
I was fortunate in that in the first 
demonstrations that followed the the 

1528
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:09,183
videos that the people who were 
supporting me behaved reasonably well 

1529
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:15,533
compared to the people who weren't.
Now you could think about that as 

1530
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,180
somewhat dependent on chance.
Not entirely,

1531
01:25:21,181 --> 01:25:22,014
but things could have gone badly the 
other way and also I was protected by 

1532
01:25:26,071 --> 01:25:26,904
the fact that I already had about 400 
hours of videos online and so virtually 

1533
01:25:30,871 --> 01:25:31,704
everything I had said to students in the
last well over the span of 30 years 

1534
01:25:35,341 --> 01:25:37,470
really,
but particularly in the last five years,

1535
01:25:37,471 --> 01:25:38,304
was all recorded.
And so if anybody wanted to find out if 

1536
01:25:40,651 --> 01:25:41,484
I was a monster,
all they had to do is go through the 

1537
01:25:43,201 --> 01:25:44,034
painful process of listening to what I 
had to say and there were no smoking 

1538
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:48,630
guns buried in there,
which is,

1539
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:49,980
which is significant.

1540
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:53,100
Given that there were 200 hours of it,
you know,

1541
01:25:53,101 --> 01:25:53,934
it's,
it's,

1542
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:54,893
you'd think there'd be something in 
there that I said that could have been 

1543
01:25:57,090 --> 01:26:00,420
taken out of context that would have 
really walled me a good one,

1544
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:05,150
but so far nobody seems to have 
extracted so.

1545
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:06,673
And I also think that.
I guess the next reason would be I 

1546
01:26:09,381 --> 01:26:10,214
didn't,
just apart from saying there was 

1547
01:26:11,511 --> 01:26:12,344
something specific I wouldn't do,
which brings the abstraction down to a 

1548
01:26:15,591 --> 01:26:16,880
point of reality,
right?

1549
01:26:16,881 --> 01:26:17,191
It's,
it's,

1550
01:26:17,191 --> 01:26:18,024
it's a line that,
that makes it real rather than just an 

1551
01:26:20,991 --> 01:26:21,824
abstract critique.
I think the other thing thAt happened 

1552
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:27,290
was that people came to my website 
because of the political material,

1553
01:26:27,291 --> 01:26:28,124
but that isn't where they stopped.
They started listening to what I had to 

1554
01:26:29,961 --> 01:26:33,350
say and I think that what I have to say 
is actually revolutionary.

1555
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:35,900
So.
And I think people have a sense of that.

1556
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:38,330
I mean,
it looks like it as far as I can tell,

1557
01:26:38,331 --> 01:26:40,610
the response seems to indicate that.
And,

1558
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:41,444
you know,
I shared some of that with you today 

1559
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,340
that the idea that some of our values 
are grounded in,

1560
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,060
in phenomena that are far more 
primordial,

1561
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:51,830
let's say,
then our mere opinion,

1562
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,590
like that's a big deal.
If it's,

1563
01:26:53,591 --> 01:26:55,340
if there's anything about it that's 
true.

1564
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,690
And I mean,
I don't know,

1565
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,400
but I've been trying to puzzle this out 
for a long time and uh,

1566
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:01,813
it seems to cohere and when people try 
to apply the principles that I've been 

1567
01:27:05,661 --> 01:27:08,450
discussing in their lives,
it makes their lives better.

1568
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,850
You know?
And it's so interesting too because I've

1569
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,630
been going around speaking publicly,
you know,

1570
01:27:12,631 --> 01:27:15,860
and most of my audience is men,
interestingly enough,

1571
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:16,933
even in the live talks and all I've been
doing with the man basically is talking 

1572
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:24,950
to them about saying what's true and 
adopting responsibility.

1573
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:27,830
And they're so bloody hungry for that.
That is just mind boggling,

1574
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,133
you know,
which is something really curious and 

1575
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:33,440
interesting to me because that's not a 
saleable message.

1576
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,340
You know,
it's,

1577
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,620
it's because are basically saying,
well,

1578
01:27:36,621 --> 01:27:40,130
find the heaviest load you can conceive 
of and try to pick it up.

1579
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:41,390
And while you're doing that,
you know,

1580
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,403
try to engage in the least amount of 
deceit as possible and that that's also 

1581
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:48,950
a pathway out of suffering for people in
general.

1582
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:50,053
Well,
it's so interesting to see how 

1583
01:27:51,351 --> 01:27:56,351
unbelievably positively the people who 
who are following this are responding.

1584
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:58,550
They're responding to that.
It's,

1585
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,223
I've been talking to a lot of the 
potential leaders of the conservative 

1586
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:03,824
party and you know,
one of the things I've told them 

1587
01:28:05,331 --> 01:28:06,164
repeatedly is you guys have something to
sell young people for the first time 

1588
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,720
that I can remember.
And that's responsibility.

1589
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:14,450
The left is selling freedom and rights.
It's like,

1590
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,313
well yeah,
where's the other half of the story 

1591
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:20,120
freedom.
That's freedom to drown.

1592
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:20,983
I mean,
I've got nothing against freedom 

1593
01:28:21,831 --> 01:28:22,664
obviously,
but there's no rights without 

1594
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:27,770
responsibilities and there's no freedom 
without tradition.

1595
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:30,470
So somebody's got to tell the other half
of the story.

1596
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:33,890
So Dr. Peterson three more questions.
Is that okay?

1597
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:35,420
We don't want to wear you down.
Sure.

1598
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,860
Okay.
That's,

1599
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:38,090
you're too late for that.

1600
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:44,163
Thanks a lot Jordan.
I'm remembering a conversation we had 

1601
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,550
about a month ago.
Yep.

1602
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:53,650
Cafe in ottawa.
And some of the issues we discussed then

1603
01:28:53,651 --> 01:28:55,810
brought up again today.
Uh,

1604
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:59,590
it leads to certain we didn't resolve 
anything.

1605
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:02,310
I think ultimately,
and I doubt if we ever will,

1606
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:06,240
and it seems to me the real problem is 
something you mentioned today.

1607
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:07,433
We could go a little further with it.
It's the question that's pontius pilots 

1608
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,900
question,
the first postmodernist what is truth?

1609
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,573
And it was taken up many times,
but by nature and the genealogy of 

1610
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:18,474
morals were all truth is interpretation.
And of course this is not the case with 

1611
01:29:21,721 --> 01:29:24,270
nisha and anybody who follows him,
as you pointed out,

1612
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:25,553
because that's somebody else's truth,
that there is no truth and therefore 

1613
01:29:27,841 --> 01:29:30,770
what do you do with that?
And you're into the problem of the creek

1614
01:29:30,771 --> 01:29:34,920
and liar.
But here is the problem for me even with

1615
01:29:34,921 --> 01:29:36,510
your talk,
which is as usual,

1616
01:29:36,511 --> 01:29:37,344
brilliant and I think grounded and in 
tremendous amount of factual 

1617
01:29:40,351 --> 01:29:41,184
information.

1618
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:45,270
I was asked once a,
after a book of mine came out,

1619
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:47,400
which was contested hockley by many 
people.

1620
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:50,610
What gave me the right to think I had 
the truth.

1621
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:51,444
This was an interviewer in toronto for 
the random house thing and why did I 

1622
01:29:55,981 --> 01:29:56,814
think what I was saying was true.
Who was I to say that I had the truth 

1623
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:02,430
and I said,
I don't have the truth,

1624
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,953
and I had to come up with some 
explanation quickly in some kind of 

1625
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:07,740
phrase and it just occurred to me.
I said,

1626
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,710
all I have is this credible 
verisimilitude.

1627
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,020
What is credible?
Various similitude.

1628
01:30:13,050 --> 01:30:15,420
He wanted to know.
I said a,

1629
01:30:15,421 --> 01:30:18,870
it depends on gathering as much evidence
as you possibly can,

1630
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:21,510
even if you have to counter your own 
biases.

1631
01:30:21,511 --> 01:30:22,344
You just said with as least the least 
amount of deceit or self indulgence as 

1632
01:30:26,731 --> 01:30:30,600
possible,
and the second factor is common sense,

1633
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,910
which seems to be not so common these 
days.

1634
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:34,163
So if you can put evidence and coMmon 
sense together and at the same time try 

1635
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:40,950
and marshall and monitor your own 
proclivities.

1636
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,383
I went right,
but that was hard with my book as I was 

1637
01:30:44,881 --> 01:30:48,630
left before I could go right and I had 
to make that decision.

1638
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,493
Do I want to go right and lose all my 
friends or do I want to stay left and 

1639
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:55,980
you know,
have catholic men and joy my friends and

1640
01:30:55,981 --> 01:30:58,920
saw I had to go right?
Because that's what the evidence told me

1641
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,710
against my own desires.
So honesty,

1642
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:06,711
if you can manage it,
evidence and common sense,

1643
01:31:06,781 --> 01:31:08,910
but here's the problem.
Truths.

1644
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:12,220
It's still there.
How do you get from credible?

1645
01:31:12,221 --> 01:31:14,970
Uh,
various similitude to truth.

1646
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:17,720
Where is the bridge?
How do you get there?

1647
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:21,120
Nobody can say that ultimately,
yes,

1648
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:24,390
but the problem I think you can,
you can say certain things are true.

1649
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,680
Certain dates,
etc. Etc.

1650
01:31:25,800 --> 01:31:28,830
Certain things have happened for men 
have suffered as a result of feminism.

1651
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,400
All this is true,
but we're truth seems to founder is when

1652
01:31:32,401 --> 01:31:33,234
you enter the realm of cars who has the 
truth to explain why feminism developed 

1653
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:43,620
in the way it did,
or why climate warming or global warming

1654
01:31:43,621 --> 01:31:46,250
developed in the way in d did.
We can point out the facts.

1655
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:47,200
This is wrong,
this is wrong,

1656
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:50,910
this is happening.
But when you get out of the element,

1657
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:55,140
the region of events and into the region
of the cause of his,

1658
01:31:56,910 --> 01:31:57,743
that's the bridge,
the gap from credible verisimilitude to 

1659
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:01,144
truth,
and I franKly don't know how to manage 

1660
01:32:03,371 --> 01:32:04,204
that.
So the conclusion I'm coming to is a 

1661
01:32:06,101 --> 01:32:07,840
little bit different from your 
conclusion.

1662
01:32:07,841 --> 01:32:11,290
It's not the one that I want to come to 
and I would like to resist it,

1663
01:32:11,830 --> 01:32:13,990
but the conclusion I'm coming to is 
quite simply,

1664
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:14,973
we're fucked.

1665
01:32:16,980 --> 01:32:18,720
Yes.
But that's always been true,

1666
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,550
right?
The apocalypse is always.

1667
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:21,413
That's why the apocalypse is eternal 
because the world's always coming to an 

1668
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:27,810
end and it's actually true in small ways
and in great ways.

1669
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:33,220
I mean with regards to to your,
your ideas about truth.

1670
01:32:33,301 --> 01:32:38,130
I would say that like language truth is 
more like a process.

1671
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:40,850
And I would say it's,
it's,

1672
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:41,743
it's a process that you actually 
embodied rather than conceptualiZe 

1673
01:32:44,401 --> 01:32:47,910
abstractly to.
One of the ways I've thought about it is

1674
01:32:47,911 --> 01:32:51,960
that if you're seeking the truth and 
what you don't know is more important to

1675
01:32:51,961 --> 01:32:55,500
you than what you know.
And that's a fundamental orientation,

1676
01:32:55,501 --> 01:32:56,310
right?
I mean,

1677
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:59,400
what I'm doing,
what I've been doing since september,

1678
01:32:59,401 --> 01:33:01,290
and I've had friends who've been helping
me with this,

1679
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:02,124
but I think I've been doing this for a 
long time as I'm trying to figure out 

1680
01:33:04,081 --> 01:33:04,980
where I'm wrong.

1681
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:07,920
I'm watching the audience to see if I'm 
making mistake.

1682
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:08,754
I'm listening to my friends who were 
watching my youtube videos telling me 

1683
01:33:10,951 --> 01:33:15,570
what I'm a little too angry maybe or 
maybe too pompous or too noisy,

1684
01:33:15,571 --> 01:33:18,270
or you know,
all the different ways that you can fail

1685
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:19,104
in front of an audience.
I'm listening to them and listening to 

1686
01:33:21,091 --> 01:33:24,390
the comments and I'm trying to modify 
myself accordingly.

1687
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:25,603
You know,
and so you live in error and strive 

1688
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:28,164
towards the truth and it's in that 
striving that the truth is most 

1689
01:33:30,541 --> 01:33:31,374
accurately embodied.
But then I would also say one other 

1690
01:33:33,331 --> 01:33:34,164
thing,
and this is what I like about the 

1691
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:36,210
existentialists,
is that,

1692
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:37,410
you know,
there's,

1693
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:38,243
there's a kind of emphasis on pragmatic 
truth among the existentialists because 

1694
01:33:41,341 --> 01:33:46,170
they claim that your truth is something 
that you should act out not merely hold.

1695
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,950
Because to act out is to believe that 
it's a definition,

1696
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:50,250
right?

1697
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:50,551
It's,
it's,

1698
01:33:50,551 --> 01:33:52,470
it's not,
it's not precisely a proposition,

1699
01:33:52,471 --> 01:33:56,970
it's a definition.
And so I've found some things that I was

1700
01:33:56,971 --> 01:34:01,971
confident in enough into risk acting out
and so that's what I'm doing to the best

1701
01:34:03,751 --> 01:34:06,120
of my ability and then I'm watching what
happens and,

1702
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:10,620
and I'm watching what happens if other 
people act oUt the propositions and w as

1703
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:13,830
far as I can tell.
So far so good.

1704
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:15,510
I mean,
I,

1705
01:34:15,970 --> 01:34:16,803
I don't,
I wouldn't say that my position right 

1706
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:22,140
now is to be,
what would you envied?

1707
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:26,140
It's very stressful.
I mean since september I basically be an

1708
01:34:26,141 --> 01:34:31,110
imposition of
any misTake is fatal for,

1709
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,340
for all intents and purposes,
you know,

1710
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:36,960
and that's very stressful to be that 
hypervigilant and uh,

1711
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:38,273
but by the same token,
the public response to what I've been 

1712
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:43,960
doing has been overwhelmingly positive.
You know,

1713
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:46,640
I've only got three pieces of hate mail 
which,

1714
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:48,330
which just staggers me,
you know,

1715
01:34:48,331 --> 01:34:50,880
and,
and the comments on youtube for example,

1716
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:54,150
are,
are like 50 to one positive and I mean,

1717
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:54,840
who,
yeah,

1718
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,700
maybe it's a biased sample.
I can't tell,

1719
01:34:56,701 --> 01:34:57,900
but,
but,

1720
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:02,870
and the other thing,
you know,

1721
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:03,704
I'd been trying to rip holes in the 
ideas that I presented to you today for 

1722
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,650
really like with all my intellectual 
capability for as long.

1723
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,050
Every time I lecture I'm trying to do 
the same thing is like,

1724
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:14,570
is there something in this that I 
haven't got right?

1725
01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:16,610
Because I'm trying.
I was trying to look for some,

1726
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,310
a rock at the bottom of things,
you know,

1727
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:23,780
and partly why I decided that I wasn't 
going to use those damn words is because

1728
01:35:23,781 --> 01:35:27,650
I think the rock at the bottom of things
is honest speech.

1729
01:35:27,740 --> 01:35:32,090
I really believed that it seems to me to
be right and

1730
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,353
that's good enough.
So I'll act it out and see what happens 

1731
01:35:36,251 --> 01:35:37,390
as best I can.
I mean,

1732
01:35:37,391 --> 01:35:38,224
I'm not claiming to be.
I'm not claiming to be any more honest 

1733
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:42,280
than anyone else.
You know?

1734
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:43,480
Seriously,
I'm not.

1735
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:44,663
I did that.
That's a big claim to make you better 

1736
01:35:46,271 --> 01:35:48,370
watch your bloody step if you're going 
to say that,

1737
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:49,653
but that doesn't mean I don't believe 
that on a speech is the pathway to 

1738
01:35:53,321 --> 01:35:57,850
redemption because I do believe that.
So I know that's strange language,

1739
01:35:57,851 --> 01:36:00,370
but you know,
that's still,

1740
01:36:00,490 --> 01:36:04,120
it's the most accurate language for that
kind of conceptualization.

1741
01:36:04,690 --> 01:36:05,523
So

1742
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:13,460
during your presentation,
your,

1743
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:17,790
your emphasis is always been on the 
truth.

1744
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:18,820
I mean,
um,

1745
01:36:19,190 --> 01:36:20,023
the,
the man who strays from the group to 

1746
01:36:23,761 --> 01:36:28,761
find the truth and comes back to it,
etc. Oh,

1747
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:30,693
I'm,
his emphasis has been throughout on 

1748
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:36,750
truth.
And my question is this,

1749
01:36:37,590 --> 01:36:42,590
I take it that truth is a necessary 
condition for an idea being important at

1750
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:43,883
some level.
It's not at all obvious and it's a 

1751
01:36:45,811 --> 01:36:47,700
sufficient condition.
I mean,

1752
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:50,280
some truths are surely uninteresting,
boring.

1753
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:53,820
Um,
and others are really important.

1754
01:36:54,450 --> 01:36:56,490
And,
and in particular,

1755
01:36:56,491 --> 01:36:59,150
ideas about value.
Now,

1756
01:36:59,160 --> 01:36:59,993
I'm not sure whether you wanted to 
classify claims about value as being 

1757
01:37:04,441 --> 01:37:08,280
susceptible of truth or falsity.
That's sort of been a long standing,

1758
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:11,280
you know,
questioning the philosophical world,

1759
01:37:11,281 --> 01:37:12,114
but uh,
but which is the right thing to say 

1760
01:37:13,681 --> 01:37:15,060
about those,
but let's,

1761
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:19,920
if we suppose that we include those,
it would be a way of,

1762
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,790
of,
uh,

1763
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:23,010
obscuring the contrast I'm pointing to 
make,

1764
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:23,873
which is surely we need an additional 
variable which is the value of these 

1765
01:37:30,451 --> 01:37:35,451
ideas and it's not.
I was wondering whether you were in,

1766
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,013
we're supposing that you had at least 
implicitly some kind of general 

1767
01:37:40,441 --> 01:37:45,441
criterion of value of that kind that 
applies in your theory or whether that's

1768
01:37:45,631 --> 01:37:46,430
open ended.

1769
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:49,010
No,
I have a criteria because it didn't.

1770
01:37:49,011 --> 01:37:49,844
I mean that's a fundamental question and
I am talking about values rather than 

1771
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,790
empirical facts of which there are an 
infinity right.

1772
01:37:56,791 --> 01:38:00,210
And so it's tHe application of the facts
to the problems of life.

1773
01:38:00,211 --> 01:38:03,270
That's the,
that's the problem because there's a lot

1774
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:05,310
of facts,
but I would say,

1775
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:08,150
and I got this partly from piaget 
because cpa,

1776
01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:11,340
one of the things that jumped piaget was
trying to do is to understand.

1777
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:14,190
He was actually trying to mediate 
between religion and science.

1778
01:38:14,191 --> 01:38:15,024
That's what drove his entire 
intellectual career and he came up with 

1779
01:38:18,301 --> 01:38:21,620
this idea of the aquilla braided state,
which is an idea I really liked,

1780
01:38:21,621 --> 01:38:26,430
so imagine two teams of five people 
pursuing a goal.

1781
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,713
it's the same goal for both teams,
but team a has been forcibly compelled 

1782
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:36,990
to attain the goal and team b is doing 
it voluntarily.

1783
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,340
his proposition was is that in a,
in an even in a race,

1784
01:38:41,341 --> 01:38:42,174
that was even all other things 
considered that the team that was 

1785
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:45,474
composed of voluntary participants would
outperform the team that was compelled 

1786
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:49,733
and I believe that ben and he and he 
basically said it's enforcement costs 

1787
01:38:52,441 --> 01:38:53,274
that make the difference and that's a 
compelling argument for me and so I've 

1788
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:57,564
been expanding on that.
Partly it's like piaget via young I 

1789
01:39:00,751 --> 01:39:04,140
would say is the intellectual pathway.
It's like the,

1790
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:05,243
the,
the proper aim for value is something 

1791
01:39:07,381 --> 01:39:08,214
like what's good for me in a way that's 
good for me tomorrow and next week and 

1792
01:39:14,371 --> 01:39:17,460
next month and next year because 
timeframe matters a lot,

1793
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:22,590
so that's a serious constraint and then 
what's good for me now and the future me

1794
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,800
in a way that's also good for the other 
people around me,

1795
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,693
if that's possible,
and then also broader society if that's 

1796
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:30,024
possible across multiple time frames and
that sort of like the ultimate 

1797
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:34,014
equilibrated state.
And so that's a hypothetical ideal 

1798
01:39:36,901 --> 01:39:38,170
obviously,
but

1799
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:46,050
a
number of things which are,

1800
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:51,540
which are good,
that same criteria but different.

1801
01:39:51,590 --> 01:39:55,720
Lots of them,
we don't want to get it right,

1802
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:57,290
but a sort of single criteria,

1803
01:40:00,460 --> 01:40:01,660
well I know,
but I think

1804
01:40:01,690 --> 01:40:03,610
take it to graduate and that filters 
out.

1805
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:04,623
Yeah.

1806
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:06,143
But it leaves a whole lot of it in and 
that's interesting and I think that's a 

1807
01:40:11,391 --> 01:40:15,510
good thing myself,
but certainly it's not obvious that that

1808
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:16,344
wouldn't be true.

1809
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:19,880
I think there's commonalities among the 
set of solutions.

1810
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:21,673
That's basically,
that's the proposition that I'm putting 

1811
01:40:23,121 --> 01:40:23,954
forward is that there are.
And I think those would be akin to 

1812
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:27,043
young's archetypes.
There are commonalities across the sets 

1813
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:32,810
of solutions and so,
and they're reflective of people's,

1814
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:35,720
I would say basic nature,
roughly speaking.

1815
01:40:35,721 --> 01:40:36,554
I mean it's partly why human beings that
are isolated and have been forever can 

1816
01:40:40,491 --> 01:40:43,010
learn to trade with one another for 
example,

1817
01:40:43,011 --> 01:40:45,200
because they can.
And so there's,

1818
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:46,353
there's,
there are constraints built into that 

1819
01:40:48,951 --> 01:40:52,700
requirement that I just described that 
weed out most solutions,

1820
01:40:52,820 --> 01:40:54,220
which also I think the answer

1821
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,053
to the postmodern dilemma,
which is well because you're kind of 

1822
01:40:57,311 --> 01:40:58,300
posing it,
which is well,

1823
01:40:58,301 --> 01:41:01,180
how do you know there isn't an 
indefinite number of solutions.

1824
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:04,360
And I would say because the,
the,

1825
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:05,213
the constraints on the solution space 
are so intense that very few variance 

1826
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,280
manage.
Because if you make a big mistake,

1827
01:41:12,281 --> 01:41:15,350
your dad or people or people gang up on 
you or like you know,

1828
01:41:15,351 --> 01:41:16,184
you either run into the world headlong 
and parish or you transgressed against 

1829
01:41:20,681 --> 01:41:23,590
your fellow people and they are not very
happy about that.

1830
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,800
And so the set of solutions that allows 
you to simultaneously exist in the world

1831
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:33,190
and in the social world for a reasonable
length of time there,

1832
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:36,820
I think there's a very limited number of
solutions to that problem.

1833
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:42,450
It Just seems to be
in your universe in a way that

1834
01:41:50,150 --> 01:41:50,983
restricts.

1835
01:41:57,420 --> 01:41:59,180
What's that?
Well,

1836
01:41:59,181 --> 01:42:01,400
I mean,
the only thing I can say is that,

1837
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:06,590
that I think there are a set of 
solutions that bounded in some manner,

1838
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:07,973
even though it may be quite large,
but there's still a pattern to be 

1839
01:42:10,471 --> 01:42:12,090
detected among.
It's like,

1840
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,223
it's like the pattern that you can 
detect that unites everything that's 

1841
01:42:16,021 --> 01:42:17,940
musical.
You know,

1842
01:42:17,941 --> 01:42:18,774
there's something,
although there's very diverse forms of 

1843
01:42:20,491 --> 01:42:21,324
music,
there's something that emerges from all 

1844
01:42:23,191 --> 01:42:25,590
those forms that allows you to generate 
the category.

1845
01:42:25,591 --> 01:42:28,620
And I think the same is the case with 
ethical behavior,

1846
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,760
although even though it's subject to the
constraints of time and place as well.

1847
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:34,550
So.
Well,

1848
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,483
thanks very much Jordan.
This was really a great presentation 

1849
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:40,680
that you've done.
I wanted to end with some encouragement.

1850
01:42:40,681 --> 01:42:41,514
First of all,
I've looked at the extent of your 

1851
01:42:43,081 --> 01:42:47,130
coverage on youtube and one of my areas 
is digital media and journalism and it's

1852
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:49,560
incredibly impressive as you probably 
already know.

1853
01:42:49,800 --> 01:42:50,633
So the level of influence that you have 
is really incredible and that's a good 

1854
01:42:54,811 --> 01:42:57,000
thing because that brings me to my 
second point.

1855
01:42:57,001 --> 01:42:57,834
I've watched a lot of your stuff and 
you're not embarrassing for those of us 

1856
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:04,050
who hold similar views.
Great,

1857
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,053
great.
That's good.

1858
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:06,933
I am.
I'm,

1859
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,610
I'm,
I am definitely.

1860
01:43:09,780 --> 01:43:10,613
In fact,
I mean there are a lot of people who 

1861
01:43:12,301 --> 01:43:15,180
espouse similar views and they give me 
shivers.

1862
01:43:15,181 --> 01:43:17,220
They get,
they make me sick to my stomach a bit,

1863
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:22,170
but you haven't embarrassed us,
me and that's good.

1864
01:43:22,171 --> 01:43:23,004
And secondly,
I've seen that you have moderated even 

1865
01:43:24,961 --> 01:43:29,961
your approach as saying the same things,
but you become even more erudite and the

1866
01:43:31,231 --> 01:43:32,064
way that you present your arguments and,
and I really appreciate the effort that 

1867
01:43:35,491 --> 01:43:36,324
you're putting into this because the 
number of places that you've been and 

1868
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,700
the number of shows that you've appeared
on,

1869
01:43:41,701 --> 01:43:42,534
I know must be very tax taxing.
And so I want to just acknowledge that 

1870
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:47,873
you're doing this not for your own good 
and I really the effort that you're 

1871
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:52,934
putting into this because this is a lot 
of personal effort that you've expended 

1872
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:58,670
and I really appreciate it.

1873
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:04,450
Yes,
thank you.

1874
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:06,690
Because this is the question.
The question is,

1875
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:09,180
I've heard a story everyone,
but the question is this,

1876
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,433
I keep hearing people say if,
and these are my colleagues who are 

1877
01:44:12,571 --> 01:44:16,500
cowards incidentally who say if only he 
were nicer.

1878
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:21,240
And you've mentioned that already.
Do you really think that an honestly,

1879
01:44:21,241 --> 01:44:23,790
this is the question then,
do we need to be nicer?

1880
01:44:23,850 --> 01:44:26,110
Do you need to be nicer?
What really?

1881
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:27,940
Just the response to that if you would.

1882
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:31,043
I need to be nicer when it's necessary 
to be nice and not nicer when it isn't 

1883
01:44:34,441 --> 01:44:37,980
and I need to learn to distinguish those
more carefully,

1884
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:40,860
continually more carefully and ho 
hypothetically.

1885
01:44:40,861 --> 01:44:41,694
I'm getting better at it.
The fact that my job isn't at stake at 

1886
01:44:44,881 --> 01:44:49,050
the moment actually does take some of 
the agitation pressure off.

1887
01:44:49,051 --> 01:44:49,884
You know?
I mean,

1888
01:44:50,010 --> 01:44:53,190
at the beginning of this I was quite 
embattled,

1889
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,560
let's say,
and also less

1890
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:02,240
accustomed to this crazy sequence of 
events and so,

1891
01:45:03,241 --> 01:45:05,820
you know,
I didn't know exactly what I was doing,

1892
01:45:05,821 --> 01:45:07,980
not that I do now,
but I'm,

1893
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:11,010
and I'm more resigned to it in some 
sense as well,

1894
01:45:11,011 --> 01:45:14,010
and I'm not trying to present myself as 
you know,

1895
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:15,253
I don't regard what's happened to me as 
any sort of calamity even though it's 

1896
01:45:18,031 --> 01:45:22,500
very complicated,
but it has its own momentum and,

1897
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:25,770
and that's okay,
I guess,

1898
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:27,930
but I'm,
I'm trying to

1899
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:34,050
weave my way through this with the least
amount of enmity possible.

1900
01:45:34,680 --> 01:45:35,513
Right.
But that's something you have to 

1901
01:45:36,181 --> 01:45:41,181
continually feel out and hopefully 
that's working better.

1902
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:42,773
That's the plan.

1903
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,080
Thanks.
