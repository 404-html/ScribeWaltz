The Bible is a series of books written,
edited,

2
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:14,541
and assembled over thousands of years.
It contains the most influential stories

3
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,074
of mankind.
Knowledge of these stories is essential 

4
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,120
to a deep understanding of western 
culture,

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,433
which is in turn,
vital to proper psychological health as 

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,730
human beings,
our cultural animals,

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:27,863
and to societal stability.
These stories are neither history as we 

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,170
commonly conceived that nor empirical 
science.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
Instead their investigations into the 
structure of being itself and calls to 

10
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,250
action.
Within that being,

11
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,010
they have deep psychological 
significance.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,253
Hi everyone.
I just wanted to make a quick video to 

13
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:50,843
remind everyone or let everybody who's 
watching know that I'm starting my 

14
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,344
series on the stories of the Bible,
the psychological significance of the 

15
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:01,470
stories on the Bible.
On Tuesday,

16
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:06,210
May 16th at the Isabel Bader theater in 
downtown Toronto.

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,810
I'll put the address and everything at 
the bottom of the video.

18
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:10,644
In the description.
I want to delve into the biblical 

19
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:16,800
stories from a psychological perspective
and I've wanted to do it for a long time

20
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:19,590
and have done it in part in my maps of 
meaning series,

21
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,424
but the biblical stories are are what 
their canonical in relationship to the 

22
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,210
rest of our culture.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,630
It's very difficult to understand 
Western civilization itself,

24
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:34,080
unless you're grounded in the biblical 
stories there.

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:34,933
There are like a precondition for 
knowledge of the humanities and and 

26
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:42,630
knowledge of history for that matter and
so I want to improve my understanding of

27
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,464
them and share what I'm able to figure 
out with everybody that I can and so I 

28
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:51,180
wanted to just make a quick video to let
everyone know that I'm going to run a 12

29
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,540
week series about two hours lecture per 
week,

30
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,673
starting May 16th and running until 
approximately mid August pretty much 

31
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,740
every week except a couple where I 
couldn't get the theater.

32
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,050
It's really nice theater,
so that would be good.

33
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,884
I'd also like to let everybody know that
the videos will be a taped a thanks to 

34
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:10,434
my patron subscribers and put on youtube
probably within a week or two after I 

35
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,700
initially showed them as soon as we can 
get them edited and all of that.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,090
So anyways,
there's still season tickets left.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,823
That's the tickets that will allow you 
entrance to all of the lectures and 

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,550
their individual tickets left for each 
lecture as well and you can get those at

39
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,310
Jordan b Peterson Dotcom.
But as I said,

40
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,144
I'll put all the instructions and the 
details in the description of the video 

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,763
below.
So I'm tuned in on Youtube if you're 

42
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,990
inclined to and if you're in Toronto and
you'd like to see them live,

43
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:45,870
then come down and see them live.
It should be really interesting.

44
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:49,950
I hope that's the plan anyway,
so thanks a lot and uh,

45
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,870
hopefully we'll see you there.
Otherwise.

46
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,440
Well you'll see them on youtube and 
that's good too.

47
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,570
Thanks a lot.
Bye.

48
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:58,404
Bye.
