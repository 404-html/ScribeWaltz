1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,460
Okay.
If I remember correctly,

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,440
we stopped with the clocks.
That's true.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,131
Yes.
Good.

4
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:05,964
Okay.
So one of the things I mentioned was 

5
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:08,004
that the emphasis on the clocks here is 
to divide time up and the film makers 

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:21,441
emphasize time to tell you in some sense
that we're in the prosaic normal world.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,860
And then in a sense you could say that 
when the clock stops,

8
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,020
which you'll see happening,
we,

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,740
we move into a different dimension 
completely.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,060
And I think I mentioned when we went 
through this last time,

11
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,780
that young hypothesized for example,
that there was no time in the collective

12
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,614
unconscious.
And what that means is that there's a 

13
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,210
strata of knowing,
I suppose,

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,780
that you can think of as outside the 
normal stream of individual life.

15
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,390
So it's sort of Super Ordinance and,
and you know,

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,253
here's one way to think about it.
So it's pretty obvious that your 

17
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,920
personality can transform.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:07,020
So then you might ask yourself,
well,

19
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,240
what is it that guides that 
transformation?

20
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,080
Because in some sense it has to be 
outside the thing that's transforming.

21
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,783
And you could say that the,
the place that's outside of that 

22
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:25,011
transformation is this place out of time
and space that you is describing.

23
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,390
And it would be,
it's the same place as a long time ago,

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,360
you know,
in a fairy tale which refers to some,

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,960
it's like you've been collapsed pass.
That's another way of thinking about it.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,573
Or you can think about it like the 
amount of time that passes when you're 

27
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:41,814
asleep as far as your consciousness is 
concerned because there's no real sense 

28
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,490
of duration.
There is if you,

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,860
obviously if you wake up and remember a 
dream,

30
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,770
but even dreams take extreme liberties 
with time.

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,903
I'm sure you've had the experience where
your alarm goes off and the sound is 

32
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,344
incorporated into the dream and it's as 
if the dream has been going on for a 

33
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,350
very long period of time and the alarm 
makes sense in the context.

34
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,900
Even though it may have only been 
ringing for a few seconds.

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,260
Freud observed how much time could deal 
dilate and extend in dreams in,

36
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,674
in,
in his book the interpretation of 

37
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:15,804
dreams.
And,

38
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,420
um,
it's a fairly well known phenomena.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,650
So we're in time now.
At this point,

40
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:27,030
Pinocchio is already got his mouth.
So in principle he's capable to speak.

41
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,090
And so now we're in time and then the 
next week we've got the created creature

42
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,440
at this point.
So you might think about that as the,

43
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,480
as the first stage of development.
And the way I look at it with regards to

44
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,970
this movie is that,
you know,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,690
really the next time we see Pinocchio 
with Japan.

46
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,890
Oh,
he's off to school.

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,413
And so you might say that this is the 
moment that ends childhood and that's 

48
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,184
the developmental stage we're at.
He's ready to launch himself into the 

49
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:57,780
world or he has at least after this next
scene.

50
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,500
And so that's where we pick them up in 
the developmental progress is entry into

51
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,334
the world.

52
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Oh No,
please.

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,793
Okay.
So obviously obviously all this is 

54
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,360
signifying the transition into 
unconscious.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Oh
No.

56
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Well we can sneak in name.
Yeah.

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Hi.
Okay.

58
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,690
You are most yolks.
Aw,

59
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:17,683
come on.

60
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,550
Okay.
So at that point did your pedo expresses

61
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,430
his,
I would say the key element of his value

62
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:28,264
system as a father or you could say the 
key element of his archetipal role as 

63
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:34,234
the good father.
Because of course the father is 

64
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:38,260
separated archetypically into the,
you know,

65
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:43,261
the positive farther in the negative 
[inaudible] and you know,

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,433
we've already established the 
proposition that your values guide your 

67
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,741
perceptions and actions.
And so if it's Japan,

68
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:57,860
it was fundamental desire is to produce 
something real well,

69
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:58,694
first of all,
we don't know exactly what's what real 

70
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,944
means at this point,
but we obviously know that it's not 

71
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,340
merely a wooden marinette Marionette,
right?

72
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,590
Because it's contrast it with his 
current state and your patio is resigned

73
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,930
to the fact that that's a highly 
improbable event.

74
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,810
And so it doesn't necessarily always 
occur.

75
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,973
And I would say that's a hint in the 
context of the movie of a variety of 

76
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:21,950
things.

77
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,150
But one of them is that it isn't 
necessarily the case that people get out

78
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,984
of the marionette stage.
So now I think the thing that makes you 

79
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,220
pedal a good father rather than a 
terrible father,

80
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:36,290
a son devouring father,
let's say,

81
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,570
is that he's actually aiming at 
developing an autonomous individual.

82
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,213
And so that also means he's aiming to 
produce something that will transcend 

83
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:51,140
him and leave him right and that's 
capable of operating on it on his own.

84
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,270
It's the very definition of a good 
father.

85
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,160
And so that's why he's invested in this 
process so far.

86
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,560
That's his goal.
And we know the background,

87
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:03,890
we know that he's a master carver and it
looks like he's a good guy.

88
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,724
He likes kittens and he likes fish and 
he likes to sing and he likes music and 

89
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,800
he likes to play and he likes to make 
toys.

90
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,970
You know,
those are all,

91
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,390
and his place is comfortable and warm 
and inviting and all of those things.

92
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:15,224
So you know,
there's a very maternal element to it 

93
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:21,740
almost because you know the house is so 
cozy and so well kept.

94
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,200
You might ask yourself,
what,

95
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:24,034
where's the feminine element?
You don't have to wait very long before 

96
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:28,550
you get it.
You had a clue about that.

97
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,413
Now,
and what happens next is that the star 

98
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,030
that we saw at the beginning of the 
film,

99
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,420
when it was shining over a scene that 
looked very much like a,

100
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,890
like a Bethlehem Nativity scene,
that star makes its reappearance.

101
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,650
And we already talked about what a star 
might represent,

102
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,600
but we'll go over it very briefly.
You can say,

103
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,820
well,
a star represents a light shining in the

104
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:50,654
darkness and it's,
it's a symbol of value and purity and 

105
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,660
light and illumination and 
enlightenment.

106
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,270
And it's also something that transcends 
the horizon.

107
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:03,140
It's above the horizon.
And what happens is that Japan,

108
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:07,130
no wishes on this star and what he 
wishes is that Pinocchio,

109
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,023
he could become a real boy.
And so partly what the film is 

110
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:15,431
indicating through that ritualistic 
gesture is that the desire to produce an

111
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,084
individual period or the forces that 
have to conspire to produce an 

112
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:23,750
individual cannot be brought about 
unless the,

113
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,520
the participants in that process have 
elevated their,

114
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,803
their value structure to something 
that's beyond what's immediately 

115
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,930
evident.
And you might even say secular or,

116
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,380
or,
or earthly or,

117
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,360
I mean,
I know those are all medieval terms,

118
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:39,194
but,
but that's really the idea that unless 

119
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:46,061
you raise your eyes above normal,
the normal value structure,

120
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,290
you won't be able to participate in this
process.

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,220
Now,
you know,

122
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,320
if we make reference back to the story 
of the Buddha,

123
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,450
you remember when the angel comes to 
visit the Buddha,

124
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,190
he tells us,
he tells a story.

125
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
When the angel comes to visit the 
Buddhist farther before the Buddha is 

126
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,614
born,
he tells him that his son is either 

127
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,600
going to be a spiritual leader or a 
great king.

128
00:09:05,601 --> 00:09:10,380
And of course the Buddhist farther being
a practical man immediately goes for the

129
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,040
great king theory.
He,

130
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,900
he stuck to earthly desires,
so to speak.

131
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,330
And instead of looking for something 
that's transcendent,

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,860
and then you might ask yourself,
well,

133
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:23,430
what constitutes transcendent?
And I would say a variety of things that

134
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:25,290
we'll explore in the course of the 
movie.

135
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,124
But one of the things,
one of the ways that you might 

136
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:28,914
conceptualize it as that it's the 
difference between horace and no cyrus 

137
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,730
or maybe it's the difference between oh 
Cyrus and the union of Horace and earth.

138
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,240
Oh Cyrus,
you can look at it.

139
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,074
I either of those ways.
You remember now when horace goes to 

140
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,754
rescue a cyrus,
he has to go back into the underworld 

141
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,680
and haul his father out of the depths 
and as fathers down,

142
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,060
they're sort of half blind and three 
quarters to dad then.

143
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,810
And so the transcendent things,
which is often represented by the eye,

144
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,620
it's,
it's also often wreck.

145
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,990
You see this in Christian symbolism of 
fair bit.

146
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:02,991
So on top of cathedrals in the dome,
often what you'll see is tears of people

147
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,123
and or tiers of angels.
And then at the top you'll either see 

148
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:08,244
God the father or Christ.
And the idea there is that what that 

149
00:10:11,491 --> 00:10:13,740
represents.
So let's say the logos,

150
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:17,460
which is roughly equivalent to horace,
I mean men,

151
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,620
by the way,
I think I probably told you this,

152
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:24,621
but horace and Christ share many,
many features in common.

153
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,900
You know,
and the notion is,

154
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:30,990
is that as the methodology of 
Christianity developed,

155
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,430
it encapsulated a tremendous amount of 
the symbolism and story that was already

156
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:38,370
present in the Egyptian myths and 
incorporated into the,

157
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,443
into the new religion.
So it's not that surprising that they 

158
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,224
share a parallels,
but it's very useful to know what the 

159
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,570
parallels mean.

160
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,180
There's,
there's a pyramid of power,

161
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,014
there's a hierarchy,
but there's something that stands 

162
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,190
outside the hierarchy that fixes the 
hierarchy and reshapes it and gives rise

163
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:57,930
to it.
Well,

164
00:10:57,931 --> 00:11:00,840
that's exactly it.
It fixes it and shapes it and gives rise

165
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:04,560
to it.
And that that's something that you might

166
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:07,350
think about as roughly equivalent to the
autonomous individual.

167
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,860
Because at that point you're no longer a
marionette and tell us,

168
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,210
so piaget's highest stage of moral 
development,

169
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:14,910
by the way,
because when children hit that stage,

170
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,860
if they do,
and not all do,

171
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,430
instead of conceiving of morality as 
following the rules you conceive of,

172
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:25,230
morality is following the rules when 
that's appropriate,

173
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,840
but adjusting the rules when that's 
necessary.

174
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:32,370
And so you start to view yourself not 
only as a follower of the tradition,

175
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,204
let's say,
and not only has something that's 

176
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,484
obedient but also as something that has 
a say in what the game is going to be 

177
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,200
going forward.

178
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,843
And so,
so we're going to surmise that what 

179
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,504
Japan is trying to produce since he 
isn't producing and Marionette is 

180
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:51,420
something that has a certain amount of 
autonomy and thus the,

181
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,313
you know,
the right to interact as an autonomous 

182
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:56,890
being with his,
with his own cultural context.

183
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,660
So now he knows that it's unlikely and 
it's also a transcendent wish.

184
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,660
It's sort of outside the dominance 
hierarchy because you,

185
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:06,490
one of the things you could say is,
Oh,

186
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:07,324
you know,
do you want your child to become an 

187
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,680
engineer or a lawyer or a doctor?
Heaven forbid a psychologist.

188
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:12,514
And in some sense all of that is 
irrelevant in relationship to this more 

189
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,014
transcendent goal because you can get to
the place of transcendence pretty much 

190
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:26,290
through any disciplinary pathway.
There has to be a disciplinary pathway,

191
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,950
but which one doesn't matter.
What matters is how you conduct yourself

192
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:31,720
while you're on the disciplinary 
pathway.

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,150
And so,
you know,

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,993
that's an interesting observation too 
because it's another thought that 

195
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,213
radically undermines the idea of moral 
relativism because the idea is while 

196
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:44,404
there can be many disciplinary systems 
and so in a sense that borrowers to the 

197
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,704
idea of moral relativism,
but there can't be a situation where 

198
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,080
there's no disciplinary system.
And you know,

199
00:12:56,081 --> 00:12:59,670
part of that is obviously that human 
beings are inculturated creatures and,

200
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,670
and we,
we just cannot exist in the absence of a

201
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,970
disciplinary system.
And you might say we can't exist.

202
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,510
Well in the absence of an optimized 
disciplinary system,

203
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,140
so okay,
so your pedo wishes upon this star.

204
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:17,054
And so he makes,
he makes content contact with something 

205
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:23,920
that's outside the normative world and 
well we'll see how that unfolds.

206
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,950
Oh
God.

207
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,740
See Japan,
I was also a little bit of a trickster,

208
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:56,660
you know,
and you saw that quite repeatedly.

209
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:57,494
He Makes Pinocchio Fall over.
He kicks his little cat in the rear end 

210
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,940
with the puppet.
Now he's making him go open the window.

211
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:06,890
Like he's playing little tricks all the 
time.

212
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,213
No one,
the trickster figure is a very complex 

213
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:10,574
and interesting figure.
Yo describe the trickster as a 

214
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:16,040
psychopomp.
And a psychopomp is someone who mediates

215
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,874
between conscious and unconscious life.
And you can think about that in 

216
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,070
relationship to comedians because what 
comedians always do and what jokes often

217
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:28,850
do is revealed truths that no one is 
willing to face.

218
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,220
You know,
when the more extreme the comedian,

219
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,700
the more likely they are to transgress 
social norms.

220
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,830
Well,
similar caneously making you laugh,

221
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,270
you know,
you can see,

222
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,110
um,
Russell Peters for example,

223
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,870
all he does is tell racist jokes,
you know,

224
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:45,704
and everyone in the audience is thrilled
about it even though they're all there 

225
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,280
in an essence identified with ethnic 
group.

226
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,323
You know,
he calls on the Arabs and then he makes 

227
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:55,634
fun of them and they all cheer.
And then he calls on the Indians and 

228
00:14:57,431 --> 00:15:00,220
makes fun of them and they all cheer and
the Chinese.

229
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,353
And it's a relief for everyone to get 
out of that sphere of the unspeakable 

230
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,463
and to,
and it puts everybody in a place of 

231
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:11,480
transcendence because for a moment 
they're outside their ethnic identity,

232
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,703
you know,
and they can laugh at themselves as 

233
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:17,960
something that can stand outside of 
their own definition.

234
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,020
And so a psychopomp is,
you know,

235
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:21,883
Freud also talked a fair bit about this 
with regards to humor because he said 

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,833
like slips of the tongue and so forth.
You can also often use them as as 

237
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,710
doorways in some sense,
into unconscious contents.

238
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:36,860
And there's just no doubt about that.
Like if you listen to people very,

239
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:37,694
very carefully,
you'll make little jokes or little 

240
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:43,190
unconscious slips and you can see if 
you're trained to see it.

241
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,960
You can see whole complexes of of often,
you know,

242
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:52,400
terribly chaotic masses underneath those
sorts of things.

243
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,060
And so their portals in a sense,
into the underworld.

244
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,583
It also is very strange.
You see this when people talk about 

245
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,490
their dreams.
I've seen this numerous times where I'll

246
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:02,324
have someone,
what I do is I have people bring me 

247
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,260
their dreams.
If they remember them,

248
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:09,410
they've written them down,
and then I listened to them once and let

249
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:14,411
my imagination start playing with them.
And then I go have the person,

250
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,523
they read the dream out loud.
Then I have them go through it sentence 

251
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:19,640
by sentence.
And we,

252
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,603
we do what's essentially free 
association from a psychoanalytic 

253
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:24,260
perspective.
You know,

254
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,160
if they talk about uh,
let's say a big box department store,

255
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,330
I might say,
well what,

256
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
what first comes to mind when you think 
about that?

257
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,493
And they'll have associations and that 
sort of lays out the cloud of concepts 

258
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:39,560
that surround that particular image.

259
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,050
And so you keep doing that,
expanding it.

260
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:44,540
And I'll throw in my associations as 
well.

261
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,450
And then we have a discussion about,
you know,

262
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,360
how that might pertain to the current 
state of their life.

263
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:51,194
And it's like,
it's like understanding a book in some 

264
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:59,021
sense or understanding of movie and 
often know what's so cool is that if you

265
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:01,214
really,
really listen to people when they use 

266
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,844
words to describe their dreams,
they'll use sentences that mean two 

267
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:08,294
things at the same time and one will 
mean it will be a description of the 

268
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,043
actual images,
stick content of the dream and at the 

269
00:17:17,331 --> 00:17:18,164
same time it will be a description of 
what that means and people don't even 

270
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:23,720
notice when they're doing it.
It's so cool.

271
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,763
You have to detach yourself and listen 
carefully because if you're following 

272
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,593
only the semantics of the conversation,
all you'll see is the reference to the 

273
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,524
dream.

274
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,460
But if you remember simultaneously that 
the dream pertains to their life,

275
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,280
then you can often,
I wish I had an example for you,

276
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:41,870
but it's so complex.
I can't,

277
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,260
I actually have dreams recorded from one
client,

278
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:49,890
about 50 of them in a row all laid out 
and we're thinking where we're,

279
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,443
the plan is to put that into book form 
and publish it because there isn't 

280
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,620
anything like that.
But,

281
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,053
so there are these holes portals through
which you can pass into an unconscious 

282
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:01,344
realm.
And you know this look when you're 

283
00:18:03,871 --> 00:18:04,704
having a conversation with people you 
know now and then if it's a group 

284
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,034
conversation now and then someone will 
say something that brings the 

285
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:12,120
conversation to a halt,
right?

286
00:18:12,121 --> 00:18:15,180
You can think of it as a non sequitur 
or,

287
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,660
and it's something that a non sequitur 
is something that doesn't fall.

288
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,673
And so particularly an unconscious 
person who isn't following the trail of 

289
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:23,534
the conversation will pipe up with 
something and it brings everyone to a 

290
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,754
halt.

291
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,870
And the reason for that is that the 
person has just manifested part of their

292
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:34,950
own unconscious structure at an 
inopportune time.

293
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,113
And it's like everyone's on one story 
and then bang another one comes to to 

294
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,250
join it.
And,

295
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,233
and
that person isn't on the same 

296
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:46,410
wavelength,
so to speak.

297
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,960
There is somewhere else.
And you know,

298
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,690
sometimes you can figure out where they 
are and generally speaking,

299
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:56,130
that is far from pleasant.
So you know,

300
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:56,964
because as Freud pointed out,
the things that you tend to keep 

301
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,000
unconscious are not the most positive 
things about you.

302
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:03,834
At least you don't think so.
There might be lots of positive down 

303
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,074
there,
you know,

304
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,750
but you're going to only get to it 
through the negative.

305
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,990
So,
so anyways,

306
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,330
a trickster figure who's playing tricks.
The other thing I think I,

307
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,370
I'm not,
I'm not,

308
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,280
I had an experience once when I was 
remembering,

309
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,830
I had a memory that from when I was very
young,

310
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,950
my father had this friend who was 
Russian,

311
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,430
very good friend who basically served me
as a grandfather.

312
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,730
And I can remember when I'm just very 
little,

313
00:19:32,731 --> 00:19:33,564
three or four sitting on the floor on a 
rug between this man and my father with 

314
00:19:38,751 --> 00:19:41,280
that fireplace going and you know,
farmhouse,

315
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,010
very,
very warm place and a very nice family.

316
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,600
I really enjoyed going there.
And my dad and this gentleman whose name

317
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:52,440
is Nick Zinner off would sit and talk.
And while he was doing that,

318
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,960
I would take my fist and try to hit his 
toes,

319
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,820
you know,
and while he was conversing,

320
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,460
he'd move his toes around.
And so we were playing this game and now

321
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:03,840
and then my dad would say rather kindly,
you know,

322
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,200
enquire whether or not I was bothering 
him and he would say,

323
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:07,591
no,
no,

324
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:10,920
it's fine.
And I realized just recently that partly

325
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,740
what he was doing with his tricks was 
sharpening me up,

326
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,083
you know,
because I'm trying to hit a moving 

327
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:16,680
target.

328
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,900
Right.
And so he keeps moving it and that means

329
00:20:18,901 --> 00:20:20,430
I have to adjust.
It's a,

330
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,840
it's a goal directed activity training,
you know,

331
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,970
and I know with kids,
the more you,

332
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,450
it's like you're willing in some sense 
or carving them.

333
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:31,284
I think carving is the right word.
The more you interact with them 

334
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:36,960
attentively,
the more sharp and focused they get.

335
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,350
And I can see people walking down the 
street with no problem,

336
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,220
who I know were never played with,
cause they sort of lumber along there,

337
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,510
sort of like,
they're like,

338
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:48,040
don't,
they're not carved and attentive.

339
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,203
They're vagan unshaped and I kind of 
think of them as uncarved blocks to 

340
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,230
Taoist idea.
Uncarved block is what the world is made

341
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,050
out of before you encounter it.
It couldn't be anything,

342
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,300
but it's nothing.
And so,

343
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,510
and often I've also dealt with children 
in places like preschool where I can see

344
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,560
the kids who are sharp and who've been 
played with.

345
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,393
They know exactly all you have to do is 
look at them with a little bit of a 

346
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,620
playful glint and they'll laugh and 
they're ready.

347
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,860
Whereas the kids that haven't be played 
with there so pathetic know,

348
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,743
I mean this,
I mean this in the literal sense of the 

349
00:21:21,191 --> 00:21:21,731
word,
you know,

350
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:22,151
it's,
it's,

351
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:22,984
it's unbelievably pathetic to see them.
So you'll sit down and the kid lumber 

352
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:30,490
over kind of blindly even and sit right 
on your lap,

353
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,960
you know?
And it's basically,

354
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,823
maybe that's a four year old kid,
three year old kid that's like pre 

355
00:21:37,211 --> 00:21:40,030
toddler behavior.
That's all they know how to do.

356
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,190
You know?
And so if you have a kid that does that,

357
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:46,600
just go and sit on a stranger.
They're so desperate for attention,

358
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,150
they can't even help it,
but they're so far behind,

359
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,590
the other kids can't even play with 
them.

360
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,630
Cause it's like playing with an 
overgrown infant,

361
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,793
you know?
And by that time it's damn near 

362
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,140
hopeless.
So,

363
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,450
so you know,
this,

364
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,360
this use of humor and tricks and teasing
and all of that,

365
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,070
I mean it can get mean,
you know,

366
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,540
if it's not bounded properly,
you have to stay on the funny side of,

367
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,703
of Tz.
But if you're constantly playing with 

368
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,960
kids,
they sharpen up.

369
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,450
And so that's another thing that 
tricksters do.

370
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:20,230
So I used to steal my daughter's dessert
all the time when she was little,

371
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,423
you know,
right from the time she started sitting 

372
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:26,560
at the table,
which was about probably 10 months older

373
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:27,400
soul,
you know,

374
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:30,460
I tried to get her to look out the 
window or something like that.

375
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:32,440
And every time she did it I'd take her 
dessert.

376
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,663
And so she got very good at it after a 
while she could tell when I was joking 

377
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:39,190
and when there was actually something 
there.

378
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,930
And by the time there she was about 
three,

379
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:41,764
I could hardly ever fooled her.
And soon after that she learned a new 

380
00:22:44,561 --> 00:22:45,394
trick,
which was if I told her to look at 

381
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:47,884
something,
she grabbed her dessert and then turn 

382
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:52,030
and look at it and put it back down,
you know.

383
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:52,864
But,
and I could really see this with mark 

384
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,533
probably to some degree more with my son
than my daughter because he was an 

385
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,530
ornery little rap and very disagreeable,
very disagreeable child.

386
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,633
And um,
I mean in the big five traits sense and 

387
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,440
you'd lay down a rule for that kid and 
he would worry that thing to death.

388
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,030
You know,
here's the rule.

389
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,133
You have to be embedded date.
Well do you mean seven 59 do you mean 

390
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:20,750
seven 59 and 30 seconds?
What about 79 you know,

391
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,770
seven 59 and 50 seconds or maybe eight 
oh two or maybe eight oh five.

392
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,273
And just constant battling right on that
edge to find out exactly where the 

393
00:23:31,841 --> 00:23:36,310
contours of the social structure was.
And a lot of that is also playing around

394
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,144
rules.
And if you're ever wondering why your 

395
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,360
children are teasing you and bothering 
you,

396
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,194
because they will do that nonstop.
It's partly because nothing is more 

397
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:45,604
valuable to a child and adult attention 
and partly because they're trying to 

398
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:52,520
figure out who the hell you are.
And so because you're the,

399
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,703
you're the Avatar of the social 
structure and so they want to know 

400
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:58,880
everything they possibly can about you.
They're not going to leave you alone.

401
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,380
So well,
that's all comment on the utility of the

402
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:04,460
trickster.
You know,

403
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:05,294
the other thing that tricks your 
daughters sometimes from a 

404
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:11,240
methodological point of view is trick 
you into behaving properly,

405
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,370
you know,
with humor or something like that.

406
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,204
And that's partly why the trickster is a
mediator between the normal domain of 

407
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:22,340
consciousness in the sort of 
transcendent archetypal realm.

408
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,653
So,

409
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,820
oh,
stop.

410
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,140
First Star.
I see.

411
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,240
Which
I think

412
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,700
my thing of Pinocchio,
just thing

413
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,203
very loving.

414
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,393
Okay.
So there was a couple of interesting 

415
00:25:27,271 --> 00:25:28,680
things that happened there.
You know,

416
00:25:28,681 --> 00:25:30,780
first you see that cuts back to the 
cricket.

417
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,050
So it's clearly that he's,
uh,

418
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,160
he's clearly involved in this and he's 
listening to see what's happening.

419
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,593
So,
and then of course he comments that 

420
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:40,050
that's not a practical,
that's not,

421
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,230
it's not practical.
That's in,

422
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,103
in some sense that's exactly right 
because practical basically means 

423
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,130
instruction and how to climb the 
particular hierarchy.

424
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,913
You know,
impractical means no instruction 

425
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:56,220
whatsoever.
But there's a transcendent practicality,

426
00:25:56,221 --> 00:26:00,000
which is more like how to operate in 
this space between hierarchies.

427
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,540
And so that's,
that's more than practical.

428
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,730
You could think about it as metta 
practical.

429
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,593
And I think really the purpose of most 
religious ed education when it's still 

430
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:14,600
grounded in its original materials so to
speak,

431
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,650
is to catalyze this Mehta identity.
You know,

432
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,300
it's sophisticated being,
Yup.

433
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,400
Can you give me,

434
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,750
well,
I would say,

435
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,853
you know,
the best example I know is the story of 

436
00:26:27,271 --> 00:26:29,580
Horus.
But if you want to relate it to your own

437
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,170
consciousness,
you know,

438
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,670
so here's an example.

439
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,760
Wait,
wait,

440
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,470
sorry we're late.

441
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,831
No,
no.

442
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:41,664
It's more than that.
It's outside of principles because 

443
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:46,440
principals have already been laid down 
as rules,

444
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,660
but rules have their problems.
You know,

445
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:53,490
because once you formulate something
in a static manner,

446
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,140
you limit the number of situations that 
it can apply to.

447
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,250
You know,
cause we couldn't say,

448
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:03,120
well don't never kill another human 
being.

449
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,160
Well,
that's a pretty good rule of thumb.

450
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:07,320
But there are situations where it's not 
tenable.

451
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,423
There has to be something that operates 
outside of the rule framework that 

452
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,733
that's,
that extracts out the spirit of the 

453
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:17,610
rules.
That's a way of thinking about it.

454
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,333
Universal.

455
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,640
Well that's,
that is what this is.

456
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:31,280
But I wouldn't call it a principle,
I would call it more of,

457
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,263
it's more like a process and the process
is tightly aligned with paying 

458
00:27:36,081 --> 00:27:37,910
attention.
Let me give you an example.

459
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,850
You're playing a musical piece.
Okay?

460
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:41,684
Now when you're practicing that piece,
what you're doing is building a motor 

461
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,530
hierarchy.
You know,

462
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,050
you start,
it's very difficult to do it.

463
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,303
You,
you practice and practice and you're 

464
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,434
automating these motor routines and 
you're driving the action from your 

465
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:55,274
whole cortex to the left hemisphere and 
then backwards and making these little 

466
00:27:58,101 --> 00:28:01,520
micro machines that are specialized for 
these operations.

467
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,590
But let's say you make a mistake while 
you attend to that,

468
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,970
you know,
so that's a,

469
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,813
that's a trigger of error.
And then what you do is slow down and 

470
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,520
analyze the motor programs that you've 
already programmed and you see where the

471
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:17,354
error is and then you correct it slowly 
and practice the correction that 

472
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:22,220
practice the correction and practice the
correction.

473
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,760
So what you're doing in a sense is 
tuning the hierarchy,

474
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:26,594
the automated hierarchy.
And the thing that I'm talking about is 

475
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,164
the thing that pays attention to error.
And that might be the best way of of 

476
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,860
conceptualizing it.
There's something that pays attention to

477
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:37,694
error or there can be,
and it's also the thing that moves up 

478
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:40,664
and down hierarchies and tries to find 
the optimal level of analysis for 

479
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:49,310
correction and then does the correction.
And sometimes that can be minimal,

480
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,350
you know,
when it's down at the real,

481
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,480
you know,
details of motor output.

482
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,523
But sometimes it can be revolutionary.
Now I can tell you a couple of 

483
00:28:58,371 --> 00:29:03,371
mythological rifts on that.
So Horace is represented.

484
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,350
Remember Marta?
Marta is represented mostly as the force

485
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:13,460
that that goes into combat with ty Mac.
So chaos.

486
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:15,770
But that's fine.
So chaos is what emerges.

487
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,353
You know,
when the social order is disruptive 

488
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,680
threat.
In a minor way.

489
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:22,514
He also organize the society.
It comes up at the top because you 

490
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:27,800
remember before he's willing to go fight
time mad.

491
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,993
He forces all the gods to meet,
to organize themselves and to proclaim 

492
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:36,110
him king of the hierarchy.
So He's two things.

493
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,850
He's the principal at the top or the 
process at the top of the hierarchy,

494
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,310
eyes and mouth,

495
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:43,893
and he's the determiner of destiny's,
which is explicitly stated in the 

496
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,710
Mesopotamian myth.
And as that thing,

497
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,250
his primary role is to go and combat 
chaos.

498
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,220
Okay.
By the time the Egyptians come along,

499
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,010
there's two major problems that are 
emerging as sort of architectural.

500
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,290
I would say one is while there's still 
the underworld to deal with,

501
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:08,620
that's chaos,
but the other one is the rot of previous

502
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:12,040
structures and that's Cyrus and seth,
right?

503
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,690
Because you could,
you could think of,

504
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:15,400
oh,
cyrus is only protective.

505
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,413
You're culture is functioning.
It's protecting him for the terrible 

506
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:21,310
element of Mother Nature and it's 
working perfectly.

507
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,790
But the problem is it doesn't work 
perfectly for two reasons.

508
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:25,624
One is it just decays with time because 
yesterday's solutions are not 

509
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,034
necessarily appropriate.
Today's circumstance and it sped along 

510
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,254
by people's unwillingness to attend to 
errors and correct them refusal to do 

511
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:39,934
that,
and that's refusal to make the proper 

512
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:42,370
sacrifices.

513
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,980
So that's what gets cane in trouble.
For example,

514
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,023
he will not make the right sacrifices.
Somebody kindly sent me another 

515
00:30:49,541 --> 00:30:50,374
translation of Gods gods conversation 
with Cain when Cain goes to complain 

516
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:58,990
about the nature of being,
and God basically tells him straight out

517
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,340
that if he's,
if things aren't going well for him,

518
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,203
it's his fault.
And so it lays explicit stress on the 

519
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:09,730
idea that they're,
part of the reason that things are going

520
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:12,310
wrong for cane is that he's,
he's not doing the right thing.

521
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,800
It's not only the arbitrary decision of 
God.

522
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,800
So,
so the thing,

523
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,723
the thing that stands above in some 
sense is the thing that corrects errors 

524
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,710
or you could eat,
you could say,

525
00:31:23,711 --> 00:31:24,544
you could say that in a slightly 
different manner because one of the 

526
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:27,154
things that I've,
I've been trying to figure out in some 

527
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,590
sense what might constitute the highest 
virtue.

528
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,730
And I don't think it's an answerable 
question actually,

529
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:41,731
because there there's an interdependent,
there's an interdependence of virtues.

530
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:43,863
I think the primary decision that people
make is whether or not you want to make 

531
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,750
being better or worse.
That's,

532
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,430
that's the pinnacle of any of any 
particularized hierarchy.

533
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,610
So you're always making that decision 
better works better or worse,

534
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:00,670
better or worse.
If you want to make it better,

535
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,700
then you're the optimal tool you have is
true.

536
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,020
And then if you're in that hierarchy,
that thing that stands above it,

537
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:09,100
the eye,
let's say,

538
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,960
or the transcendent feature is the thing
that attends to error and repairs.

539
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,513
And if you squelch that,
which is exactly what happened in the 

540
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,743
Soviet Union,
then the whole bloody system starts to 

541
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,180
shake.
You know,

542
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,230
the psyche because people have to 
falsify their experience constantly,

543
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,300
never updating it,
never repairing it.

544
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,610
And then the whole bloody system starts 
to oscillate too because you can't voice

545
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,050
your detection of error.

546
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,930
You know,
in part of the utility of free speech,

547
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,460
and this is precisely utility of free 
speech,

548
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,180
is that people get to voice their error 
detection.

549
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,920
Now,
they might be wrong.

550
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,840
You know,
everybody has to figure that out.

551
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,290
But if you stop people from objecting,
then the system can't correct itself and

552
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,210
it will become corrupt because it does 
that.

553
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:01,211
But it'll just careen off the path.
So what Japan was doing,

554
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,533
what he's trying to do in generating a 
genuine individual is to produce an 

555
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,080
entity that's related to the divine,
hence the star,

556
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,020
but whose function is to,
to,

557
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,340
to be socialized by the hierarchy,
but then to repair it.

558
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,370
Now that's manifested most particularly 
in this movie on a couple of levels.

559
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:23,714
First of all,
Pinocchio has to make minor course 

560
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:26,471
corrections.
He,

561
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:30,110
he makes mistakes and gets off the path 
and has to return.

562
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,140
So that alters his character.
And sometimes,

563
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,520
sometimes in a way that's a mixed 
blessing to say the leaks,

564
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,910
you know,
cause he's damaged by deviation from the

565
00:33:40,911 --> 00:33:41,744
path.
But so that's one part of 

566
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:45,824
transformation.
But this movie takes the transformation 

567
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:49,664
all the way to its logical conclusion.
Because in order for Pinocchio to 

568
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,240
completely catalyze his transformation 
into an autonomous individual,

569
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,650
he has to go to the very depths,
right in the bottom of the underworld to

570
00:34:00,651 --> 00:34:04,970
the most monstrous thing.
And it's from that rescues his father.

571
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,710
It's the same story as the story of o 
Cyrusone Horace.

572
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,300
And there's an idea there,
here,

573
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:12,680
here's,
here's the ideas.

574
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:14,893
You will not understand the value of 
your culture until you face the thing 

575
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:23,460
you're most afraid of.
And that's what this story means.

576
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:24,923
And it's partly because you can't tell 
what the utility of the ideas are until 

577
00:34:28,741 --> 00:34:33,741
you experienced a situation where the 
most profound ideas become necessary.

578
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,900
And that won't happen unless you face 
something terrible.

579
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,603
So,

580
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,613
okay,

581
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,071
no,
you know,

582
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:43,904
what the movie is doing is constantly 
hinting at what that transcend that and 

583
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,280
figure is,
you know,

584
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,163
and,
and I would say what human beings have 

585
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,154
been doing ever since we became self 
conscious was attempting to define the 

586
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:59,870
parameters of ideal Ba.
So,

587
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,063
and a religious story.
Buddhism and Christianity are very 

588
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,360
intent on specifying the nature of ideal
Ba.

589
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,700
And the reason they're doing that,
it's because they,

590
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,470
they match ideal being against
mortality.

591
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,060
And they say,
look,

592
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,850
we faced this terrible problem.
It's the one outlined in the fall.

593
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:24,950
He's the one outlined in the story of 
the Buddhist,

594
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,080
you know,
inability to go home.

595
00:35:27,081 --> 00:35:28,490
Again,
it's the same idea.

596
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,103
There's a mode of being that allows 
people to live properly and for society 

597
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,040
to be maintained in the face of that.
The question is what's

598
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,873
that ideal mode of being?
And the answer is we'd been trying to 

599
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:45,510
figure that out individually and 
collectively ever since history began.

600
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,883
And what we have as a record of that is 
the trail of profound religious ideas 

601
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:52,980
that,
that you know,

602
00:35:52,981 --> 00:35:53,814
that we're,
that we're leaving behind us as we move 

603
00:35:55,771 --> 00:35:56,604
through time.
But you can't understand why those are 

604
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:02,910
useful until they become necessary.
So you don't go deep enough,

605
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,040
you don't go deep enough into the 
underworld,

606
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,960
you know.
So for example,

607
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,510
your conception of good is pretty

608
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,470
unsophisticated and naive until you know
what its opposite is.

609
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,870
You know,
and I've encountered a fair bit of that,

610
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,763
I would say in my psychotherapeutic 
practice because a lot of the problems 

611
00:36:27,671 --> 00:36:28,504
that I attempted to solve that are 
rooted in individual and then also in 

612
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:35,830
the family because there's almost no 
barrier between those two things.

613
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,470
You know,
it's like a trip.

614
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,940
It's like Donald Tastes,
inferno,

615
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:43,210
you start at one level of hell.
That's really not too bad.

616
00:36:43,211 --> 00:36:46,210
It's sort of like vacation hell.
And then you know,

617
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:47,044
and that's like the outside circle in,
in Dante's inferno where the ancient 

618
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:51,910
philosophers were,
you know,

619
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:52,744
they weren't Christian.
So as far as the Catholics were 

620
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,530
concerned,
they weren't going to be in paradise,

621
00:36:56,531 --> 00:37:00,460
but they were starting about the Chief 
Club Med version of hell.

622
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:06,090
And then Dante takes you down layer by 
layer to the ultimate hell that's at the

623
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:06,560
bottom.

624
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,870
And in that hell in Dante is poem.
That's where the betrayers are.

625
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,540
And that's also where Satan,
if I remember correctly,

626
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,330
sometimes I get this confused with 
paradise lost.

627
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,343
That's where Satan,
who's the archetipal figure of evil is 

628
00:37:19,631 --> 00:37:23,200
lodged and immobile,
immobilized right at the center.

629
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,273
And so the journey is down to the lowest
level into the underworld to encounter 

630
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:28,624
the archetype of evil.
And it's at that point that religious 

631
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:35,710
stories start to become the values that 
are put forth in religious stories start

632
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:40,711
to become crucially necessary cause 
they're the only thing you have that can

633
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:45,880
fortify you against that level of 
catastrophe.

634
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,610
So,
and you know,

635
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:49,444
so partly what this developmental 
process is supposed to be accomplishing 

636
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:56,830
is the production of a personality 
that's capable of doing that.

637
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,220
So,
you know,

638
00:38:00,221 --> 00:38:03,040
part of partly I figured this out in 
part because I was,

639
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,860
I did a lot of meditation on the things 
that I read about,

640
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,900
about the concentration camps in Germany
and in the Soviet Union,

641
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:11,734
but,
but things that were worse than that 

642
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:15,490
because there are things that have 
happened in the world that are far worse

643
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:15,880
than that.

644
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,690
I think the worst things I ever found 
were the actions of unit.

645
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:23,800
I don't remember one 72 it was a 
Japanese unit that went into China.

646
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,050
It's like,
it's just,

647
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:30,190
it's so terrible.
It's traumatizing to read,

648
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,593
you know?
And partly what I was doing when I was 

649
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:33,724
going through that material was trying 
to imagine myself as the person who did 

650
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:41,260
that.
And that's,

651
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,610
that's no game.
You know,

652
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,444
like if you're really imagining it 
because you have to put yourself in the 

653
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,284
place where you could do that.
And that's a terrible thing to realize 

654
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,564
that you could do that,
to realize that that's part of your 

655
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:55,294
character.
And until you realize that you don't 

656
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,240
have enough motivation to mess with any 
ideas that are actually profound,

657
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:07,140
it's just too difficult and unnecessary.
So well.

658
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,670
So we'll continue with this.

659
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,013
Great.

660
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,771
Okay,
so,

661
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:51,660
so one of the things that,
that appears to be the case,

662
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,490
you know,
when you have two hemispheres,

663
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,713
okay?
The reason for that appears to be that 

664
00:39:56,491 --> 00:39:59,380
you need to neural networks in order to 
negotiate the world,

665
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,350
you need one to produce stable warbles 
of reality and you need another two.

666
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:05,184
Identify deviations from that and then 
feed the process deviation information 

667
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:13,290
slowly into the system that imposes a 
stable view.

668
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,590
Because you know,
I,

669
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,200
I'm sorry I don't have the details of 
this quite right,

670
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,560
but if you train a neural network,
for example,

671
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:23,394
to identify birds,
and so it learns how to do that and to 

672
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:29,190
identify fish and it learns how to do 
that and you feed it a penguin,

673
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,043
then all birds become fish.
What happens is the anomaly blows the 

674
00:40:34,651 --> 00:40:37,890
category structure.
And so the category structure now ranges

675
00:40:37,891 --> 00:40:38,910
from fish to birth.

676
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,373
And so in order to prevent that,
you need a separate system that deals 

677
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:46,080
with exceptions.
Now that's what we have in our right and

678
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:46,914
left hemispheres roughly speaking.
And what the right hemisphere does is 

679
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:53,070
identify anomalies and start to 
formulate a theory around it.

680
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,670
That's a fantasy essentially.
And then when you were asleep at night,

681
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,863
while you're dreaming,
the right hemisphere is communicating 

682
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:00,954
with the left hemisphere,
the left hemisphere is categorical 

683
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:03,564
structures loosen up and you can 
experience that in the dream because 

684
00:41:05,791 --> 00:41:08,010
things become somewhat irrational,
right?

685
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,353
And then the brain plays with how it 
might recategorize information in the 

686
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:16,950
least damaging fashion in order to 
incorporate this new information.

687
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:21,420
And a lot of that's a dream.
So that's what's happening at night.

688
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:25,350
Your brain is basically updating itself 
and it's a very important process.

689
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:30,270
If you deprive people of dream sleep,
they become psychotic and quite quickly.

690
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,530
So it's a nontrivial necessity.
So

691
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,143
now this,
this is complicated so that we've got 

692
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:39,794
this bug now and he's the only thing 
that's awake and he's being driven mad 

693
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,450
by time.
That's what's happening here.

694
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,790
And you'll see his eyes start to move 
independently.

695
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:51,050
And that's a very common cartoon 
representation of insanity.

696
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,243
And it's quite interesting because one 
of the things that you see in 

697
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:58,520
schizophrenia is eye movements that are 
unconscious.

698
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,683
And so it's as if you've got voluntary I
direction fields at the front of your 

699
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,660
brain and involuntary ones at the base 
of your brain.

700
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,943
And when you're dreaming,
the involuntary ones are the ones that 

701
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,690
are in control.
And when you track a moving object,

702
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,450
that's also the involuntary one.
So you can,

703
00:42:14,451 --> 00:42:15,284
you can experience this.
So if you put your finger up here and 

704
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,470
track that,
it's no problem.

705
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,630
Smooth vision.
Okay,

706
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,464
now try to do that.
Try to move your eyes that smoothly 

707
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,980
without having that thing to track.

708
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,310
Try it.
So you do this first,

709
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,260
don't move your head,
but just track it.

710
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:32,330
You'll see it and feel your eyes moving 
smoothly.

711
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,740
Okay?
Now put your finger down.

712
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,730
Now try to move your eyes that smoothly 
and you can't do it.

713
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,660
You go Chu,
Chu,

714
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,210
Chu,
Chu,

715
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,043
Chu,
and it's partly because the old eye 

716
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:45,230
movement system is more sophisticated 
than the new eye movement system.

717
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,273
One of the things you see in 
schizophrenia is that the person is 

718
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:49,783
using voluntary eye movements,
but there's emergent grip of control 

719
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,020
over the eye movements by these archaic 
parts of the brain.

720
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:57,854
And you could think about that as the 
emergence of the dream up into waking 

721
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:05,270
consciousness and that's associated with
the schizophrenia symptomatology.

722
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,730
So okay,
so anyways,

723
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:09,320
back to this bug.
Okay,

724
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:12,560
so what is the bug do while we know he's
associated with a star,

725
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,633
we know he's a tramp and we've already 
covered the possibility that he stands 

726
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:20,480
for those things that bug you.

727
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,673
Now,
one of the things that I would suggest 

728
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,240
is that,
and this is union idea,

729
00:43:26,241 --> 00:43:27,074
is that those things that bug you are 
the portals both to the unconscious 

730
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:34,340
world or to the underworld and also the 
portal to further development.

731
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:35,803
So,
and it's part of an error detection 

732
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:37,844
system.
So let's say you walk into your house 

733
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,160
and you think,
Jesus,

734
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:42,890
that really bugs me at why does it bug 
you?

735
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,460
Well it's because your anomaly detection
system is saying,

736
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:48,410
look,
there's something out of kilter here.

737
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:52,220
This territory is not property mapped or
not property groomed.

738
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,450
You know,
cause you can map,

739
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,523
you can make your map accurate by 
changing the map or changing the 

740
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:57,584
territory either way.
And sometimes the thing to do is change 

741
00:44:00,261 --> 00:44:01,094
the territory.
You don't remap your bedroom when it's 

742
00:44:03,681 --> 00:44:04,514
messy,
you clean it up so that it matches the 

743
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,304
map.
And so lots of times you walk into your 

744
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:10,610
house and something bugs you and it's 
like,

745
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,920
that's an anomaly detection.
And you might say,

746
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:13,754
it really bugs me.
Well or you'll say it really bugs me 

747
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,140
when my mother does that.
It's like,

748
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:18,690
yeah,
go,

749
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,523
you go investigate that.
And see where you get and that'll take 

750
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:25,460
you right down to the depths to find out
exactly why that's happening.

751
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,810
And it might be depths in her,
and it might be depths in newer,

752
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:30,440
it might be depths in both of you,
but,

753
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,190
and it's just

754
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,210
a bloody nightmare to get to the bottom 
of that because first of all,

755
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,060
people will block you at every level.
You know,

756
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,940
the first thing they'll do is say,
I don't want to talk about it.

757
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,340
And then the next thing you'll do is 
leave.

758
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,500
And then if you chase them,
they'll tell you that you're,

759
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,453
you know,
something associated with the scum of 

760
00:44:49,051 --> 00:44:51,870
the earth and you know,
cause you won't leave them alone.

761
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:52,943
Then they'll,
then they'll get angry and then they'll 

762
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:58,530
burst into tears.
And then if you can still pursue it,

763
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,140
then you can have a conversation.
But no one,

764
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:06,350
hardly anyone ever gets to that point 
because you just have to be brutal to,

765
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:10,740
to peck your way through those defenses.
The only way you're going to do it is if

766
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:11,574
you're more afraid of that stupid thing 
continuing than you are of the terrible 

767
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:18,570
conflict,
you're going to have to have to fix it.

768
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,350
And I don't think you can be that scared
unless you know what's at the bottom.

769
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,130
You think that is not good.
And you know,

770
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:28,380
if you know what not good means,
that new think,

771
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,223
hey,
we can have a fight for a couple of 

772
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,200
days.
Man.

773
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,510
That's nothing compared to where this is
leading,

774
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,430
you know,
or where it to where it's from.

775
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,610
But people will rarely do that.
You'll see when you have your,

776
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,860
you establish your intimate 
relationships,

777
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:41,694
you know,
this is a critical element of forging a 

778
00:45:45,001 --> 00:45:45,834
longterm union because there will be 
things about you and your partner that 

779
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:52,254
bug each other.
And those are places where your maps do 

780
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:55,764
not coincide.
And sometimes that's for cultural and 

781
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,214
familial differences.
But sometimes it's because one or both 

782
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:05,880
of you is deviating seriously from the 
proper script.

783
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,300
And those are hellacious fights,
you know?

784
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:10,134
And those are the sorts of things that 
happen when someone gets really upset 

785
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,374
about nothing.

786
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,530
You think that's not about nothing.
It's just,

787
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,000
it's like the nothing is is one hair on 
a camel or something like that.

788
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:21,834
You know you don't have the damn camel 
without the hair and even if it's one 

789
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:28,560
hair,
you know there's a camel around so,

790
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,540
okay.
So anyways,

791
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,740
what bugs you?
Well that's that anomaly detector saying

792
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:35,574
something isn't right now you think 
about the things that could be not 

793
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:40,290
right.
It could be the external world,

794
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,430
it could be someone else and their value
structure and their behavior.

795
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,593
It could be your value structure and 
behavior and when the thing that comes 

796
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:49,494
up that bugs you hits,
you don't know which of those it is and 

797
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:56,130
one of your tendencies and is going to 
be to say it's the outside world or that

798
00:46:56,131 --> 00:47:00,450
other person because the last place you 
want to look as inside and that,

799
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,284
that's part of the reason that I find 
increasingly find university campuses 

800
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,363
intolerable because the default theory 
when something isn't right is that it's 

801
00:47:10,111 --> 00:47:11,670
someone else's fault.

802
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,713
And I think that is pathological beyond 
belief because the step from someone 

803
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:19,860
else's fault too,
they should be punished for that is it's

804
00:47:19,861 --> 00:47:21,630
trivial,
it's insignificant.

805
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,093
So you know,
the default position might be it's your 

806
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:30,081
God damn fault.
Find where you went wrong and fix it.

807
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,720
And you might say,
well,

808
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,350
how can I be at fault?
It's like,

809
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,470
think about it for an hour.
You'll figure it out.

810
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:37,540
Like what?
Here's a very useful technique.

811
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,160
If you're fighting with someone that you
love,

812
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,200
you hit an impasse,
man.

813
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:44,080
You can't get anywhere.
You're misunderstanding each other,

814
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,333
you know,
and your tempers are flaring and you 

815
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,280
know,
maybe it lasts for a week.

816
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:52,450
It's not entertaining.
You go sit on your bed and you think,

817
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:53,284
all right,
I probably did something stupid in the 

818
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:58,510
last like three years that set me up for
this somehow.

819
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,183
And if you just allow yourself to 
imagine your memory will take you to 

820
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:05,614
some bloody idiotic thing that you did 
that might seem to be only tenuously 

821
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:13,120
related to the current circumstance,
but maybe it's the best you can offer.

822
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,800
Maybe you're only 5% at fault.
Well then you go tell the person while I

823
00:48:17,801 --> 00:48:21,700
was thinking about this,
and it seems to me to that I set this up

824
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:24,970
like this,
and then they're all shorted out because

825
00:48:24,971 --> 00:48:28,510
you know you've admitted fault and then 
that may be allows them to admit fault.

826
00:48:28,511 --> 00:48:33,340
They don't have to drive the spike home.
And then you can often have a dialogue,

827
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,413
but you don't get the dialogue until 
you're willing to see yourself as a 

828
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:39,950
contributor.
You know?

829
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,340
And the alternative,
and this is a terrible alternative,

830
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,830
is that you win the argument with your 
partner.

831
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,983
Well,
good luck with that because all of that 

832
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:53,980
will do is make the person who's better 
at formulating the arguments,

833
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,100
the tyrant and the person who's worse,
the slave.

834
00:48:57,550 --> 00:48:58,870
And then you got to decide,
well,

835
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,910
is this slave what you want as a 
partner?

836
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:05,040
And maybe the answer's yes and no.
It could easily be because Japan,

837
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:05,883
oh,
could've just as easily picked the but 

838
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,040
over the boy.
So,

839
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:12,220
so there's this,
so this,

840
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,113
the thing that bugs you,
you could think about that as a moral 

841
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:15,784
responsibility.
And so maybe you go to work and 

842
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:21,250
something bugs you and you think,
well,

843
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:22,630
I can just ignore that.
It's like,

844
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:27,631
don't be so sure your whole damn brain 
is telling you there's a hole there,

845
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,043
there's a hole in the fabric of being 
and something terrible is going to come 

846
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,030
out of it unless you do something about 
it.

847
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,441
And you can say,
well,

848
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:36,274
I'll ignore that.
But all that happens is the whole grows 

849
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:41,320
and the monsters inside of it get bigger
and you get weaker.

850
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,860
And so eventually what happens is the 
whole gets really big.

851
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,440
You get really small and something comes
out and eats you,

852
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,633
so you get fired or you get royally 
screwed over at work or something like 

853
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:52,150
that.

854
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,983
Or maybe someone sets up a conspiracy 
where you're implicating something you 

855
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,280
didn't even do and then you get fired 
and you know it,

856
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,233
it doesn't have to end there.
And it's all because you didn't pay 

857
00:50:03,941 --> 00:50:05,890
attention to that thing that was bugging
you.

858
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,270
You know?
Maybe it was,

859
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,313
you were supposed to say to some 
extraordinarily annoying coworker to 

860
00:50:12,311 --> 00:50:15,100
leave you the hell alone.
You know when it,

861
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:19,000
when it was still possible to say that 
maybe even cause I politely,

862
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:20,943
so you know,
once you understand that your brain is 

863
00:50:23,051 --> 00:50:23,884
an early,
an early warning system and the things 

864
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:28,070
that bug you are markers for holes

865
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,903
in Mba,
then it's a hell of a lot easier to 

866
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,120
attend to them.
Now,

867
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,320
one more thing,
when I first watched this film,

868
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,050
or the first dozen times I watched it,
you know,

869
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:39,884
I was struck by the concordance between 
Jimminy cricket and the figure of 

870
00:50:42,681 --> 00:50:43,514
Christ.
And it's weird because obviously 

871
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:49,790
Pinocchio to some degree is that is the 
infant save you,

872
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,620
right?
But then you have the cricket,

873
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,340
his initials are JC,
he serves as the conscience,

874
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,840
you know,
he's a moral guy.

875
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,470
So they're kind of inter twined in a 
very weird way.

876
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:05,210
And when I was thinking about the 
cricket as the Voice of value,

877
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,250
you know,
I thought it kind of thought about it as

878
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:11,690
an omniscient voice has a divine voice,
but that's not how the film portrays it.

879
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,080
What happens is it's so cool.
What happens is,

880
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:18,140
is that Pinocchio develops,
his conscience develops.

881
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:20,390
It's like there's a dialogue between 
them.

882
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,224
So the conscious,
the conscious starts by just spouting 

883
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:27,890
rules and you know,
your conscience does this to you all the

884
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:28,724
time.
If you watch what's going on in your 

885
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,540
head,
you'll see that it continually

886
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,460
okay

887
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,210
assaults you with doubts and questions 
about the validity of your Ba.

888
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:39,830
But if you,
if you notice,

889
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:40,664
and I dealt with this with people a lot,
a lot of the criticisms are sort of 

890
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:44,930
generic.
You know,

891
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:45,764
it's like a chattering critic and you 
can ignore a lot of it once you learn 

892
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:51,680
how,
because you know like the criticism,

893
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:54,450
you're no good that's useless.
It's so low,

894
00:51:54,451 --> 00:51:55,430
low resolution,

895
00:51:57,090 --> 00:52:01,500
you just can't do anything with it.
What the film indicates,

896
00:52:01,501 --> 00:52:02,334
and this is a very sophisticated ideas 
that as you start making moral 

897
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:05,814
judgments,
the first judgments your make your mate 

898
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,680
are going to be low resolution and 
generic.

899
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,813
They're going to be cliched.
But as you attempt to hone yourself and 

900
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,390
maybe you start fixing the errors in 
your,

901
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:19,643
in your mode of being,
then your ability to detect errors gets 

902
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:23,454
better and better and finer and finer.
And so at some point you get to the 

903
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:27,204
point where you're shipshape enough so 
that you're going to detect little 

904
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:32,580
deviations and jump on those suckers 
right away.

905
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,350
And you won't even no one leave a notice
that you just fixed the problem.

906
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,620
And you know,
if you read any Dallas writings like the

907
00:52:40,621 --> 00:52:42,150
Dao de chain,
once,

908
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:44,430
you know what I just told you,
read the Tao Te Ching,

909
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,710
it'll make perfect sense because the 
Dow,

910
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:48,840
which is the pathway between chaos and 
order,

911
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,300
the Dow is what you're supposed to 
follow.

912
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,403
And the Dow is exactly what allows you 
to avoid conflict without anybody even 

913
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:58,080
notice it.
You know,

914
00:52:58,081 --> 00:52:58,914
you just,
you see the thing pop out when there's 

915
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:01,944
nothing to it,
you can just smooth it over maybe even 

916
00:53:03,811 --> 00:53:07,950
gently and no one even notices that you 
did anything so

917
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,200
well.
So that's something to aim for.

918
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,570
You know,
that's definitely something game for it.

919
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,990
So,
and I,

920
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:17,500
I,
I've seen in my own life,

921
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:21,550
the best path to that is truth.
That's the best path.

922
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,950
And so,
you know,

923
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,220
part of what you might be thinking is 
that as you're willing

924
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,100
to face the things that bug you,
sometimes when you intervene,

925
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:30,780
you're going to make a mistake.
You know,

926
00:53:30,781 --> 00:53:32,130
you're not going to handle it.
Well,

927
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,020
maybe you'll even make the situation 
worse.

928
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:37,890
But one of the consequences of that is 
that you will learn something.

929
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,620
And so the more you learn,
you know,

930
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,850
the more you're informed and the more 
you turn on your capacity to,

931
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,261
uh,
what would you say?

932
00:53:46,261 --> 00:53:47,094
Creatively confront.
The sharper you get and the better you 

933
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,450
get at it.
So you know,

934
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,360
it's going to be like this.
You know,

935
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:55,194
at the beginning you're,
you're going to be a pretty wobbly 

936
00:53:57,091 --> 00:53:59,760
system because what the hell do you know
about fixing things?

937
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
But if you practice it a thousand times 
or 10,000 times or 100,000 times,

938
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:07,650
you know,
you'll get very good at it.

939
00:54:07,651 --> 00:54:08,484
And that's exactly what this film 
portrays is there's this dialog between 

940
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:12,684
the generic conscience and you could 
maybe think about that as the superego 

941
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:18,840
or something akin to the 10 commandments
or something like that.

942
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,883
General principles of value.
There's a dialogue between the 

943
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:23,484
individual and these general principles 
of value so that the value principles 

944
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:31,020
are updated and the individual gets 
sharper and sharper.

945
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,570
And I can tell you a mythological 
example of that.

946
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,660
So there's the scene in the New 
Testament.

947
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:39,300
One of the things that happens quite 
frequently in the New Testament,

948
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:41,580
and this is eventually why Christ gets 
crucified,

949
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,360
is that he does moral things that are 
forbidden.

950
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,360
So for example,
um,

951
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,170
there's a couple of episodes where it's 
the Sabbath Day when you're not supposed

952
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:53,004
to do anything.
And someone comes into the synagogue or 

953
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:59,160
the temple and their hand is all 
withered up and he fixes their hand.

954
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:03,030
And then everybody was pretty freaked 
out about that whole fixing thing.

955
00:55:03,031 --> 00:55:07,080
But they also accused him of breaking a 
divine rule.

956
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:12,030
And his answer to that is,
is the sabbath made for man or a man for

957
00:55:12,031 --> 00:55:12,864
the Sabbath?

958
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,700
So,
and that's a very,

959
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:15,534
you got to understand that that's an 
unbelievably revolutionary answer 

960
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,433
because the prevailing morality,
and it's always the prevailing morality 

961
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:26,901
was follow the damn rules.
And his action and response was not when

962
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:30,180
they don't serve the purpose for which 
they were intended.

963
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:35,280
And so there's another explicit 
statement of that in,

964
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,860
in the New Testament is very,
very interesting.

965
00:55:37,861 --> 00:55:40,230
So
the,

966
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:45,450
by the time this story emerges in the 
developmental story,

967
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,620
the Pharisees and the scribes.
So you could roughly think about that as

968
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:52,110
the priests and the lawyers,
that powerful,

969
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:56,400
powerful clique are already,
they already want to get rid of this guy

970
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,773
and they're trying to trap him into 
saying something that's outright 

971
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,480
heretical so they can lock them up or 
kill them.

972
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,600
And so the lawyers are always coming 
around them,

973
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,013
pestering him with complex ethical ideas
in the hope that it will trip up and 

974
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:10,824
make a mistake.
And so one of the things they ask him 

975
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:15,390
is,
which of the 10 commandments is the most

976
00:56:15,391 --> 00:56:16,770
important?
And that's,

977
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:17,610
uh,
you know,

978
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:21,090
that's a hierarchy of principle.
Um,

979
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,410
question.
Well,

980
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:23,800
no matter what he says he's,

981
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,890
he's done.
Because if you say,

982
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:29,590
what is the most important,
you say the others are less important.

983
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:32,590
And so you can get hung out to dry on 
your argument.

984
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,210
But that isn't what happens.
He says,

985
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:36,500
if I remember correctly,
uh,

986
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,503
love thy neighbor as thyself and then 
says all of the commandments are 

987
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,483
emanations of that single principle just
bypasses the question completely 

988
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,680
brilliantly.
It's brilliant.

989
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,753
It's a paradigm shift in mood.
And of course that makes the people who 

990
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:53,344
are pursuing him even more angry because
he made them into fools and showed them 

991
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:59,470
how advanced his ability to debate was 
over.

992
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:00,304
There's,
and then there's one other scene that 

993
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:02,920
comes to mind where,

994
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,660
again,
I think it's in this,

995
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,523
in this situation where he's being 
accused of undermining tradition and 

996
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:11,934
they,
he's asked what his relationship is to 

997
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:14,604
the tradition and he says,
I didn't come here to break the 

998
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:19,350
traditional rules.
I came here as their fulfillment.

999
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,900
And so it's,
it's those sorts of things.

1000
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:25,010
You see those in these mythological 
stories and you think it's,

1001
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,333
I do not buy for a second that that was 
invented in any normative sense of the 

1002
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:31,884
word.
No statements are so sophisticated that 

1003
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,210
there that it's,
it's unbelievable.

1004
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,460
They are so sophisticated now,
you know,

1005
00:57:38,461 --> 00:57:39,294
I see them emerging as a consequence of 
a very lengthy development of 

1006
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:45,300
mythological imagination and knowledge.
But

1007
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,420
Ah,
I just don't understand.

1008
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:50,254
I cannot understand for a moment how 
that could have possibly been thought 

1009
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:55,630
up.
So at least not by a single individual.

1010
00:57:56,650 --> 00:57:57,483
So you know,
when did the idea there too is that 

1011
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,023
passing through the narrow streets of a 
rule system is one of the ways to 

1012
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:08,140
emerging on the other side of the rule 
system.

1013
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,690
So,
you know,

1014
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:14,290
and that's all with regards to proper 
relationships with the great father.

1015
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:18,810
You know,
the other thing too is that if you allow

1016
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:21,630
yourself to be passed through that 
disciplinary process,

1017
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,720
you also have firsthand experience of 
its errors,

1018
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,970
right?
Like if you want to fix the system,

1019
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,550
unless you subject yourself to the 
system,

1020
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,250
how in the world are you ever going to 
know what it did wrong?

1021
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,713
You can't just stand from the outside as
an observer without having been passed 

1022
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,300
through it at every level and say,
well,

1023
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,070
this is how it needs to be fixed.
It's like,

1024
00:58:41,071 --> 00:58:45,810
what the hell do you know about it?
There's no direct personal experience so

1025
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,240
you don't necessarily even have a right 
to comment.

1026
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,560
So one of the things human suggested 
should,

1027
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:22,160
I think it's a boggling idea,

1028
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,940
he thought you were always dreaming 
awake or asleep,

1029
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:30,090
but the dreams just went on continually 
like maybe not 100% of the time,

1030
00:59:30,091 --> 00:59:32,930
but you were passing through dreams 
continually.

1031
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:36,080
And what was happening when you were 
awake was that the,

1032
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:41,120
the sensory pressure of the real world 
was such that it just obliterate it.

1033
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:43,700
Your knowledge of the dream.
And then when you went to sleep,

1034
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:44,534
what happened was you shut off all your 
sensory input roughly speaking and then 

1035
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:51,020
the sensitivity of your,
what do you say?

1036
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:52,483
Signal to noise ratio changes so that 
the background activity of your 

1037
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:01,220
underlying neural structures can start 
to manifest itself and you can detect it

1038
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,233
all that that might be the dream.
And I think there's a reference to that 

1039
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:08,510
here.
Whereas night progresses,

1040
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,273
one of the things that happens to this 
cricket is that it gets so sensitive to 

1041
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:14,600
anything,
you know,

1042
01:00:14,601 --> 01:00:17,600
it's getting more and more sensitive as 
a detection device.

1043
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:22,930
And so at some point it stops time
after all enough.

1044
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:41,923
So that's pretty interesting because now
all of a sudden this bug is the master 

1045
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,300
of time.
He can bring time itself to a halt.

1046
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,163
Okay,
now we're in a completely different 

1047
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:51,200
dimension.
We're in the real world,

1048
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:52,034
so to speak.
Although it was obviously also with 

1049
01:00:53,991 --> 01:00:54,824
dream,
like what's that movie where you go 

1050
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:58,910
through levels of dreaming.
Inception.

1051
01:00:58,911 --> 01:00:59,744
Yeah.
So you know the Pinocchio Stories are 

1052
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,040
all,
all,

1053
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:02,973
all obviously a dream.
And then we go down a level to a dream 

1054
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:09,170
within a dream.
And that's what we're in right now.

1055
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:18,663
Watch out,

1056
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:29,973
let's go.

1057
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:43,230
Oh Hey.
So like what the hell do you know?

1058
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,133
Really a star.
Dot Star comes down and turns into a 

1059
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:48,640
ferry.
It's like,

1060
01:01:48,641 --> 01:01:50,350
okay,
no one has any problem with that.

1061
01:01:50,351 --> 01:01:51,790
I mean the crickets a little freaked 
out,

1062
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,880
but everybody else seems to think that's
a perfectly reasonable low currents.

1063
01:01:54,881 --> 01:01:59,881
Which really begs the question,
how in the world can you understand that

1064
01:02:00,671 --> 01:02:03,550
you understand that?
Cause it's not understandable.

1065
01:02:03,551 --> 01:02:04,384
It makes no sense know,
like from a conscious or rational 

1066
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:08,320
perspective.
Okay,

1067
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:10,090
so here's,
here's what's happening.

1068
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,790
We notice that there's a real absence of
femininity so far in,

1069
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,250
uh,
in the story.

1070
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,830
It's sort of implicit in the comfort of 
the home,

1071
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:20,310
but there's nothing explicit it now

1072
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,850
you can think of Japan as the beneficial
element of culture.

1073
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,760
And so here's the way of conceptualizing
it.

1074
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,660
If the beneficial aspect of culture is 
put into place,

1075
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,140
the beneficial elements of nature is 
called forth.

1076
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:36,600
And so,
you know,

1077
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:37,434
I can give you an example.
Like if you have a neurologically 

1078
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:43,140
damaged infant and that infant grows up 
in a chaotic environment,

1079
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:43,974
the probability that that neurological 
damage will result in severe behavioral 

1080
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,073
and social impairments is quite high.
But if you take an individual like that 

1081
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:55,410
and you raise them in a stable 
environment,

1082
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:58,260
then they can often stabilize their 
nervous systems.

1083
01:02:58,530 --> 01:02:59,363
And so you can see that there's a dance 
between nature and culture as a child 

1084
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:05,220
develops and that,
you know,

1085
01:03:05,221 --> 01:03:10,221
if you set the culture up properly,
then the child's nature has the capacity

1086
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:13,410
to manifest itself in the most 
beneficial manner possible.

1087
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:16,980
Now it would be partly the facilitation 
of individual development.

1088
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:17,843
You know,
because the child is a variant of a 

1089
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:23,130
human being and you want to apply or 
cultural structure to it,

1090
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,660
to the child so that it becomes 
socialized and,

1091
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:26,543
and disciplined and able to do things.
But at the same time you want it to 

1092
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:32,670
manifest its particularities.
So you've got to get the balance right.

1093
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,910
Well Japan or made the wish,
it's the right wish.

1094
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:36,893
So nature comes to the rescue and in its
most benevolent forum and it's 

1095
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,350
attractive and seductive.
This is almost like,

1096
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:44,783
you know,
Buddhist farther setting up all the 

1097
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:48,360
dancing girls in the forest because 
this,

1098
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:52,680
this figure is part of what entices 
people into life,

1099
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:56,280
but certainly entices babies into life.
You know,

1100
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,210
the love that a mother provides is a 
seduction into life.

1101
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,630
And no wonder because
you need to be seduced into living.

1102
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,640
It's too hard otherwise,
you know,

1103
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:11,640
and if babies don't have that primary 
relationship with their mother,

1104
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,250
they just fold up and die,
fed,

1105
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:16,490
warm,
bathed,

1106
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:19,200
irrelevant.
They have to have that relationship.

1107
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:27,603
Great.

1108
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:32,130
So right away,
you know,

1109
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:32,964
there's a,
there's a hint to give them so much 

1110
01:04:34,201 --> 01:04:35,034
happiness to others.
There's a hint of the sexual element 

1111
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:41,820
there.
And so this particular ferry was modeled

1112
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:43,860
on a screen queen of the time,
you know,

1113
01:04:43,861 --> 01:04:48,390
a woman who was famous for her beauty.
And you know,

1114
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,313
there's,
there's a knob here to something which 

1115
01:04:50,581 --> 01:04:51,414
is that there are multiple elements of 
being that have nothing to do with 

1116
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:54,804
rationality that are necessary,
that are necessary components of the 

1117
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:01,530
nature that entices you into life.
You know,

1118
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,560
and one of those primary sources of 
energy obviously,

1119
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,590
and delight and motivation and all of 
those things,

1120
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,603
his sexuality and his Freud pointed out,
it permeates all levels of human 

1121
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:14,580
endeavor.
And you know,

1122
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:17,470
we have some trouble with that because 
it's,

1123
01:05:17,471 --> 01:05:18,304
you know,
sexuality is such a powerful force that 

1124
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,660
wherever you introduce,
it's like a divine force.

1125
01:05:22,661 --> 01:05:25,690
It produces rifts in the cultural 
structure.

1126
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:26,883
You know,
hand sold a continual debate about 

1127
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:32,400
sexual harassment and so forth in the 
workplace.

1128
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:33,243
You know,
you have men and women in the same 

1129
01:05:34,451 --> 01:05:39,451
places all the time.
And so there's the normative day

1130
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,790
to day cultural things that are supposed
to be occurring,

1131
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,700
narrow in goal directed and the 
consistent,

1132
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,820
you know,
eruption of sexuality into that well and

1133
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,830
you could say,
well that should just be stopped.

1134
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:51,664
It's like be careful what you say.
Do you really want to stop it while you 

1135
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:56,531
think,
yeah,

1136
01:05:56,531 --> 01:05:58,240
it gets out of hand and rudy fast.
It's like,

1137
01:05:58,241 --> 01:06:01,060
yeah it does.
But two attempts to suppress it.

1138
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,140
So you know you're stuck with it.
It's,

1139
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:05,103
it's an unalterable element of life's 
complexity and it's also something that 

1140
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:10,294
pulls you forward into life.
So you can imagine the level of tyranny 

1141
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:18,220
that would be necessary to eradicate all
sexual interactions from the workplace.

1142
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,620
You just,
everyone would wear a uniform.

1143
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,440
Everyone would have their haircut 
exactly the same.

1144
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,020
No one would ever wear makeup.
You know,

1145
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:26,873
you,
you have to be rendered as neutral as 

1146
01:06:29,171 --> 01:06:34,171
possible and even not wouldn't do it.
But that would be the start of doing it.

1147
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:42,210
Come through
little puppet made a pie.

1148
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:07,040
See Young would regard that little blue 
fairy as an anima finger.

1149
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,350
An animal.
Anima means soul.

1150
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,630
And so there's an idea here that you 
know,

1151
01:07:11,631 --> 01:07:12,464
the masculine great fathers sort of 
constructed the structure that's an oak 

1152
01:07:15,581 --> 01:07:16,414
hill.
So that would be the nuts and bolts of 

1153
01:07:17,511 --> 01:07:22,100
the individual as a cultural construct.
And then the sort of divine and enticing

1154
01:07:22,101 --> 01:07:25,580
feminine spirit breathes life into it.
And so,

1155
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,013
you know,
there are situations where that causal 

1156
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,410
sequence could be reversed depending on 
what was being exemplified or amplify.

1157
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:34,244
But that's what's happening here.
So he wakes up and he becomes self 

1158
01:07:36,991 --> 01:07:39,130
conscious per pretty much immediately.

1159
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:54,790
I've given you a nice host tonight.
You her wished for real,

1160
01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:00,310
no Cahokia to make two pillows wish come
true.

1161
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,513
It would be entirely up to you,
prove yourself truthful and unselfish 

1162
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,220
and someday you will be over your gone.

1163
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:11,813
Okay?
So there's a variety of extraordinarily 

1164
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:16,310
complex things going on here.
So you know,

1165
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,623
one of the things that you'll hear 
constantly bandied about in a quasi 

1166
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,300
scientific community is the role of 
nature and nurture.

1167
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:27,550
Okay?
So we could say architecturally for,

1168
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:29,870
for our purposes at the moment in this 
film,

1169
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:31,603
nurture is being represented by Japan 
because he's constructing things in 

1170
01:08:35,481 --> 01:08:37,130
nature by the ferry.
So you can say,

1171
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:37,964
well,
nature nurture the role of biology 

1172
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:43,060
versus culture.
Well,

1173
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:43,903
it's a,
it's an interesting ediology we'll say 

1174
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,223
because it makes a proposition and the 
proposition is that's the only two 

1175
01:08:50,841 --> 01:08:53,750
causal elements that are operating,
right?

1176
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:55,220
Nature,
culture,

1177
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,120
mother,
father,

1178
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,270
let's say roughly speaking.
Then you ask yourself,

1179
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,104
well,
where the hell's the individual in this 

1180
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:04,820
equation?
And the answer is nowhere at all because

1181
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:09,380
there's no causal role for the 
individual in a scientific psychology.

1182
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:10,940
It's either nature or nurture.

1183
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,610
Now that the film,
weirdly enough,

1184
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,720
has a theory that's I would say is more 
sophisticated than that.

1185
01:09:17,721 --> 01:09:18,554
It says nature's necessary culture is 
necessary and it would be best if they 

1186
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:25,010
were optimized.
So you get a head start,

1187
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:27,350
for example,
if your father actually loves you and so

1188
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:28,184
does your mother fair enough?
But that isn't sufficient in and of 

1189
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:33,620
itself to produce,
you know,

1190
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,470
an individual who inhabits the 
transcendent zone.

1191
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:39,050
There's actually choices that have to be
made.

1192
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,423
Now,
I would say our entire culture is 

1193
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,930
predicated on the idea that people 
actually make choices.

1194
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:45,980
You know,
our,

1195
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:50,150
our culture is predicated on the idea of
individual responsibility and choice.

1196
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:51,223
So we recognize that in our legal system
and we recognize it in our individual 

1197
01:09:54,771 --> 01:09:55,604
interactions because you always treat 
people around you as if they could have 

1198
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,800
chosen something different.
You know,

1199
01:10:00,801 --> 01:10:03,230
unless they can make a really strong 
case that they couldn't.

1200
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:04,311
And then you say,
oh,

1201
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,144
well,
you know,

1202
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,230
then you're not responsible for it.
No,

1203
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,103
I was in a court case at one point and 
the person who was on trial had been 

1204
01:10:14,571 --> 01:10:19,400
forced to help kill someone with the 
rock after she'd been stripped naked and

1205
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:20,293
threatened with death and rape.
And it was a credible threat because 

1206
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:27,020
she'd already watched the people that 
were threatening her,

1207
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,273
beat someone 95% to death.
And so she dropped a rock on the guide 

1208
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:36,510
and you know,
then there's a rule in,

1209
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:37,790
in law,
you're not,

1210
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,840
no matter what duress you're subject to,
you don't get to do that.

1211
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,900
But this was such an ex she got there 
accidentally.

1212
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:45,734
She just blundered into the situation.
She was a single mother and also very 

1213
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:51,190
worried that you know,
if she got killed,

1214
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,130
you know who the hell was going to take 
care of her kid and well and so forth.

1215
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:59,150
But you know the,
the court eventually found in her favor.

1216
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,550
And the reason for that was that the 
court,

1217
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:02,483
that was the first time in English 
common law history that that had ever 

1218
01:11:04,401 --> 01:11:05,234
happened.
But the court decided that under those 

1219
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:11,330
circumstances she wasn't acting as an,
she had no will,

1220
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,313
like the circumstance was so compelling 
that she did what you would expect 

1221
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:18,570
someone to do.
Because the law is also by the way,

1222
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:22,170
optimized for the average individual,
not for the hero.

1223
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:25,050
The law does not demand of you that you 
act like a hero.

1224
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,430
And thank God for that.
So I know.

1225
01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:29,550
So if someone says,
look,

1226
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:30,384
I couldn't help it,
and then you believe that you don't 

1227
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,900
judge them,
but if they can't make that case,

1228
01:11:33,901 --> 01:11:36,930
your automatic presupposition is you 
could have done something differently.

1229
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,120
And you might ask yourself,
you know,

1230
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:42,390
to the degree that you're an admirer of 
nature versus nurture,

1231
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,253
you know,
culture versus nature or biology versus 

1232
01:11:45,871 --> 01:11:46,704
culture.
Why in the world do you believe that 

1233
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,690
people have any,
any avenue of choice,

1234
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,110
but you do you act that out in your 
beliefs all the time.

1235
01:11:55,880 --> 01:12:00,880
Um,
or like more human options,

1236
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:05,370
like the results.
It doesn't just like,

1237
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,210
I feel like there's no,

1238
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,271
well,
you know,

1239
01:12:10,271 --> 01:12:13,630
the problem with that viewpoint is it's 
fundamentally deterministic.

1240
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,620
Yeah.
Yeah.

1241
01:12:14,620 --> 01:12:17,080
But,
but the reality isn't deterministic.

1242
01:12:17,081 --> 01:12:19,630
It's probabilistic.
And so you can't,

1243
01:12:19,810 --> 01:12:22,300
like the,
one of the things that quantum mechanics

1244
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:26,980
makes quite evident is that you cannot 
draw on airinc cause and effect chains.

1245
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:29,660
Okay.

1246
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:30,500
Yeah.
But I know,

1247
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:31,760
I know it is.
I know it is,

1248
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:32,803
but we also exist at the microscale and 
I'm also not saying that what the movie 

1249
01:12:36,681 --> 01:12:37,514
is putting forth is true.
I'm just telling you what it's putting 

1250
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:41,054
forth.

1251
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:46,450
The movements,
it's still

1252
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:49,770
worse.
We'll,

1253
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,910
well this seems non random to me.
Okay.

1254
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:54,420
Well yeah.
You know,

1255
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:55,320
we know what I mean.

1256
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,240
That's,
but that's more like,

1257
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:01,940
because I haven't started this 
conversation,

1258
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:03,740
you wouldn't have done that sort of,
again,

1259
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,490
it's a result of link.

1260
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:07,023
Lord,
you know,

1261
01:13:07,120 --> 01:13:07,761
I,
I'm,

1262
01:13:07,761 --> 01:13:10,370
I'm,
I'm not making a case for the,

1263
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,390
I'm not making a case for the ultimate 
validity of this viewpoint.

1264
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:16,670
Okay.
Or at least if I am,

1265
01:13:16,671 --> 01:13:17,504
I'm not expecting you to believe it.
What I'm saying is that there's a 

1266
01:13:20,181 --> 01:13:21,014
tension between this viewpoint,
which is an archetypal and mythological 

1267
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:27,680
viewpoint and the scientific viewpoint.
And you know,

1268
01:13:27,681 --> 01:13:31,370
the way that a person would object to 
this viewpoint is by saying,

1269
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:35,750
hold on a minute.
There's deterministic causality at work.

1270
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:39,830
You know,
I would say in favor of this perspective

1271
01:13:39,831 --> 01:13:42,590
is we don't act that way.
And you know,

1272
01:13:42,591 --> 01:13:45,170
maybe we're wrong,
but we do not act that way.

1273
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,180
We shouldn't.
Why not?

1274
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,390
Well,
because,

1275
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,550
because it's an attractive,
because I like it wouldn't work,

1276
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:55,320
but then I wouldn't object if it,
if it wouldn't work.

1277
01:13:55,321 --> 01:13:56,154
That actually indicates that it's wrong.
And that goes back to this sort of 

1278
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:00,690
debate between Darwin and Newton.

1279
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:01,860
Yeah.
This is wrong.

1280
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:06,930
Not objectively wrong in the sense that 
it gets not a good way to

1281
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,850
sure you can say it's wrong.
Pragmatically you couldn't say that.

1282
01:14:10,851 --> 01:14:11,684
And that could be the case.
You could make a case that we act as if 

1283
01:14:14,351 --> 01:14:17,830
we have free will because that's the 
simplest solution to the problem.

1284
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:19,093
Yeah,
you could.

1285
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:22,330
And you know it's a perfectly reasonable
argument.

1286
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,120
Just say that,
I don't believe it but,

1287
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,470
but it's,
but as,

1288
01:14:26,471 --> 01:14:28,270
as a coherent argument,
it's,

1289
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,133
it's fine.
It's partly why there is such tension 

1290
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:34,210
between scientific and mythological 
views of the world.

1291
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,880
This is a huge part of the tension.
You know,

1292
01:14:36,881 --> 01:14:39,430
part of it is evolution versus 
creationism.

1293
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:42,550
It's like who cares about that?
That's a stupid argument.

1294
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:46,360
But this one is much more difficult,
you know,

1295
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,390
that's determinism versus choice.
That's part of it.

1296
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,900
And there's much to be said on both 
sides.

1297
01:14:52,901 --> 01:14:53,734
And of course are deterministic models 
of the world are extraordinarily 

1298
01:14:55,961 --> 01:14:58,270
powerful and we use them all the time.

1299
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:00,520
So we also act out our belief in those 
models.

1300
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,960
So,
okay,

1301
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:05,290
so back to Pinocchio.
So now he's got his own voice.

1302
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:06,670
So that means,
you know,

1303
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:07,504
partly what that means is that by the 
time you launch your child into the 

1304
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:13,030
world,
they should have their own voice.

1305
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,280
You actually see that developing in 
kids.

1306
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,173
You see that really developing when 
they're about to because that's when 

1307
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:23,410
they learn to say no and like 50% of 
what a two year old will say to you is,

1308
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:26,290
no,
I used to fool my son cause he would say

1309
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,124
no to everything.
He'd say no to things like 10 things in 

1310
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:30,304
a row.
And then I'd ask him if he wanted some 

1311
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:34,690
chocolate ice cream.
Then the first thing he would say is no.

1312
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:35,920
And then he,
you know,

1313
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:37,810
startle a bit and think,
wait,

1314
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:40,300
I actually do want some chocolate ice 
cream.

1315
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,433
So but,
but we know people called the terrible 

1316
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:44,914
twos,
the terrible twos because that is when 

1317
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:46,834
the child discovers it's voice,
it learns how to push back and then so 

1318
01:15:50,141 --> 01:15:53,110
it's dependent,
then it's oppositional,

1319
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:57,580
then it starts to become cooperative.
You know when you want the child to be a

1320
01:15:57,581 --> 01:16:02,020
nice balance between opposition land 
cooperative roughly by the time they hit

1321
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,900
three and for sure by the time they hit 
four,

1322
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,180
because if they don't do it by the time 
they hit four,

1323
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:11,320
it's like the crucial developmental 
period in many ways his past.

1324
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,633
So,
or you're too stupid to learn how to 

1325
01:16:14,290 --> 01:16:16,080
interact with your kid and you know 
what,

1326
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:18,130
it basically boils down to the same 
thing.

1327
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,920
So now he has his voice and he has some 
limited autonomy.

1328
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:22,683
And the first thing that blue fairy 
tells him is that he has a moral 

1329
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:25,504
adventure in front of him and that it's 
going to involve following some rules 

1330
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,750
and they're pretty prosaic and 
stereotypical rules.

1331
01:16:31,751 --> 01:16:33,730
You know,
they're like a lecture from your,

1332
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,370
maybe not so favorite act or something 
like that.

1333
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:44,760
Easy.
You was hard to choose between right and

1334
01:16:44,761 --> 01:16:45,594
wrong.
But how do I know how I know your 

1335
01:16:49,741 --> 01:16:54,741
conscience with your
options?

1336
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,760
Just that still small voice but people 
won't question.

1337
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,173
So He's kind of a loud mouth at this 
point and he holds himself up a little 

1338
01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:05,800
podium to,
to,

1339
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,520
you know,
speech or fight from.

1340
01:17:07,521 --> 01:17:11,480
And one of the things you'll see us,
his voice is quite patronizing and phony

1341
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,340
and it's also very hard to listen to 
him.

1342
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,720
Like the next five things he says,
they have no life in them.

1343
01:17:17,721 --> 01:17:18,554
They're boring.
And that's because they're basically 

1344
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:21,980
debt rules.
They're necessary,

1345
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:22,814
but they've got no spirit in them.
And he's also got this pointing thing 

1346
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:26,361
going on,
you know,

1347
01:17:26,361 --> 01:17:27,194
so he's like a hectoring,
superego type of creature and he's too 

1348
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:32,630
dumb to stay out of the situation.
Right.

1349
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,520
He leaps into it,
you know,

1350
01:17:35,180 --> 01:17:36,013
without even thinking really.
And so it's a good commentary on your 

1351
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:41,600
conscience because that damn thing can 
drive you crazy.

1352
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:42,703
And the thing is,
even though it's necessary and partly 

1353
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:48,200
right,
it's also destructive and not completely

1354
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:49,011
right.
So,

1355
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:50,930
you know,
that makes it very difficult to know how

1356
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:51,764
to relate to it.

1357
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,250
Just the problem with the world today.
Oh hello.

1358
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,480
Would you like to be conscious
about?

1359
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:15,420
How does your name Oh credits you have 
any quick neil,

1360
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:20,970
Mr
you can.

1361
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,810
Oh,
countries not high.

1362
01:18:24,811 --> 01:18:27,480
Keep her
counselor

1363
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:34,330
and guide it on the street and down.
So jimminy cricket,

1364
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:49,430
but don't we get a badge or something?
We'll see.

1365
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:51,350
Well,
I shouldn't.

1366
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:57,310
Okay.
So again,

1367
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:59,620
a variety of very complex things happens
there.

1368
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,940
Um,
first of all,

1369
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:01,774
but conscience undergoes a 
transformation at the same time as the 

1370
01:19:04,241 --> 01:19:06,850
boy does.
And so I think the way of thinking about

1371
01:19:06,851 --> 01:19:09,220
that is that it's something like,
you know,

1372
01:19:09,221 --> 01:19:12,880
obviously human beings are predisposed 
to learn language,

1373
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,863
whatever that means.
One of the things that infants do when 

1374
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:17,434
they're in their crib,
you'll hear them badly and they're 

1375
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:21,820
playing with,
they're playing with sounds,

1376
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:26,990
and I don't know if you know this,
but an infant babbles every human phony.

1377
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:31,540
So there's four different phonemes 
speech elements in different languages.

1378
01:19:31,541 --> 01:19:32,374
You know what one interesting,
different saves between many Asian 

1379
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:37,624
languages in English.
There's no distinction between the r 

1380
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,864
sound or end.
The old found in many Asian languages 

1381
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,450
and so often Asian people can't even 
hear that difference.

1382
01:19:46,451 --> 01:19:48,430
And they certainly can't say it and 
there's,

1383
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,473
there's lots of sounds,
but that English speakers have a hard 

1384
01:19:51,401 --> 01:19:56,290
time with many,
many sounds in Asian languages,

1385
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:57,880
lots of sounds in German.

1386
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,530
Um,
you know,

1387
01:19:59,531 --> 01:20:02,830
there was throat,
throat sounds that are kind of guttural.

1388
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:04,850
And then there's click languages and you
know,

1389
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,730
there's all sorts of things that not 
only can you,

1390
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:09,720
not by the time you're an adult and 
trained in one language,

1391
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:10,554
but you can't even hear them.
Now the child is sitting there battling 

1392
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:16,200
in every single phony,
which is amazing.

1393
01:20:16,201 --> 01:20:20,100
It's as if it knows the units of every 
possible language.

1394
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:21,083
And then what happens is it loses the 
ability to admit phonemes that are of 

1395
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:27,840
that language.
It's so not what you'd expect,

1396
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:29,610
man.
You'd expect that it doesn't know a damn

1397
01:20:29,611 --> 01:20:30,444
thing.
And then it learns the particular full 

1398
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:34,290
names,
not that it knows every phoneme and then

1399
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:36,660
loses the ability.
That's very peculiar.

1400
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,793
Okay.
So you could say in some sense that the 

1401
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:40,674
child has a low resolution,
broad adaptations to possible languages 

1402
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:46,430
now.

1403
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:47,263
And I would say,
well the same thing comes with regards 

1404
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:53,310
to conscious is the child has the 
inbuilt mechanism for conscience.

1405
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,473
You know,
and it could be developed in a very 

1406
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:58,210
large number of specific ways.
You know,

1407
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:02,400
they,
they fit within a universe of potential,

1408
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,640
what would you call playable moral 
games.

1409
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,280
So it's not unbounded,
it's not infinite but,

1410
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,170
but,
but it's,

1411
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:11,004
it's large.
And then so the child comes equipped 

1412
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:16,050
with that.
And then what happens is that it's an,

1413
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,913
as it's inculturated,
the conscience starts to pick up the 

1414
01:21:19,591 --> 01:21:22,170
specific rules that underlie that 
cultures,

1415
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,143
motive,
social interaction and that sort of the 

1416
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:28,890
generic corn chance.
And so that's what it is at this point.

1417
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,090
You know,
it's been well developed.

1418
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:33,090
That's why it's got this sort of rich 
nature.

1419
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:35,760
It's not fully developed,
ignores that itself.

1420
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:38,070
That's why it's still wants the damn 
gold badge.

1421
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:39,113
It's a lot better than it was when it 
was just a tramp that had been 

1422
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:42,690
everywhere.
Right.

1423
01:21:42,691 --> 01:21:45,300
Cause now it's specifically allied with 
an individual.

1424
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:46,613
And so that's interesting too because 
the movie posits that the conscience 

1425
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,480
requires the individual to develop just 
as the individual requires.

1426
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:56,610
The conscience to develop.
It's very cool,

1427
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:57,473
very sophisticated idea.
And so now they're both sent out 

1428
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:01,223
fundamentally to learn.
Now the conscience is a little wiser 

1429
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:06,360
because in some sense it's been 
everywhere.

1430
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:07,194
Right?
Well that was partly why it was a tramp 

1431
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:10,290
to begin with.
But it also,

1432
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,124
the interesting thing too is that it 
doesn't have full control over the 

1433
01:22:14,191 --> 01:22:16,680
individual.
You know,

1434
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:18,570
and that's a strange thing too because 
it's not,

1435
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,870
it's also not what you would expect from
a purely deterministic system.

1436
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,333
You know,
a deterministic system you think would 

1437
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:26,940
be bound by the rules.
Well,

1438
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:31,290
maybe we are in a very complex way,
but certainly not in any simple way.

1439
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,390
That's rule two,
two behavior.

1440
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:36,450
You know the rules,
but you don't have to follow them.

1441
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,960
We all
always let your conscience,

1442
01:22:57,260 --> 01:23:00,360
oh yeah,
I almost forgot about you.

1443
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:01,823
Well,
hello.

1444
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:06,080
Maybe you and I better have a little to 
heart talk.

1445
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:09,860
Want to be a real boy.
I don't,

1446
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:14,880
you
know,

1447
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:21,720
you see the world is full of him page.
Yeah,

1448
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:25,750
they're in the wrong things,
but seek right at the time.

1449
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:26,770
But,
um,

1450
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,813
even though the right things may seem 
wrong sometimes and sometimes the wrong 

1451
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:32,794
things,
but maybe right at the wrong time or 

1452
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:41,150
vice advisor
had a boy and I'm going to help.

1453
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,250
So there's a nice little philosophical 
conundrum there.

1454
01:23:50,251 --> 01:23:51,084
It's quite sophisticated.
It's even the conscience can say state 

1455
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:58,160
explicitly the rules of the game,
right?

1456
01:23:58,161 --> 01:23:58,994
So,
so much of it is implicit now he's kind 

1457
01:24:00,261 --> 01:24:03,920
of narcissistic at this point and thinks
he knows a lot more than he does know.

1458
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:07,220
When he tries to articulate the rules,
he finds that he doesn't know them.

1459
01:24:07,221 --> 01:24:08,054
And even if he did,
the thing to which they're being 

1460
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,860
articulated cannot follow matt an 
articulated level.

1461
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:14,031
So,
you know,

1462
01:24:14,031 --> 01:24:14,864
and what that really means is people do 
this with your two year olds all the 

1463
01:24:17,181 --> 01:24:19,550
time.
They explain the rules to them.

1464
01:24:19,790 --> 01:24:20,623
It's like,
it's virtually pointless because a two 

1465
01:24:22,581 --> 01:24:24,410
year old,
they don't,

1466
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:29,600
they aren't governed by rules.
Adults aren't governed by rules.

1467
01:24:29,601 --> 01:24:30,434
Why in the world would you ever expect 
that the two year old to be guided by 

1468
01:24:32,781 --> 01:24:35,300
rules and they certainly can't 
articulate them.

1469
01:24:35,630 --> 01:24:36,081
You know?
Now,

1470
01:24:36,081 --> 01:24:36,914
if you're careful,
there's certain things that you can 

1471
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:42,920
articulate for a two year old,
but explaining complex moral concepts to

1472
01:24:42,921 --> 01:24:46,220
them is that's just not how they learn 
how to behave.

1473
01:24:46,221 --> 01:24:47,054
They learn how to behave by bugging you,
roughly speaking and seeing what 

1474
01:24:50,091 --> 01:24:51,380
happens.
But not only that,

1475
01:24:51,381 --> 01:24:53,870
they come for comfort and they laugh 
like they're,

1476
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:58,250
they're charting the interactions 
constantly and extracting all rules.

1477
01:24:58,700 --> 01:24:59,533
They're learning it through experience.
And that's basically what happens here 

1478
01:25:01,461 --> 01:25:02,300
at the,
the,

1479
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,433
the,
the conclusion for the conscience and 

1480
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:07,100
the puppet as well.
We have to learn through experience.

1481
01:25:07,101 --> 01:25:10,790
It's something that has to be acted out,
not explained in an articulated way.

1482
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:12,123
Okay.

1483
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:16,610
Just like,
all right,

1484
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:20,060
we'll skip the little song.

1485
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,350
Okay.
So now it's the next morning.

1486
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,693
Wow.

1487
01:26:03,940 --> 01:26:04,601
So,
you know,

1488
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:05,434
you can see by his behavior that he's 
being raised well because he's very 

1489
01:26:08,891 --> 01:26:11,140
enthusiastic.
Hence the hopping around,

1490
01:26:11,141 --> 01:26:13,180
you know,
and he's not powering,

1491
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,440
you know,
you could also say,

1492
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:15,274
well,
he's got the temperament for it and 

1493
01:26:15,911 --> 01:26:18,040
fine.
He's not cowering,

1494
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,920
you know,
afraid of the world and Japan,

1495
01:26:20,921 --> 01:26:22,840
Oh,
isn't going to walk him to school,

1496
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:23,651
you know,
old Japan.

1497
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:24,484
Oh,
is courageous enough we could say and 

1498
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:28,880
know,
but also confident enough in Pinocchio's

1499
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:32,680
capacity at this point to say,
okay,

1500
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:37,180
you know you're going to manage it.
And it's not like he's naive and figures

1501
01:26:37,181 --> 01:26:39,370
that there's no,
that there's no danger.

1502
01:26:39,371 --> 01:26:40,990
That's not,
that's not it at all.

1503
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:41,883
It's that he feels that the child is 
developed enough so that the next 

1504
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:49,741
logical step is to allow him some 
freedom of choice in the actual world.

1505
01:26:50,141 --> 01:26:50,974
So that's what he proceeds to do.
Now there's sign that he's a good 

1506
01:26:53,531 --> 01:26:54,400
father.
He's not,

1507
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,953
Pinocchio isn't cotton.
They need a whole family that won't let 

1508
01:26:58,361 --> 01:26:59,194
him go.
It's encouraging him to move out into 

1509
01:27:01,361 --> 01:27:02,194
the world.

1510
01:27:08,610 --> 01:27:13,610
One
teacher,

1511
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:24,860
ow.
Oh yeah.

1512
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:38,630
He doesn't forget to give them a book.

1513
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,130
Come
back.

1514
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:06,250
Listen
[inaudible] school,

1515
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:14,530
I'm no institution would be stupid.

1516
01:28:19,100 --> 01:28:23,530
Well,
well Stromboli so the battle arrest,

1517
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,560
so this farkes is well,
cynical and shallow at the same time and

1518
01:28:29,321 --> 01:28:32,980
all he ever does is lie.
So every single word is a lie.

1519
01:28:32,981 --> 01:28:35,290
And you can tell that in the falsity of 
his voice.

1520
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,680
And so I was back in it.

1521
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,990
I could give you the time.
I tied sleeves on you.

1522
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,870
We nearly put one over on that old 
gypsy.

1523
01:28:48,910 --> 01:28:49,743
That time
you might not want to be with a fortune 

1524
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,550
to someone.
Let me see.

1525
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:16,360
That's it.
Okay.

1526
01:29:16,361 --> 01:29:17,194
So because of long practice,
these two are more adept deadline line 

1527
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:23,260
and Pinocchio is at detecting false 
hood.

1528
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:25,810
Okay.
So he,

1529
01:29:25,811 --> 01:29:28,600
he's,
he's still naive and that's not the same

1530
01:29:28,601 --> 01:29:30,940
as good.
He's not doing,

1531
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,070
he's not evil.
He's neither.

1532
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:35,770
He's just naive and people often 
mistake.

1533
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:38,560
Now evd for good.
I couldn't imagine doing that.

1534
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:41,560
That doesn't make you good at,
just makes you naive.

1535
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:44,940
And so it's definitely one of the,
you know,

1536
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,860
direct threats in the world when the 
puppet goes out.

1537
01:29:47,861 --> 01:29:51,460
He actually doesn't encounter like an 
Avatar of tire map.

1538
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:53,890
It's not a natural force.
It's not a crocodile.

1539
01:29:53,891 --> 01:29:55,750
It's not danger lurking somewhere 
that's,

1540
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,430
you know,
off the natural world.

1541
01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:58,383
It's the corrupt social world.
So you could think about this as his 

1542
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:01,654
encounter with seth.
Although these guys are like low rent 

1543
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:05,320
versions of Seth,
you know,

1544
01:30:05,321 --> 01:30:07,210
they're,
they're petty evil.

1545
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:15,200
Speak on the
cons,

1546
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:18,430
right?
You Sleep,

1547
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,880
oh my name is molly's job.
How's that?

1548
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,270
No one else,
any cops.

1549
01:30:51,070 --> 01:30:55,080
Oh,
oh,

1550
01:30:55,580 --> 01:31:00,100
oh,
oh,

1551
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:01,960
I'm sorry.

1552
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,810
So he's off to school.
He's gone.

1553
01:31:05,811 --> 01:31:06,860
His book soul,
you know,

1554
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:09,360
he's,
he's heading straight towards the,

1555
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:10,363
the conventional path to knowledge and 
enculturation safe and something trips 

1556
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:16,130
them up.
Well we know how that works.

1557
01:31:16,131 --> 01:31:19,340
And so what trips you up is chaos.
And then,

1558
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:20,263
you know,
chaos can manifest itself as many 

1559
01:31:21,651 --> 01:31:24,850
forums.
And what it manifests itself here as is,

1560
01:31:25,070 --> 01:31:25,903
is like low level of malevolence.
So they've got plans for him that he 

1561
01:31:29,721 --> 01:31:31,910
knows nothing about and all the plans 
are,

1562
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:34,730
is exploited.
And so you could think about that as one

1563
01:31:34,731 --> 01:31:38,660
of the canonical existential problems 
that people face in the world.

1564
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:39,494
And what happens is Pinocchio faces a 
number of canonical existential 

1565
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,340
challenges and they're not trivial.
Obviously.

1566
01:31:46,341 --> 01:31:48,710
He's no match for these characters even 
though they're like,

1567
01:31:48,770 --> 01:31:50,520
you know,
they're pretty rich.

1568
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:52,040
It as far as thugs go.

1569
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:57,133
No,

1570
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:05,710
I see
a man of letters,

1571
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:23,700
that
personality,

1572
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,420
this party is more relevant now than it 
was when it was first,

1573
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:41,170
when it was first produced.
I mean,

1574
01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:42,893
you know,
people were obsessed with fame at this 

1575
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:45,454
point,
but it has nothing like it is today 

1576
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,160
where we have people who are famous 
merely for being famous.

1577
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:51,994
And you know,
part of the reason that they're famous 

1578
01:32:53,171 --> 01:32:54,004
is because they're there.
They're like anti stars indicate in a 

1579
01:32:57,911 --> 01:33:01,780
sense what they indicate to people,
and this is partly why they're popular,

1580
01:33:01,781 --> 01:33:05,620
is that you can get to the top of the 
hierarchy of power and influence without

1581
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:06,454
having anything that distinguishes you 
whatsoever except maybe some random 

1582
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:11,640
attractive feature.
You know?

1583
01:33:11,641 --> 01:33:12,474
And that's,
that's precisely what's being talked 

1584
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:14,974
about here.
And so it took me a long time to figure 

1585
01:33:17,021 --> 01:33:20,470
out why in the world was this film so 
critical of actors?

1586
01:33:20,530 --> 01:33:21,363
I thought it was produced by Hollywood.
It's like they're engaged in this 

1587
01:33:23,411 --> 01:33:25,930
dramatic game.
So what's wrong with actor,

1588
01:33:25,931 --> 01:33:30,931
but it's not actor in the actor Sam's,
it's persona in the psychological sense.

1589
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,493
Do you want to be the real thing or you 
want to be something who appears to be 

1590
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:38,500
the real thing?
It's a lot easier.

1591
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:39,513
And that way you could,
you can attain all the advantages of 

1592
01:33:42,311 --> 01:33:43,144
status and power without having to have 
done anything that actually contributes 

1593
01:33:46,931 --> 01:33:50,140
to the system in which that kind of 
status and power is actually possible.

1594
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,930
So basically what you're doing is you're
Europe,

1595
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:57,730
Europe,
simulacrum of of competence.

1596
01:33:57,910 --> 01:34:00,070
And you know the fox here like that 
already.

1597
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,770
He's cynical about school,
but when he holds a book,

1598
01:34:02,771 --> 01:34:03,604
he holds it upside down.
He has no idea what he's being cynical 

1599
01:34:05,381 --> 01:34:06,214
about.
And so you might think of this as the 

1600
01:34:07,991 --> 01:34:09,170
first,
it's what?

1601
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:11,350
It's not necessarily bow first 
temptation,

1602
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:14,950
but it's at first temptation.
It's the temptation of persona.

1603
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:18,640
Are you going to be really who you are 
or you're going to be an actor?

1604
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:19,803
Well,
Pinocchio obviously picks actor and no 

1605
01:34:21,551 --> 01:34:22,900
wonder,
you know,

1606
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:23,920
it's,
it's,

1607
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,753
it's a convincing possibility and that 
would be associated with youngs idea of 

1608
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:29,464
development of the persona.
But the persona is also a necessary 

1609
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:32,974
thing to develop.
So you could also think about this as a 

1610
01:34:36,401 --> 01:34:40,750
developmental phase.
You need to learn how to act in public.

1611
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:45,730
And so if you learn to well how to act 
in public,

1612
01:34:45,731 --> 01:34:48,190
well then there's nothing left of you 
and it's a catastrophe.

1613
01:34:48,191 --> 01:34:50,700
But if you don't learn at all,
well that's equally it.

1614
01:34:50,701 --> 01:34:51,910
Catastrophe.
So,

1615
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:52,930
okay.
So anyways,

1616
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,580
he's suckered in by these guys.

1617
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,630
I can see your name in lights,
lights,

1618
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:05,820
six feet high.
Name

1619
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,830
no po P.
Dot.

1620
01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:19,030
William wasting precious come
home.

1621
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:25,940
Yes.
Horrible thing.

1622
01:35:45,930 --> 01:35:46,763
Okay.
So the conscience basically tells him 

1623
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,470
it's very interesting.
You see this little look where he is.

1624
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,453
No,

1625
01:35:58,570 --> 01:36:00,280
that thing in the background there.

1626
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:06,490
Well I don't know if I can eat

1627
01:36:06,550 --> 01:36:08,280
and explain it.
I'll try to explain it.

1628
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,910
One of the holiest Hindus symbols is,
is the Yoni Lingham.

1629
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,850
Um,
combination,

1630
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,560
masculine and feminine.
It's like a container and a phallic

1631
01:36:21,390 --> 01:36:22,223
cylinder and it's often in gold and it's
often the thing that's at the center of 

1632
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:26,874
a temple and it's a car.
It's a symbol for the original 

1633
01:36:29,911 --> 01:36:30,744
juxtaposition of masculine and feminine.
The creative juxtaposition of masculine 

1634
01:36:34,381 --> 01:36:35,820
and feminine.
Okay.

1635
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,130
So it's also a symbol,
it's like a taoist symbol.

1636
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,130
It's also very similar to the Jewish 
star,

1637
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:44,880
which is a female triangle.
And a male triangle put together.

1638
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,050
And so it's a combination.
It's,

1639
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:47,933
it's a symbol of the unity out of which 
valuable things spring Hanse it'd be 

1640
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,580
gold.
Well the cricket is speaking from that.

1641
01:36:57,330 --> 01:36:58,163
And so you could also say that the 
conscience in some sense is the voice 

1642
01:37:01,351 --> 01:37:02,184
of,
it's the voice of the combination of 

1643
01:37:04,621 --> 01:37:07,830
masculine and feminine from him from a 
mythological perspective.

1644
01:37:07,831 --> 01:37:10,170
And it's trying to speak natural wisdom 
or,

1645
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:11,333
or maybe it's trying to speak wisdom.
That's the optimal combination of 

1646
01:37:14,251 --> 01:37:15,084
natural and cultural wisdom and trying 
to convince Pinocchio that this isn't a 

1647
01:37:18,841 --> 01:37:20,940
good idea,
but he doesn't listen.

1648
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,240
So then he gets,
he meets this Italian,

1649
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:25,343
a scam artist fundamentally who in 
slaves him well pretending that he's 

1650
01:37:30,331 --> 01:37:32,250
doing a good thing and you could see 
them.

1651
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,050
The cricket is

1652
01:37:35,450 --> 01:37:38,660
not very happy about this.
Where is that?

1653
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:39,710
Okay.

1654
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:41,330
Right there.
He's Very

1655
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:43,663
Unhappy About Pinocchio.
Was d two or into cheap attention 

1656
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:49,070
getting okay.

1657
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:22,273
Yeah.
So you see there the emergence of the 

1658
01:38:23,371 --> 01:38:24,810
tyrannosaur farther,
like you know,

1659
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:28,940
in that explosion of Rage is Pinocchio 
was not acting his puppet part.

1660
01:38:28,941 --> 01:38:33,110
And so there's instant rage on the part 
of the tyrant now when he finds out that

1661
01:38:33,111 --> 01:38:37,580
the crowd is happy about his now a slave
making,

1662
01:38:37,581 --> 01:38:40,370
a fool of himself,
that that's also funny and that that can

1663
01:38:40,371 --> 01:38:42,230
garner attention,
that it's all,

1664
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,650
it's all,
you know,

1665
01:38:44,150 --> 01:38:46,070
put away.
So,

1666
01:38:46,370 --> 01:38:47,203
and you know,
it's certainly possible for children to 

1667
01:38:49,011 --> 01:38:51,530
be caused by celebrities by acting 
badly.

1668
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:53,990
Like if you've been around badly behaved
children,

1669
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,510
especially if they're kind of 
professional added,

1670
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:59,120
that's exactly what they do there.
You know,

1671
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,313
they absorb all the attention in the 
room and they do that by acting in a 

1672
01:39:03,261 --> 01:39:07,100
suboptimal way.
And it's a terrible thing to see happen.

1673
01:39:07,101 --> 01:39:08,990
And that's exactly what's being played 
out here.

1674
01:39:09,410 --> 01:39:10,243
You know,
their parents think they're giving them 

1675
01:39:11,391 --> 01:39:13,220
freedom,
but they're not there.

1676
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,460
They're quite the contrary.
Okay.

1677
01:39:16,461 --> 01:39:18,710
So anyways,
so Pinocchio does his Little Act

1678
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:22,790
and shows that he's capable of 
autonomous action.

1679
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:26,610
He makes a fool of himself again at the 
end and

1680
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,233
Oh shit.

1681
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:32,570
Okay.
And then this scene,

1682
01:39:32,571 --> 01:39:35,420
Japan goes out to look for Pinocchio 
because he hasn't come home.

1683
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,833
All right?
And so then now we're back after the 

1684
01:39:39,620 --> 01:39:40,453
performance.

1685
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,800
Boom.
Sure.

1686
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:08,320
I would push you in the public's eyes,
your face.

1687
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:12,590
She would be on everybody's down.
Yeah.

1688
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:18,220
Uh Huh.
Uh,

1689
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:26,810
you,
my,

1690
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:31,811
you go to her no heel.
Yeah.

1691
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:38,923
God,
you're going to go home at the old 

1692
01:40:41,050 --> 01:40:44,300
mother
Mary called beat.

1693
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,193
Well,
you obviously know what's going to 

1694
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:49,884
happen next.
So he's now become a prisoner of this 

1695
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,010
thing that's exploiting

1696
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:58,420
him and it threatens him.
And then of course he's kidnapped.

1697
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:01,420
So the cricket goes off to look for,

1698
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:19,190
what was that show?
Don't you worry,

1699
01:41:20,340 --> 01:41:22,350
I'll have you out of here in no time at 
all.

1700
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:25,810
Why?
This is just as easy

1701
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:35,710
[inaudible]

1702
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:39,120
animosity.
Okay.

1703
01:41:39,121 --> 01:41:43,200
So neither the conscience nor Pinocchio 
can make it out of here.

1704
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:47,820
And so they're both trapped because this
is actually a very sneaky,

1705
01:41:47,940 --> 01:41:52,090
difficult position to be it all right.
But

1706
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:55,983
anyway,

1707
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,640
I tell her the truth.

1708
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,033
You know,
there's an idea about creative people 

1709
01:42:19,321 --> 01:42:24,000
that they have a muse and the muse is 
often a feminine figure.

1710
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,490
And there's a variety of reasons for 
that.

1711
01:42:26,491 --> 01:42:28,170
But some of the were played out in this 
movie.

1712
01:42:28,171 --> 01:42:30,390
But the idea to some degree is,
is that,

1713
01:42:31,080 --> 01:42:33,870
you know,
if you're out in no man's land in chaos,

1714
01:42:33,871 --> 01:42:34,704
maybe you've broken a social rule that 
there's the possibility that you can 

1715
01:42:37,801 --> 01:42:41,610
garner something positive from it if 
your attitude is proper.

1716
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:42,953
And that's part of what's happening here
is that he encounters the positive 

1717
01:42:45,661 --> 01:42:48,210
element of deviation deviating from the 
path.

1718
01:42:49,020 --> 01:42:51,750
But there's also something a little more
subtle,

1719
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:56,751
which is the idea that
your nature is robust enough to tolerate

1720
01:42:57,811 --> 01:43:00,960
a certain amount of deviation from the 
proper course.

1721
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:05,580
You can tolerate like oscillations back 
and forth into too much order.

1722
01:43:05,581 --> 01:43:08,130
It too much chaos without it completely 
undermining you.

1723
01:43:08,460 --> 01:43:09,293
But then the movie also makes a point is
that that works best if you're not 

1724
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:13,794
falsifying your own experience.
And of course this is the part of the 

1725
01:43:15,571 --> 01:43:16,404
movie that,
that Everybody Who Watches Pinocchio 

1726
01:43:18,091 --> 01:43:20,520
always remembers is that when he tells a
lie,

1727
01:43:20,521 --> 01:43:22,620
his nose growth,
right?

1728
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:26,100
Making him making the lie obvious to 
others fundamentally.

1729
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,180
And you know,
the,

1730
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:29,430
the simple moral from the stories don't 
lie.

1731
01:43:29,431 --> 01:43:30,264
And of course that's,
that's a primary part of the 

1732
01:43:33,991 --> 01:43:38,640
developmental sequence in the movie.
Part of the problem with the lie is that

1733
01:43:38,850 --> 01:43:43,850
it prevents you from repairing your own 
structure because you deny the existence

1734
01:43:43,861 --> 01:43:44,694
of the error.
And what do you do then is accumulate 

1735
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:47,094
errors as you move through time.
And if you do that long enough then all 

1736
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:52,010
you are is there and then you're really 
in

1737
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
trouble because part of your conscience 
is speaking from the error ridden 

1738
01:43:57,890 --> 01:44:01,700
domain.
And so the more you pathologize your own

1739
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:04,880
internal structure or say your 
relationship with the broader community,

1740
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:07,840
the less it is possible for you to 
realize it.

1741
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:08,683
To rely on that in build voice of 
conscience because it gets pathologized 

1742
01:44:13,131 --> 01:44:13,964
too.
And so you can imagine that as the 

1743
01:44:16,221 --> 01:44:20,060
development of a positive feedback loop.
The more you tell yourself lies,

1744
01:44:20,061 --> 01:44:20,894
the more ben your perceptions become.
And and the more unstable the self 

1745
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:30,140
guiding mechanism so to speak inside of 
you becomes.

1746
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:35,860
So that's the corruption of the self is.
And then the corruption of the state.

1747
01:44:39,070 --> 01:44:39,903
You know,
one of the things you hypothesize 

1748
01:44:41,451 --> 01:44:44,240
where's the people are almost always 
bugged by,

1749
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:49,250
by things that are also partly that are 
connected in some important way.

1750
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:50,084
To the social community.
And one of the things he suggested was 

1751
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:55,910
that if you really fix your own 
problems,

1752
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:57,643
you know the problems that have 
announced themselves to you within your 

1753
01:44:59,661 --> 01:45:00,494
own personal space,
if you took them on is your problems to 

1754
01:45:02,271 --> 01:45:03,104
fix.
You would also be simultaneously 

1755
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:09,290
retooling the social structure in so far
as you were able to do that.

1756
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:11,690
Because there's no,
there's no only fixing you,

1757
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:12,131
you know,
you,

1758
01:45:12,131 --> 01:45:15,770
you change the social structure around 
you just by fixing yourself.

1759
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:20,510
And so what that also means is that to 
the degree that you failed to respond to

1760
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:23,360
your own knowledge of error,
and this is what makes it so cool.

1761
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:24,393
It isn't,
this process is isn't someone else 

1762
01:45:26,271 --> 01:45:27,104
telling you that you're wrong,
it's you telling yourself that you're 

1763
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:33,050
wrong.
And so it doesn't,

1764
01:45:33,051 --> 01:45:36,650
failure to abide by the rules because 
the rules,

1765
01:45:36,651 --> 01:45:39,200
while the conscience is the arbiter of 
the rules,

1766
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:42,290
they're unstable,
necessary but unstable.

1767
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:43,840
But you're,
you're,

1768
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:44,983
the moral battle that you're obliged to 
pass through is it is a product of your 

1769
01:45:48,321 --> 01:45:49,154
own construction.
And so it's as if you're playing a game 

1770
01:45:51,111 --> 01:45:53,900
and then where you make up the rules and
then cheating,

1771
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:55,250
not useful.

1772
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:04,580
Cool.
Oh,

1773
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:10,300
it's writing it.
Anyway.

1774
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:16,270
So now he's given up
back to nature.

1775
01:46:21,220 --> 01:46:26,220
I tell her the truth.
Ah,

1776
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:36,810
oh
wow.

1777
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:42,220
This
Nokia,

1778
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:47,640
why didn't you go to school?
Go ahead Tom.

1779
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:53,863
Yeah.

1780
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:02,830
The other thing that's happening here 
obviously is that he,

1781
01:47:02,831 --> 01:47:03,664
as he lies,
he becomes less human and more would 

1782
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:07,640
like.
So

1783
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,000
hence the,
you know,

1784
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:12,710
the nose growing.
So anyways,

1785
01:47:12,711 --> 01:47:13,544
he learns that that's a bad idea and the
ferry gives them a hand and he escapes 

1786
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,050
out of that.
Hypothetically having learned something.

1787
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:26,103
Okay,

1788
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:27,523
now I want you to follow this.
So you remember at the beginning of the 

1789
01:47:30,201 --> 01:47:31,250
movie,
Pinocchio,

1790
01:47:31,251 --> 01:47:32,061
God,
his smile,

1791
01:47:32,061 --> 01:47:34,700
you saw that negative male figure 
glaring out of it.

1792
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:38,780
And then we saw the same negative fee 
figure male figure in the,

1793
01:47:38,781 --> 01:47:39,710
uh,
you know,

1794
01:47:39,711 --> 01:47:43,160
in the Gypsy who the kidnapping gypsy.
Now they're harsh,

1795
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:44,720
tyrannical male.
Okay.

1796
01:47:44,721 --> 01:47:45,554
So what you're doing is,
and then of course there's the Fox and 

1797
01:47:47,331 --> 01:47:50,090
the cat.
You're seeing different incarnations are

1798
01:47:50,091 --> 01:47:52,130
avatars of the,
of the negative.

1799
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:54,500
Great fodder.
And you know,

1800
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:55,100
with,
with,

1801
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,500
I would say some contamination by the 
adversary,

1802
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:59,120
but we'll,
we'll just stick with the negative.

1803
01:47:59,121 --> 01:48:00,290
Great farther.
Right now,

1804
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,130
what happens here is the actual 
archetype reveals itself.

1805
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:05,960
So you could think of this as a,
you know,

1806
01:48:05,961 --> 01:48:06,794
it's a daunting is inferno model.
Pinocchio is coming into contact with 

1807
01:48:10,521 --> 01:48:12,350
things that are more and more serious.

1808
01:48:12,650 --> 01:48:13,483
And what you see here is the petty petty
evil guys bragging about how remarkable 

1809
01:48:18,321 --> 01:48:19,154
they are to the coachman coachman's that
typical archetipal a representation of 

1810
01:48:23,841 --> 01:48:26,570
Satan.
So the coachman is someone who takes you

1811
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:27,920
where you don't want to go.
You know,

1812
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:29,630
it's something that,
that it's,

1813
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:33,650
it's your,
your placement within the confines of an

1814
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:34,484
autonomous force.
So what you see here is they encounter 

1815
01:48:37,431 --> 01:48:41,870
the coachman and the coachman doesn't 
reveal who he is except in one place.

1816
01:48:41,871 --> 01:48:42,704
And what's interesting,
so it's all of a sudden he transforms 

1817
01:48:45,201 --> 01:48:47,540
from a,
a mere character in the movie.

1818
01:48:47,541 --> 01:48:49,430
So to speak,
to the archetype itself.

1819
01:48:49,431 --> 01:48:52,220
It reveals itself.
And then the gates slam back shop.

1820
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:53,413
And one of the things that's very 
interesting is that that revelation is 

1821
01:48:55,611 --> 01:48:56,444
sufficient even to terrify the thugs 
because in some sense they have no idea 

1822
01:49:00,561 --> 01:49:01,880
what they're messing with.
You know,

1823
01:49:01,881 --> 01:49:02,714
and they're very art.
They're very narcissistic and 

1824
01:49:04,131 --> 01:49:04,964
egotistical and they think that they're 
going to get away with what they're 

1825
01:49:07,221 --> 01:49:10,190
doing forever and you know that they're 
really not so bad anyways.

1826
01:49:10,191 --> 01:49:13,100
And that the people they're praying on 
it deserve it because they're stupid and

1827
01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:15,050
you know,
they're full of rationalizations,

1828
01:49:15,470 --> 01:49:16,303
but they get a glimpse of what it is 
that's animating them and it terrifies 

1829
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:20,594
them.

1830
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:59,900
This job's too
coach man.

1831
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:13,760
What's your brother's name?
How would you like to make some money?

1832
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,840
And who do we ask to it?
Nothing.

1833
01:50:27,230 --> 01:50:32,230
You see,
you'll know the disability.

1834
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:09,860
No,
no,

1835
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:16,980
no
crossing.

1836
01:51:33,650 --> 01:51:35,510
You always meet the Devil at the 
crossroads,

1837
01:51:35,511 --> 01:51:37,250
right?
Cause every blues singer notes.

1838
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:38,263
Why?
Because the crossroads is a binary 

1839
01:51:41,151 --> 01:51:42,410
choice.
Right.

1840
01:51:42,411 --> 01:51:44,030
And there's the right road in the wrong 
road.

1841
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:46,400
So the devil always be two at the 
crossroads.

1842
01:51:46,940 --> 01:51:47,773
So,
and that's where the coachman meets the 

1843
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:50,180
boys.
It's a decision point.

1844
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:51,980
So,
okay.

1845
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:56,660
So something up is something is up that 
isn't good.

1846
01:51:57,860 --> 01:52:02,510
So Pinocchio is going back to school and
then he gets stopped again.

1847
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:08,410
Okay,
the snake

1848
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:28,190
to
go,

1849
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:34,860
no sir,
nothing can stop me now I will.

1850
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:41,080
I'm going to school.
That's it.

1851
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:20,020
Victim.
That's the next temptation.

1852
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:22,970
So,
and the victim Motif is a deep one.

1853
01:53:22,971 --> 01:53:23,804
So basically what the Fox tells the boy 
now is that there's a bunch of things 

1854
01:53:26,991 --> 01:53:28,790
wrong with it.
Well obviously right?

1855
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:30,590
Because there's a bunch of things wrong 
with everyone,

1856
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,053
but,
and so he can make a perfectly 

1857
01:53:33,471 --> 01:53:34,304
reasonable claim of that.
And then he convinces the boy that the 

1858
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:38,324
fact that there's something wrong with 
him justifies his deviation from what 

1859
01:53:41,181 --> 01:53:43,360
he's supposed to do.
And that's,

1860
01:53:43,430 --> 01:53:45,440
that's a classical eatable trick,
by the way,

1861
01:53:45,441 --> 01:53:46,274
if you want to keep your kids at home 
and make sure that they never leave and 

1862
01:53:48,411 --> 01:53:49,244
render them completely useless,
what you want to do is watch them toy 

1863
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:55,970
with their own vulnerability and then 
encourage that,

1864
01:53:56,330 --> 01:53:57,310
you know?
So if the kid,

1865
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:00,440
you ever use this being ill as a,
an excuse,

1866
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:01,274
which every kid will absolutely do,
especially if they have to go do 

1867
01:54:03,891 --> 01:54:05,870
something they don't want to do,
like go to school,

1868
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,240
you just give in every time they do 
that.

1869
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:09,373
Or if you really want to do a good job,
what you do is you reward them every 

1870
01:54:11,931 --> 01:54:15,530
time they do that and you punish them 
every time they do the opposite.

1871
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:16,753
And if you do that 150,000 times,
then you'll have someone who will be 

1872
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:23,570
absolutely incapable of standing on 
their own two feet.

1873
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:26,750
And that's very helpful for you.
If that's the sort of person you want to

1874
01:54:26,751 --> 01:54:27,584
have around that,
usually you're usually inclined to do 

1875
01:54:29,691 --> 01:54:31,310
that if you don't have a life of your 
own,

1876
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:32,923
you know,
and you can't even tolerate the 

1877
01:54:34,011 --> 01:54:34,844
possibility of ever being alone.
So you cripple your child so they can't 

1878
01:54:37,821 --> 01:54:38,654
leave.

1879
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:39,890
Yeah.

1880
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:42,380
So that's essentially what's being 
offered to Pinocchio now.

1881
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:44,060
And then the,
the Fox says,

1882
01:54:44,061 --> 01:54:45,740
look,
you're way too stressed.

1883
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:48,530
Everything's too terrible.
What you need is a vacation.

1884
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:50,880
So what we're going to do is replace 
the,

1885
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,510
the duty,
so to speak to them.

1886
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:53,563
You know,
the movement forward towards the proper 

1887
01:54:54,801 --> 01:54:58,460
goal with nothing but fun and games.
So it's,

1888
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:01,790
you could say it's a future discounting 
in the extreme,

1889
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:04,310
forget about the future.
Life is hard.

1890
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:05,144
Concentrate on the present,
do the easy fun things and you deserve 

1891
01:55:07,971 --> 01:55:09,860
it anyways because you're in such rough 
shape,

1892
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:12,740
you can see that that's a very 
compelling temptation.

1893
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:13,603
I mean,
I had a child who is quite ill for a 

1894
01:55:15,711 --> 01:55:19,590
long time and one of the things we 
really struggled with was if you have,

1895
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:20,443
you're with someone who's really ill,
how the hell do you know when to excuse 

1896
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:26,240
them from their obligations?

1897
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:28,220
You know,
like I could never,

1898
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:30,710
we had to,
we had the negotiate this all the time.

1899
01:55:30,711 --> 01:55:31,544
So my,
my,

1900
01:55:31,550 --> 01:55:33,830
my one child was very,
very tired in the morning,

1901
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:34,693
terribly tired.
It was a secondary consequence of this 

1902
01:55:37,221 --> 01:55:39,020
particular illness.
But you know,

1903
01:55:39,021 --> 01:55:39,854
we were trying to negotiate that.
It's like you have to go what you have 

1904
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,880
to do,
unless you absolutely can't.

1905
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:46,560
Okay.
When can't you?

1906
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:47,993
Well,
God,

1907
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:50,760
can you do it if you can crawl out the 
door?

1908
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:53,190
I don't know.
Did you ever see my left foot?

1909
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,280
It's an amazing movie.
It's based on a true story.

1910
01:55:56,281 --> 01:55:57,114
It's about this kid who,
I think he had cerebral palsy but he 

1911
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:03,510
couldn't really do anything with his 
body except with his left foot.

1912
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:08,220
He could drag himself around with his 
left foot and he learned to write and he

1913
01:56:08,221 --> 01:56:10,170
learned to draw and he learned how to 
communicate.

1914
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:12,600
And you went to school.
But as far to just wouldn't help him.

1915
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,790
He dragged himself up and down the 
stairs.

1916
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:17,250
Like he had to do everything with his 
left foot.

1917
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:18,630
And you know,
he managed,

1918
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:21,240
he managed to live that way.
But you know,

1919
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,500
I just,
I can't,

1920
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:23,393
I don't think I've ever met anyone in 
the modern world who would be tough 

1921
01:56:27,901 --> 01:56:30,690
enough to do what his father did because
you know,

1922
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:31,620
you'd say,
well,

1923
01:56:31,710 --> 01:56:34,470
have some compassion.
It's like,

1924
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:37,470
yeah,
well compassion is a double edge sword,

1925
01:56:37,710 --> 01:56:38,940
you know,
and the basic rule,

1926
01:56:38,941 --> 01:56:39,774
I can tell you what the rule is,
and this is a rule that's often used in 

1927
01:56:41,641 --> 01:56:44,730
nursing homes.
Never do anything for anyone they can do

1928
01:56:44,731 --> 01:56:47,100
themselves.
And you think,

1929
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:47,934
well that's,
that's harsh man part because you have 

1930
01:56:50,371 --> 01:56:54,390
to find out what they can do.
But it's also respect for their autonomy

1931
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:57,420
and encouragement to continue developing
so

1932
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:02,600
well.
So that isn't what happens here.

1933
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:04,873
You know,
one of the things I told my child was 

1934
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,710
never use your illness as an excuse.
Not even once.

1935
01:57:09,711 --> 01:57:11,870
Because as soon as you do that,
even once,

1936
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:12,943
you won't be able to tell the difference
between being sick and wanting to be 

1937
01:57:14,871 --> 01:57:15,704
sick.
And when you're sick like that and you 

1938
01:57:17,121 --> 01:57:18,650
know,
50 things is wrong with you,

1939
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:23,030
it's already hard enough to figure out 
what you can do and what you can't do,

1940
01:57:23,031 --> 01:57:23,864
man,
you drop a little bit of poison into 

1941
01:57:25,071 --> 01:57:28,850
that brew and like it's just toxic mess 
everywhere.

1942
01:57:31,150 --> 01:57:35,590
We must diagnosis cases once we got the,
Yup.

1943
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:42,430
So basically what happens here is that 
by over attending to Pinocchio's,

1944
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,800
let's say neurotic doubts,
the parent figure produces,

1945
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,710
uh,
like hop,

1946
01:57:49,711 --> 01:57:51,080
hop,
hypochondriasis,

1947
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:52,043
you know,
because partly what parents kids are 

1948
01:57:52,941 --> 01:57:54,650
doing is saying,
I feel like this,

1949
01:57:54,710 --> 01:57:57,110
what does that mean?
My throat hurts a bit.

1950
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,970
Does that mean I don't have to go to 
school?

1951
01:57:59,540 --> 01:58:00,373
Well,
for sure you don't have to go to school 

1952
01:58:01,911 --> 01:58:04,130
and there's probably eight other things 
wrong with you.

1953
01:58:04,131 --> 01:58:04,964
You know,
and then let's spend a bunch of time 

1954
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:07,183
looking for them.
Maybe we can have a hug and a cuddle 

1955
01:58:08,631 --> 01:58:11,090
while we're doing that.
And I don't have to watch my stupid soap

1956
01:58:11,091 --> 01:58:13,880
operas and you could stay home from 
school and keep me company.

1957
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:16,250
It's a little conspiracy,
you know?

1958
01:58:16,251 --> 01:58:19,970
So the child learns to do that and to 
bloody will exploit that like mad.

1959
01:58:20,210 --> 01:58:21,043
And the parent can justify doing that 
with the feeling that they're being 

1960
01:58:24,051 --> 01:58:26,840
compassionate.
So it's a nasty,

1961
01:58:26,841 --> 01:58:27,674
nasty little game.
And that's partly why it's laid out 

1962
01:58:29,751 --> 01:58:30,860
here.
So anyways,

1963
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,810
he convinced his Pinocchio,
the sick,

1964
01:58:35,500 --> 01:58:39,640
making him sick in the process and then 
telling him he needs a vacation.

1965
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,600
So off they go.
Vacation time.

1966
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,113
Yeah.

1967
01:59:06,230 --> 01:59:07,063
Okay.
So this nasty little character we're 

1968
01:59:08,091 --> 01:59:09,410
going to beat now,
meet now.

1969
01:59:09,411 --> 01:59:10,244
His name is lamp wake.
And I think that's a reference to 

1970
01:59:11,871 --> 01:59:12,704
Lucifer.
It's the same category of word and he's 

1971
01:59:15,051 --> 01:59:15,884
a prematurely cynical,
delinquent type of kid and he's got a 

1972
01:59:18,591 --> 01:59:21,980
very superior and arrogant attitude 
cause he goes everything cause nothing's

1973
01:59:21,981 --> 01:59:25,160
worth knowing.
And he's the adversary.

1974
01:59:25,550 --> 01:59:27,740
He's Pinocchio's shadow.
That's,

1975
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,400
that's one way of thinking about 
written.

1976
01:59:29,430 --> 01:59:30,263
So Pinocchio meets a Chateau,
which of course every teenager meets 

1977
01:59:32,841 --> 01:59:35,570
when they're a teenager because that's 
who you meet when you're a teenager,

1978
01:59:35,571 --> 01:59:36,260
right?
It's,

1979
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:37,093
it's that part of the developing ego 
that's challenging the structure of the 

1980
01:59:41,541 --> 01:59:44,270
community and often doing that by 
breaking rules.

1981
01:59:44,271 --> 01:59:47,030
And so that's what people always talk 
about as pure pressure.

1982
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:48,373
You know,
are you going to try this bad thing or 

1983
01:59:49,411 --> 01:59:51,260
are you going to try that bad thing?
You know,

1984
01:59:51,261 --> 01:59:54,440
kids have to experiment with that.
And so it's part of the deal.

1985
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:56,660
It's part of the developmental 
progression.

1986
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:58,310
And you know,
the question is well,

1987
01:59:58,311 --> 01:59:59,144
why not behave badly and break all the 
rules and be on disciplined and you 

1988
02:00:02,090 --> 02:00:02,923
know,
take every advantage it's at your 

1989
02:00:04,071 --> 02:00:06,560
fingertips.
That's a perfectly reasonable question.

1990
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,220
Let me say it's a swell job.
No school,

1991
02:00:25,230 --> 02:00:28,420
no.
Nobody says,

1992
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:33,421
oh boy.
Oh

1993
02:00:35,550 --> 02:00:36,950
boy.
That's the place.

1994
02:00:39,780 --> 02:00:40,613
The other thing that's interesting about
lamp wait cause he completely 

1995
02:00:42,931 --> 02:00:44,480
narcissistic,
like I don't give,

1996
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:47,340
it doesn't even exist for him.
And so he's basically,

1997
02:00:47,341 --> 02:00:48,174
he's got tremendously well developed 
psychopathic traits and he's also 

1998
02:00:50,911 --> 02:00:53,730
delusional because he thinks this is all
going to be free.

1999
02:00:54,330 --> 02:00:59,330
So they go off the route of the main 
culture out to an isolated place.

2000
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,960
All right,
so it's like,

2001
02:01:00,961 --> 02:01:03,930
I would say that we're there going,
I told you that [inaudible] was a suburb

2002
02:01:03,931 --> 02:01:06,180
of the underworld.
Well that's where they're headed.

2003
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,840
So,
and they're also in a mall,

2004
02:01:37,330 --> 02:01:38,163
not an easy thing

2005
02:01:38,300 --> 02:01:39,133
to escape.

2006
02:02:02,220 --> 02:02:03,053
One of the things that's quite striking 
about horror movies is that they're 

2007
02:02:05,251 --> 02:02:06,084
often,
they often feature clouds and they're 

2008
02:02:07,981 --> 02:02:10,620
often said at amusement parks and you 
might say,

2009
02:02:10,621 --> 02:02:10,980
well,
what,

2010
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:14,190
what the hell is the connection between 
the Amusement Park and horror?

2011
02:02:14,580 --> 02:02:15,413
Well,
I don't know if you've ever been to 

2012
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,580
amusement park,
but if you have,

2013
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:19,680
you can see the connection pretty much 
right away.

2014
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:21,000
You know,
they,

2015
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:23,970
it's,
it's mindless entertainment,

2016
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:24,833
roughly speaking.
And now it's not like there's anything 

2017
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:27,833
particularly
intrinsically terrible about mindless 

2018
02:02:31,921 --> 02:02:33,660
entertainment.
But there's this,

2019
02:02:33,690 --> 02:02:34,523
there's a dark side to amusement parks 
and carney life and the gambling that 

2020
02:02:38,221 --> 02:02:39,930
goes on there,
like it's low level.

2021
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:40,853
It's a low level place.
It's a low class place roughly speaking 

2022
02:02:44,011 --> 02:02:49,011
and it's because it's associated.
It's associated with this idea of fun in

2023
02:02:49,771 --> 02:02:52,740
the moment with no care for the future.
And that's its dark side.

2024
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:53,603
That's the part of it is,
is it's tinted with horror and that's 

2025
02:02:56,701 --> 02:02:59,220
what happens here.
These kids have abandoned culture.

2026
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:00,213
They don't care about it at all.
They're cynical about it and no doubt 

2027
02:03:02,461 --> 02:03:07,230
they have their reasons and they move.
They not only are they cynical about it,

2028
02:03:07,231 --> 02:03:10,320
but they even hate it.
Maybe it's being too tyrannical for them

2029
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:11,543
or maybe they just don't want to bear 
the responsibility of having to live up 

2030
02:03:15,091 --> 02:03:16,980
to its demands.
In any case,

2031
02:03:16,981 --> 02:03:18,930
they moved from,
you know,

2032
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:22,650
ceasing to identify with it,
to wanting to pull it down completely.

2033
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:25,470
And they do that partly by engaging in 
mindless entertainment.

2034
02:03:25,471 --> 02:03:27,480
But there's more to it than that.
And this is,

2035
02:03:27,570 --> 02:03:30,300
this is where the Nazi mob thing starts 
to happen.

2036
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:57,430
So you can't find your car chase in the 
mall.

2037
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:07,000
Now you see that center symbol that's a 
Mandela niche.

2038
02:04:07,050 --> 02:04:11,110
It's very commonly portrayed in 
cathedrals and the Mandela is the symbol

2039
02:04:11,111 --> 02:04:11,944
of the self from a union perspective.
And why that is is ridiculously 

2040
02:04:15,821 --> 02:04:16,654
complicated,
but it's the best way that I could 

2041
02:04:18,641 --> 02:04:19,474
describe it as like there's this 
Buddhist idea that a lotus flower grows 

2042
02:04:22,721 --> 02:04:26,980
up from the depths through the water and
then lays itself open on top.

2043
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:28,810
And then the Buddha emerges in the 
middle.

2044
02:04:29,080 --> 02:04:32,740
And that's what a Mandela is.
It's that flower process.

2045
02:04:32,741 --> 02:04:36,190
It's like emerging being manifesting 
something perfect.

2046
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,280
And that's that thing represents.

2047
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:39,473
So

2048
02:04:39,640 --> 02:04:44,640
no,
all right,

2049
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:05,513
I've been there.
And then you start to see what's going 

2050
02:05:07,151 --> 02:05:08,320
on.
And like as I,

2051
02:05:08,321 --> 02:05:09,154
as I mentioned it at some point,
like remember what was happening in 

2052
02:05:11,111 --> 02:05:13,480
Europe at the time that this movie was 
being made.

2053
02:05:13,481 --> 02:05:14,314
You know,
like the dark forces of fascism were 

2054
02:05:16,181 --> 02:05:18,130
really starting to gather,
you know,

2055
02:05:18,131 --> 02:05:21,130
in the movie is an unconscious dram of 
sorts.

2056
02:05:21,131 --> 02:05:21,964
And one of the things that it's 
suggesting is that there's a tight 

2057
02:05:23,741 --> 02:05:28,741
connection between the abandonment of 
individual moral responsibility.

2058
02:05:29,470 --> 02:05:30,303
The turning to deceit and the 
degeneration of society into something 

2059
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:36,820
that's pleasure,
short term pleasure on the one hand that

2060
02:05:36,850 --> 02:05:39,520
absolute slavery and brutality on the 
other.

2061
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:43,180
And so you have this faceless figures 
moving in the background,

2062
02:05:43,330 --> 02:05:44,163
locking the doors to begin with.
And it's all a conspiracy in some sense 

2063
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:52,950
to conspiracy by the coachman in order 
to entrap the unwary

2064
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:09,530
awesome themselves.
No.

2065
02:06:21,730 --> 02:06:22,563
So you know,
Pinocchio is become separated from his 

2066
02:06:24,191 --> 02:06:25,024
conscience.
I would say that happens to lots of 

2067
02:06:26,141 --> 02:06:28,330
people in,
in their teenage years.

2068
02:06:28,630 --> 02:06:30,550
You know,
they experiment with all sorts of things

2069
02:06:30,551 --> 02:06:31,384
they know they shouldn't be doing.
It's not a particularly pleasant life 

2070
02:06:33,820 --> 02:06:35,770
and they lose the thread that guides 
them.

2071
02:06:35,950 --> 02:06:36,783
Now there's some necessity in that 
because in some sense they're wandering 

2072
02:06:39,581 --> 02:06:42,010
through places that they need to 
explore,

2073
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:45,610
but it's also very dangerous because it 
can leave you permanently damaged,

2074
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:51,500
you know,
you can fall out and never get back on.

2075
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:05,653
Okay,
so Pinocchio is in there and he's like 

2076
02:07:07,331 --> 02:07:11,130
playing pool and smoking and drinking 
and acting like a narcissist.

2077
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:14,770
And this guy knows some cool tricks and 
they're Pinocchio.

2078
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:17,680
He takes a little swig of his cigar and 
you know,

2079
02:07:17,681 --> 02:07:22,681
it makes him sick.
Right?

2080
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,240
So there,
that's,

2081
02:07:27,270 --> 02:07:28,830
that's deceit right there,
right.

2082
02:07:28,831 --> 02:07:31,770
He's willing to falsify the nature of 
his actual experience,

2083
02:07:31,771 --> 02:07:36,400
even at a deep physiological level in 
order to impress this character

2084
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,151
who,
you know,

2085
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:40,480
was the last person in the world that 
anyone sends a postcard to impress.

2086
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:45,940
Okay.
And now he can't end.

2087
02:07:47,261 --> 02:07:48,094
Right.

2088
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:52,243
Okay.

2089
02:07:52,730 --> 02:07:54,290
That's also very interesting.
You know,

2090
02:07:54,291 --> 02:07:55,124
you see the sideways eight ball and 
that's a symbol of infinity and it's 

2091
02:07:58,131 --> 02:07:59,420
starting to wander.
And you know,

2092
02:07:59,421 --> 02:08:00,254
partly what the,
partly what the images are suggesting 

2093
02:08:03,471 --> 02:08:04,071
is,
first of all,

2094
02:08:04,071 --> 02:08:04,904
Pinocchio's aim is very unsteady because
he's pathologized himself and he's also 

2095
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:10,963
like,
he's facing an infinite number of 

2096
02:08:12,171 --> 02:08:14,750
problems and can't aim straight to fix 
them.

2097
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,183
Losing your grip.

2098
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,293
I also think that's pretty funny from 
the perspective of teenage experience 

2099
02:08:30,731 --> 02:08:31,564
because it's often the case that just 
when some idiot teenager is out to 

2100
02:08:34,361 --> 02:08:36,750
impress someone,
he or she shouldn't depressed,

2101
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:37,584
that their conscience will pipe up and 
they'll do something absolutely moronic 

2102
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:41,493
that you know,
makes them into a fool in front of the 

2103
02:08:42,911 --> 02:08:43,744
people they're trying to impress.
And that's exactly what's happening 

2104
02:08:46,271 --> 02:08:47,110
here.
You know,

2105
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:51,340
and its partly because the person is 
torn apart inside and can't act with any

2106
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:52,360
strength.
Okay.

2107
02:08:52,361 --> 02:08:54,960
So anyways,
the cricket end,

2108
02:08:54,961 --> 02:08:55,794
this lamp put character have it out and 
Pinocchio decides that he's going to go 

2109
02:09:00,581 --> 02:09:05,050
with Lamp Wick and so Pinocchio storms 
or the cricket storms out

2110
02:09:05,690 --> 02:09:08,750
and then
he's going home.

2111
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:36,070
He's come on,
come on

2112
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:44,770
and watch your neigh.
Okay,

2113
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:49,300
Yo go
vegan ice.

2114
02:09:50,270 --> 02:09:51,103
Okay.
So basically what you see is that the 

2115
02:09:52,341 --> 02:09:53,174
pathway that's been laid out so far 
including this neurotic induced 

2116
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:57,493
antisocial trip to pleasure island 
basically culminates in a form of 

2117
02:10:00,711 --> 02:10:04,010
slavery.
But there's more to it than that because

2118
02:10:04,011 --> 02:10:06,050
it's voiceless slavery.
Right.

2119
02:10:06,140 --> 02:10:08,870
These kids,
they're now jack houses.

2120
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:13,220
They're not fit to be slaves until they 
can't speak properly anymore.

2121
02:10:13,221 --> 02:10:16,490
All they can do is break.
So they've severed their connection with

2122
02:10:16,491 --> 02:10:17,324
their capacity for genuine speech to 
such a degree that everything that is 

2123
02:10:22,011 --> 02:10:22,844
associated with a logo.
So let's say with the ability to think 

2124
02:10:25,071 --> 02:10:27,290
things through and communicate,
that's all gone.

2125
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:30,230
You're empty and brain and that's at 
that point,

2126
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:31,730
they're fit for slaves.
Yeah.

2127
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:34,160
Well,
it's not only that he can't speak is,

2128
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:37,580
is fit when you can no longer safe zone.
Right,

2129
02:10:37,610 --> 02:10:38,300
right,
right.

2130
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:39,510
Absolutely.
That's right.

2131
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:42,650
So that means that all of these 
individual identity is gone as well.

2132
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:43,543
There's nothing individual left at all.
There's just brute animal existence and 

2133
02:10:47,691 --> 02:10:49,040
that's fit for slavery.

2134
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:51,600
Oh,
mine,

2135
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:54,780
next
door.

2136
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:59,320
Maybe Allen
and Paul.

2137
02:11:00,250 --> 02:11:05,250
Yeah.
Yeah.

2138
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:14,700
Okay.
So last notes are good

2139
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:25,240
conch.
Okay.

2140
02:11:31,070 --> 02:11:36,070
You'd think something was done
or as you get to be a real board,

2141
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,580
what do you think?

2142
02:11:56,490 --> 02:11:56,830
Okay,

2143
02:11:56,830 --> 02:11:57,663
sure.

2144
02:12:01,490 --> 02:12:02,323
Hey,

2145
02:12:05,450 --> 02:12:10,450
allow me
Brian.

2146
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:54,673
Okay,

2147
02:12:55,470 --> 02:12:56,910
so the mirror,
of course,

2148
02:12:56,911 --> 02:13:00,480
that's the destruction of painful self 
consciousness.

2149
02:13:05,170 --> 02:13:05,531
Oh,
Yay.

2150
02:13:05,531 --> 02:13:10,270
So the cricket knows what's going on and
he goes to Rescue Pinocchio.

2151
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:15,720
And then the only way out from this 
place is to dive into chaos.

2152
02:13:17,830 --> 02:13:19,630
So that's what happens.
They jump off the cliff,

2153
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:22,330
very dangerous to get from somewhere 
terrible to somewhere,

2154
02:13:22,360 --> 02:13:26,170
absolutely unknown.
And so they do that and they go home,

2155
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:29,860
they wash up at home.
And so that's where we are now.

2156
02:13:31,790 --> 02:13:33,420
Well,
you can't go home again.

2157
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:50,670
Okay,
so dad's not home.

2158
02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:54,150
It's too late.
And so now they have no idea what to do.

2159
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:57,053
Going

2160
02:14:00,630 --> 02:14:01,463
now you'll see a weird intermingling of,
I would say pagan and Christian 

2161
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:05,393
Christian symbolism.
So the star now sends a dove and the 

2162
02:14:07,471 --> 02:14:09,620
dove is a symbol of the holy ghost.
Right?

2163
02:14:09,621 --> 02:14:12,840
And hypothetically,
the Holy Ghost,

2164
02:14:12,900 --> 02:14:14,910
there's three members of the Christian 
Trinity,

2165
02:14:14,911 --> 02:14:17,040
the father,
the son,

2166
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:17,874
and the Holy Ghost.
And that's what the hell is a holy 

2167
02:14:19,651 --> 02:14:20,311
ghost.
You know,

2168
02:14:20,311 --> 02:14:23,040
that's quite the weird idea.
But what it is,

2169
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:24,533
what it is,
is it's a representation of the idea 

2170
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:27,503
that you have an image of the divine 
within you and that it's something that 

2171
02:14:30,931 --> 02:14:35,800
can,
it's something capable of communicating.

2172
02:14:36,460 --> 02:14:37,293
And so it's a natural force in part,
which is also why it's associated with 

2173
02:14:40,961 --> 02:14:44,590
the blue fairy and this and this star.
It's,

2174
02:14:46,630 --> 02:14:49,600
well that's the best I can do at the 
moment with that.

2175
02:14:49,601 --> 02:14:50,434
So anyways,
it gives the cricket a message from 

2176
02:14:52,181 --> 02:14:53,320
beyond so to speak.

2177
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:01,970
Hey,
it's a message pop

2178
02:15:03,710 --> 02:15:05,280
up.
It says here,

2179
02:15:05,281 --> 02:15:07,540
he um,
he went looking for you and uh,

2180
02:15:07,570 --> 02:15:09,080
uh,
he was one of them.

2181
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:15,210
Okay.
So you noticed that,

2182
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:18,780
you know,
Pinocchio without Japan it was lost,

2183
02:15:19,110 --> 02:15:19,943
but you pedo without Pinocchio gets 
degenerates into chaos and it's 

2184
02:15:24,450 --> 02:15:27,930
swallowed by a whale.
So the two are necessary for one another

2185
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:28,973
anyways.
People swallow this part of the plot 

2186
02:15:30,031 --> 02:15:30,864
without any problem.
And so the cricket now tells the puppet 

2187
02:15:34,111 --> 02:15:34,944
that in order to become real,
he has to go to the bottom of the ocean 

2188
02:15:37,021 --> 02:15:37,854
and rescue his father from a whale.
And so another part that makes 

2189
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:42,540
absolutely no sense.
So anyways,

2190
02:15:42,541 --> 02:15:45,120
that's what they proceed to do back into
the,

2191
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:48,060
the cricket warns him about how 
dangerous this is,

2192
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:49,253
but decides to go along anyways.
So down they plunge into the ocean and 

2193
02:15:53,131 --> 02:15:57,570
they have some kind of cute adventures 
and they get the fish to tell them where

2194
02:15:57,571 --> 02:15:58,404
they're going.
But the Fisher so scared that they just 

2195
02:16:01,171 --> 02:16:06,171
run away when they hear monster name.
And so notice that you know,

2196
02:16:06,570 --> 02:16:11,570
he's in the depths already and he has to
go to the darkest place in the depths in

2197
02:16:12,451 --> 02:16:17,451
order to find where his father is.
Okay.

2198
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:37,084
Now Japan goes in there and he's 
starving to death in the belly of a 

2199
02:16:40,061 --> 02:16:41,680
whale.
There's not enough food,

2200
02:16:41,681 --> 02:16:43,750
there's not enough nourishment for him 
to survive.

2201
02:16:43,751 --> 02:16:47,140
And he can't see any way that on his own
he can get out.

2202
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:49,180
In fact,
he's actually given up.

2203
02:16:52,710 --> 02:16:54,780
Okay.
And he's fishing because he thinks,

2204
02:16:54,781 --> 02:16:55,620
well,
you know,

2205
02:16:55,650 --> 02:16:56,483
we might as well have some beat.
The whale wakes up and it catches a 

2206
02:16:59,881 --> 02:17:00,714
bunch of fish,
but it also catches what you might 

2207
02:17:03,931 --> 02:17:08,931
describe as king of the fish.
Now see that's Pinocchio.

2208
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:12,053
So let's,

2209
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:14,613
so this is where the movie gets varied.
I really have very difficult time 

2210
02:17:18,571 --> 02:17:21,750
understanding how this symbolism got in 
there.

2211
02:17:21,751 --> 02:17:25,560
But this whole part of the movie is 
packed with fish symbolism.

2212
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:28,320
And although you may know or you may 
not,

2213
02:17:28,321 --> 02:17:29,154
but the fish was a symbol for it,
early Christianity and Christ is 

2214
02:17:31,621 --> 02:17:32,454
assimilated to the fish.
There's all sorts of fish symbolism in 

2215
02:17:34,261 --> 02:17:37,140
the new testament and there's all sorts 
of reasons for that,

2216
02:17:37,230 --> 02:17:39,290
a number of which are truly 
incomprehensible.

2217
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,160
Some of the raster logical,
because

2218
02:17:43,450 --> 02:17:48,450
I won't even go into that.
So imagine this way,

2219
02:17:48,611 --> 02:17:49,720
you're somewhere starving

2220
02:17:51,160 --> 02:17:53,320
and you've got,
you've got two choices.

2221
02:17:53,321 --> 02:17:54,154
You can either figure out how to live so
that you're not going to be starving 

2222
02:17:56,531 --> 02:18:00,010
anymore or you can catch some fish.
Okay.

2223
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:03,370
So you can,
you can feed yourself momentarily or you

2224
02:18:03,371 --> 02:18:07,570
can feed yourself for the long run.
And so,

2225
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:09,400
and people are making that choice all 
the time.

2226
02:18:09,401 --> 02:18:10,270
And so you might say,
well,

2227
02:18:10,271 --> 02:18:12,550
if you're a good fisherman,
you catch a fish.

2228
02:18:12,640 --> 02:18:14,340
But if you're a really good fit from 
fishermen,

2229
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:17,650
you catch something from the depths that
feeds you all the time.

2230
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,660
Okay.
So that's what's happening here.

2231
02:18:20,280 --> 02:18:23,530
Yup.
Oh he thought there was any relationship

2232
02:18:23,531 --> 02:18:26,670
with the Fisher and the Fisher king 
cause you know yes,

2233
02:18:26,680 --> 02:18:28,120
definitely.
Yes,

2234
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:29,290
absolutely.
Yes,

2235
02:18:29,291 --> 02:18:30,430
definitely.
So,

2236
02:18:30,431 --> 02:18:31,480
okay,
so now Japan,

2237
02:18:31,481 --> 02:18:34,930
I was fishing like mad and he's happy 
because he's catching fish now.

2238
02:18:35,590 --> 02:18:38,410
It's very cool what happens here because
Japan,

2239
02:18:38,411 --> 02:18:38,861
oh,
couches,

2240
02:18:38,861 --> 02:18:39,610
a bunch of fish.

2241
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:41,770
Hypothetically he's looking for 
Pinocchio.

2242
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:42,813
But he says the unbusy catching fish 
that when he catches Pinocchio he 

2243
02:18:45,071 --> 02:18:48,490
doesn't even notice.
And then he kind of wakes up to the fact

2244
02:18:48,491 --> 02:18:49,324
that he's caught Pinocchio,
which is really what he's trying to 

2245
02:18:50,831 --> 02:18:52,810
catch.
And when he turns around to hug him,

2246
02:18:52,811 --> 02:18:53,644
he grabs a fish and he kisses the fish 
and then notices that it's not 

2247
02:18:56,531 --> 02:18:57,364
Pinocchio.
So the filmmakers are very careful to 

2248
02:18:59,471 --> 02:19:02,740
insist upon the fact that you peddle 
becomes,

2249
02:19:03,070 --> 02:19:03,903
he's blinded by short term 
considerations and cannot see when he's 

2250
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:08,950
caught the thing that's the most 
valuable.

2251
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:11,140
And we see why Pinocchio is the most 
valuable.

2252
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:13,500
So this is actually the redemption of 
Japan.

2253
02:19:13,501 --> 02:19:14,201
Oh,
to some degree,

2254
02:19:14,201 --> 02:19:19,090
he needs Pinocchio's youth and vision to
rescue himself from sterile,

2255
02:19:19,250 --> 02:19:21,490
sterile,
and static existence.

2256
02:19:21,610 --> 02:19:23,490
And that would be associated say with 
the,

2257
02:19:23,620 --> 02:19:25,390
the,
the construction of us,

2258
02:19:25,630 --> 02:19:28,430
a sterile totalitarian,
like North Korea,

2259
02:19:28,580 --> 02:19:32,360
where I think I told you last week,
the wise leader has told all the Koreans

2260
02:19:32,361 --> 02:19:33,194
that they better get used to sucking 
routes like they did 20 years ago 

2261
02:19:35,451 --> 02:19:38,540
because there ain't gonna be any food.
And not only that,

2262
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:43,400
they get to donate to pounds of rice a 
month each to the state warehouses,

2263
02:19:43,430 --> 02:19:46,610
which in principle are supposed to be 
the places that distribute the food.

2264
02:19:46,850 --> 02:19:47,683
So the idea that a static enough state 
can become sterile and baron is exactly 

2265
02:19:52,251 --> 02:19:53,110
right.
So,

2266
02:19:53,210 --> 02:19:54,043
all right,

2267
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,093
here's a mythological motif there and 
many hero stories when the hero heroes 

2268
02:20:15,311 --> 02:20:18,310
out to find the worst thing.
But when he finally finds it,

2269
02:20:18,370 --> 02:20:19,203
it's like he's out of there.
But by that time it's generally too 

2270
02:20:21,641 --> 02:20:22,660
late.
You know?

2271
02:20:22,661 --> 02:20:23,494
So what it means to some degrees that no
matter how awful the thing that you're 

2272
02:20:26,981 --> 02:20:27,814
looking for,
no matter how awful you think the thing 

2273
02:20:30,251 --> 02:20:33,190
that you're looking for is,
it's more awful than you think.

2274
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:35,650
Even prepared.
So Pinocchio,

2275
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:39,490
he's out of their conscience too.
They're both gone.

2276
02:22:26,670 --> 02:22:27,503
Yeah.

2277
02:22:28,110 --> 02:22:28,943
Okay.
So Japan will basically tells Pinocchio 

2278
02:22:31,631 --> 02:22:33,750
that there's no damn way they're getting
out of this whale.

2279
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:36,390
And so Pinocchio has a bit of a 
brainstorm.

2280
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:38,183
Oh yeah.
Do you pay to also finds out that he's 

2281
02:22:39,511 --> 02:22:42,150
half turned into a donkey,
which isn't all that pleasant.

2282
02:22:42,151 --> 02:22:42,990
He gets forgiven,

2283
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:44,553
right?

2284
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:45,500
Japan.
Oh,

2285
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:47,890
says he's built a raft that they can get
out with,

2286
02:22:47,891 --> 02:22:50,380
but everything comes in and nothing goes
out in Pinocchio.

2287
02:22:50,381 --> 02:22:53,590
Decides that he could make the whale 
sneeze and he does that.

2288
02:22:53,800 --> 02:22:56,440
So we'll start here.
He's got this brainstorm of an idea.

2289
02:22:58,090 --> 02:22:58,510
Okay.

2290
02:22:58,510 --> 02:23:00,030
Master of fire idea.

2291
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:03,080
No,
not all offices

2292
02:23:05,430 --> 02:23:08,790
working comes.
Oh,

2293
02:23:09,330 --> 02:23:13,440
it's all British prenup.
Nice.

2294
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,280
We cooked some of the fish.

2295
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:19,850
Okay.
So that's a paradigm shift for Japan.

2296
02:23:19,851 --> 02:23:20,684
Oh,
the fire is there to cook the fish for 

2297
02:23:22,251 --> 02:23:23,084
Pinocchio.
It's there to escape from the damn 

2298
02:23:24,471 --> 02:23:25,580
whale.
Now,

2299
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:28,310
the other thing that happens here is 
Pinocchio sacrifices.

2300
02:23:28,311 --> 02:23:30,500
A bunch of things that you pedal thinks 
are useful.

2301
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:32,150
Japan will thinks he's going to be in 
the whale.

2302
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:33,183
I know.
Okay.

2303
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:36,680
So now Pinocchio breaks up all the 
furniture and builds a fire out of it.

2304
02:23:36,681 --> 02:23:37,580
And so he's,
you know,

2305
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:38,630
when part of that is,
uh,

2306
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,033
an explicit,
remind her that part of the reason that 

2307
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:44,840
the way people got out of the whale,
you know,

2308
02:23:44,841 --> 02:23:47,630
the terrible chaotic force of nature was
to master fire.

2309
02:23:47,631 --> 02:23:50,440
It's a technological,
it's a technological solution.

2310
02:23:50,530 --> 02:23:55,530
These are
not the chair.

2311
02:24:07,110 --> 02:24:08,940
Oh,
okay.

2312
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,403
No.
So there's an idea there too that the 

2313
02:24:23,441 --> 02:24:26,530
human use of technology is likely to 
make the environment,

2314
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,880
you know,
react terribly.

2315
02:24:27,881 --> 02:24:30,580
And we're all,
we're guilty about that all the time.

2316
02:24:30,581 --> 02:24:32,860
It's part of what underlies our 
environmental guilt.

2317
02:24:32,861 --> 02:24:33,694
You know,
we're using technology against nature 

2318
02:24:35,321 --> 02:24:36,154
and you know,
we always feel that there's going to be 

2319
02:24:37,331 --> 02:24:39,160
a kickback,
we'd done something wrong,

2320
02:24:39,170 --> 02:24:41,200
there's going to be a kickback.
You know,

2321
02:24:41,201 --> 02:24:43,120
it's,
it's not like it's completely unfounded.

2322
02:24:43,690 --> 02:24:45,550
Okay.
So now the way home,

2323
02:24:45,551 --> 02:24:47,140
there's something bursty very 
surprising,

2324
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:50,110
which is that it transforms into a fire 
breathing dragon.

2325
02:25:04,750 --> 02:25:05,583
Okay.

2326
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:10,230
Okay.
So then there's a great band

2327
02:25:12,580 --> 02:25:15,250
demand.
The whale just won't quit.

2328
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:19,510
Need breaks their boat.
Altarpieces Pinocchio rescues his father

2329
02:25:19,511 --> 02:25:24,511
there
and then the is all smashed to pieces.

2330
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:26,750
We'll pick up,
right?

2331
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:31,750
Yeah.
Okay.

2332
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:36,990
Japan.
Oh says save yourself right now.

2333
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:39,960
He's out of the damn whale.
Why bother with the old mat?

2334
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:42,000
That's a good question.
You know,

2335
02:25:42,001 --> 02:25:43,800
and because part of that question is,
well,

2336
02:25:43,801 --> 02:25:46,230
what's the relationship between the 
individual and the culture?

2337
02:25:46,440 --> 02:25:49,140
What responsibility do you have to the 
culture?

2338
02:25:49,440 --> 02:25:51,570
It's drowning.
It's not much use.

2339
02:25:51,571 --> 02:25:52,404
It's old.
It's,

2340
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:53,850
it's,
it produced you.

2341
02:25:53,910 --> 02:25:56,760
It's worn out.
It's dangerous to rescue it.

2342
02:25:56,820 --> 02:25:58,380
Why bother?
Well,

2343
02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:03,560
Pinocchio decides to rescue his father.
So Pinocchio is basically peer destroyed

2344
02:26:51,471 --> 02:26:56,471
by the clash between no hell they should
chaos and insufficient culture.

2345
02:26:57,890 --> 02:27:00,590
And so as far as we know,
Japan,

2346
02:27:00,591 --> 02:27:01,424
it was alive.

2347
02:27:24,390 --> 02:27:25,223
Oh yeah.

2348
02:27:31,780 --> 02:27:32,613
So you know,
he sacrificed himself to save his 

2349
02:27:35,141 --> 02:27:36,140
culture.
But you have,

2350
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:39,400
you have to remember what he sacrificed.
He's a jackass,

2351
02:27:39,401 --> 02:27:40,234
puppet.
And maybe that is what's supposed to be 

2352
02:27:43,121 --> 02:27:45,310
sacrificed.
If you're going to save your culture,

2353
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:47,590
you know,
you get rid of the jackass.

2354
02:27:47,591 --> 02:27:49,100
Puppet is the really adopt the part of 
the,

2355
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:52,360
we want to have live anyways.
People identify with that.

2356
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:52,991
They think,
oh,

2357
02:27:52,991 --> 02:27:54,790
that's me.
That's what I think.

2358
02:27:54,820 --> 02:27:56,590
That's who I am.
It's like,

2359
02:27:56,591 --> 02:27:59,470
well,
if you find yourself breaking,

2360
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:02,860
you might presuppose that that's not 
exactly the case.

2361
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:37,200
Unselfish Aye.

2362
02:29:29,860 --> 02:29:30,693
Harmony is restored.
You can see that father and son Canal 

2363
02:29:40,691 --> 02:29:41,710
dance together.

2364
02:29:45,030 --> 02:29:50,030
Okay.
Yeah.

2365
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:02,120
And the car insurance is like finally 
transformed at this point.

2366
02:30:07,790 --> 02:30:10,770
She was nice.
Hmm.

2367
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:18,540
And now it's like a gold flower.
It's called Mandela.

2368
02:30:18,541 --> 02:30:20,340
It's the sun.
It's all those things.

2369
02:30:20,600 --> 02:30:24,300
And you see you can communicate with 
this star.

2370
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:31,063
No.

2371
02:31:09,630 --> 02:31:12,390
So all of that wrapped up in the Little 
Kid's movie,

2372
02:31:14,590 --> 02:31:15,610
you know,
you can think about it.

2373
02:31:15,611 --> 02:31:17,800
There's the work of the collective 
imagination.

2374
02:31:18,510 --> 02:31:20,250
And I mean that literally in some sense

2375
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:23,820
because a huge number of people who are 
creative worked on this,

2376
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:25,163
you know?
And so it's constant compromises as to 

2377
02:31:26,821 --> 02:31:29,430
plot and as to,
you know,

2378
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:30,264
the images that are going to be used.
And like there's a tremendous amount of 

2379
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:36,540
attention and same amount of attention 
focused on every single sale.

2380
02:31:36,541 --> 02:31:38,370
Right?
These things were hand painted.

2381
02:31:39,210 --> 02:31:40,043
So the amount of work that goes into 
each frame is it's hours and hours and 

2382
02:31:44,700 --> 02:31:45,533
hours of work and do each frame 60 
frames a second cause Disney did it at 

2383
02:31:47,941 --> 02:31:49,860
60 frames a second,
you know,

2384
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:51,960
so,
and it's completely,

2385
02:31:52,350 --> 02:31:53,183
you know,
it's hard to remember when you watch 

2386
02:31:54,361 --> 02:31:57,540
something like this that every single 
bit of it was created,

2387
02:31:57,630 --> 02:31:58,191
you know?
And,

2388
02:31:58,191 --> 02:31:59,024
and by people who had to agree by genius
level people who had to agree on what 

2389
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:05,790
they were doing and so they'd feel their
way,

2390
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:07,500
what seems right,
you know,

2391
02:32:07,610 --> 02:32:08,850
and the group would agree,
look,

2392
02:32:08,851 --> 02:32:09,684
that's the right thing.
Or someone would insist upon having had 

2393
02:32:11,601 --> 02:32:15,000
done this particular way and the 
narrative would emerge from that.

2394
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:17,190
And someone had an intuition,
probably Disney,

2395
02:32:17,191 --> 02:32:18,090
that,
you know,

2396
02:32:18,091 --> 02:32:18,924
the Pinocchio Story had enough.
It's quite a bit transposed from the 

2397
02:32:22,081 --> 02:32:23,700
colone story,
the original story.

2398
02:32:23,850 --> 02:32:26,020
But then it had enough depth,
you know,

2399
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:29,400
to hang a story on it and to be worthy 
of that much attention.

2400
02:32:30,520 --> 02:32:31,353
So,

2401
02:32:33,800 --> 02:32:37,730
and I think I like the developmental 
path that it traces.

2402
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:40,573
It's,
it's as accurately summarized in that 

2403
02:32:41,851 --> 02:32:43,830
movie as I'd ever seen it summarized.
I mean,

2404
02:32:43,831 --> 02:32:44,664
the movie is not without its flaws.
I would say it kind of slips into 

2405
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:49,320
moralizing from,
you know,

2406
02:32:49,321 --> 02:32:50,610
from time to time.
Although,

2407
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:54,870
you know,
I don't know if it's been done better.

2408
02:32:57,430 --> 02:32:58,263
So

2409
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,240
you don't want to complain about it too 
much.

2410
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:02,113
Yeah.

2411
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,173
So,
well one of the questions that we posed 

2412
02:33:06,281 --> 02:33:10,120
at the beginning of the course was,
you know,

2413
02:33:10,121 --> 02:33:13,420
why do people do terrible things?
Why does societies degenerate?

2414
02:33:13,421 --> 02:33:15,310
In answer to that,
as far as I can tell,

2415
02:33:15,311 --> 02:33:16,144
is because people don't,
they people decide to not attend to 

2416
02:33:21,131 --> 02:33:23,290
their knowledge of their own errors

2417
02:33:25,250 --> 02:33:27,440
or errors in the situation they find 
themselves.

2418
02:33:27,441 --> 02:33:28,274
I think maybe it's,
they don't attend to their knowledge of 

2419
02:33:29,811 --> 02:33:33,290
holes in being that might be a more 
reasonable way of putting it.

2420
02:33:33,740 --> 02:33:34,573
And because they refuse to attend,
they allow the structure to get rotten 

2421
02:33:38,180 --> 02:33:39,013
and they allow themselves to get weak.
And the more rotten the structure and 

2422
02:33:41,511 --> 02:33:45,030
the weaker the people that compose it,
the more rapidly it degenerates,

2423
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:45,913
the further rottenness and uh,
quickly or everything descends into 

2424
02:33:50,271 --> 02:33:54,980
something that's absolutely horrified.
Hell for all intensive purposes.

2425
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,060
And so the alternative to that out as 
far as I can tell,

2426
02:33:59,061 --> 02:34:02,150
isn't so much specifically political as 
it is psychological.

2427
02:34:02,151 --> 02:34:03,980
Although I think at this level of 
analysis,

2428
02:34:03,981 --> 02:34:06,470
those two things merge,
you know,

2429
02:34:06,650 --> 02:34:11,030
you work on correcting the errors that 
are accessible to you in your own life,

2430
02:34:11,031 --> 02:34:11,864
that you can correct and that you know 
how to correct and simultaneously you 

2431
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:18,700
have the best chance of raw find your 
culture and keeping,

2432
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:20,373
you know,
the horrors of tyranny and an unbridled 

2433
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:24,730
nature at bay.
You know,

2434
02:34:24,731 --> 02:34:27,370
and I would also say that's the 
fundamental human story.

2435
02:34:27,371 --> 02:34:32,371
We've been working on that story for our
entire evolutionary history.

2436
02:34:33,550 --> 02:34:34,383
And so maybe it's wrong,
but that's the one we've based our 

2437
02:34:37,001 --> 02:34:38,680
survival law.
And you know,

2438
02:34:38,681 --> 02:34:40,990
there's always the possibility that it's
not wrong.

2439
02:34:45,360 --> 02:34:49,320
That's it guys.
Nice talking to you.
