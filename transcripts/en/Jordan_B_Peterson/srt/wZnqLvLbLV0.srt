1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,820
I didn't quite get through what I wanted
to in the last lecture.

2
00:00:02,821 --> 00:00:05,970
So I think I'm going to steal half an
hour from this lecture and do that and

3
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:08,070
then we'll go to this lecture.
So,

4
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:11,040
because I didn't get a chance to read
you some of the things I wanted to read

5
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,970
you
what they're really worth.

6
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:15,630
Three,
they're really worth hearing.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,900
So I think I'm going to do that.
So one of the things that I've spent a

8
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:26,580
very long time trying to figure out is
what motivated people to do the terrible

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,740
things that they did in the
concentration camps,

10
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:32,460
particularly in the 20th century in the
concentration camp was pretty widespread

11
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,300
phenomenon.
I mean,

12
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:37,230
it's still being used extensively in
North Korea for example.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,440
And most of the popularity population
there is starving.

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,360
Um,
so it's not like it's done with yet.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Anyways.
The best authors that I've ever read

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,380
with regards to insights about the kind
of totalitarian possession that leads

17
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:02,430
people to commit extraordinarily brutal
atrocities in the service of their

18
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:06,600
belief have been ball soldier knits and
who's not normally considered a

19
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:09,300
personality psychologist,
but also Viktor Frankl.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,020
And the reason I have you read soldier
Nixon is because I think soldier knits

21
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:17,130
and has a more,
I mean Frankel's an amazing thinker,

22
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,550
but soldier knits and is one of those
geniuses that comes along about every

23
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,810
100 years.
So,

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,380
and I think soldier Nixon wrote the
most,

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,960
the most pertinent and analysis of the
relationship between individual

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
cowardice and the propensity to adopt
totalitarian beliefs and then the

27
00:01:37,381 --> 00:01:41,580
propensity to commit acts of cruelty in
the name of those beliefs.

28
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:44,700
Now it's a really tricky issue.
I mean

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,920
it's,
it's,

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,930
it's commonly been assumed,
for example,

31
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:52,380
that people who are right wing
authoritarian people are right wing

32
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:56,820
authoritarian because they're afraid of
people who aren't like them or they're

33
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:00,990
afraid of ideas that aren't like their
ideas or something like that.

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,510
It's,
it's often a fear based explanation.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,710
And it seems to me that there's
something to that.

36
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,001
You know,
it's,

37
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,240
it's hard for me to imagine,
you know,

38
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:14,880
if your,
if your belief systems are disrupted by

39
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:18,030
a piece of information that you don't
particularly want to receive,

40
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,570
it certainly does expose you to a
tremendous amount of chaos.

41
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,231
And so,
you know,

42
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,270
we've talked about situations,
for example,

43
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,260
where perhaps you received the
information that you knew a loved one

44
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:30,780
has been unfaithful to you or betrayed
you.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,930
Now part of what you're going to feel in
relationship to that,

46
00:02:33,931 --> 00:02:37,650
his anxiety and it's because it
destabilizes your past and all your

47
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,800
memories and d stabilizes your future
and it destabilizes your,

48
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,230
your present.
And so that presents you with a whole

49
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:47,580
bunch of uncertainty where at one point
you had a pretty functional map and you

50
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,520
knew how things related to one another
and how you should act.

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,560
And so it's reasonable to presuppose
that that produces fear,

52
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:58,950
especially because we know from,
from work by someone,

53
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,070
people like Jeffrey Gray

54
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,750
for example,
who were going to talk about in the next

55
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:05,710
lecture,
that if you expose laboratory animals to

56
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:08,590
novelty,
which is certainly an annex,

57
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,860
something unexpected is something novel
or something anomalous,

58
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:15,310
it's something novel that they react.
You can,

59
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:18,940
you can conceptualize the reaction
roughly in two ways.

60
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,751
And you can say,
well,

61
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:22,870
they become afraid.
They manifest anxiety,

62
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,590
which you can dampen down with
antianxiety drugs like valium,

63
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,570
benzodiazepines,
barbiturates,

64
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,460
and alcohol.
Um,

65
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,670
but they also manifest curiosity.
But the,

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,520
but the anxiety usually supersedes the
curiosity.

67
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,180
So the anxiety has to wear off before
the coup curiosity will come forward.

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,680
And that depends to some degree on the
magnitude of the novel event and

69
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:49,150
calculating how large novel of is turns
out to be extraordinarily difficult.

70
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,400
But we'll talk,
we'll talk through that as well.

71
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,910
And so the anxiety models and so those
would be,

72
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,520
so things is things like terror
management theory,

73
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,030
for example.

74
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,330
The anxiety models are pretty good,
but they're missing things.

75
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:03,610
They're missing things.
And there's a,

76
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,240
so here's a couple of things that they
might be missing.

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,750
I've pursued the idea that when you
encounter a

78
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,950
datum,
we'll say,

79
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:17,800
cause it could be a stimulus or it could
be an idea or it could be a person,

80
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:22,420
but let's call it a piece of information
that contradicts your axiomatic

81
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:25,360
presupposition.
So your theory then,

82
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,080
what might happen,
the hippocampus is a brain area that

83
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:33,190
seems to do something like detect mick
mismatches between what you expect or

84
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:35,200
want to have happen and what actually
happens.

85
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,590
And it seems to send a signal down to
the reticular activating system,

86
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,830
which is the part of your brain that
actually governs consciousness.

87
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,340
So it's what wakes you up in the morning
and puts you to sleep at night.

88
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,860
And also what makes you wake up very
suddenly.

89
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,810
If you hear an unexpected noise at
night,

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,470
it stops,
it stops it,

91
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,310
it releases the reticular activating
system from inhibition.

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,420
And so it's basically the hippocampus
does something like tell your reticular

93
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:04,480
activating system to take it easy as
long as everything's going the way you

94
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,150
want it to go.
And if it doesn't go the way you want it

95
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,650
to go,
then it releases the reticular

96
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,270
activating system from inhibition.
And what that seems to do is to release

97
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,470
a whole variety of underlying
neurological circuits from inhibition.

98
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,310
So then you become anxious but you also
become curious.

99
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,280
But it's possible that you'll become a
lot of other things too.

100
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:27,550
And this is,
this is part of the generalized stress

101
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:30,070
response as far as I can tell him.
What happens when,

102
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,960
when you manifest the general stress
responses that your body prepares for

103
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,330
everything.
Why?

104
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,070
Well,
cause you don't know what to do when

105
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,690
something you don't expect happens.

106
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,360
It's like the definition of not want
knowing what to do.

107
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,670
And so because your body's pretty smart,
it just ramps itself up in terms of its

108
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,100
preparation,
which is very stressful.

109
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,860
Technically speaking.
It's stressful because you're burning a

110
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:57,230
lot of energy and resources that you
could devote to other things,

111
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,080
suppresses your immune system and gets
you ready.

112
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,520
You know?
So and,

113
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,373
and at,
at,

114
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,640
you know,
for any length of time that can be fun

115
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,070
in small doses.
In fact it is because people like

116
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:10,760
novelty in small doses,
but in large doses and chronically it's

117
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,010
like that's death itself,
you know?

118
00:06:13,011 --> 00:06:16,400
So it seems that people really don't
like to have their,

119
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,530
their expectations dashed or,
or more accurately,

120
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,890
they don't like it when what they want
to have happen doesn't happen,

121
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,040
which isn't exactly the same thing.
So the question is then,

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
what does happen when what you want to
doesn't happen?

123
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,590
How exactly do you characterize it?
One way of characterizing it as fear and

124
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:41,150
another way of characterizing it is
something like generalized disinhibition

125
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,130
of potential.
That's another one.

126
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,550
And I think that one's more accurate.
I think it's more accurate because it's

127
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,090
more comprehensive and it's deeper.
But then there's a third variable that

128
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:51,590
we're going to talk about quite a bit
that,

129
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,260
that everybody's just sort of coming to
terms with now,

130
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:59,180
which is that it turns out that people
who are tilted towards right wing

131
00:06:59,181 --> 00:07:00,920
authoritarianism,
first of all,

132
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,050
they're high in conscientiousness and
they're,

133
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,930
and they're low in openness.
And if you fractionate

134
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,550
conscientiousness,
which you can,

135
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:10,610
you can break it into two things.
You can break it into industriousness

136
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,770
and orderliness and industriousness is a
bang dead on predictor of how well you

137
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:17,060
guys do in university.
It's,

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,310
it's damn near as powerful as
intelligence.

139
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,830
It's not as powerful,
but we can't measure it as well either.

140
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,100
And so that's industriousness.
We don't have,

141
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,410
we don't know anything about
industriousness.

142
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,930
You know,
we know how to measure it through self

143
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,080
report and we know how to correlate
those self reports with life outcomes.

144
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,300
We have no neuropsychological model for
it.

145
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,170
We have no conceptual model for it.
We have no pharmacological model for it.

146
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,000
Uh,
did I say animal model?

147
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:44,060
We have no animal model for it.
It's like we don't know anything about

148
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:48,470
it except that it predicts longterm life
success better than anything else except

149
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,180
Iq in managerial,
administrative and academic positions

150
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,760
like grades.
So but orderliness,

151
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,170
that's a whole different story cause it
turns out that orderliness,

152
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:03,110
we haven't published this yet,
but orderliness is associated with

153
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:08,111
sensitivity to discussed and that's a
weird thing because for a long time we

154
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,420
thought that all the negative emotions
loaded on neuroticism.

155
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,900
So this is big five speak fundamentally
that you know,

156
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,630
pain and anger,
frustration,

157
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,860
disappointment,
shame,

158
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:20,780
guilt,
anxiety and fear.

159
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,600
We're all,
if you were more likely to feel one,

160
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,270
you're more likely to feel all of them.
And all of the negative emotions clump

161
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,630
together.
And that's basically what neuroticism is

162
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:33,530
from a big five perspective.
But it turns out that disgust,

163
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:38,531
sensitivity loads on orderliness.
Now I tell you man,

164
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:41,240
that is one major finding.
It's like I think

165
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,320
because we know we know a fair bit about
disgust,

166
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,170
sensitivity.
Now give me one second.

167
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,430
That's mostly,
at least in part through the work of

168
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,600
Jonathan Haidt.
He was a very,

169
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,670
very,
very smart guy who started scouting,

170
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:57,000
discussed before anybody else figured
out that it was worthwhile to discuss or

171
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,030
to just do I investigate roughly
speaking,

172
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,051
you know,
and he fall.

173
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,240
He found that people who are disgust
sensitive,

174
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,880
we're very obsessed with moral purity.

175
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,500
You know,
it turned out to be the same thing.

176
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:12,501
So bodily contamination and moral
impurity are roughly the same phenomena.

177
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,290
And then it turns out,
I really figured this out when I was

178
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,740
reading Hitler's table talk cause
Hitler's table talk by the way,

179
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:24,741
it was a book that was put together of
Hitler's spontaneous speeches discussion

180
00:09:24,811 --> 00:09:26,880
while he was eating dinner for like
three years.

181
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:29,540
You know,
it's a fascinating book because it

182
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,620
really gives you some insight into how
he thought.

183
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,770
And he was a very,
he's a very peculiar person cause he was

184
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,860
very high in openness,
which is a creativity dimension and very

185
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,410
high in orderliness and people like that
aren't very common.

186
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,280
But anyways,
his whole metaphor for,

187
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,480
for,
for German,

188
00:09:45,481 --> 00:09:49,350
for the area and race,
the whole metaphor was body.

189
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,910
It's like the areas,
we're a pure body with pure blood and

190
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,370
they were under assault from parasites.

191
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,250
And so it was a disgust metaphor.
You know,

192
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,810
it wasn't fear.
You know,

193
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:02,490
it kinda sounds like fear because you
could say,

194
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,670
well Hitler was afraid of the Gypsies
and he was afraid of the Jews.

195
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,650
And you know,
he was afraid of non ariens.

196
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:08,840
But,
but,

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,610
well first of all,
I don't think it's reasonable to say

198
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,980
that the Nazis were precisely possessed
by fear.

199
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,040
That is exactly how they looked.
And if you look at conservatives,

200
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,230
I'm not calling conservatives Nazis by
the way,

201
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:20,250
but they're,
you know,

202
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,300
the Nazi philosophy is an extension of
political belief on the right,

203
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:27,330
just like totalitarian communism.
And this is extension of political

204
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,510
belief on the left.
So you can fall into a pit either way,

205
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:31,860
you know,
but

206
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,270
the Nazis were,
first of all,

207
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:40,150
they're German and the Germans are a
conscientious people,

208
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:40,961
so to speak.
You know,

209
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:43,270
they have a very advanced industrial
society.

210
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,690
Their engineering is very precise.
To what degree that's a national trait.

211
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:49,300
God only knows to what and to what
degree.

212
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:51,630
That's a consequence of,
of uh,

213
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,290
you know,
sociological pressure.

214
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,360
We don't understand anything about those
sorts of things.

215
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,793
But,
um,

216
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,630
Hitler was absolutely obsessed with,
with purity and with willpower and those

217
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:07,000
things go together.
So orderly people seem to be very

218
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,640
enamored of their own willpower.
It's something like that.

219
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:12,610
They sort of worship it as the top God,
so to speak,

220
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:13,560
and like,
uh,

221
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,930
anorexic people tend to be very orderly
and they get discussed.

222
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,690
I think anorexia is a disorder of
disgust.

223
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,780
Anorexic girls,
they get completely disgusted by their

224
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:24,980
own bodies,
you know,

225
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:26,390
and that's a fair,
think about that.

226
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:30,500
That's a very tight line because there's
any number of disgusting things about

227
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:33,680
bodies and you have to attend to that
because if you don't,

228
00:11:33,681 --> 00:11:36,170
then you end up contaminated in a
variety of ways.

229
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,840
You know,
you can catch us sexual disease for

230
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:40,910
example,
or you can just catch a disease or you

231
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:43,970
could be developing infection or any
number of things that will take you

232
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,350
down,
you know?

233
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:48,320
So it's,
it's very difficult for human beings to

234
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,350
get the calibration right with regards
to,

235
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,640
you know,
their bodies and their feeling about

236
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:57,910
their bodies and the fact that you also
have to keep the damn thing clean and

237
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,590
organized and are otherwise,
you know,

238
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:01,750
all hell breaks loose.
And it's no joke.

239
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,850
When Hitler was before Hitler,
you know,

240
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,980
started the concentration camps and went
after when we had after things in a big

241
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,120
way,
is very,

242
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,880
very concerned with the hygiene of the
German people,

243
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,120
you know.

244
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,400
And he did things like,
uh,

245
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,160
his first,
here's his first stop policy

246
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:21,520
implementations where tuberculosis
screening and had people go around in

247
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:24,250
vans and ex-ray everyone to try to get
rid of tuberculosis.

248
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,001
It's like,
yeah,

249
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,340
you know,
let's get rid of tuberculosis.

250
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:30,010
And then they started cleaning up the
factory so they,

251
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,200
you know,
get rid of the bugs and the rats and

252
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,660
sweep them all out and plant flowers out
front.

253
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:38,470
It was like a beautification campaign
and they used Zyklon B to do that.

254
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,620
And Zyklon b was the gas that was used
in the concentration counts.

255
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,540
It's like,
that's quite interesting.

256
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:48,190
And that movement from insects in rats
to human beings.

257
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:49,960
And that there was an intermediary
there,

258
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,100
which seemed to be mental hospitals
because the next day and they did was go

259
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,700
and clean up the,
you know,

260
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,360
the people that the Nazis,
Hitler in particular,

261
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:02,830
but the Nazis and general felt were
inferior or contemptible or something

262
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,200
like that.

263
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,730
And like contempt and disgust seem to go
very tightly together.

264
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,280
And contempt.
That's a vicious emotion.

265
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,850
So like if you're in a relationship with
somebody,

266
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,950
close relationship and they start to
become contemptuous of you,

267
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,410
and you could tell that because they
rolled their eyes,

268
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,620
the probability that you're going to
divorce them or separately from them is

269
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:24,160
extraordinarily high.
Contempt is a very corrosive emotion.

270
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,130
And anyways,
so you know,

271
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,320
the transformation and purity campaign
of Hitler just extended and extended and

272
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,810
extended and extended and extended.
And you know,

273
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,460
God only knows where it would have
ended.

274
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:40,630
And I also think that's why he was a
worshiper of fire because fire is a

275
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:44,350
purifying substance.
And the Nazis really used fire as a

276
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:47,110
symbol of their,
of their movement because Hitler would

277
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:51,730
have these massive nighttime political
rallies,

278
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:55,000
you know,
with 150,000 people all put in perfect

279
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,140
squares,
you know,

280
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,050
with this massive background of fire and
light.

281
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,870
And you know,
and it all seems to boil down to the

282
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:06,310
fact that he was extraordinarily disgust
sensitive and not became a cardinal

283
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:09,430
element of his political platform.
And then that was associated with

284
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,130
orderliness and that,
you know,

285
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,300
you can try,
you can track it all the way down to the

286
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:15,880
biology.
And there was a paper published in Plos

287
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:17,560
one,
which I should really put on the website

288
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:19,510
about a year ago.
And I unfortunately,

289
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,240
I don't remember who published it,
but they were looking at,

290
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,850
you know,
let's say iss to your political

291
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:25,990
attitudes.
I could do that,

292
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,080
say with an authoritarian scale
authoritarian and belief scale.

293
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,470
Cause authoritarianism has been studied
quite a bit since the end of World War

294
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,480
II.
Nobody really knew what to do with it in

295
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,790
relationship to personality.
It doesn't matter.

296
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,050
You can,
you can assess it,

297
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,200
you know,
to with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

298
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,880
These people went to,
they did two things.

299
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,180
They did a cross country survey and then
within country surveys,

300
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,520
so you imagine you could,
if you were looking at a phenomena,

301
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,850
you could look at the country level,
you asked Canada or you could go into

302
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,950
the u s and then you could look at a
state level.

303
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,480
And it's nice to do the analysis at both
levels to see if it replicates itself

304
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,930
across the two different conceptual,
you know,

305
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,840
two different conceptual strata.
And what they've found is mind boggling.

306
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,270
It's Nobel prize winning stuff as far as
I'm concerned,

307
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:12,980
is that the correlation between the
prevalence of infectious disease in a

308
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:17,981
locale and the degree to which are
authoritarian beliefs were held in that

309
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:23,120
locale was bout 0.7.
It's like you never see that in the

310
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:25,190
social sciences.
That's higher than the correlation

311
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:28,190
between Iq and grades,
which is about as good as we ever get in

312
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,024
terms of prediction.

313
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,070
So it's like really it's that high,
you know.

314
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:37,400
And one of the things that that implies
is that one of the ways to get rid of

315
00:15:37,401 --> 00:15:40,040
right wing authoritarian attitudes,
assuming that you want to get rid of

316
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:42,320
such things is too is through public
health.

317
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,960
You know,
it could easily be that the reason that

318
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:49,370
we're all tilted fairly hard to the
center and even to the left is that

319
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:51,470
everybody's clean.
You know,

320
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:55,900
we've got suit,
we've got functioning sanitation and

321
00:15:55,901 --> 00:15:56,600
she's like,
Oh,

322
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,520
don't have to worry about that anymore.
So,

323
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:00,590
and believe me,
like people used to have to worry about

324
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:03,380
that before the antibiotics.
It's like you get an infection man,

325
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:06,410
your dad and that's on its way back by
the way.

326
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,050
Cause we keep using antibiotics for
everything under the sun.

327
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,970
Just very,
very,

328
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,070
very stupid.
Anyways,

329
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,320
so I,
I gave you all that background because

330
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,690
you know,
it's a tangled mess.

331
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,830
The,
the authoritarian personality issue.

332
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,740
There's a sociological element to it,
which is the disease element.

333
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:29,030
And then there's the existential element
that we've talked about in detail where

334
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,090
there seems to be also something about
people's unwillingness to stand up for

335
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:38,300
themselves and develop their own beliefs
and adhere to the truth and to adopt

336
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,530
authoritarian,
you know,

337
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,230
extremely rigid,
authoritarian belief systems and then go

338
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:45,290
persecute people for them.
And we don't know how to separate all

339
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:49,070
those things out,
but I thought I would read you some

340
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:53,660
things that were written both by soldier
Knutsen and by Frankel about a,

341
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:57,050
the concentration camps in Germany.
Cause Frankl was a concentration camp

342
00:16:57,051 --> 00:17:01,610
survivor survivor and be the
concentration camps in the Soviet Union

343
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,580
because soldier Nansen was a
concentration camp survivor.

344
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,350
He was a rather fortunate concentration
camp inmates in so far as there is such

345
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,950
a thing because he had,
he had some specialized knowledge that

346
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,980
made him sufficiently valuable not to
starve to death.

347
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,940
So,
so here is one of soldier Nixon's

348
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:24,970
descriptions of one of his experiences
or that some firsthand observer told him

349
00:17:25,281 --> 00:17:27,140
because when he wrote the Gulag
archipelago,

350
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,660
he,
he wrote a lot about his own

351
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:31,850
experiences.
But he also wrote a lot about the

352
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,490
experiences that other people had
related to him while he was in the

353
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:35,990
camps.
So

354
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,110
one of the people he met told how
executions were carried out at a dock,

355
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:42,590
which was,
uh,

356
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,990
which is a work camp hum.
It destructive labor camp on that mature

357
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,470
river.
They would take the opposition members.

358
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:50,040
So these were people who weren't
communists.

359
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,940
A lot of people who got thrown in the
gulag prisons and the Soviet Union were

360
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,650
basically political prisoners.
Right.

361
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:57,900
You didn't have,
you weren't a staunch communist or

362
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:01,410
you've been turned in for some,
you've being turned in for political,

363
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,060
uh,
what would you call it?

364
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,920
Um,
treason,

365
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,290
you know,
by a neighbor who really wanted your

366
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,790
apartment.
And so they turn you on,

367
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,530
you need to get hold off to
concentration camp,

368
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:11,041
and then,
you know,

369
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,280
your neighbor would get your apartment's
very pretty arrangement for everyone

370
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,670
concerned.
So the,

371
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,820
the gulags were full of political
prisoners.

372
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:20,190
They were also full of normal criminals,
murderers,

373
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,120
rapists,
thieves.

374
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,380
And those guys basically ran the camps.
And because the stalinists thought that

375
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:26,490
murderers,
rapists,

376
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:28,320
and thieves,
that they were,

377
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,700
um,
what would you call those?

378
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,980
You could rehabilitate them because they
were actually victims of an unjust class

379
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,270
structure.
So,

380
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,310
you know,
hypothetically you could save them,

381
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:42,360
whereas if you had rich parents or maybe
your parents owned farm or maybe they

382
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:46,050
just had a bloody house,
God only knows then you were socially

383
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,140
suspect element because he came from the
bourgeoisie,

384
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,810
it not the proletariat.
So you got thrown in jail alongside the

385
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:54,180
murderers and rapists and thieves and
you know,

386
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:56,490
they were regarded as morally superior
to you,

387
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,380
which is,
you know,

388
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,680
something that only a bloody communists
could think through and come to that

389
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:02,550
conclusion,
you know,

390
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,570
it's mind boggling.

391
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,330
So anyways,
a lot of what happened in the counts

392
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:07,020
was,
you know,

393
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,800
political murder essentially.
And so this is what Solzhenitsyn's

394
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,960
talking about in this particular case.
So he says,

395
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,010
this is how executions were carried out
at a dock,

396
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,730
a camp on the [inaudible] river.
They would take the opposition members

397
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:25,080
with their things out of the camp
compound on a prisoner transport at

398
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:30,000
night and outside the compound stood
those small house of the third section.

399
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,780
The condemned men were taken into a room
one at a time and they're the camp

400
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:37,080
guards sprang on them.
Their mouths were stuffed with something

401
00:19:37,081 --> 00:19:40,290
soft and their arms were bound with
cords behind their backs.

402
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,590
Then they were led out into the
courtyard where harnessed carts were

403
00:19:43,591 --> 00:19:46,350
waiting.
The bound prisoners were piled onto the

404
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,220
carts from five to seven at a time and
driven off to the Gorkha,

405
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,200
the camp cemetery on arrival.

406
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,910
They were tipped into big pits that had
already been prepared and buried alive.

407
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,180
Not Out of brutality,
no,

408
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,780
it'd be Nasser tained that when dragging
and lifting them,

409
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,970
it was much easier to cope with living
people.

410
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:10,470
Then with corpses,
the work went on for many nights at a

411
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:14,220
deck and this is how the moral political
unity of our party was achieved.

412
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Now you see what seems to be happening
there is that the people who are engaged

413
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:24,201
in these activities are classifying
those who oppose their political beliefs

414
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,850
as contemptible and therefore worthy of
destruction.

415
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,090
And that that seems to be partly a fear
response.

416
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,370
You know,
that which is not us,

417
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:38,520
but it's also,
it seems very much also to partly to be

418
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:42,840
tied very deeply into this disgust and
contamination system about which we

419
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,540
don't know much about the cognitive
elements of that system.

420
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,700
Although one of the things that's that's
worth considering,

421
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
you know,
this has gone through my mind,

422
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,550
is that,
you know,

423
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,570
you might ask why the hell to human
beings categorized things because other

424
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,310
animals don't really do that the same
way.

425
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,300
We really categorize things like mad and
you think,

426
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,100
well,
we're all,

427
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,590
first of all,
we're omnivores,

428
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,890
right?
That's a kind of a weird problem because

429
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:12,700
if you're omnivores,
you can eat anything except the things

430
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:14,650
you should need,
you know,

431
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,720
and making a clear,
and that's a real problem.

432
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,060
If you're a Koala bear and all you eat
is eucalyptus leaves,

433
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,490
it's like Poof,
problem solved.

434
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,110
Unless the eucalyptus leaves aren't
around and then you die.

435
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,660
But if you're an Omnivore,
you have to run all over the place and

436
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,480
you can eat damn near anything.
But you have to keep track of the things

437
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:31,120
that will kill you and the things that
are poisoning the things that are

438
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,650
contaminated and the things that are
good for you and it's,

439
00:21:33,651 --> 00:21:38,320
it's not an easy thing to do that.
So it seems like part of our

440
00:21:38,321 --> 00:21:41,890
classification system and the cognitive
elements seem to actually have emerged

441
00:21:41,891 --> 00:21:46,120
out of out of contamination and
discussed concerns and that seems to be

442
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:48,700
grounded in some sense in what,
you know,

443
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,530
our,
our ability to make decisions about what

444
00:21:50,531 --> 00:21:52,180
we're going to put in our mouths and
not,

445
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:54,160
you know,
like people don't like to put disgusting

446
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,060
things in their mouth.

447
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,590
Generally speaking,
you know,

448
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:58,630
you can overcome that.
So people will eat,

449
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,220
you know,
moldy cheese,

450
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,270
but you really have to work to overcome
that and you have to work to overcome

451
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,970
your,
your disgust at eating bitter

452
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,070
substances.
So you have to develop a taste for

453
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:12,370
coffee and you have to develop a taste
for all of us because a lot of things

454
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,950
that are bitter are actually poisonous.
So,

455
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,010
so the,
the idea that there are things that you

456
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,980
can put in your mouth that are good for
you and there are things that you can't

457
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:22,810
put in your mouth cause they're bad for
you,

458
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,520
is rooted somehow very deeply in our,
in our ideas of categorization and also

459
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,740
in our ideas of morality.
Right?

460
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:31,660
And you think of morality as a higher
order,

461
00:22:31,661 --> 00:22:33,580
cognitive function.
But think about,

462
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,460
you know,
modern people are as obsessed with food

463
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,610
as the,
as the victorians were obsessed with sex

464
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:44,020
and people are making divisions,
primary divisions of morality based on

465
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:45,880
what each other eat all the time.

466
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,760
You know,
the vegetarianism movement or the Vegan

467
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:50,350
movement is a really good example of
that.

468
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,510
I mean,
those sorts of concerns have been

469
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,330
present throughout human history as far
as I can tell,

470
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:57,850
because there's lots of ancient sex that
don't,

471
00:22:57,851 --> 00:23:00,790
that are vegetarian and just lots of
people in India who are vegetarian

472
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,220
primarily and often for religious
beliefs.

473
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:04,360
You know,
so it's a matter of,

474
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,820
and it,
it also seems that we divide,

475
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:11,080
we tend to divide people into groups,
even ethnic groups on the basis of what

476
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:15,100
one group is allowed to eat and what
another group will eat.

477
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:15,934
And so,
you know,

478
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,450
um,
Christians elite will eat swine.

479
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,020
And that's something that,
uh,

480
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,240
you know,
more,

481
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,790
more conservative Jews and Muslims in
general won't touch.

482
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,370
It's disgusting and it's contaminated,
you know?

483
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:32,140
And it isn't fear.
Exactly.

484
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,120
It's something other than fear.
It's more,

485
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,270
and the danger of conceptualizing it in
terms of contaminated and disgusting.

486
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,570
And you see this a lot in the language
that the say the Auschwitz camp guards

487
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:46,910
used with to the people that they were
putting in the ovens,

488
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:48,140
for example,
they weren't people,

489
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:50,870
they were rats and insects.
That was the language.

490
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,290
It's not like people are afraid of rats
and the insects,

491
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,041
you know,
I mean,

492
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:56,900
it's a rat.
That's not a big problem,

493
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,680
but you can easily hate it.
And it is something to be destroyed,

494
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,110
you know?
And so we also don't know to what

495
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:06,080
degree,
when you use the disgust system to

496
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:09,110
classify someone,
whether you're automatically putting

497
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:12,230
them into the category of disgusting
thing that should be destroyed.

498
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,750
And there,
there's a woman named Martha Nussbaum

499
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:17,360
who's a legal scholar and she's
suggested she's liberal.

500
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:22,040
And she suggested that
our legal decisions should never be

501
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:24,260
based on discussed,
you know?

502
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:26,570
But then I read Nussbaum and I think,
well yeah,

503
00:24:26,571 --> 00:24:30,980
it's easy to say that except the disgust
system is what stops you from eating

504
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,150
things that will kill you.

505
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,000
And you can't just shut the damn thing
off because you know,

506
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,030
it's a fundamental biological mechanism
and it orients you in the world now.

507
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:44,450
And so we don't know how to control it.
Spillover say into radical political

508
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,980
belief,
but just saying,

509
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:48,230
don't do that or you know,
you know what I mean?

510
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:51,260
It's not wrestling with the problem
because first of all,

511
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,320
you don't want to be not disgusted by
things.

512
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,980
That's a really bad idea.
But by the same token,

513
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,780
you know,
if you get too radical about that,

514
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:03,350
you get to orderly then not,
you know,

515
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,050
if you're anorexic he can't even stand
your own body.

516
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,550
That's really not a good thing,
you know,

517
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,320
cause at the anorexic,
so I've worked with,

518
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:13,040
they often talk about their fantasies
and they look at their body and what

519
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,310
they see is like corruptible flash
basically.

520
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:19,610
And they have fantasies about purity and
the purity is they want to reduce

521
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,900
themselves to bone.

522
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,110
You know,
cause bone is white and it's pure and it

523
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:26,810
doesn't have this sort of corruptible
flesh hanging off it.

524
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,400
And you know that that seems to go along
with fairly severe perceptual

525
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,760
aberrations.
So cause a anorexics don't really see,

526
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,060
seem to be able to look at their body as
a whole.

527
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,110
What they seem to do is focus
obsessively on parts and they can never

528
00:25:42,111 --> 00:25:45,530
really get the parts together.
So you know,

529
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:49,070
and I don't exactly know how that's
associated with disgust either except

530
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,840
that that hyper,
you know,

531
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,650
that hyper alertness and hyper
concentration could easily be associated

532
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:59,000
with analysis of things that that might
be disgusting and dangerous.

533
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,840
Anyways,
Frankel,

534
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,160
the most,
this is from the Nazi concentration

535
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:11,330
camps.
The note most ghastly moment of the 24

536
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:16,331
hours of camp life was the awakening
when Adh is still nocturnal hour.

537
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:20,750
The three shrill blows of a whistle,
Torres Petty Leslie from are exhausted

538
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,810
sleep and from the longings in our
dreams.

539
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,250
We then began the tussle with our,
which shoes into which we could scarcely

540
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:31,400
force our feet,
which were sore and swollen with a Dema

541
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:36,110
and there were the usual moans and
groans about petty troubles such as the

542
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:38,870
snapping of wires,
which replaced shoe laces.

543
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,390
One morning I heard someone

544
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,010
whom I knew to be brave and cry like

545
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,210
a child because he finally had to go to
the snowy marching grounds in his bare

546
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,090
feet as his shoes were too shrunk and
for him to wear.

547
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,670
And these gospely moments,
I found a little bit of comfort,

548
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,170
a small piece of bread,
which I drew out of my pocket and

549
00:27:00,171 --> 00:27:01,880
munched with absorbed delight

550
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,150
Lord of what happened in the Gulag camps
was that,

551
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,680
you know,
these people that were putting in the

552
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:11,230
camps where we're putting into work
brigades and you know,

553
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,960
so there was a huge canal that was dug
in the Soviet Union,

554
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,420
I believe it was in the 30s and I
believe,

555
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,630
I don't remember the canals name at the
moment,

556
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:22,720
unfortunately,
but they killed 300,000 people in three

557
00:27:22,721 --> 00:27:27,100
months building it because they were
pick axing dirt in the,

558
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,490
in the brutal cold to build this canal.
You know,

559
00:27:30,491 --> 00:27:33,070
because it had to be done now.
And you know,

560
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,700
according to Solzhenitsyn's description,
by the time they finished the canal,

561
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,870
while 300,000 people had died,
but it was too shallow to be useful for

562
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:43,900
the,
for the purpose they wanted to put it

563
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:46,270
to.
And so basically it was built but never

564
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:47,830
used.
And so then you think,

565
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,720
well,
what was the purpose of the canal if it

566
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:52,180
was never used?
And the answer to that is the purpose of

567
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:55,270
the canal was to kill 300,000 people
while they were working on it.

568
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,460
You know?
And if you think that people can't have

569
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:59,590
such purposes,
then you're not thinking very hard

570
00:27:59,591 --> 00:28:02,740
because they certainly can't.
And stellan certainly did.

571
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,230
Yeah.

572
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,980
Here's soldiers,
Nixon's comments about about work camps

573
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:09,630
during the winter.
And this is Russia,

574
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,600
right?
It's like Russia has a winters in cold

575
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,750
lower than 60 degrees below zero work
days were written off.

576
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,710
In other words,
on such days,

577
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,040
the record showed that the workers have
not gone out to work,

578
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,230
but they chased them out anyway and
whatever they squeezed out of them on

579
00:28:28,231 --> 00:28:32,640
those days was added to the other days.
They are by raising the percentages.

580
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:33,760
Okay.

581
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,330
And the serve biomedical section wrote
off those who froze to death on such

582
00:28:37,331 --> 00:28:39,340
cold days on some other basis.

583
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,320
Okay.

584
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
And the ones who were left who could no
longer walk,

585
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,890
and we're straining every sinew to crawl
along on all fours on the way back to

586
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:51,390
camp.
The convoy simply shot so that they

587
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:53,480
wouldn't escape before they could go
come back together.

588
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,423
The,

589
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,380
when I was studying this material,
I was also looking at him poetic

590
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:07,010
representations of contamination and
corruption and evil.

591
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:12,011
And so I'm going to read you a poem from
William Blake that seems to sum up the

592
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:17,321
attitude that's necessary to harbor
before you would be capable of doing

593
00:29:18,201 --> 00:29:21,140
such things.
This is from the complete works of

594
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,450
William Blake.
Oh rose,

595
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,650
thou art sick.
The invisible worm that flies in the

596
00:29:27,651 --> 00:29:32,651
night in the howling storm has found out
that I bet of crimson joy and his dark

597
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:38,471
secret love does die life destroy.
This is something I took out of the

598
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,040
Gulag archipelago,

599
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,250
the volume two of the Gulag archipelago,
which is an amazing book.

600
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,790
The Gulag archipelago itself is an
unbelievable work of literature.

601
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,713
It's,
it's,

602
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,790
it's,
it's phenomenal.

603
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,950
It's,
it's an immense book.

604
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,930
I think it's 2,700 pages long and it's
written in little tiny type.

605
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,590
So it's,
it's 2,700 dense pages and it record

606
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:05,500
Solzhenitsyn's,
uh,

607
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,070
experiences of the concentration camp
and the concentration camps and the

608
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,770
stories that he gathered,
the individual stories that he gathered

609
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,090
that describe it qualitatively.
But Solzhenitsyn also made an attempt to

610
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:21,091
put the hit the camps did write a
history of the camps and also a history

611
00:30:21,371 --> 00:30:24,670
of the political and social institutions
that gave rise to them.

612
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,150
But at the same time,
a psychological analysis of the

613
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:32,590
conditions that made these camps
possible and probable.

614
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:36,940
And he identified the fundamental
problem in the Soviet Union has the

615
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:41,440
willingness of the Soviet citizens to
lie to themselves and to each other on a

616
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:43,090
constant and ongoing basis.

617
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,130
So to some degree it's a reflection of
the idea that I told you about before of

618
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:52,480
the instrumental use of language.
Language was something to hide your true

619
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:55,060
self behind,
not something to communicate about.

620
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,230
And people were very unwilling to
discuss anything that might be

621
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:01,930
considered a shortcoming of the system
in any way possible.

622
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:04,510
No matter how bad the system God.
And no matter how bad they were

623
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:07,930
suffering,
because by definition the system was

624
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:10,150
always already perfect,
right?

625
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:13,630
You told me I had already come.
And what that meant was that if you were

626
00:31:13,631 --> 00:31:17,140
suffering and it was utopia,
there obviously was something seriously

627
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,170
wrong with you.
And the best thing to do with a creature

628
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:24,940
that was as seriously garnish dre is you
was to get rid of them and often in the

629
00:31:24,941 --> 00:31:27,130
most brutal way that could possibly be a
management.

630
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,010
And so that happened to lots of people.

631
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,270
You know,
in East Germany,

632
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:34,660
they estimated one out of every three
people was a government informer.

633
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,870
So the line,
and this is Solzhenitsyn's analysis of

634
00:31:37,871 --> 00:31:40,510
what happened in the Soviet Union,
he didn't believe that any of that could

635
00:31:40,511 --> 00:31:45,511
happen unless the entire citizenry had
made an unspoken pact that they were

636
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,780
never ever going to say anything that
was true to each other or to themselves

637
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:53,350
under any circumstances whatsoever.
And he believed that that was the

638
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,730
precondition.
You know,

639
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:57,430
I've already mentioned these sorts of
phenomena are very complicated,

640
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,000
but he believed that that was the
precondition for the absolute corruption

641
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,550
of the state.
And that's really worth thinking about,

642
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:05,590
you know,
and soldier knits and also said that,

643
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,490
I think this was in his,
in his Nobel prize speech,

644
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:13,930
but it might've been as Harvard address
cause he was invited to speak at

645
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,100
graduation at Harvard.
And the newspapers ripped him apart by

646
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,810
the way,
because he was quite critical of,

647
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:24,850
of Western society despite the fact that
he had been granted asylum in Vermont.

648
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,310
You know,
and it was so interesting to read the

649
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,950
crit criticisms because you know,
people base,

650
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,320
even people who should have known a hell
of a lot better,

651
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,610
you know,
like smart people,

652
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,940
we're very irritated at soldier knits.
And for daring to say that there was

653
00:32:36,941 --> 00:32:40,010
anything wrong with the West,
given that he had been asylum,

654
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,380
you know,
by the Americans in Vermont,

655
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,630
I personally thought they were lucky to
get him,

656
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,580
you know,
and I think that's the right attitude

657
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,620
toward someone like him.
But,

658
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:49,454
um,

659
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,690
anyways,
so the book itself,

660
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:58,450
the Gulag Archipelago,
the second volume is mostly personal

661
00:32:58,451 --> 00:33:00,160
experiences of one form or another.
And it's,

662
00:33:00,161 --> 00:33:00,994
you know,
enough to,

663
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,400
while you've read some of it
hypothetically,

664
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,890
you know,
it's an unbelievably brilliant book,

665
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,320
but the three volumes together,
you know,

666
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,880
2,700 pages,
it's,

667
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,010
they're,
they're almost unbearable because

668
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,790
they're written by someone who's
basically screaming at the top of his

669
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:19,570
lungs for like 2,700 pages.
That's pretty impressive.

670
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:22,570
You know,
I read this study once about rats.

671
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,870
So if you put rats in a,
in a normal environment,

672
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,450
not,
not like you're single caged rat,

673
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,450
but your family loving hierarchy,
inhabiting,

674
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,740
exploring sort of rat.
If you make a natural habitat for them,

675
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,490
maybe you put all the family things at
one end so the rats can hang out with

676
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:42,100
all their kith and kin.
And then at the other end you,

677
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,550
you place a place where they can go
explore and maybe that's where you feed

678
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:46,240
them hay.

679
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,040
So,
so they get used to that and that's

680
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:51,370
home.
And then you put a cat in out there

681
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:54,730
where they're feeding and you know,
a rat goes out there and he sees the cat

682
00:33:54,731 --> 00:33:56,140
and like,
that's hell for rats,

683
00:33:56,141 --> 00:33:58,540
man.
He's back in his rabbit burrow and like

684
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,090
now,
and then what he does is he peaks his

685
00:34:01,091 --> 00:34:05,620
head out of the borough and he screams,
no rat rat screams ultra sonic screens

686
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,330
for the equivalent of three weeks in
human hours.

687
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:15,310
It's like that rat that's one freaked
out rack and none of the other rats go

688
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:18,190
anywhere when that rat is screaming.
And that's really like,

689
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:20,740
I think of that as the equivalent of
Solzhenitsyn's book.

690
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,360
It's like,
it's,

691
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,790
it's a hair raising,
uh,

692
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,040
endeavor to plow your way through that
book.

693
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,260
But it's,
it's an indictment of,

694
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,070
of,
of 20th century morality in a very clear

695
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:37,180
indication of what happens at a
sociopolitical and an economic level if

696
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:40,660
people abandon their claim to
existential truth at an individual

697
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:40,960
level.

698
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,810
And that's something really worth
thinking about because one of the things

699
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,340
I derived from this was that if you want
to protect yourself against the

700
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:53,341
possibility that you would become as
corrupt politically or sociologically as

701
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:56,860
the Nazis for examples or,
or maybe the Soviet communists or maybe

702
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,320
the mile was communist sort of,
we could,

703
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,490
or the North Koreans,
I mean we could go on and on.

704
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,990
You might ask,
well,

705
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,910
you know,
if you're smart enough to assume that

706
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:06,220
you're not already protected because
you're not,

707
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,590
you know,
one of the things that's really worth

708
00:35:08,591 --> 00:35:12,010
thinking about is there does seem to be
a direct causal relationship between

709
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:15,760
people's willing to willingness to
falsify their own personal experience

710
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:20,020
and the spread of unbelievable political
and economic corruption.

711
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:23,740
And one of the things we do know is that
if you want to make a country rich,

712
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,060
the one thing you absolutely have to do
is make sure that the people will in

713
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,770
fact trade honestly with one another.

714
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,940
So unless the default presupposition
between people is trust,

715
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,100
it's just damn hard thing to implement,
you know?

716
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,940
And I don't even understand any
country's ever managed it ever.

717
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,300
If the default presupposition is that if
we trade,

718
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,450
you won't screw me over.
We can get rich,

719
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,440
but if the default assumption is God
only knows what's up with you,

720
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,020
it's like forget it man.
I don't care how many natural resources

721
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,270
we've got,
we're going to stay poor.

722
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,810
So there's something that's incredibly
like truth,

723
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:01,890
I think is truth might be the only true
natural resource.

724
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,530
You know the Japanese are good example
because their culture,

725
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:06,420
their trading culture is fundamentally
honest.

726
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,420
They don't have any bloody at natural
resources at all.

727
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,400
The rich,
you don't explain that.

728
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:18,300
It's not an easy thing to do.
But anyhow,

729
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,670
I know your story from Solzhenitsyn
fire fire,

730
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:29,300
the branches crackle in the night.
Wind of late autumn blows the flame of

731
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:33,170
the bonfire back and forth.
A compound is dark.

732
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:37,370
I'm alone at the bar and fire and I can
bring it still some more carpenter

733
00:36:37,371 --> 00:36:38,204
shavings.

734
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:39,960
Okay.

735
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,760
The compound here is a privileged one,
so privileged that it is almost as if I

736
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:48,660
were out in freedom.
This is an island of paradise.

737
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,080
This is the Marfino Shahram [inaudible],
a scientific institute staffed with

738
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:59,280
prisoners in its most privileged period.
No one is overseeing me,

739
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:03,060
calling me to a cell,
chasing me away from the bonfire,

740
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,510
and even then it's chilly in the
penetrating wind,

741
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,120
but she who's already been standing in
the wind for hours,

742
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,510
her arms straight down,
her head drooping,

743
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,110
weeping,
then growing numb and still,

744
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,060
and then again she begs pity.
Asley citizen chief,

745
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,450
please forgive me.
I won't do it again.

746
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,120
The wind carries her mons to me just as
if she were moaning next to my ear.

747
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,780
The citizen chief at the gate house
fires up.

748
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:41,781
His stove does not answer.
This was the gate house of the camp next

749
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:47,271
door to us from which workers came into
our compound to lay water pipes and to

750
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:50,610
repair the old ramshackle seminary
building

751
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,810
cross for me.
Beyond the artfully intertwined many

752
00:37:55,811 --> 00:38:00,811
stranded barbed wire barricade and two
steps away from the gate house beneath a

753
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:06,481
bright lantern stood the punished girl
head hanging the wind tugging at her

754
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:11,120
gray work skirt,
her feet growing numb from the cold,

755
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:16,120
a thin scarf over her head.
It'd be warm during the day when they

756
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:20,770
had been digging a ditch on our
territory and another girl slipping down

757
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,630
into a ravine had crawled her way to the
flat of Keno highway and escaped.

758
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:31,410
The guard had bungled and Moscow city
buses ran right along the highway.

759
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,720
When they caught on,
it was too late to catch her and they

760
00:38:34,721 --> 00:38:35,650
raised the alarm.

761
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,630
Yeah,

762
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,180
amine dark major arrived and shouted
that if they failed to catch the girl,

763
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,040
the entire camp would be deprived of
visits and the parcels for a whole month

764
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,340
because of her escape
and the women brigadiers went into a

765
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:56,430
rage and they were all shouting.
One of them in particular who kept

766
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,110
viciously rolling her eyes.

767
00:38:59,250 --> 00:38:59,780
Okay.

768
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,920
Oh,
I hope they catch her.

769
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,830
The bitch.
I hope they take scissors and clip,

770
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,143
clip,
clip,

771
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,180
take off all her hair in front of the
lineup.

772
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:11,090
This wasn't something she had thought of
it herself.

773
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,460
This was the way they punished women in
the Gulag.

774
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,320
But the girl who was now standing
outside the gate house in the cold had

775
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:22,920
sighed and said instead
deadly.

776
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,370
She can have a good time out in freedom
for all of us.

777
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:31,690
The jailer overheard what she said and
now she was being punished.

778
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,960
Everyone else had been taken off to the
camp,

779
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:38,390
but she had been said outside there to
stand at attention in front of the gate

780
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:42,400
house.
This had been at 6:00 PM and it was now

781
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:45,940
11:00 PM to tried to shift from one foot
to another,

782
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:47,680
but the guards stuck out his hand and
shouted,

783
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,640
stand at attention,
whore or else it will be worse for you.

784
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,240
Now.
She was not moving only weeping.

785
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,520
Forgive me,
citizen chief,

786
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:59,710
let me into the camp.
I won't do it anymore,

787
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,400
but even in the camp,
no one was about to say to her,

788
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,420
all right,
idiot,

789
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,170
come on in.
The reason they were keeping her out

790
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:11,590
there for so long was it the next day
was Sunday and she would not be needed

791
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:14,950
for work.
Such a straw,

792
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:16,510
blonde,
naive,

793
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,800
uneducated slip of a girl.
She had been in prison for some spool of

794
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:23,560
thread.
What a dangerous thought.

795
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:27,370
You express their little sister.
They want to teach you a lesson for the

796
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:31,370
rest of your life.
Fire,

797
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,110
fire.
We fought the war and we looked into the

798
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:38,360
bonfires to see what kind of victory
would be

799
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,460
the wind was did a glowing husk from the
bonfire

800
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,670
to that flame and you girl,
I promise.

801
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

802
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,950
Whole wide world will read about.
Right.

803
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:59,300
This is from Milton Paradise Lost
Mailgun when he wrote paradise lost.

804
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,430
He was trying,
he was trying to,

805
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,810
you can say that you can think in some
sense that that a huge part of the

806
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:13,870
mythological religious and philosophical
enterprise of the human race over the

807
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:18,971
last five or 6,000 years and perhaps
long before that has been an attempt to

808
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,240
segregate out what is the good,
the good way of existing and what the

809
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:29,540
evil way of existing now why we're
obsessed with good and evil is a very

810
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:32,240
difficult thing to understand.
I think it has something to do with our

811
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,370
self consciousness.

812
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,690
I think that because I don't really,
if you're an animal you can be a

813
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:40,310
predator.
But if you're a human being,

814
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:42,830
you can take it past that because if
you're a self conscious,

815
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:44,750
you can understand your own
vulnerability.

816
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,610
You know what will hurt you.

817
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,840
As soon as you know what can hurt you,
you know what can hurt other people.

818
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,140
And as soon as you know what can hurt
you and what can hurt other people,

819
00:41:55,141 --> 00:41:58,170
then you can make a choice between good
and evil because you can start to hurt

820
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:00,120
other people just for the sake of
hurting them.

821
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,270
You know?
And that's as close to evil as I think

822
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,340
it gets.
And people have been trying to

823
00:42:05,341 --> 00:42:09,660
conceptualize that for it because they
are trying to conceptualize it as well.

824
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,840
How it is that human affairs can go
dreadfully wrong insofar as that can be

825
00:42:14,941 --> 00:42:16,500
laid at human feet.
You know,

826
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,810
sometimes it's earthquakes and sometimes
it's floods,

827
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:22,050
but sometimes it's not.
Sometimes it's people causing trouble

828
00:42:22,051 --> 00:42:25,890
for the sake of trouble and they,
the human race has been trying to

829
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:30,891
understand the personality
characteristics of that mode of action

830
00:42:30,961 --> 00:42:32,160
for thousands of years.

831
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,060
And a lot of that's emerged up in
mythology and stories and,

832
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:37,920
and more than in philosophy.
It's,

833
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,810
it's,
it's like the bad guy.

834
00:42:39,811 --> 00:42:43,110
And in a movie it's like a low key,
you know,

835
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:45,630
that's a good example.
That's a good example of that sort of

836
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,420
thing popping up in,
in relatively modern culture.

837
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,283
You know,
what's the,

838
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:53,010
what's the embodiment of evil?
And that's what Milton was trying to

839
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,990
figure out when he wrote paradise lost,
you know,

840
00:42:54,991 --> 00:42:58,080
and he was taking all these stories
about say,

841
00:42:58,081 --> 00:43:01,130
tannic forces and hell that had
collected in,

842
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,160
in human culture for thousands and
thousands of years and trying to sort

843
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:06,660
them out and make some sense out of
them.

844
00:43:06,661 --> 00:43:08,040
Some narrative sense,
you know?

845
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,233
And He,
uh,

846
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,850
yeah,

847
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,570
he believed that fundamentally evil
impulse,

848
00:43:14,571 --> 00:43:18,020
the most evil impulse,
which you could characterize evil as a

849
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:20,570
Meta personality that exists across
people.

850
00:43:20,571 --> 00:43:23,750
Because if you do something evil and you
do something evil and you do something

851
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,000
evil,
it's like there's some commonality

852
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:29,450
across that you can extract out the
commonalities and you can say,

853
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,580
well,
that's what this personality is like.

854
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,110
But then you can also say,
well,

855
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,360
that's a very powerful,
it's a matter of personality.

856
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,550
It's something that will never die.
And it's something that can actually

857
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:39,410
possess people.
You know?

858
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:41,990
And if you don't think that you know
that that's possible,

859
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,150
then you know,
you probably don't know that serial

860
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:45,920
killers tend to compete with one
another.

861
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,450
You know,
these sorts of things.

862
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:49,040
They're not,
they're not,

863
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,880
they're not fictions.
And the people who shoot up high

864
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,110
schools,
they're pretty damn

865
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,310
informed about the last person who did
the same thing in January.

866
00:43:58,311 --> 00:44:01,100
They're trying to do a better job.
So,

867
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,510
you know,
this is serious,

868
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:05,870
this is serious matters.
And Milton's analysis,

869
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:07,310
you know,
he wrote what was considered the

870
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,220
greatest poem in the English language,
which is roughly speaking,

871
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:13,220
is paradise lost and what,
what,

872
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,470
what Milton would milton concluded?
And this is like a phenomenal logical

873
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:19,460
statement.
You know,

874
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,260
when we talked about the
phenomenologists,

875
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:24,140
we talked about them trying to wrestle
with the,

876
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,170
with the question of what constituted
being,

877
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,760
you know,
and human being.

878
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,500
What's the nature of your experience and
when,

879
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,570
then what's your relationship to that
experience?

880
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,130
You know,
and the phenomenologists and the

881
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,580
existentialists claimed that the proper
relationship was one of truth.

882
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:43,581
Fundamentally mill basically
conceptualized Satan and that's his

883
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,380
persona.
Effication of evil as the,

884
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,550
okay.

885
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,340
Either the embodiment of or the force
behind.

886
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:51,600
You can read it either way.

887
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:53,640
Okay.

888
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,060
The,
the mind that has made its decision,

889
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:00,580
that being itself is evil.
It should be eradicated.

890
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,610
If you read the Columbine killers,
the literary one,

891
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,930
if you read his,
his writings,

892
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:12,550
it's exactly what he concluded.
He concluded that being as such was

893
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,020
flawed.
You know,

894
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:19,030
people were contemptible being itself
was unsupportable ethically because

895
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:21,460
there was too much suffering.
It was too flawed in the best thing to

896
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,560
do,
which was to eradicate it

897
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,480
and so,
and conceptualized evil as resentment

898
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,050
against big now in,
in Milton's language that was resentment

899
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:35,300
against God.
But it boils down to exactly the same

900
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:36,200
thing.
You know,

901
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,270
when you can,
you can understand this,

902
00:45:38,271 --> 00:45:40,050
it's,
so that would be like the architectural

903
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,800
roots of resentment.
That's a way a union would look at it

904
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:44,180
and you know,
you can see,

905
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,850
you'll see in your life that resentment
will emerge.

906
00:45:46,851 --> 00:45:49,700
Like it'll emerge anytime something you
regard is unfair,

907
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:52,300
happens specifically to you.
You know,

908
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:55,940
and if it's bad enough,
you'll not only be irritated and angry

909
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,660
and hostile and self pitying and
destructive,

910
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,720
um,
and looking for revenge because of it.

911
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:05,870
All those things that will happen and
it's almost inevitable.

912
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,200
But um,
if you take that far enough,

913
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:15,480
then you get to the bottom of that.
And the bottom of it is that it would be

914
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,380
just as well in your estimation if
everything that lived ceased to exist.

915
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,620
It's interesting because not only did
Milton come to that conclusion,

916
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,590
um,
the great German,

917
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,480
yeah,

918
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,480
philosopher and author and poet Girtha
came to exactly the same conclusion.

919
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,410
He believed when he,
when he wrote Faust and faust started Mo

920
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,070
Mephistopheles about now there's so
Mephistopheles was a,

921
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,490
an Avatar of evil.
Fundamentally,

922
00:46:40,491 --> 00:46:45,491
his basic creed was that existence
itself is so terrible in its fundamental

923
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:48,830
nature,
so tragic and flawed that we'd be better

924
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,480
if we just brought the whole thing to an
end.

925
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,860
Now you think that's a pretty damn
powerful philosophy actually.

926
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:56,990
And believe me,
there'll be times in your life where you

927
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:58,730
think that,
especially when something really

928
00:46:58,731 --> 00:47:02,120
terrible happens to someone really close
to you in some arbitrary way,

929
00:47:02,121 --> 00:47:03,640
you know,
maybe you'll have a child,

930
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:06,020
it becomes extremely ill and some
painful manner,

931
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:08,400
you know,
and that'll be enough to make you shake

932
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,720
your fist at heaven.
The problem with that attitude,

933
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,360
as far as I can tell,
because I've traced it,

934
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:17,870
I've tried to understand what are the
logical conclusions to adopting that

935
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:22,760
attitude and a logical conclusion is
that you take a bad situation and you

936
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:26,870
make it worse and that to me that means
it's logically and coherent.

937
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,360
If the problem you're trying to solve is
the fact that being is flawed in a deep

938
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:34,540
way and it's tragic and that people
suffer and they suffer on justly,

939
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,020
you're making the presupposition that
that's wrong,

940
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,440
that it shouldn't happen.
The fact that it's happening is what it

941
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:44,950
what undoes the whole project of being
so to speak.

942
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,610
And so what that means is that if you
actually believe that in your acting,

943
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,940
in accordance with that,
then the one thing you should not do is

944
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:55,630
make it worse.
And I can tell you the one thing that

945
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,780
will make it worse is that is if you
adopt that attitude,

946
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:01,510
it will get worse.
It'll get worse,

947
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,820
and at some point you'll be happy that
it's getting worse.

948
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:07,420
And at some point after that,
not only will you be happy that it's

949
00:48:07,421 --> 00:48:10,900
getting worse,
but you'll be doing everything that your

950
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:15,490
imagination allows you to conceive to
make it worse and worse and worse,

951
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:17,710
faster and faster.
You know,

952
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,710
when there's a mythological conception
of hell,

953
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:23,500
and one of the elements of that
mythological conception is that it's a

954
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,270
bottomless pit.
And the reason for that,

955
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:27,670
I believe,
is that there is nothing that is so

956
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:31,090
awful that you can't make it worse if
you just try.

957
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,770
So,
and I've seen situations like that a

958
00:48:34,771 --> 00:48:35,550
lot.
I've seen,

959
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,850
you know,
families locked and absolutely homicidal

960
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,660
unconscious battles where every single
person in the family was doing

961
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,430
absolutely everything they could to make
sure that no one was going to escape

962
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:50,580
from that and that it was going to get a
hell of a lot worse.

963
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,280
So Milton wrote
for whence,

964
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:02,281
but from the author of all ill could
spring so deep a malice to confound the

965
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:07,430
race of mankind in one route and earth
with hell to mingle and involve

966
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,130
done all to spite the great creator.
This is Richard the third from

967
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:17,970
Shakespeare.
I shall despair.

968
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,800
There is no creature loves me.

969
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:20,980
Yeah.

970
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:21,840
And if I die,
no,

971
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,520
saul will pity me,
nay.

972
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:29,521
Wherefore should they.
Since that I myself find in myself,

973
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,610
no pity to myself.
This is social needs.

974
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:40,510
Solzhenitsyn's description of the
staunch party members.

975
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,710
See,
I guess part of the contamination issue

976
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:47,930
with something like this is that,
you know,

977
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,560
you might say that one of the
preconditions for existing as a human

978
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:54,740
being is the ability to tolerate
contamination and anxiety and

979
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,880
imperfection.
You know,

980
00:49:55,881 --> 00:49:57,790
that's certainly something you would
say.

981
00:49:57,890 --> 00:50:01,220
He believed that in some sense you had
to make a pact with that in order to

982
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,430
tolerate exist.
You had to come to terms with that.

983
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,190
But you can fly from that in some sense.
You know,

984
00:50:07,191 --> 00:50:11,330
and then then there's nothing about you
that's contaminated or strange or

985
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:14,270
disgusting that's all out there.
It's all somewhere else.

986
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:15,860
It's not you.
You know?

987
00:50:15,861 --> 00:50:17,840
And then you build a wall between you
and that.

988
00:50:17,841 --> 00:50:20,480
And then because that doesn't work,
at least in part,

989
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,570
there's no way of getting rid of the
contamination that the wall gets higher

990
00:50:23,571 --> 00:50:26,470
and higher and more and more people are
on the outside and fewer and fewer of

991
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,250
you are on the,
and you know,

992
00:50:28,251 --> 00:50:31,280
the impulse is to burn up everything
that's contaminated.

993
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,640
Yeah.

994
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,021
You know,
and,

995
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:35,790
and part of the problem with that,
and I think that this is why you can't

996
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:38,580
just conceptualize it as discussed,
you know,

997
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,880
cause you can think of that as a natural
territoriality you can think of is

998
00:50:41,881 --> 00:50:43,860
natural and discussed.
You can think of is natural.

999
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:46,800
But there's something about people that
takes just that step further.

1000
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,320
And I think that's the intermingling of
the,

1001
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,550
of the contamination,
disgust and fear response with revenge

1002
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:57,540
and resentment and the desire to hurt.
And if you get those things going

1003
00:50:57,541 --> 00:51:00,180
together,
especially if you also add in the

1004
00:51:00,181 --> 00:51:03,570
propensity to lie man life,
things are going to get really,

1005
00:51:03,571 --> 00:51:06,000
really ugly.
They're going to get really bad.

1006
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,000
And so you know,
you have to come to terms with the fact

1007
00:51:09,001 --> 00:51:12,230
that you carry the contamination around
in you,

1008
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,610
so to speak,
everywhere you go.

1009
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:17,970
And that that's an ineradicable part of,
of limited being.

1010
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,980
And then you can't be resentful about
that,

1011
00:51:19,981 --> 00:51:23,640
are hateful about it because if you are,
then you act in a manner that will

1012
00:51:23,641 --> 00:51:28,641
definitely make it worse.
So these,

1013
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:33,340
this is social and it's the stories
about Communist Party loyalists who were

1014
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,610
arrested by the gulag system and thrown
into prison,

1015
00:51:36,611 --> 00:51:38,380
not happening to them all the time
because no,

1016
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,920
it wasn't like the system was plagued by
any real rules.

1017
00:51:41,921 --> 00:51:44,440
You know,
in fact it was probably even better as

1018
00:51:44,441 --> 00:51:47,830
far as the fundamental motives of the
system are concerned that you are

1019
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:51,250
innocent when you got arrested because
that made it even more miserable and it

1020
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,230
would be even funnier if you were

1021
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,350
arrested for supporting the system that
was going to arrest you.

1022
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:59,840
It's like that was the perfect form of
vicious ird.

1023
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:04,841
And so that happened a lot to say that
things were painful for them is to say

1024
00:52:05,481 --> 00:52:09,110
almost nothing.
They were incapable of assimilating such

1025
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,510
a blow,
such a downfall and from their own

1026
00:52:11,511 --> 00:52:16,511
people to from their own dear party and
from all appearances for nothing at all.

1027
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,120
After all,
they had been guilty of nothing as far

1028
00:52:20,121 --> 00:52:22,100
as the party was concerned,
nothing at all.

1029
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,820
It was painful for them to such a degree
that it was considered taboo among them.

1030
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,330
I'm comradely to ask,
what were you in prison for?

1031
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,600
The only squeamish generation of
prisoners.

1032
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,290
The rest of us with tongues hanging out.
Couldn't wait to tell the story to every

1033
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:42,140
chance newcomer we met and to the whole
cell.

1034
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,580
Cause if we're an anecdote,
here's the sort of people they were.

1035
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,980
Olga sleep Oseberg's husband had already
been arrested and they,

1036
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:57,010
which was usually the KGB and usually in
the middle of the night and they had

1037
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:59,330
come to carry out a search and arrest
her too.

1038
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:04,420
The search lasted for hours and she
spent those four hours sorting out the

1039
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,870
minutes of the congress of Staccato
vites of the brush,

1040
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,870
low and British bristle and brush
industry,

1041
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,200
of which she had been the secretary
until the previous day.

1042
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:20,210
The incomplete state of the minutes
troubled her more than her children who

1043
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:23,720
she was now leaving forever.
Even the interrogator conducting the

1044
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:26,670
search could not resist telling her,
come on now,

1045
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,190
say goodbye to your children.
Here's the sort of people they were

1046
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,790
a letter from her 15 year old daughter
came to yellows,

1047
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,810
Loveta cep cova in the cad sound prison
for long term prisoners.

1048
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:45,710
Mama,
tell me why.

1049
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:46,603
Right?
To me,

1050
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,330
are you guilty or not?
I hope you weren't guilty because then I

1051
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:53,620
won't join the Komsomol.
So that was a Soviet youth groups,

1052
00:53:53,621 --> 00:53:55,670
sort of like the boy scouts or the
brownies,

1053
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,740
except it was the communist version.
Because then I won't join the calm

1054
00:53:59,741 --> 00:54:01,820
softball and I won't forgive them
because of you.

1055
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:06,380
But if you are guilty,
then I won't write you anymore and I

1056
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:08,990
will hate you.
And the mother was stricken by remorse

1057
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:11,750
in her damp grave,
like sell within its with it's dim

1058
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:14,270
little lamp.
How could her daughter live without the

1059
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,970
Komsomol?
How could she be permitted to hate

1060
00:54:16,971 --> 00:54:20,360
Soviet power battery that she should
hate me?

1061
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:22,820
And so she wrote,
I am guilty.

1062
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,840
Enter the Komsomol.
How could it be anything but hard?

1063
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:31,970
It was more than the human heart could
bear to fall beneath the beloved acts

1064
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,470
and then to have to justify its wisdom.
But that's the price of man pays for.

1065
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:38,960
Interesting is God given sole to human
dogma.

1066
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,370
Even today,
any orthodox communist will affirm that

1067
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:47,750
set Cova acted correctly even today.
They cannot be convinced that this is

1068
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,140
precisely the perversion of small
forces,

1069
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,590
that the mother perverted her daughter
and harmed her soul.

1070
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,380
Here's the sort of people they are.
They were yt gave sincere testimony

1071
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,900
against her husband,
anything to aid the party.

1072
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,100
Oh,
how one can pity them if at least now

1073
00:55:07,101 --> 00:55:09,290
they had come to comprehend their former
wretchedness,

1074
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:11,450
the whole chapter.
This whole chapter could have been

1075
00:55:11,451 --> 00:55:14,750
written quite differently if today,
at least they had forsaken their earlier

1076
00:55:14,751 --> 00:55:18,460
views,
but it happened the way Maria Daniel and

1077
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,700
had dreamed it would.

1078
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,330
If I leave here someday,
I'm going to live as if nothing

1079
00:55:23,331 --> 00:55:25,640
happened.
Loyalty

1080
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,210
in our view,
it's just plain pigheadedness.

1081
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,820
These devote to the theory of
development,

1082
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:36,140
construed loyalty to that development to
mean renunciation of any personal

1083
00:55:36,141 --> 00:55:40,670
development whatsoever.
As Nikolai Adamovich villain,

1084
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,280
chuck said,
after serving 17 years,

1085
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:47,000
we believed in the party and we were not
mistaken.

1086
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,920
Is this loyalty or pigheadedness?
No,

1087
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,270
it was not for show and not out of
hypocrisy that they argued in the cells

1088
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:58,070
and defensive all the government's
actions.

1089
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:02,360
They needed ideological arguments in
order to hold on to a sense of their own

1090
00:56:02,361 --> 00:56:04,280
rightness.
Otherwise,

1091
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,330
insanity was not far off.

1092
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,940
You know,
people build memorials now they bowed

1093
00:56:40,941 --> 00:56:43,550
hoke Holocaust memorials.
There's a Holocaust memorial in

1094
00:56:43,551 --> 00:56:46,080
Washington and there's a Holocaust
memorial in Berlin.

1095
00:56:46,081 --> 00:56:47,330
And you know,
the,

1096
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:53,980
the Motif for the slogan of those
memorials is we shall never forget.

1097
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,370
And I think
you can't remember something you don't

1098
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:02,204
understand.

1099
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,200
Okay.

1100
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,120
You can say you're not going to forget
all you want,

1101
00:57:06,121 --> 00:57:09,270
but
unless you understand what happened,

1102
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:13,440
you can't remember it.
And we don't understand what happened,

1103
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,320
you know?
And as far as I can tell,

1104
00:57:16,321 --> 00:57:18,240
you know,
the most important thing that happened

1105
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:21,360
in the entire 20th century with regards
to evidence for,

1106
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,090
for,
you know,

1107
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,380
absolute existential catastrophes that
threatened the human rates at the

1108
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,110
individual level and at the,
and at the state level and at the

1109
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:34,680
international level,
it's all whatever it was that produced

1110
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:38,710
the Nazis and that produced the Soviets
and the produced the Maoist.

1111
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:42,300
And that hasn't gone away.
And that's partly because we don't

1112
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:43,890
understand it,
you know?

1113
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:47,670
And from what I've been able to tell,
and this is partly why teach you guys

1114
00:57:47,671 --> 00:57:49,770
about the existentialists and the
phenomenologists,

1115
00:57:49,771 --> 00:57:52,740
because they're not covered very often
in personality classes anymore.

1116
00:57:52,741 --> 00:57:56,490
It's because I do believe,
I do believe that there's,

1117
00:57:56,491 --> 00:57:59,940
I do believe it was demonstrated by
those who throw it through most

1118
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:02,460
carefully,
that there is a direct causal

1119
00:58:02,461 --> 00:58:06,510
relationship between individual ethical
corruption.

1120
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:11,700
And I can define that the corruption is
when the individual does something that

1121
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:15,750
they know themselves by their own
standards to be wrong.

1122
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,620
It's not a relativistic claim at all and
it doesn't really have much to do with

1123
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,080
the truth.
It has to do with false hood cause I

1124
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,940
don't think people can identify the
truth,

1125
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,750
but I know they can identify false hood.
So,

1126
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:32,751
and I think that people become corrupt
when they act out actions that they know

1127
00:58:32,911 --> 00:58:35,250
by their own moral standards to be
wrong.

1128
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,560
And they,
they do the same thing in a Piagetian

1129
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,730
sense when they refuse to accommodate to
what they've assimilated.

1130
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:46,560
So if I pick up a piece of information
and it contradicts a dearly cherished

1131
00:58:46,561 --> 00:58:51,561
belief and then I refuse to take that
piece of information and transform my

1132
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,690
perceptual and belief structures to
account for it,

1133
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:56,460
then I'm doing the same thing.

1134
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:00,330
That's willful blindness.
And that makes you smaller and smaller.

1135
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:04,260
And the world more and more out of your
control and you weaker and weaker and

1136
00:59:04,261 --> 00:59:06,990
more likely to be paranoid and angry and
hurt.

1137
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:11,910
And I also don't think that the
connections between people and the

1138
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:14,520
society are as abstract and distant as
we think.

1139
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:17,040
Because you might think,
well what the hell difference could it

1140
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,120
possibly make?
You know,

1141
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,950
the way I behave,
it's like,

1142
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:25,430
well you're a node in the network.
You're not an individual connected by a

1143
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:30,800
linear line to another individual
connected to a linear line by another

1144
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:34,740
individual in line that's 7 billion
people long that would make you nothing.

1145
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,060
You can just pull you out and you know
the line would reclose and that would be

1146
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,070
the end of that.
You're a node in the network and the

1147
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:42,560
networks communicating and we know for
example,

1148
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:47,060
that you know you're roughly going to
interact with in some serious way a

1149
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,170
thousand people in your lifetime.

1150
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,020
That's a minimum minimum estimate,
you know,

1151
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,270
so,
and all those people know a thousand

1152
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:55,130
people.
So that's a million people that are one

1153
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:59,270
person away from you and two people away
from you is a billion people.

1154
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,070
And you know,
as soon as you get to three,

1155
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:03,170
well that's far more people than there
are.

1156
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,930
So you know,
you're only three or four or five

1157
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:09,050
connections away from everyone.
And so it's very,

1158
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:14,051
very difficult to know exactly how your
behaviors and misbehaviors echo and

1159
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:18,170
ripple,
you know,

1160
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,690
and we know that people can be
tremendous forces for good.

1161
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:23,360
We know that because we do see people
like that from time to diamond.

1162
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:28,361
We certainly know plenty about the
reverse and so god only knows what,

1163
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,770
what role you play in determining,
you know,

1164
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,330
whether the,
the part and the whole of mankind goes

1165
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:40,331
seriously wrong or seriously right.
But I wouldn't dismiss it as a fantasy

1166
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,860
from everything I've seen.
You know,

1167
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,510
what you do definitely,
definitely affects your family and what

1168
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:50,840
your family does definitely affects the
community and what the community does

1169
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:54,800
definitely affects the state.
Like it doesn't take much rippling for

1170
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:58,070
these things to start to have the facts,
you know,

1171
01:00:58,250 --> 01:00:59,210
it doesn't,
for example,

1172
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:02,210
it doesn't take that many people in a
country to cheat on their income tax

1173
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:04,070
before the whole damned economy falls
apart.

1174
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:07,790
I doubt if it's more than 10% you know,
and it's pretty,

1175
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:10,550
it's a miraculous that there are
countries where that doesn't happen.

1176
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:11,750
Yeah

1177
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,450
but there are,
God only knows why.

1178
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:16,183
So

1179
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,450
anyways,
it's worth thinking about,

1180
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:23,940
you know,
cause people ask questions like,

1181
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:24,750
well what,
you know,

1182
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:27,510
does life have any meaning?
I can tell you one meaning that it has

1183
01:01:27,511 --> 01:01:31,710
like it's perfectly reasonable for you
to devote yourself to not producing any

1184
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:35,610
more suffering than is absolutely
necessary because I don't care what you

1185
01:01:35,611 --> 01:01:37,920
think about meaning in the absence of
positive meeting,

1186
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:41,370
it's pretty damn hard.
Tend to die you pain and you know you

1187
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:46,371
could at minimum live in such a way that
you're least likely to create mayhem in

1188
01:01:47,071 --> 01:01:49,530
misery.
So you know,

1189
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,780
maybe that's not enough,
but at least it's a start.

1190
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:55,290
And I certainly know that if you don't
decide to live that way,

1191
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:59,850
the probability that you can cause
serious trouble is extraordinarily high.

1192
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:02,700
And so you got to ask yourself,
is that what you want?

1193
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,430
You know,
cause it is sometimes what people want.

1194
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,480
So I think it's an abdication of
responsibility and I think it's

1195
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:16,350
resentful and week to do that.
So I think there's no,

1196
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,460
there's nothing in it but,
and weakness.

1197
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,300
Okay.
So that ends the philosophical part of

1198
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:29,301
the course roughly speaking,
cause you can't separate philosophy from

1199
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:32,340
anything because philosophy is about
what things mean.

1200
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:35,070
And even though we're going to go into
psychometrics now and we're going to go

1201
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:35,940
into biology.

1202
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:39,163
Okay.

1203
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,880
It's all building the same edifice.
So I'm,

1204
01:02:41,890 --> 01:02:43,680
I'm going to,
I'm going to start to talk to you a

1205
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:45,570
little bit today about psychometrics
now.

1206
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:48,750
Okay.

1207
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:53,700
I doubt very much that any of you
decided to go into psychology because of

1208
01:02:53,701 --> 01:02:55,860
psychometrics.
Like that's the theory of measurement.

1209
01:02:55,861 --> 01:02:56,521
Basically.
It's,

1210
01:02:56,521 --> 01:02:57,840
you know,
it's kind of dry.

1211
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,480
The theory of measurement.
It certainly wasn't something I was

1212
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:02,300
enamored of when I was,
uh,

1213
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,850
an undergraduate or a graduate student,
you know?

1214
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,810
Um,
but then as I started to dig into things

1215
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:12,960
and started to try to really understand
them and you know,

1216
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:16,530
and understand means that you can use
the knowledge that you have to do

1217
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:20,070
something valuable with that sort of
what understanding seems to me to be,

1218
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,960
the thing I kept running into was the
fact that measurement is everything in

1219
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:27,150
psychology.
As a science it's everything.

1220
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:29,340
Because if you don't know what you're
measuring,

1221
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,510
you have no idea what you're up to.
And then it gets worse because it turns

1222
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:36,030
out that measuring things,
especially psychological things is

1223
01:03:36,031 --> 01:03:36,631
really,
really,

1224
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:37,464
really hard.

1225
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:41,370
And so psychologists do it badly all the
time.

1226
01:03:41,371 --> 01:03:43,800
And sometimes it's because they just
don't know what the hell they're doing.

1227
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,800
And sometimes it's,
it's willful blindness and sometimes

1228
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:49,710
it's blind careerism and it's those two
things a lot.

1229
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:55,220
And so one of the things I want to do
with you and for you for the remainder

1230
01:03:55,501 --> 01:03:57,960
of the course is to well teach you some
biology.

1231
01:03:57,961 --> 01:04:00,270
You know,
some neurobiology because actually there

1232
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:03,840
have been some real biological
psychology geniuses and they've

1233
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:05,130
outlined,
you know,

1234
01:04:05,131 --> 01:04:06,300
the,
the,

1235
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,050
the stigma of brain function quite
nicely and in a way that I think is

1236
01:04:10,051 --> 01:04:13,110
really interesting to know about and
that's important and useful.

1237
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,560
But also to familiarize you with the
basic concepts of psychometrics because

1238
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,210
you'll be armed against stupidity that
way.

1239
01:04:21,211 --> 01:04:23,460
And it's really useful to be armed
against stupidity.

1240
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:27,660
And that's especially the case if any of
you are interested in science or if

1241
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:29,700
you're interested in psychology as a
science.

1242
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,470
Now how many of you are interested in
psychology?

1243
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,600
Has a science,
okay,

1244
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:36,780
so there's a substantial number of you
and I presume that some of you are

1245
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:39,570
interested because maybe you hope to
make a career of it or you know,

1246
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,390
or at least to finish your degree as a,
you know,

1247
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:45,060
a psychologist with biological
orientation.

1248
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:48,570
So either way you need to know,
you need to know what we're going to

1249
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:53,400
learn in the next couple of weeks.
And the first thing you have to really

1250
01:04:53,401 --> 01:04:57,930
come to terms with is how the hell do
you know something is real?

1251
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,170
That's a measurement problem.
You know now the people that we've been

1252
01:05:01,171 --> 01:05:03,090
talking about have been concerned about
that too.

1253
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:07,230
And they argue about it because some of
them are more like objective material

1254
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:10,900
scientist and some of them are more like
phenomenologists and so everybody's sort

1255
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:13,710
of concerned with,
well what's the nature of the real?

1256
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,660
But scientists have an additional
concern,

1257
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:18,130
which is,
well how do you measure it?

1258
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,960
And it's not a secondary concern.
The measurement is everything.

1259
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,570
It's everything.
You can't get anywhere without the

1260
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:27,460
measurement.
So then you think,

1261
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:31,690
well what are people like?
You know,

1262
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,210
what are people like?
Do they have beliefs?

1263
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:36,070
Do they have attitudes?
Do they have values?

1264
01:05:36,071 --> 01:05:38,620
Do they have personalities?
Do they have emotions too?

1265
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:40,930
They have motivations.
Do they have cognitions?

1266
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:44,110
Do they have behaviors?
How do you separate those from one

1267
01:05:44,111 --> 01:05:45,040
another?
It's like,

1268
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:48,190
good luck with that.
And then like how do you,

1269
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,430
how do you assess them at micro and
macro levels?

1270
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:54,670
How do you conceptualize them?
Like what's a unit of behavior?

1271
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,510
That's a really difficult thing to
figure out her what's of value and is

1272
01:05:58,511 --> 01:06:01,030
what you value independent of your
personality?

1273
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,340
Well,
what's your personality or what's a

1274
01:06:03,341 --> 01:06:04,780
trait?
You know,

1275
01:06:04,781 --> 01:06:06,370
and it's,
it's a complete mess.

1276
01:06:06,371 --> 01:06:06,881
It's,
it's,

1277
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:09,550
it's something that's chasing its own
tail constantly.

1278
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,060
It's been very difficult for
psychologists to come to terms about

1279
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:14,830
this now.
So I can tell you something about

1280
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:19,360
measurement theory first.
So one thing you might ask yourself is

1281
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,970
like,
how is it that you determine what's real

1282
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:22,804
in the world?

1283
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,820
Okay.
So the first thing you might think about

1284
01:06:25,821 --> 01:06:29,720
is while this is an empirical idea,
you have census.

1285
01:06:29,721 --> 01:06:34,280
And so a radical in Paris in Paris would
say you get all the information about

1286
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:36,830
the world from your senses.
So it's sense data.

1287
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,083
Okay?
So,

1288
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:41,480
so then you might notice and you might
think,

1289
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,470
well,
okay,

1290
01:06:42,471 --> 01:06:46,760
let's say since data provides you with a
picture of the world and let's even go

1291
01:06:46,761 --> 01:06:48,320
one step farther and let's say,
well,

1292
01:06:48,321 --> 01:06:50,060
it,
it provides you with a picture of the

1293
01:06:50,061 --> 01:06:52,850
reality of the world.
Then you might say,

1294
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:56,950
well,
how many senses do you need?

1295
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:02,230
And it's one high enough while we have
two eyes.

1296
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:04,840
So one eye doesn't seem to have been
enough for people.

1297
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:06,130
And then,
okay,

1298
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:08,650
it's two eyes and then,
but it's not just two eyes,

1299
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:13,000
it's two eyes in hearing and then it's
not just two eyes and hearing it's two

1300
01:07:13,001 --> 01:07:13,834
eyes.
Hearing,

1301
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,750
smell,
taste and touch.

1302
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,240
Yeah.

1303
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,470
Okay.
So That's interesting.

1304
01:07:19,471 --> 01:07:23,000
So what that means is evolution has
calculated that for a,

1305
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:27,660
for a beast like you,
you need five dimensions of evaluation

1306
01:07:27,661 --> 01:07:29,880
before you can be certain that something
is real.

1307
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,480
You can't rely on one.
You know,

1308
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:38,310
you can't rely on too.
Now if you can see something and hear

1309
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:39,144
it,
you're,

1310
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:42,270
it's much more likely to be real.
Then if you can just see it or just hear

1311
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:44,370
it.
But if you can see it and hear it and

1312
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:48,420
touch it,
it's like at that point it takes a

1313
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:52,770
pretty damn sneaky thing to fool you.
And then if you add taste and smell to

1314
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:54,120
that,
it's like,

1315
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,580
well,
what we've figured out is that enough?

1316
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:59,040
If you could,
if you get those five things working,

1317
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:03,060
you probably won't die.
And that's a good measurement of whether

1318
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:05,070
that's sufficiently real.
Okay.

1319
01:08:05,071 --> 01:08:06,120
So That's interesting.

1320
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,440
So your your sensory Operandi,
our measurement devices,

1321
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:13,170
but you don't just need one,
you need five and then you think,

1322
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:18,171
well are those the same or different?
Now it turns out that's a complicated

1323
01:08:19,191 --> 01:08:22,130
question because although this may not
seem obvious,

1324
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:27,380
two things can be the same and different
in an infinite number of ways.

1325
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,110
So one of the things you might say is,
well what makes,

1326
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,360
why do you put two things in the same
category?

1327
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,700
And you'll say,
well because they're similar.

1328
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:37,010
It's like,
well actually that turns out not to be.

1329
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,260
Why?
Because they're similar and different in

1330
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:42,530
an infinite number of ways.
And so you can't use that as a basis for

1331
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:45,140
categorization.
Plus it's just circular.

1332
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:48,830
You put similar things in a category
because categories contains similar

1333
01:08:48,831 --> 01:08:50,240
things,
not helpful,

1334
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,400
not helpful.
So

1335
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,810
when you're trying to zero in on
something,

1336
01:08:56,990 --> 01:09:01,160
not only do you need to sense it,
but you need to use sentences that in

1337
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:03,740
some sense are qualitatively different
from one another.

1338
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,960
So you might,
you might almost think about them is

1339
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:09,950
uncorrelated isn't exactly the right
phrase,

1340
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,860
but they're different methodological
techniques.

1341
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:14,360
So,
for example,

1342
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,540
your eyes rely on light waves,
right?

1343
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:21,410
And then your ears rely on sound waves.
And those are quite different.

1344
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:23,330
They don't even interfere with each
other to any,

1345
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:27,830
to any real degree.
And so that means what you're getting is

1346
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:30,590
information from two independent
sources.

1347
01:09:31,370 --> 01:09:32,810
So that's helpful.
But then if you,

1348
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,880
if you smell something or more
accurately,

1349
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:37,400
if you taste something,
I don't know if you know this,

1350
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:42,401
but it seems to be the case that taste
is a molecular phenomena that you know

1351
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:45,710
that when you taste something,
you're actually assessing it.

1352
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:49,700
I'm a molecular level and there might be
as many tastes in some sense,

1353
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,730
or at least as many smells.
Cause you're sensing that at a molecular

1354
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:56,240
level and smell is more complex as there
are substances.

1355
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,310
Now,
people aren't quite sure about that,

1356
01:09:58,311 --> 01:09:59,240
but it's,
you know,

1357
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:01,820
it's pretty,
it differentiates a lot.

1358
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:06,620
And so you're detecting molecular
signatures with your nose and then with

1359
01:10:06,621 --> 01:10:10,510
your hands,
you're detecting the electron shells on

1360
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:14,090
the outside of your fingertips are
pushing against the electron shells of

1361
01:10:14,091 --> 01:10:16,070
solid surfaces and they can't push
through.

1362
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:17,870
And so that's basically what you're
detecting.

1363
01:10:17,871 --> 01:10:22,250
You're detecting the elect surface of
electrons more,

1364
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,080
more or less,
and you can't push through it.

1365
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:26,120
And so that's,
that's a different way of,

1366
01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:29,330
it's a different way of determining
whether or not something is real.

1367
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:32,320
And so the reason I'm telling you this
is because there,

1368
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,950
there was a famous set of papers
published in the 1950s by a researcher

1369
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,200
named [inaudible] and another researcher
named meal.

1370
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:42,980
And they were trying to figure out how
in the world should psychologists figure

1371
01:10:42,981 --> 01:10:46,460
out what a phenomena,
what phenomena is real.

1372
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,350
You know,
it's the same question in some sense

1373
01:10:48,351 --> 01:10:50,870
that the chemists had disordered out,
but they sorted that out.

1374
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,690
They got the periodic table of the
elements and that was the end of that.

1375
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:56,840
That was a big,
that was a big step forward because they

1376
01:10:56,841 --> 01:11:00,710
got their basic,
they got their idea about what the world

1377
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:02,840
was made of,
nailed down pretty damn tight,

1378
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:05,810
and then they could move from that.
But in psychology it's like we have this

1379
01:11:05,811 --> 01:11:07,850
problem.
What are the basic phenomena?

1380
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:11,120
Okay.
So what meal and chronback we're trying

1381
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,710
to figure out is not so much what the
basic where,

1382
01:11:13,711 --> 01:11:17,190
but how it would be that you could go
about figuring out what they were if

1383
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:22,170
they existed and they basically came up
with a strategy that's very similar to

1384
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:26,580
the sense strategy.
So they're hypothesis was you can't

1385
01:11:26,581 --> 01:11:31,581
really tell if something is real unless
you can measure it using a variety of

1386
01:11:31,831 --> 01:11:34,770
different methods and get the same
answer.

1387
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:40,550
Now the first thing you should remember
is that every psychologist knows this

1388
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,850
unless they've been trained
extraordinarily badly.

1389
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,190
Cause this is a key paper.
Okay.

1390
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,070
It's a key paper of what's called
construct validation.

1391
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,800
And a construct is a measurement,
you know?

1392
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:55,860
And so the issue with construct
measurement is how do you construct your

1393
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:57,990
measures so that you know they're
measuring something real.

1394
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:00,480
It's not something peripheral.
You got to get this right.

1395
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:05,810
And the rule from chronback in meal was
multi method multi-method.

1396
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,840
Now there's a bit of a problem there
because it's not exactly clear when

1397
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:13,050
you're using the same method and when
you're using a different method.

1398
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:14,700
You know,
like if I,

1399
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,510
if I say I filled out a questionnaire
about your personality and then you

1400
01:12:18,511 --> 01:12:20,460
filled out a questionnaire about your
personality,

1401
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,500
is that the same method or a different
method?

1402
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:25,740
Well there's some similarities and some
differences.

1403
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,710
Maybe if I had you fill out a
questionnaire,

1404
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:30,870
you know,
maybe I gave you an electric shock and I

1405
01:12:30,871 --> 01:12:34,110
had you fill a questionnaire.
I would about how you felt about that.

1406
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:38,280
And at the same time I measured changes
in your skin conductance cause those

1407
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:40,650
occur because you sweat a bit if you've
been stressed,

1408
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,050
maybe I measure your heart rate
acceleration,

1409
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,200
you know,
I might notice that when you report,

1410
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,320
you know,
being unhappy or miserable or angry or

1411
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:53,730
frustrated or disappointed or stressed,
you also show us skin conductance

1412
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:57,000
increase because you're sweating a
little bit and your heart rate goes up.

1413
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,790
And then I think,
well I've kind of triangulated on the

1414
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,610
phenomena,
we don't know what the phenomena is but

1415
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,260
at least we can measure it three
different ways.

1416
01:13:04,261 --> 01:13:06,000
It turns out that with heart rate for
example,

1417
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,590
it's being damn tricky.
You know,

1418
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:09,840
cause you might think,
well heart rates and objective measures

1419
01:13:09,841 --> 01:13:12,420
so you could get at what it index is
quite easily.

1420
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:14,890
So you know,
if you get afraid your heart rate will

1421
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:17,100
go up.
But if you get excited,

1422
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,280
your heart rate will go up.
It'll go up if you take cocaine and will

1423
01:13:20,281 --> 01:13:21,990
go up if you run.
It's like,

1424
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:25,800
so it's not exactly clear what heart
rate index is indexing.

1425
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:29,430
It turns out that from the psychological
perspective,

1426
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,970
the theory has developed to the point
where we,

1427
01:13:32,971 --> 01:13:35,730
we,
we assume that when I measure your heart

1428
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:39,090
rate increase to a phenomena that isn't
associated with exercise,

1429
01:13:39,091 --> 01:13:41,760
say that what I'm actually assessing is
your bodies.

1430
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:43,483
MMM.

1431
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:48,150
The,
the intensity of your bodies preparation

1432
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,980
to do something.
What makes sense,

1433
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:51,900
right?
Why does your heart rate go up to get

1434
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:53,730
more blood to your muscles?
Why?

1435
01:13:53,731 --> 01:13:56,640
So that you can go and do something.
So if your heart rate goes up,

1436
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:58,470
it's because you're preparing to do
something.

1437
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:00,090
What?
Well,

1438
01:14:00,180 --> 01:14:03,900
it depends on the situation.
So it's not that fine grained a tool,

1439
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:04,711
you know?
So that's that.

1440
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:06,780
That's a measurement problem.
Um,

1441
01:14:09,980 --> 01:14:12,670
so you want to measure the thing
multiple ways and you want to hope that

1442
01:14:12,671 --> 01:14:13,750
you get the right answer.
Now,

1443
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:17,950
that's what a real scientist does.
A real scientists looks to see that

1444
01:14:18,190 --> 01:14:19,960
they've got the damn thing they want to
measure.

1445
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:24,340
They've identified it and that it will
manifest itself across multiple levels

1446
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:28,690
of measurement because then they can
sort of be clear that it's there.

1447
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,040
Now this guy,
Jeffrey Gray,

1448
01:14:30,041 --> 01:14:32,680
who you're going to read about for the
next lecture,

1449
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,370
he's a brilliant scientist and gray.
I love gray because gray,

1450
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,160
when gray uses a word,
you know exactly what it means and he's

1451
01:14:39,161 --> 01:14:41,980
a behaviorist and those people are known
for precision.

1452
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:44,230
You know,
the philosophers that we've been talking

1453
01:14:44,231 --> 01:14:47,380
about in the clinical psychologists,
they take a broad overview of the world

1454
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:51,820
and that can be really useful.
But gray is a master of the reverse,

1455
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,920
which is zeroing in on what something
means.

1456
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:57,250
So when he says anxiety,
he usually talks about animals.

1457
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,210
He means something specific about it.
He means that there's was a particular

1458
01:15:01,211 --> 01:15:04,510
biological circuit that gets activated.
You can measure that a variety of

1459
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:08,710
different ways that it will respond to
the administration of barbiturates,

1460
01:15:08,711 --> 01:15:10,510
benzodiazepines,
or alcohol.

1461
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:14,170
Cause those are primary anxie lytics and
that there will be certain behavioral

1462
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:16,150
concomitance that are associated with
that.

1463
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:19,990
So the theory has to work across
multiple levels of analysis,

1464
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,750
pharmacological,
physiological,

1465
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,880
psychological,
behavioral.

1466
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:26,410
And then he thinks,
okay,

1467
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:30,040
we kind of zeroed in on this.
Maybe we can cautiously move forward.

1468
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:31,690
So Britt,
beautiful,

1469
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:34,420
beautiful way to proceed and you get
results that way.

1470
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:38,140
When he wrote a book called the
neuropsychology of anxiety at 1982 and

1471
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:41,680
he updated it in 1999 and you know that
thing,

1472
01:15:41,681 --> 01:15:45,550
that thing stood the test of time
because he was absolutely rigorous in

1473
01:15:45,551 --> 01:15:48,310
his definitions and the behaviors were
very good at that.

1474
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,580
When they measured something and defined
it,

1475
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:56,880
you knew what it was very good.
Now it turns out that for a lot of the

1476
01:15:57,371 --> 01:15:59,890
things that psychologists study,
it's not so straight forward.

1477
01:15:59,891 --> 01:16:02,800
You know,
you can't get multiple measures of the

1478
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:05,050
same thing.
And so you have to often,

1479
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:08,080
you have to proceed forward with what
you've got in the hope that you can

1480
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:12,520
accrue additional evidence later.
And I'm going to talk to you in detail

1481
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:16,060
about one such approach and that's been
the psychometric approach with in

1482
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,810
relationship to the establishment of the
basic personality traits.

1483
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:25,060
So,
so what happened with the statistical

1484
01:16:25,061 --> 01:16:26,560
approach,
because that's primarily what we're

1485
01:16:26,561 --> 01:16:31,561
going to talk about is that the initial
discovery of the basic traits was done

1486
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:36,010
only at a statistical level.
And then what happened was that as the

1487
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:39,640
traits were established statistically
and people got more comfortable with the

1488
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:43,780
idea that they might be real,
then the way they manifested themselves

1489
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:46,690
across different levels of analysis
started to become understood.

1490
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:50,200
So for example,
once I knew that there was such a thing

1491
01:16:50,201 --> 01:16:53,230
as extroversion,
I could start to associate certain kinds

1492
01:16:53,231 --> 01:16:55,000
of behaviors and certain emotions with
it.

1493
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:59,890
And then I could start to document what
the neurological systems where that that

1494
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:02,110
underpinned it.
And then I could start to understand the

1495
01:17:02,111 --> 01:17:05,260
neuro pharmacology and all that stuff
started to stack up.

1496
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,410
And that's sort of where we are with
psychometric personality theory.

1497
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:13,400
And the first element of psychometric
personality theory is a hypothesis.

1498
01:17:13,401 --> 01:17:15,500
And here here you think this hypothesis
through.

1499
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:20,510
So this,
so imagine that one of the things that

1500
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:25,280
human beings communicate about with
their language is personality.

1501
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:30,290
I'm really interested in describing what
you're like to someone else and you're

1502
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,290
interested in describing what I'm like
to someone else.

1503
01:17:32,291 --> 01:17:36,680
It helps us keep track of our,
of everyone's relationships and

1504
01:17:36,681 --> 01:17:39,710
reputations,
but it also helps us understand their

1505
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,170
behavior and we're obsessively curious
about each other.

1506
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:46,130
And it's no wonder because you know,
we're weird and unpredictable things,

1507
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,590
but we're kind of useful too.
So the,

1508
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:52,940
so the linguistic hypothesis,
and this is what started the

1509
01:17:52,941 --> 01:17:56,570
psychometric,
the psychometric movement forward in the

1510
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:59,120
domain of personality,
there's a linguistic hypothesis and the

1511
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:04,121
linguistic hypothesis is the important
variation in human personality will be

1512
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:08,720
captured by the language.
Okay.

1513
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:12,140
So that's like a hypothesis that the
language is a good measurement device.

1514
01:18:12,350 --> 01:18:15,890
We're trying to use the language to
assess and communicate about each other.

1515
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:19,400
And roughly we've,
we've nailed the structure within that

1516
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:21,320
language.
If we could figure out how to extract

1517
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,900
it.
Now people debate that,

1518
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:27,380
hey,
because it's not self evident that we

1519
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:30,590
would have captured all the important
variation in personality in our

1520
01:18:30,591 --> 01:18:33,380
language,
but it's not a bad hypothesis and you

1521
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:36,230
can test it.
And the way you test it is by deriving

1522
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,970
personality based descriptions from an
analysis of natural language and then

1523
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:45,080
seeing how those derived descriptions do
in the real world.

1524
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,680
Do it predicting things,
do it being correlated with different

1525
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:52,070
physiological structures,
do at predicting responses to

1526
01:18:52,071 --> 01:18:54,590
pharmacological interventions and so
forth and so on.

1527
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:57,050
And the answer to that as being,
hey,

1528
01:18:57,410 --> 01:18:59,720
it's done pretty well.
So,

1529
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:04,490
so the first hypothesis is that
important trait variation is

1530
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:07,460
encapsulated in the language.
But there's another hypothesis,

1531
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:10,250
and I'll leave you with this and you
really need to think about this because

1532
01:19:10,251 --> 01:19:13,730
psychologists do not get it right and
they should.

1533
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,820
It's a sin.
It's a scientific sin not to get this

1534
01:19:16,821 --> 01:19:19,010
right.
The big five theorists,

1535
01:19:19,011 --> 01:19:21,680
and they're the psychometric guys who
did the language analysis,

1536
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:25,760
they make a claim,
they make a strong claim and a weak

1537
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:30,761
claim.
The strong claim is you can extract out

1538
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,290
information about personality from the
language.

1539
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:36,170
It lays itself out in five dimensions.
We'll,

1540
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,510
we'll talk about what that means.
Extroversion,

1541
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,880
neuroticism,
conscientiousness,

1542
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:45,770
agreeableness and openness and that is
where all the important variation in

1543
01:19:45,771 --> 01:19:47,540
personality lies.
Okay?

1544
01:19:47,630 --> 01:19:51,650
That's the strong claim.
The weak claim is this.

1545
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:54,500
We're going to forget about the strong
claim because you guys can evaluate that

1546
01:19:54,501 --> 01:19:59,501
as we go through it.
The weak claim is this in so far as you

1547
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:04,901
can measure personality with language
and so that means with words or phrases

1548
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:10,470
or sentences in so far as you could
measure it with language,

1549
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:17,080
you're going to measure one or more of
the big five traits well or badly.

1550
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,920
Now,
the reason I'm stressing this is so many

1551
01:20:22,921 --> 01:20:26,580
of you have taken many psychology
courses so far and you may have noticed

1552
01:20:26,581 --> 01:20:28,980
that people measure all sorts of things
with questionnaires.

1553
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,140
They measure self esteem.
For example,

1554
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,780
they measure self ethicacy.
You know,

1555
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:39,390
they measure authoritarian personality,
they measure any bloody thing you can

1556
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:41,150
think of.
There's going to be a questionnaire with

1557
01:20:41,151 --> 01:20:43,980
a name on it,
but the big five theorists say,

1558
01:20:43,981 --> 01:20:44,550
hey,
hey,

1559
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,520
wait a minute.
We've got a hypothesis going here.

1560
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:51,720
If you're using language and you're
measuring traits,

1561
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:56,040
you're measuring one or more of the big
five traits badly or well,

1562
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,220
and so what that means,
and no one's challenged this by the way

1563
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:01,740
that the challenges,
we'll do five traits,

1564
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:05,250
completely cover it,
or do we need six or seven?

1565
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,740
And then maybe what's the hierarchical
structure?

1566
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:11,100
There's questions about that,
but no one seriously questioned the week

1567
01:21:11,101 --> 01:21:12,060
hypothesis.

1568
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:15,720
And so what that means is that all those
things you read about that are measured

1569
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:20,370
by questionnaire
that have all sorts of different names

1570
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:24,660
are elements of the big five that have
either been measured well or badly.

1571
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:28,290
And so what that means is whenever you
read a psychological paper,

1572
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:31,350
and this is something that's
particularly endemic in social

1573
01:21:31,351 --> 01:21:34,770
psychology,
no matter what they named the damn

1574
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:37,500
measure,
if it's a questionnaire,

1575
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:39,570
it's extroversion,
neuroticism,

1576
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:42,330
agreeableness,
conscientiousness or openness.

1577
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:47,340
And it's incumbent on the researcher to
prove that that's not the case.

1578
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,500
And they don't.
Now,

1579
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:52,710
the reason they don't in parties because
they don't know the psychometric theory.

1580
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:54,750
And then the next reason is they do know
it,

1581
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:58,620
but they ignore it.
And the next reason is if they know it

1582
01:21:58,621 --> 01:22:01,440
and ignore it,
then they can invent a construct and

1583
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:04,800
name it something and they can conjure
up a whole career on it.

1584
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:10,080
You don't get to do that.
We know some things exist in psychology,

1585
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,170
Iq,
extroversion,

1586
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,730
neuroticism,
agreeableness,

1587
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:19,731
conscientiousness and openness.
They exist in so far as you can

1588
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:24,870
encapsulate personality in language and
use statistical techniques to derive it.

1589
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:31,340
Maybe other things exist,
but I don't think there's any credible

1590
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:34,220
evidence that they do.
So.

1591
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,620
All right,
so we'll pick that up on Thursday.
