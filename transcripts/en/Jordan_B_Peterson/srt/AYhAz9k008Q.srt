1
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,950
That's fine.
I'm not going

2
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,710
to hear about psychology as a career,
a career

3
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,170
for nine to five
job

4
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,530
where if someone else tells you what to
do,

5
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,760
and usually it's fairly similar to that
is that

6
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,460
someone else tells you what to do
because

7
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,170
if someone else is telling you what to
do,

8
00:01:58,171 --> 00:02:02,420
then you don't have to figure it out.
And if you work from nine to five at

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,450
five,
you're done.

10
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,900
If you have a career,
then you're never doubt.

11
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,880
So one of the things that I want to give
some consideration to when you were

12
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,490
fighting for here is how we learn to
tolerate never being done.

13
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,450
I think I went to graduate school in
1985 and I think the first time I was

14
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:28,500
caught out
might be this year,

15
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,720
but maybe it happened five years ago
once or twice to talk to me

16
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,930
30 years to catch up.

17
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,390
So I was behind for 30 years.
And that's um,

18
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,020
it's hard on your nerves,
so you have to accustom yourself to the

19
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:52,110
fact of the matter how much you work,
you're not enough.

20
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,580
And maybe you're starting to accustom
yourself to that in the universe.

21
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,030
But the thing about university that's
different from the rest of your life is

22
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,630
that although you already are facing
facing problem with that,

23
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:08,640
there's way more to learn and you're
ever going to be able to manage the

24
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,810
won't be first and then you're
responsible to at the moment is

25
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,820
fundamentally apart from your parents to
some limited degree is yourself.

26
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,230
Whereas once you start developing your
career,

27
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,730
you're going to be responsible for a
larger and larger and larger number of

28
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,950
people.
And some of them will depend on you for

29
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,550
four actions that well if you're a
clinical psychologist sometimes that

30
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,570
their lives depend on,
so your responsibility level continues

31
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,610
to decline as far as I'm concerned.

32
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,110
That's a really good thing.
People and the fate,

33
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:46,000
that responsibilities of a burden,
but,

34
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,960
and I suppose that's true,
but what the realize is that human

35
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:54,961
beings are like sled dogs are pack mules
were not happy generally seeking and the

36
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,150
lettuce,
unless we're shouldering the burden of

37
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,200
carrying the load,
I guess as part of being a social

38
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,990
animal.
So it's actually good.

39
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,140
You have the opportunity to shoulder
responsibility because it helps you

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,910
tolerate and living with yourself.
You have to be worth something in order

41
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:23,911
to really
tolerate the conditions of your

42
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,910
existence.
And so you've got to pick up something

43
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,410
heavy and carry it because then that
helps you develop some respect for

44
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:36,880
yourself and also for the table and
that's a big deal that's worth more than

45
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,470
anything that you,
anything else that will possibly be able

46
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:42,340
to point.
Now,

47
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,250
how many of you are you in your first
year?

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,530
Put up your hand from seat because I
need to know what I'm talking second,

49
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
third and fourth year.
Most of you were in third and fourth

50
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,060
year are so,
so you're thinking pretty hard about

51
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:05,020
what to do so well we'll start with the
course supports your students for those

52
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,750
that you want to apply it in.
Graduate School,

53
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,790
which is of course I suppose what you're
going to do.

54
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,670
Most of you,
if you want to pursue psychology as a

55
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,390
career,
better have a's as if you don't have

56
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,590
aids.
It's going to be rough.

57
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,520
It might be rough even if you do have
a's,

58
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,880
but it's unbelievably competitive,
especially in clinical psychology and

59
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,420
it's increasingly the case.
And this isn't such good news for those

60
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:32,010
of you in your third and fourth and your
fifth admissions committees in

61
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,400
universities are starting to look before
your last two years.

62
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,550
They're really only supposed to look at
your last two years because everyone

63
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:43,270
knows that the students,
it's reasonable to allow incoming

64
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,600
university students or a year or two the
scream their heads on straight before

65
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:50,350
you start determining whether their
performance is actually an indication of

66
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,740
their ability.
So generally drives the committees are

67
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,540
only supposed to look at the last two
years,

68
00:05:55,541 --> 00:06:00,170
but it's getting competitive enough so
that they're looking farther back.

69
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,570
Anyways,
clinical psychology requires aids.

70
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,290
Um,
and then of course all you have to take

71
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,950
your driving record exam.
Um,

72
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,340
there's two of them.
There's the standard grocery gripping

73
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,450
examiners,
the psychology specialty,

74
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:20,620
drag aggression.
Most many universities don't want

75
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:23,570
required a psychology graduate record
exam.

76
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:26,570
I would strongly remember,
I would strongly recommend that all of

77
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,060
you take it,
it's your friend.

78
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,890
If you're a psychology student from the
University of Toronto and have done

79
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:36,490
reasonably well,
the prob nick probability is high,

80
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,530
but just ace it because it tests
knowledge that you've acquired as a

81
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,190
psychology student.

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,890
Whereas the gre,
the general gre tests,

83
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:49,040
more general knowledge,
including mathematics or arithmetic and

84
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,120
mathematical knowledge,
and that's not as easy to acquire.

85
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,450
But about site students at ut asis
psychology garage was record exam fairly

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,490
frequently.
So even if the university or

87
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,010
universities that you were applying to
don't require it,

88
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,720
you might as well take it and send it to
them.

89
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,810
Because if you have a stellar 97th
percentile,

90
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,590
then you know why don't want to include
the information in your package.

91
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,640
So if you score less than 80th
percentile on the verbal portion of the

92
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,580
General Gre,
I would strongly recommend that you

93
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,050
don't consider a psychology as a career
because it's unbelievably writing

94
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,950
intensive.
And it'll go the into the variety into

95
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,710
the ground.
Some people are pretty smart

96
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,350
mathematically and analytically,
so when they write the gre,

97
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,440
they do well,
they do better on the nonverbal parts.

98
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,210
And I've had students like that who were
really powerful intellectually,

99
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,170
but more non verbally God,
deeper,

100
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,090
greatest statistics,
and they can be really good analytical

101
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:52,370
thinkers about the writing just killed
them.

102
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:56,600
You have to run all the time as an
academic psychologist and you have to be

103
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,730
very verbal as a clinical psychologist.
And so if you're not up and up,

104
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,750
I would say top 50 percentile of the
people who are taking the Gres,

105
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,350
it's going to be a real variety for you.
You should think about that very

106
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,351
seriously because it's the writing is
the most difficult part of psychology as

107
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:17,240
an academic career.
And if you're not a fluid writer,

108
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,040
you're going to have one miserable
prime.

109
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,340
You're going to drag your way through
graduate school and you're not going to

110
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:25,880
be productive because writing ability
actually determines research

111
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:29,300
productivity more than anything else.
And if you're not productive,

112
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:30,860
you won't do well on the job market.

113
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,920
And so it's to something else.
There's no sense sending yourself off

114
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:37,124
for,
you know,

115
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,220
a six year Brian and then a dismal
outcomes.

116
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,030
So students who aren't as,
who are more intellectually powerful on

117
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:51,640
the nonverbals sections of the gre are
often pretty good at designing

118
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,220
experiments and they can often learn how
to analyze the data too.

119
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:59,520
And that's great.
Let's pause his graduate students to

120
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:04,521
stumble this writing up the papers.
And so I often have students too who

121
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,910
baby,
you know,

122
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,640
completed 10 or 11 studies,
which is not planting to finish their

123
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:12,730
darker,
didn't publish,

124
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:13,650
you know,
uh,

125
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,680
several papers but they just cannot
break them up.

126
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,300
And so then they language because no one
else is going to do it.

127
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,070
So if you're,
if you're verbally oriented,

128
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,600
that's a good thing.

129
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,050
Don't be thinking that you get to pick
where you're going to graduate school

130
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,930
because you don't,
and if you think that you get to pick

131
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:40,270
where you're going to graduate school,
unless you're a straight 4.0 students

132
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:44,370
with 99% of the Uris,
then you're setting yourself up for

133
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,660
disappointment because it's so
competitive that what you do is you

134
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,750
apply to every bloody place.
Love half a chance of getting into

135
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,510
including prices.
But you think you'd ever go?

136
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
I think lake had,
for example,

137
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,760
has a clinical program now I've got
nothing against weight yet,

138
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,730
by the way.
And a small universities have real

139
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,600
advantages sometimes because you're,
you're less anonymous at small

140
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:08,850
universities,
but you might think,

141
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,300
oh,
I'd never go late as well.

142
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:13,530
And you might be also thinking then they
will never go to the clinical graduate

143
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:16,860
school because that could easily be the
only place that you'll get in.

144
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,590
So what you do,
especially if you want to go to clinical

145
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:22,710
graduate school,
is you apply every single place that you

146
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:25,320
can in Korea.
Whether you think you build,

147
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,200
they're not can always say no if they
accept you.

148
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,670
But if it's one,
you know,

149
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,990
maybe maybe it'll turn out at one place
accepts you and that's a place he didn't

150
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:36,390
think you want to go.
Well there's a big difference between

151
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:38,630
being in clinical graduates who are not
using it.

152
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,100
It's the difference between zero and
one.

153
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,660
And so if you go off to lakehead and you
come up with a clinical phd and you're a

154
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,870
clinical psychologist,
so who the hell cares if you have to

155
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:53,871
spend five years,
you know in somewhere that isn't a trend

156
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,430
in urban setting,
you're going to be sitting in a box most

157
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:59,310
of the time anyway.
It's made out of cinder blocks doing

158
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,810
your experiments and most of your life
fill fee,

159
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,680
the social life of graduate students
anyway,

160
00:11:03,681 --> 00:11:05,400
so it's not like you're going to be
missing anything.

161
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,470
One of the things you might want to do
if you're fortunate enough to get

162
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,990
accepted and you're not sure where they
would want to go,

163
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:16,950
just to go talk to whoever's going to be
your supervisor because more than

164
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:21,750
anything else you ever do in your life.
I would say if you go to Raji school,

165
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,010
you're an apprentice to a supervisor,
you're not a member of it department.

166
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,790
So your relationship with your
supervisor basically determines whether

167
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:35,160
graduate school works for you or not.
So you want to find out ahead of the

168
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,490
time if possible,
whether the person who wants to work

169
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:42,900
with you as someone who then who is it,
who you're,

170
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,700
who you think you can get along with.
What they're working on is less critical

171
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,910
I think because it's not if you know
what you want to do research or you

172
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,800
might think you do but you don't know
enough to,

173
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,330
so I would also strongly suggest that
when you write your applications for

174
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:02,590
graduate school,
you make the person tell people who

175
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,270
you're writing to,
who you are,

176
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,380
but don't specify a research interest
too closely because hardly anyone is

177
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:12,010
doing half research.

178
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,000
And why give people an excuse not to
take you.

179
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,290
You're looking for an excuse not to take
you 81 so if I'm looking for graduate

180
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,380
students,
I have a staff of a hundred applications

181
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:27,750
or maybe 150 I get rid of 75 of those so
fast that they might've,

182
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,260
well,
might as well have not even apply.

183
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,950
They're just gone.
Usually what I do is I make a

184
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:37,180
spreadsheet.
I put in grades and the gre scores and I

185
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:41,080
called the lenders have breakfast and I
some across the rank order them,

186
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,160
I knock off the bar and everyone else
does that too.

187
00:12:45,161 --> 00:12:47,050
Even though they might not do it in such
a

188
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,270
quantitative way,
they should because that's the most

189
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,010
efficient and accurate way of doing it.
But everyone else looks at that pile of

190
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:59,070
resumes.
It's more to do the same thing.

191
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,513
So,

192
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,390
so you're already 50% of the people who
applied,

193
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,090
they weren't going to get in it like
anyways,

194
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,930
that's already cop caught.
He don't want off of this type of

195
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,130
statement of interest.
It says,

196
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:17,200
well I just want to,
you know,

197
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,440
look at the left hemisphere where hey,
you have specialization for second

198
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:25,520
language learners who are children,
but there's probably one person in North

199
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:28,310
America studying.
And so anyone else who might be

200
00:13:28,311 --> 00:13:31,970
interested in your application because
of your qualifications could still look

201
00:13:31,971 --> 00:13:33,380
at that and say,
well he didn't want to work with me.

202
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,240
And then you're out deal.
You can say what you work on or be

203
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:41,450
interested in,
but what you should do.

204
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:45,090
And I'm not asking you to falsify your
letter if at 10 because that's foolish.

205
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:50,410
But what I would take you to consider is
that you don't know that much about

206
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,390
psychology and

207
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,650
why did you do it?
When did you specialize as a graduate

208
00:13:57,651 --> 00:14:00,200
student is you started to go,
it's in a sexy,

209
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:04,250
narrow as you start off with without a
lot of knowledge about one specific

210
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:07,220
topic as you narrowed,
it comes a time when you start to

211
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,640
broaden out again cause you get into the
seal talking deeply enough.

212
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,440
So you started acting starting to tech,
you start to have to consider the

213
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,930
contextual issues that surround that
coffee.

214
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,830
So for example,
if you are a saint richards

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,370
neuroscience,
but you ended up studying language

216
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,560
development as well.
At some point you're going to run into

217
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,180
the brain,
right?

218
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:31,181
Because language development depends on,
so psychology and since it's an

219
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,360
amorphous feel and there's an entry
points,

220
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,640
all the entry points are narrow.
But once you pass through the narrow

221
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:40,280
your point,
you're in the field.

222
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,020
So it doesn't matter that much
specifically what you'd be doing your

223
00:14:45,021 --> 00:14:47,240
work on for your master's degree in
particular,

224
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,490
cause you don't do enough to specify
that at all.

225
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,190
And you'll be,
if you're fortunate,

226
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,430
your supervisor will basically tell him
what to do for your master's degree.

227
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,060
It always takes a year,
right?

228
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,110
Well it takes you two months just to
clue in when you first started a new

229
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,500
program and then you're already a
quarter of the way through the first

230
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:06,500
semester somebody hurting us.
That pretty much has to hand you a

231
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:11,501
project and you have to walk through it.
And so what it's about is important as

232
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,840
the fact that it's at hand and you've
done it.

233
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,140
I'm not saying this well,
but what you're interested in doesn't

234
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,120
matter.
It matters an awful lot,

235
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,950
but you don't want to prematurely and
narrow.

236
00:15:22,951 --> 00:15:26,690
We specify you're building an interest
when what you're relying on is

237
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:30,230
information that's not all that reliable
and you're not an expert enough in

238
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:33,800
psychology where it needs to make that
have determined the decision about what

239
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:34,850
it is that you're going to study.

240
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,030
I didn't have enough 70 all sorts of
things I never thought I would study.

241
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,730
Things I didn't think were were studying
that turned out to be wrong.

242
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:43,580
We were plenty.
We're studying an intern up to the

243
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,000
necessary.
So um,

244
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,370
learn your bloody stats.
You should be a wizard with spss or some

245
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,480
others,
some of the computer program.

246
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,870
From an economic perspective,
there's nothing that you'll learn as a

247
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:59,810
psychology graduate students that's more
valuable than statistics.

248
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,780
If you use statistics,
the all sorts of things open up to you

249
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,650
don't know the experimental work and you
have to be a statistical expert really

250
00:16:09,651 --> 00:16:13,970
could be a good scientist.
But Cross disciplinary collaboration

251
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,940
because most other social sciences stoke
half here,

252
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:21,560
this statistical expertise that
psychologists do consulting for

253
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,640
businesses.
There's,

254
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,780
there's all sorts of value in doing
statistics and understanding.

255
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,750
So for those of you who are in your
earlier years,

256
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,230
don't shy away from statistics,
especially the more practical end of it,

257
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,870
which would be the computer,
you know,

258
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,670
the pc or Mac programs.

259
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,180
I wouldn't say pc,
generally pc programs that enable you to

260
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:43,380
do statistics.
You should get good at that part in

261
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:45,260
someone who will teach you how to do
statistics.

262
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,480
Statistics is actually extremely
interesting once you start looking at

263
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:55,000
your own data because it's a lot more
and I mean that technically at all.

264
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:58,160
If you pull a slot machines arm,
there isn't much of a chance that you're

265
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:00,710
going to get a good outcome.
But for some channels and so it's

266
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:03,590
exciting.
A off is variable reinforcement and

267
00:17:03,591 --> 00:17:07,430
research is like that and statistics are
exactly like that because maybe you've

268
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:12,431
spent six months putting together a data
set and you are raising the variables to

269
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,660
ask ess statistical machine so to speak
and you both handle it.

270
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,400
Now you just learned ways or you wasted
your drive for six months or you hit the

271
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,570
Jackpot.
So it's actually pretty exciting.

272
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,940
It's different when you're doing in
class or working on someone else's data

273
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,740
set because what they know you care,
but when you've got,

274
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,890
when you've got something in the game,
it's an entirely different process.

275
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,610
Should also tell you that statistics is
not arithmetic and it's not.

276
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:41,540
Mathematics is more like surgery and
it's a moral endeavor,

277
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,520
which is funny.
You wouldn't think that was one

278
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,190
statistic,
but it is a moral endeavor because there

279
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:51,191
aren't any real rules for doing.
A data is an amorphous and vague entity

280
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,800
and there might be information in it and
your job is to carve off the garbage and

281
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,430
to keep down,
to pull up the information that

282
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,570
reporters doesn't require.
The automatic application of a set of

283
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:06,150
statistical rules that just won't work
at all.

284
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,260
Your job is to figure out where the
truth is embedded in this messy thing

285
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,650
that you just produced,
this vertical study because most

286
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:16,620
studies,
they're complete disasters you've never

287
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,140
been or how to do that,
right until you've already done it and

288
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:21,990
so there are,
there are mass and whether or not you're

289
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,720
going to be able to pull something on
that mastic constitutes genuine

290
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,350
information.

291
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:30,350
Depends on how skillful you aren't using
the statistical tools and how carefully

292
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,180
you make your decisions ethically while
you were,

293
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,260
you're attacking the data.
Because for example,

294
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,010
there would be a pretty damn highly
motivated to come out with something

295
00:18:41,011 --> 00:18:45,270
where p is less than 0.05 right?
Because otherwise it's not technically

296
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:48,490
publishable even though that's a rather
foolish criteria.

297
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,510
But that's still the point.
So if you put six months in the study

298
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,260
and you know you have to decide where
the outliers are and where the masses

299
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,190
who to throw out concentrate on,
there's the little career day,

300
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:02,310
we'll let the doctor,
your mind is going to be pushing pretty

301
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:07,260
hard in the direction of money with the
data in a way it makes what you want to

302
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:10,970
come out of it.
And you can bet that 40% of published

303
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,580
studies,
cited studies at least are absolutely no

304
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:19,581
utility whatsoever because the way they
were produced was biased by the fact

305
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,710
that the person growth of wanting to
publish the study.

306
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,750
And so that's a terrible thing because
it works the whole feel,

307
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:29,140
but it's even worse if you have to be
the person that's doing it because you

308
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,330
know,
fool yourself yourself into discovering

309
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,590
something that isn't there,
then you will convince yourself that it

310
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,260
is there.
Then just spend the next 15 years

311
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,950
chasing something that doesn't exist and
trying to prove to yourself and others

312
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:43,830
that it's real.
And that accounts for a big chunk of

313
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:46,050
what passes for psychology and
researches.

314
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,320
It's a standard in some ways and the
journals are changing the way they

315
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:55,970
accept papers right now because this
happens so frequently.

316
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,760
So one of the way things want to do if
you want to be paid an academic

317
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,830
psychologist,
but you want to be a scientist as a

318
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,420
careers,
you benefit your,

319
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,010
your,
your,

320
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,040
your,
you have to decide what it is that

321
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,970
you're doing.

322
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,010
And what I'm saying that you might be
doing is building a career which is a

323
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,690
social enterprise.
It's a proud name,

324
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,430
dominance hierarchy into for us and it,
it means that what you're focusing on is

325
00:20:20,431 --> 00:20:22,410
climbing up a private,
a dominance hierarchy.

326
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,030
That's not the same thing,
is trying to pursue truth insights.

327
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,630
Those are completely different things.
If you pursue the truth in science,

328
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:34,410
you might also January and career.
If you generate a career,

329
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:39,240
you might also pursue truth and science,
but the probability is relatively low.

330
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,880
Now,
I would suggest that you pursue truth in

331
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:43,680
science.
And the reason for that is,

332
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,181
well,
first of all,

333
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,160
you won't get corrupt and second,
if you corrupt other people,

334
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,850
but perhaps more importantly,
from an existential perspective,

335
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,420
20 years down the road,
you won't look back at your life and be

336
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:59,020
disgusted by the whole thing and sinful
and not even to teach or to talk to

337
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,200
students or to be a good graduate
advisor because you're sick and tired of

338
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,970
the whole business.
So,

339
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,900
and that's exactly what happens to
people who could do things in a crop.

340
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:07,960
Man,
I think it's cynical.

341
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,410
And why did it go?
It shouldn't be cynical because they're

342
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:13,560
the sorts of people that you should be
cynical about.

343
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,880
So the other thing you should decide to,
if you want to pursue experimental

344
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:22,420
psychology as a career,
duly you actually care about scientific

345
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,520
truth.
Does that matter to you?

346
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,120
If the answer is no,
I would say go into business.

347
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,070
There's nothing wrong with going into
business.

348
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,730
I've got in,
this is important.

349
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:39,550
It's not easy,
but if you want,

350
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,470
if what you're after is this sort of
status that comes along with a business

351
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:46,300
career,
don't get hit.

352
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,480
Again,
going to have to be,

353
00:21:47,481 --> 00:21:49,720
yeah,
you might as well just go into business

354
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:51,910
and do that.
You're not going to make much money as

355
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:56,911
it as an experimental psychologist.
So if you're after status and the sort

356
00:21:57,011 --> 00:22:00,790
of status that comes along business and
it sort of productivity and social

357
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,180
relations that come along with fitness,
just go into business.

358
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,710
Don't,
don't do it.

359
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,780
Don't sidetrack yourself off into
something that's in a sense of more in

360
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:12,850
pursuit.
So,

361
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,940
okay,
so do your stats and get good at it.

362
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,400
And you know,
you might be resentful about having to

363
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:22,820
do it because a lot of people who are
sort of oriented towards the humanistic

364
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,400
psychology are pretty irritated folks,
statistics.

365
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,240
So I was certainly one of those people
because it didn't come naturally.

366
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,930
But if you can't have to get a tutor and
hit age and take more stats courses,

367
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:36,160
then you think you need because you'll
need them.

368
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,520
So,
and if you go onto graduate school and

369
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:44,350
you're sort of crippled in terms of your
ability to approach statistics,

370
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:46,860
you'll pay the price for it.
We'll get an understanding of papers,

371
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,060
we'll go do your own analysis.
Stab me.

372
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,980
Okay.
So I everywhere,

373
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,181
I mean,
you might say,

374
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,620
well,
I can't afford to apply everywhere

375
00:22:56,621 --> 00:23:00,000
because each application is under $50
riding on this.

376
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,080
What is it now?
$100 $150 that's silly.

377
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,420
That's not a cost.
It's an investment.

378
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,050
And you need to distinguish between
costs and investments.

379
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:12,760
And if you get in,
what are you thinking?

380
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,960
What are you think of?
Experiment a phd is worth,

381
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,360
let's say you get an afternoon last
work.

382
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,663
Yes.

383
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,223
Yeah.

384
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,650
Cool.
Is it 100,000 for females?

385
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:31,090
The doors?
What do you think his work?

386
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,863
Pardon?

387
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,763
Ballpark.

388
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,683
Saturday.

389
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,850
Okay.
That's good for how many years

390
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,153
maybe?
Yeah.

391
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,210
Okay,
so that's hundred freaking on the doors,

392
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,810
right?
What's your tension word?

393
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,240
Were other two and you were undressed to
be,

394
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,640
you underestimate the salary in the
latter part of their career.

395
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,420
So it was probably 7 million doors.
Okay,

396
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:01,460
so now you know what you're,
you're in that,

397
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,220
you get that APP,
you get that acceptance letter in the

398
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:06,170
mail,
it's worth 7 million doors if you play

399
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:08,360
it right.
And if you're a clinical psychologist is

400
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:12,500
probably worth twice that.
So you're after a $14 million price,

401
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:14,690
you ask,
well why is it so competitive while now?

402
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:17,240
You know?
That's why it's so competitive.

403
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,880
Lots of people would like to have $14
million.

404
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,080
So it's hard to get it.
So,

405
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,920
so then if you're applying and it's $100
$150 let's say you've got a one in 10

406
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:35,000
chance or one in 20 chance of getting in
and any given school.

407
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,460
So let's see,
what would you pay for a one in 20

408
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:39,200
chance of $14 million?

409
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,290
How would you calculate that?
Right?

410
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,800
14 million divided by 20 so you pay
about $700,000 something like that.

411
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,370
So you pay $700,000 not a hundred so
let's have that because you were

412
00:24:57,861 --> 00:25:00,050
skeptical about your chances of winning.
Fine.

413
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:05,051
So then you paid $350,000 well don't
Balk at 200 it's a bargain.

414
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,520
And don't get too irritated about the
application process.

415
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,090
It's annoying.
They're trying to annoy you because if

416
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,120
you get annoyed and quit,
then they won't have to look.

417
00:25:17,121 --> 00:25:19,340
You've got an application and that's the
end of you.

418
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:24,380
So take a big amount of time,
do your application because they're

419
00:25:24,381 --> 00:25:27,870
really important and do lots of many is
the APP.

420
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,380
If you can afford,
you think about points,

421
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:34,700
bdos throw some applications down there.
That's especially true if you're a hot

422
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:39,080
student and you're a hot student.
If you've got a basically an a average

423
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,350
and the gre of 90 percentile or above,
people will be interested in you.

424
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,510
And that means it might get a
scholarship to the American school or do

425
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:50,030
you want to pay the tuition?
So,

426
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,160
and that might especially be the case.
You don't.

427
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,010
Maybe you want me to go back with you at
Harvard,

428
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,600
although little at night,
but there's lots of state schools down

429
00:25:56,601 --> 00:25:58,430
there that are excellent.
The big research schools,

430
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,010
and maybe they'll paint it from down and
study.

431
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,550
So not only do you get your crap,
70 million or $14 million,

432
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,110
but someone will give you some money to
help you get it.

433
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,620
So that's a pretty good deal.
So don't lays out all over the bloody

434
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:14,930
applications.
It's really important.

435
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,050
All right,
so now local back to more general things

436
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,930
for a minute.
So now we might want to talk about what

437
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:29,870
makes people successful.
Okay.

438
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:32,690
And do you want also think about what
success means,

439
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,570
right?
And what success means.

440
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,630
I can give you a couple of rules of
thumb of both.

441
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,061
Dot.
I mean,

442
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:40,430
the first thing is if you want to be
successful,

443
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,560
let's,
let's put that,

444
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,580
let's use a different phrase.
So we could say,

445
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:46,440
well,
let's say you want to have a good life.

446
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,390
And I don't mean good in that it's happy
and easy or any of those things I need

447
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:54,070
sorta hood classic.
If you want to have a platonic need.

448
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,590
Good life.
Okay,

449
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:58,290
so how would one go about doing that?
Well,

450
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:03,291
the first thing I would say is do what
other people do unless you have a really

451
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,840
good reason not to.
So what people,

452
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,880
what human beings do,
they have a good life.

453
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,450
They have friends,
they have a circle of friends,

454
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,730
some of whom they can talk to.

455
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,310
Careful.
You help the important things.

456
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,430
So you need that.
People have an intimate relationship

457
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,360
with someone that is stable across time.
Why?

458
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,590
Well without that you're kind of chaotic
and loss and plus new when we have half

459
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:34,120
your brain because people are pair
bonding animals and we're kind of

460
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,410
communicative and if you have a partner
that you can trust who's got your back

461
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:43,680
that you can talk to and planning with,
then you're twice as wise as the person

462
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:47,320
that you're competing because it's just
like,

463
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,470
you know,
why is there sexual reproduction instead

464
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:52,560
of coal,
coal,

465
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,040
reproduction.
Why is that

466
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,610
you,
you guys are taking biology courses.

467
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,130
It's pretty fundamental question.
What's the answer to that?

468
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,850
Variations.
That was part of it though,

469
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,511
right?
Yeah.

470
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,344
I mean,

471
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,940
as a unit,
you called yourself first of all the

472
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,210
parasites to get again in no time flat.
But apart from that,

473
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,110
do you have a bunch of straight on to
weaknesses and they're kind of random

474
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,870
and then you'll pair up with someone
that has to match the strengths and

475
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:24,870
weaknesses.
And Eric,

476
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,470
you ran it and hopefully when you pair
up,

477
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,920
most of the places you're weak,
that person will be strong and vice

478
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,780
versa.
So that makes you a much more,

479
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,900
I'm more,
it's more properly solidified unit.

480
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,440
Sometimes a weakness is a match and
that's where you will fight nonstop.

481
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,570
And so you know,
we'll have to be a promise.

482
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,220
You're a lot better off with somebody.
And that's especially true if you also

483
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:49,040
want to have children.
And if you're foolish enough to have

484
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,290
children,
I don't know you guys,

485
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,380
most of the women in your most,
you'd be under 25 so there's probably a

486
00:28:57,381 --> 00:28:59,510
fair number of people who think you're
not going to have children.

487
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,990
Must have plenty of,
I'll dispense with that foolish idea

488
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,580
right now because all that means is that
you just have your,

489
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,730
you'd be more,
that's one thing.

490
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,980
It means,
and second it means you don't know who

491
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:13,160
the hell you are because my experience
is feeding it virtually.

492
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,560
I think this is virtually without
exception.

493
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,440
Every woman I'd ever met,
whether they thought they wanted

494
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,330
children at the age of 21 or 22 or 23 or
24 if they were basically mentally

495
00:29:23,331 --> 00:29:25,820
healthy,
they were desperate for children by the

496
00:29:25,821 --> 00:29:30,821
time you were 30 and that kicks in about
28 and so expect it because it's going

497
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:33,210
to happen and you might think,
well,

498
00:29:33,211 --> 00:29:35,420
I know it's,
it's not going to happen to me.

499
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Well,
you can take that if you want,

500
00:29:37,701 --> 00:29:40,420
but I'm basically what I'm telling you.
One,

501
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,150
my work,
I've done a lot of work with really high

502
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:43,984
achieving.

503
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,170
Most of these were female partners.
Senior partners is being offered and

504
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:51,790
being a senior partner of a big law
firm.

505
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,290
That's as hard as being a successful
clinical psychologist and you have to be

506
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,960
at the top of your class as an
undergraduate.

507
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,710
Then you have to get into a really good
law school and you have to be really

508
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:06,190
good at that law school and you have to
go off an article and you have to be

509
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:10,570
kept as an article in student and
generally you're not because the loss

510
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,460
big law firms,
you know,

511
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,130
pulling Arctic new students,
working with deaf and throw away all the

512
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,490
ones that don't make it,
so you make it well then you get to the

513
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,450
associate and then they'll get it to
bolster those two and then if you're

514
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,630
really good at it,
you'll be a senior partner and so that's

515
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,300
tough and mode and make your email and
you've done that.

516
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,220
Your blood will committed to your
career.

517
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,340
It doesn't matter.
By the time you hit 28 to 30 and you're

518
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,360
working 70 hours a week,
you're going to be thinking,

519
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:41,050
what the hell am I working?
70 hours a week four which is reviewed

520
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,280
by the way.
Good question and you're,

521
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:47,170
your attention is going to turn happy
children as it should and the way you

522
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:49,780
solve that.
If you're a female and you want a career

523
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,870
as a,
you have a partner who's got clue and

524
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:56,740
can provide some support and be you
outsource most of your domestic,

525
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,930
most of the domestic responsibilities
that go along with the household.

526
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,150
Yap,
Yap Anatomy.

527
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,190
Maybe have to have a cook.
You don't do any housework.

528
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:07,300
She pay attention to your kids with a
little bit of time that you have and

529
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,670
that would work.
Daycare care doesn't work.

530
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,510
You're bloody law firm isn't going to
take care of your children that are not

531
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:15,060
going to set up the paid care in your
firm.

532
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:17,620
That does work anyways,
but a nanny will work.

533
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,250
And so you might as well be thinking
things along that line because if you

534
00:31:21,251 --> 00:31:24,270
want to have a career and you're smart
and you're hardworking and you showed

535
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,750
how the career as you want to have
children,

536
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,670
then you have to set your life so that
you can do those two difficult things

537
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,110
without dragging yourself stark raving,
mad or exhausting yourself or destroying

538
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:37,750
your relationship.
And that's about the only way that I've

539
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:40,210
seen so far that it's possible to do
that.

540
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:45,160
Okay,
so anyone's back to the back to career.

541
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,220
Okay,
so now we've already established that

542
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:50,830
what you're after is worth a lot and
it's hard to get and it's hard to get

543
00:31:50,831 --> 00:31:53,170
cause it's worth a lot and there's lots
of people chasing it.

544
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,410
Now the question is,
what can you do to give yourself an

545
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:57,244
edge?

546
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,200
Okay,
well,

547
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,260
what makes skew good perception from a
career perspective?

548
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,250
Well,
one is I you,

549
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,460
well,
you're pretty much stuck with what

550
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:12,870
you've got.
You can maintain it by exercising.

551
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,250
It turns out physical exercise is the
best way you maintain your and thousands

552
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,690
across time.
It starts to plummet pretty

553
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:24,691
precipitously after your voting did 24
and it's downhill the 70 and then we'll

554
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,650
after that,
things get worse.

555
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,960
So you keep yourself in good physical
condition that's going to make a big

556
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,420
difference.
I would also say if you want to play a

557
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:37,030
sharp gauge,
so if you're going to be on the edge of

558
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:40,990
things competing with people who are in
say in the top 1% top,

559
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,880
you better get your drug and alcohol and
you send control because that compromise

560
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,520
you.
You better make sure that you're

561
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:50,600
sleeping as well regulated and you'd
better make sure that you eat proper.

562
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,750
And those are there.
They're not small and it's their big

563
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:57,830
things cause you do the mammary day.
And so I would say you can start to look

564
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:00,410
at yourself now get up at the same time
everyday.

565
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,160
Start learning how to do that.
I would say get up to eight or seven 30

566
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,370
because that's when civilized people get
up and the people you're competing with

567
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:10,404
from,
you're really good.

568
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:14,930
They're all already up at six and
they're working by seven and they'll

569
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,870
work you right into the ground because
the people who are at the top and their

570
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,060
discipline,
and that's basically what you're talking

571
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:22,710
about.
If you're talking about doing something

572
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,430
that requires phd level education as a
career,

573
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,620
they're not popping around.
Okay.

574
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:31,780
So here's the question.
Think about this for a minute.

575
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,290
So think about your typical day.
Now think about this.

576
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,490
How much time do you waste?
And so you've been defined based any way

577
00:33:40,491 --> 00:33:44,420
you want the weight to define it.
But I would say time is wasted.

578
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:48,690
When is that what you plan to keep you?
Right?

579
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:50,620
You know what it feels like to waste
time.

580
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,630
You feel like a moron,
right?

581
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:55,000
It's,
I didn't know it was a feeling that

582
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,330
really for me it's like a feeling like
that needs to take a shower.

583
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,140
It's,
I deviated from the appropriate path.

584
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:02,950
I mean,
you know,

585
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,940
Youtube,
the hail,

586
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:07,030
some [inaudible].

587
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,740
That's not the good.
Okay,

588
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:11,380
so now you thought about that typical
day.

589
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:13,270
How much time do you waste?
All right,

590
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:14,990
so let's find out,
um,

591
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,740
how many people waste more than half an
hour?

592
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:21,843
All right.

593
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,230
Is there anybody here who thinks they
don't waste half an hour?

594
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,700
Okay.
And if you do take that,

595
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,420
please do tell you,
cause you know,

596
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:34,450
maybe you're efficient.
Some people learn to be efficient.

597
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,381
Okay.
How many ways?

598
00:34:35,381 --> 00:34:38,160
Two O's.
All right.

599
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,450
How bout,
how bout three?

600
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,060
Okay,
how many think they waste less than

601
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:44,680
three hours?
Okay.

602
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,660
One person.
Okay,

603
00:34:46,661 --> 00:34:51,010
I'll come back to you.
Four hours.

604
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:55,030
Five hours.
Jesus,

605
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,390
you better wake up people.
Let's say five hours.

606
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,880
I won't embarrass you further.

607
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,553
What's your time?

608
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,010
No Matt,
let's come on.

609
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:12,800
Let's make him money that's told to use
to,

610
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,450
to,
to evaluate.

611
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,150
Value
your time.

612
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,860
No.
Why is that wrong?

613
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,890
That's minimum wage.
No,

614
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,020
no,
no.

615
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,040
We're going to have,
we're going to play a capitalist here.

616
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,130
It's normally valuable.
I'm not going to pay you again for the

617
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,010
amount of money to do it.
Okay,

618
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,860
so,
so we're just,

619
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:38,861
we're just talking about economic belt.
That's all she has to be quantified.

620
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,750
We're going to quantify,
okay.

621
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,690
It's not tended the port.
Why?

622
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:47,400
Because he have a future Janet quarters.
What you're worth.

623
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,370
If you're tired,
if what you do,

624
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:52,980
how is it contributing to who you're
going to be in the future.

625
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,300
So it's more than that.
How much is,

626
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,591
okay?
Well,

627
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:01,530
let's look into this way.
Let's say you managed your career goals

628
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:04,570
in his head,
you feeling then you're making the

629
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,880
amount of money you should be paying.
So we've got a whole,

630
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,370
I'm here a lot back in the seventy five
thousand seventy five thousand dollars a

631
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:14,690
year.
So that's about $6,000 a month or about

632
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,980
1500 bucks a week.
And so we'll assume 40 hours,

633
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,860
that's about $45 an hour.
Okay,

634
00:36:20,861 --> 00:36:23,560
let's assume that you're worth 35 you
can,

635
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,980
if you're slow Haiti,
you're,

636
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,620
you're not worth that.
But,

637
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,700
but the time that you spend it now isn't
invested,

638
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,400
right?
So even though you might not be,

639
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,880
he paid for it this second,
your banking one in sports.

640
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,760
So we paid for later.
So you can't be fake and it's 10 bucks.

641
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:42,760
So we'll say we'll say 40 because it
makes the math easier.

642
00:36:42,761 --> 00:36:47,180
So how much time you're wasting a day,
five hours fast switch partners for it.

643
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,680
200 times 5,000 multiply it by seven
because after all,

644
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,220
we're wasting time on the weekends too.
So that's 1400 week.

645
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,130
How many weeks in a month?
Four.

646
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,690
What's four times 1400

647
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,533
okay.

648
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,760
5,600 so we'll say hi,
this same argument,

649
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,910
5,000 a month.
How many months in a year

650
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,310
you're wasting $60,000 a year,
right?

651
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:23,060
So maybe you should stop doing that.
$60,000

652
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,480
and there are people that people,
they give me competing with,

653
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:30,710
they're going to be wasting my time.
Or maybe you're going to be wasting

654
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:35,120
$30,000 or 15,000 of it.
But if you're wasting five hours a day,

655
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,790
you better get your act together because
you're going to pay for that.

656
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,160
And the way is that foolish waste of
time.

657
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,980
Now Iq,
there isn't much you can do about it.

658
00:37:42,981 --> 00:37:47,210
We already said that you could actually
saw us and maybe you can read and you

659
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:50,900
can read it as broadly as you possibly
can until you should read every day.

660
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,010
That would be helpful.
And maybe you should read nonfiction,

661
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,780
especially if you want to be a
scientist,

662
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:00,260
what maybe he couldn't work on to work
hard.

663
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,520
And one rule of thumb to that is how
much time you waste.

664
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,620
Now you can do a little more in depth
analysis and when you speak down,

665
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,950
because I could also ask him,
I assume he said,

666
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:13,680
come and see me and they say,
what else do you do it or you want the

667
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,560
Scorps?
If we said,

668
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,090
well how much are you working on it?
They said,

669
00:38:17,091 --> 00:38:19,160
well,
I knew ivory six times today.

670
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:24,900
And I think that's what I asked.
I asked how much time you're spending

671
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,250
working on because first of all,
you should be in the library for six

672
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:31,320
times a day.
That's just insane.

673
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,280
I don't know anyone at all except for a
very small fraction of people who are

674
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,310
extremely disciplined,
well put together who could concentrate

675
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:42,220
on difficult material for six hours in a
row.

676
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,700
You're lucky if you can manage three
like real work.

677
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,820
So the first thing you do is half of
your time in the library and naming and

678
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,400
double your discipline.

679
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,630
So,
so let's say we could look at a typical

680
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,010
hour that you're working and I might
say,

681
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,290
well,
how hard are you working during that

682
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:01,260
hour?
You how hard you be working if someone

683
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,650
pulled it out with a gun and said,
look,

684
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:05,100
if you don't work as hard as you can
connect to around under to shoot,

685
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,730
and then you might think,
well,

686
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:10,850
I'm not talking about one 10th as hard
as I can [inaudible] actually that's a

687
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:11,684
moat,
right?

688
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,950
I bet you that's about right.
The reason I use that fingers,

689
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:19,480
because I figured out a long time ago
that if you have a given task to do and

690
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:22,050
you sit for five or 10 minutes and you
think Coppin,

691
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,740
I do,
this headline is faster.

692
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:27,500
You can almost always figuring out how
to do it 10 times faster and some kind

693
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:31,810
of better and can kind of staff strep.
And that's also something to really know

694
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:35,800
because what you'll find as you mature
in your career is that you'll be asked

695
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:38,230
to do way more than is humanly possible.

696
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,440
And the way that you learn how to do
that is you get way faster than you

697
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:44,680
think you could be.
And just using the 10 items,

698
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,260
Margaret Little fountains,
an excellent one,

699
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,050
you,
it's remarkable how much you can do in a

700
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:54,220
very short period of time if you set
yourself up with that expectation.

701
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,180
So then when you remember what you're
talking is worthwhile,

702
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,360
then you might think about it.
$40 it's an underestimated your time to

703
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:01,780
actually work.
One of them has to be physical.

704
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,850
You're young again.
So

705
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,140
every hour that you have now,
if you shape yourself,

706
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:10,120
pays off through the old course of your
life.

707
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,960
You know a lot of what I do now,
it wasn't a did when I was 20 but what

708
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,110
you do now that you're 23 has been
effecting when you're my age.

709
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:20,730
So your time is actually worth more,
even though you can't get any better,

710
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,210
can pay for [inaudible].

711
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,430
So,
so those might rethink what learning to

712
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:30,160
do is to figure out how to get
efficient.

713
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:35,110
And you've got to be ruthless with
yourself to be efficient and then to be

714
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:37,180
efficient.
Because if you were going to pursue a

715
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:40,570
career efficient,
people win and they don't just wait a

716
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,920
little bit.
I don't know.

717
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,900
You know,
you guys have probably learned that most

718
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:46,090
things in life are normally distributed,
right

719
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,101
height.
Well,

720
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,800
you should have learned that if you're a
psychology student and you haven't

721
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:55,420
learned that,
then there's really something wrong

722
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:59,830
because that's like the basic,
that's the basic premise of statistics.

723
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,190
So of most statistics anyways,
so all right,

724
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:06,100
so you know,
maybe the average span is five for 10

725
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,700
and then there's a standard deviation
around that.

726
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,280
If maybe,
I know it's probably something like six

727
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:17,281
inches and then 85% of men,
60 60%,

728
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,210
65% of men fall in that range.
Okay.

729
00:41:22,211 --> 00:41:24,630
So and heights like that,
weights like that.

730
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,640
When intelligence is like that,
most things are distributed according to

731
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,650
the normal distribution,
but lifeboat comes,

732
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,620
they're distributed according to a frito
distribution

733
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,650
and that's a free of distribution.
So,

734
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,320
um,
anybody know how much money Bill Gates

735
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,154
House

736
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,533
about

737
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:53,130
or you don't get me out?
So how much money did the top 10 richest

738
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:56,520
man in the last half,
300 billion,

739
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,880
something like that.
So that's a thousand gallons for every

740
00:41:59,881 --> 00:42:03,330
single person in the United States.
This is more than the average family

741
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:06,450
hasn't savings.
So the top 40 men in the United States

742
00:42:06,451 --> 00:42:10,190
have more money than all the rest of the
Americans have put together and saying

743
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,930
it's okay.
So the talk hundred richest man in the

744
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,900
world have more money than the bar and
she would believe it,

745
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,290
right?
So this is a great distribution.

746
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,690
It see the same thing with creative
production.

747
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:26,691
So let's say you're looking at Ph d
students and you want to know how many

748
00:42:27,151 --> 00:42:29,430
publications they have.
Well,

749
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:30,960
the media now,
there is one.

750
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,390
The medium is the number that most
people have for.

751
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,940
It's not the means,
it's if you cough up for typical phd

752
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:41,460
student,
do I have to call her and said

753
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,760
publications can say one.

754
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,390
I say,
well if you're not retired one cause one

755
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,650
us,
then it doesn't count.

756
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:56,520
It's more than a zero,
but it's only one more than zero.

757
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,560
Okay.
So then there's going to be the top 1%

758
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,160
of the students way the hell over here
and they're going to have 22% of the

759
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:11,340
time they graduate,
which is about as many as been typical

760
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:16,350
associate professor has that tenure and
north of the people you'll be competing

761
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,580
on the job market.
So they published the be in their phd

762
00:43:20,581 --> 00:43:24,180
for five years.
You'll publish more papers a year and

763
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:28,770
have promote and there'll be higher.
And so just for the sake of comparison,

764
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,070
the typical professor at a top rate
research institution,

765
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,110
according to North America polishes,
it could be three to four papers a year.

766
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:42,030
So the graduate students that are hot
prospects on the job market,

767
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,060
and that makes it likely that you'll get
an academic job,

768
00:43:45,061 --> 00:43:50,061
although not certain are oh,
producing technical associate and

769
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,560
assistant professors at universities.
And there's hardly any of these people

770
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:58,200
and all of the science is done by these
people,

771
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,600
sort of the rest of them,
they're just wanting to be,

772
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,850
so all the people who aren't waiting on
at that tail end,

773
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,040
they're just keeping the institutions
running.

774
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:15,990
So what's the typical profit margin for
a typical corporation year after year?

775
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,183
Awesome.

776
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,180
Well guess how much money do you get?
How much interest do you get when you

777
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:28,590
put your money in the bay?
Matt?

778
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,540
Do percentage.
Okay,

779
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,340
so obviously you've talked to you,
what happened even with the 2% and no

780
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:36,490
one would ever destined.
Well,

781
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,840
so it's gotta to be more than 2% okay,
well it's around five,

782
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,300
5%.
So I'm really efficient.

783
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:46,130
Company runs on a 5% margin.
That means it's been,

784
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:51,131
is 95% of its fine just exist.
Everything is that we'll stay stand

785
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,580
mobile phones just existed.
All of the power comes into how many of

786
00:44:58,270 --> 00:44:59,760
you put yourself in the coffin?

787
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,780
I'll
let you guys sweat and go here.

788
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,080
Okay.
So if you want to put yourself up at

789
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,710
this end of the distribution,

790
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,320
you do it

791
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,110
well,
I can give you an example.

792
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,850
Differences in people's could.

793
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,143
Awesome.

794
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:15,450
Are you 65,000 pieces as far three 65
years.

795
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,800
Okay.
And the median number of pieces,

796
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:21,790
parts for people produces zero,
right?

797
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:23,890
So that's a huge difference.
But almost all of them.

798
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,580
Fields of creative production.
I'm like,

799
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,060
almost everyone does nothing.
And a few people do.

800
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,840
Okay,
so

801
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,040
Bach Js,
Bach,

802
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:38,970
he wrote so much music.
If you took all smeared districts and

803
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:43,971
you just copied the
40 years and he was actually writing the

804
00:46:45,241 --> 00:46:48,470
music,
not just popping up so people can get

805
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:53,540
unbelievably productive and
they're the ones who have to stomach

806
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,030
premiers.
Hey,

807
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:02,060
so what do you need to do that wow
can do much about your intelligence,

808
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:05,490
but we can learn the word and work
matters.

809
00:47:05,491 --> 00:47:09,630
Conscientiousness,
it's just a trade is a big predictor of

810
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,640
longterm life.
Success and conscientious people are

811
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,880
ordering,
which isn't quite as relevant and

812
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:17,340
industrious,
industrious people.

813
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,800
When they put their mind to something,
they do it.

814
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,820
There's no wasting time.
And the people I know who were really

815
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:28,110
successful,
and so they were up in the top one 10th

816
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:32,500
of 1% which is only 1000 break.
So you guys are already,

817
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:36,700
he's probably one in a hundred if you
look at your Iq and your work ethic.

818
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:41,590
So one in 10 of you is one in a thousand
or so.

819
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,310
People like that.
They don't waste any time.

820
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,020
And I really mean that.
Then they five minutes be productive,

821
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:51,970
we'll be more than five minutes.
And most people do that.

822
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,020
And that's not an exaggeration because
they've learned to be bloody

823
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:57,940
efficiently,
do not waste time.

824
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,840
So they,
how can I do things too fast?

825
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,860
And they think,
how can I do this one thing.

826
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:05,350
So it does five things,
similar pace.

827
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,620
And also I kill five birds with one
stone instead of two.

828
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,900
And that way they maximal use of their
current and they disciplined themselves

829
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:18,120
and also the big rock in a cost of
battle with themselves about doing what

830
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:18,963
they should be doing.

831
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,260
They just bloody well do it.
And that's why they can produce,

832
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,760
they can produce at these levels reading
almost beyond human imagination.

833
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,640
So discipline really matters.
So if you're wasting time and you want

834
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,380
to pursue a different,
most career,

835
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,810
better learn how to get that under
control.

836
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,630
The best way to do that,
as far as I can tell us,

837
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:43,090
can pick something that's difficult.
You know that,

838
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,470
that,
that you'd like to do.

839
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,950
It's difficult.
Something that's kind of beyond you and

840
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:50,190
do it.
Bang your head against him will probably

841
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,130
that a couple of years of like really
hard work to mold yourself into

842
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,730
something that is utterly useless.
And that's a,

843
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,540
there's a big payoff associated with
that and I think that's something you

844
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:06,541
can do merely by warrantying it and
attending to and that if you do that

845
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,540
well,
first of all,

846
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,180
you get disciplined and that's really
useful.

847
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:16,300
It's why it doesn't matter so much what
you studied when you first go to

848
00:49:16,301 --> 00:49:18,500
graduate school.
What really matters is that you started

849
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,520
something and you really study at heart.
Now when I went to graduate school,

850
00:49:23,921 --> 00:49:26,560
I went to Grad school and neal,
we had a great time.

851
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,830
I had a great social life.
We be spent a lot of time going into

852
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:35,440
restaurants and going to bars and play
softball in a blacks.

853
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:37,690
But all the people I went to graduate
school with,

854
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,290
they worked like 10 hours a day and they
work like mad dogs.

855
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:43,210
And so that was fine.
When we're done their 10 hours,

856
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,560
then they can go off and have fun with
it.

857
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:49,060
There was no lock in about during the
work period and whether they were hung

858
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:51,160
over or not,
they go out and they enjoy their work.

859
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,620
And so that's what you have learned to
do and it makes your life more enjoyable

860
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:57,970
and entertaining,
not less.

861
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,980
I mean,
if you really want to waste five hours a

862
00:49:59,981 --> 00:50:02,050
day,
I just wanted to 30 or wasting time.

863
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,220
If you live 90 years,
he wasted 30 years and if you waste 30

864
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,370
years you'd be,
and you wonder why you are attending

865
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:13,390
Edwards slash come on.
That's pretty easy to figure out if you

866
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,660
always 30 years,
you know?

867
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,060
And why should because you're just
wasting your time.

868
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,270
So it's best to really learn how to stop
doing that.

869
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,140
It'd be a terrible battle,
especially for those of you crossing,

870
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:27,040
you lost.
People are like,

871
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,310
you really have to rewire it yourself
and get that under control.

872
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:37,270
So if you want to be successful at a
high competition career and that's what

873
00:50:37,521 --> 00:50:37,810
happened.

874
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:38,643
Yeah.

875
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,420
Okay.
I'm going to start from it and ask them

876
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,190
questions and then I'll tell you a
little bit about what options you have.

877
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,110
If you choose psychology psychology's a
career,

878
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,610
what sort of things laying themselves
open to so,

879
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,330
so if you have any questions,

880
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,760
now's the time to as a pass from
extracurricular activities per se,

881
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,690
something outside of the career will
help you get into Grad school there.

882
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,960
No
for the Gres that slipped past.

883
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:19,340
The rest of this law mean if you hit c.
The thing is it's a multiple threshold

884
00:51:20,281 --> 00:51:22,650
cutoff system.
So first of all,

885
00:51:22,651 --> 00:51:24,420
you have to get aids.
If you don't,

886
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:26,420
you're out.
Then if you have a's,

887
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:28,740
you have to have certain gre lows and if
you don't,

888
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:32,910
you're out give you have certain grades
and certain gre was Dan.

889
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:37,140
You're in vantage random factors that
determine whether or not you're going to

890
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:40,440
get shows,
which is partly why you want to maximize

891
00:51:40,441 --> 00:51:44,460
your probability of success by applying
to many any place.

892
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,070
Because let's say that you're a
threshold student.

893
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,410
Okay,
I'm going to look over your application.

894
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,690
Well,
what's going to determine when the right

895
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,650
data do I need us to eat?
Number one,

896
00:51:55,870 --> 00:52:00,080
do you want to have to find it?
Do you have funding if you can get shirt

897
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,750
or,
or,

898
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,370
or,
or um,

899
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,120
MRC funding as a graduate student,
that helps a lot.

900
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,840
And if you're above threshold,
can you sort of act two actual and then

901
00:52:08,841 --> 00:52:10,950
you got funding,
it's really easy for a professor and

902
00:52:10,951 --> 00:52:12,020
say,
yeah,

903
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:16,260
you're not gonna eat up granite
resources.

904
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,800
So that's really helpful.
So you can apply for Grad school,

905
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,510
you have to still have the same level of
attainment.

906
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,940
Some extra curricular activities can
help with that you have or don't have

907
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:32,941
experience and you can write at a decent
research proposal that increase the

908
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:35,000
probability that you can get a
fellowship.

909
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:40,090
So laboratory experience and upstairs
lobby sterns also helps when you get to

910
00:52:40,091 --> 00:52:41,790
Grad School,
cause you know what the hell is her

911
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,340
doing it.
You can get a jump on it,

912
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,190
but as long as you help them get in
much.

913
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,360
If I'm looking at two students who
basically cross threshold the say way

914
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,550
and one of them has extra lab experience
and maybe know some computer program,

915
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:59,230
you'd have some useful skills or it's
good statistically,

916
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,440
well men are all certainly prefer that.

917
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:06,590
But I won't even see the applications
unless those first two things are matt

918
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:09,450
and I promptly.
And not even deciding that.

919
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,290
Because usually what happens when you
apply is said there's a committee of

920
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:17,310
administrators that that was the first
pass and they don't even let you through

921
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:21,540
the your application through the door to
see the professors unless you meet the

922
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:24,720
minimum criteria.
So you know,

923
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:28,280
students desperate to give the extra
experience that we get into graduate

924
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:32,220
schools,
like a publication you couldn't help but

925
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:35,700
they're hard to get.
So if you do a like an honors research

926
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:37,140
project for example,
and it works,

927
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,590
you can write it up,
but almost no one does that because by

928
00:53:40,591 --> 00:53:43,260
the time you're down,
you're down project and you've written

929
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,990
up your thesis,
you're only one 10th the way to having

930
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:48,720
it published.
And that's something else to think about

931
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:50,340
too.
If you want to be an academic cycle,

932
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:57,800
everything ever do will be rejected.
And not just the middle name,

933
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:01,040
either your work for something once for
six months we'll write your first

934
00:54:01,041 --> 00:54:05,840
research paper and you set it up,
maybe not doing a very good journal and

935
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:07,880
you'll get free reduced back.
And they'll say,

936
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:11,840
this is the stupidest thing I've ever
seen and you might as well quit.

937
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,160
You know,
and that's,

938
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,670
and you'll get those letters throughout
her whole career and you'll say,

939
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:19,960
well this doesn't suck as much as it
could.

940
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:24,030
So to really work hard on it and use
this part of yeah and he would dress

941
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:27,880
these 30 concerns,
then we'll be willing to look at it

942
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,390
again.
But don't get your hopes up.

943
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,420
And that's when you go have,
you know,

944
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,540
a pint at the local bar because that's
the best news you're going to hit this

945
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,060
month.
So that's another thing to think about

946
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:39,920
too,
when you're,

947
00:54:39,921 --> 00:54:42,200
when you're thinking about whether this
tourney careers for you,

948
00:54:42,201 --> 00:54:44,600
because if you're rather high,
you needed the motion,

949
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:48,470
you're going to get punched in the
stomach a lot.

950
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:51,460
And you've got to ask yourself whether
or not you can learn to tolerate that.

951
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:53,620
It's just,
it's just a function of the,

952
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,930
of the business because it's hard to get
published,

953
00:54:56,931 --> 00:54:58,280
you know,
the rejection rate to do the

954
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,900
journalist's 95 to 99% which is worse
than your application.

955
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,080
You know,
your chances of getting accepted to

956
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,670
graduate school.
So just looking for reasons not to

957
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,800
promise your damn paper.
And it can be,

958
00:55:09,801 --> 00:55:11,660
because there's a mistaken,
I might give you guys,

959
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:13,480
it's too good,
you don't want,

960
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,340
and it scares people and there were
political reasons or whatever,

961
00:55:16,341 --> 00:55:19,870
but there's a lot of rejection and
that's true for most of,

962
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,610
so you have to get used to that.
But in academia,

963
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,970
I think in some ways it's works because
you're always trying to publish in.

964
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,850
The answer is always,
we don't want your stupid paper.

965
00:55:28,851 --> 00:55:30,080
We've got $100 ones.

966
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:35,730
So I guess you could use
research and teaching,

967
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,380
um,
uh,

968
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:48,290
want to widen.
The psychologist might choose to work

969
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,430
faster rather than full time.

970
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,073
Well,
okay,

971
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,530
well,
so one of the answers to that is why you

972
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:58,810
would ever want to be a professor.
Okay?

973
00:55:58,811 --> 00:56:01,240
So here's why you might want to be
professor.

974
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:06,160
One of the things you might watch at
home yourself want to see when you're

975
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:11,161
talking with other people does your,
is your tendency to turn the

976
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:15,540
conversation to ideas.
That means you're open.

977
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:16,840
That's a trait.
Openness.

978
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,020
If you tend to turn the conversation to
ideas,

979
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,870
then you're yearning.
You're already,

980
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:24,070
you're

981
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,860
old.
That that's a good reason to be a

982
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:31,850
professor.
You don't know if your mom can you talk

983
00:56:31,851 --> 00:56:34,570
to your friends and want you use most of
the time to talk about people are

984
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,610
meaning what he did last night here.
Those are fine.

985
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,250
Those are cross probably needs more than
you're extroverted or maybe you talk

986
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:41,950
about relationships and that means more
than that.

987
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:45,370
You were agreeable.
That's not really the kind of

988
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,290
temperament that is suited for an
intellectual pursuit because it's about

989
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,720
ideas fundamentally.
And then you also have to ask some,

990
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,270
what would you like to teach?
And teaching is teaching is brutal for

991
00:56:58,271 --> 00:56:59,760
people who don't want light.
I mean,

992
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,720
you know,
you have professors like this,

993
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,020
a standing in front of the board,
they look down,

994
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,660
they mumble,
you're so bloody terrified at the

995
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:08,950
students.
They won't even look at them.

996
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:11,020
And everyone there is like checking
facebook.

997
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,370
It's all off.
So you know,

998
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:16,420
if you're,
if you don't like to engage in audience,

999
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,260
you're going to spend the most
exhausting part of your career teaching

1000
00:57:20,261 --> 00:57:24,040
because teaching,
teaching writing is very exhausting.

1001
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:26,860
So there's three clinical work,
but right up there it was teaching

1002
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:31,090
because I lectures of performance,
it takes a tremendous amount of energy

1003
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:34,840
and who has to do with my role pins and
it's boring.

1004
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,030
But otherwise it's like spontaneous jazz
for 90 minutes.

1005
00:57:40,031 --> 00:57:43,270
It's very tiring.
And when I teach three courses in the

1006
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,680
spring,
I'm just flooded by mark and I got a lot

1007
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:48,240
of energy.
So you,

1008
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:52,080
you also have to decide if you want that
and then you'd have to just start.

1009
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,770
Do you like mentoring students?
Graduate Students.

1010
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,610
So I read it,
I got training,

1011
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:00,490
I read it like I need a second.
I really liked mentoring graduate

1012
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:02,320
students.
So it would be university professors.

1013
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,470
Perfect for me.
I got used to being rejected.

1014
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,900
The paper's being rejected.
I learned how to deal with that in about

1015
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,300
three or four years.
He used to just piss me off.

1016
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,290
I'd be naturally three months after or
you don't have to get the envelope.

1017
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,100
I open it cause he know what it says.
It says up here,

1018
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,990
but you're learning off.
Take that personally because it's not a

1019
00:58:24,991 --> 00:58:29,991
person and just hate everybody.
So if you learn to tolerate,

1020
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,250
that's good.
Now you ask me why he would be a

1021
00:58:34,251 --> 00:58:36,370
clinical psychologist as well as the
professor.

1022
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:45,910
That depends to some degree on what kind
of breadth of experience you were in

1023
00:58:46,191 --> 00:58:47,750
corn towards.
So

1024
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:50,723
okay.

1025
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,870
For me,
life is better if I'm doing a lot of

1026
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:57,110
different things.
And so being a clinician,

1027
00:58:57,111 --> 00:58:58,670
I do,
I'm a clinician,

1028
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:04,330
I do consulting with businesses.
I'm a professor and I run a little

1029
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,600
testing company that evaluates
employees.

1030
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,670
I have other,
I am not been jobs.

1031
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:14,530
I think I have seven jobs.
That's what I figured at one point it

1032
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:19,100
fluctuates between five and seven.
And the reason I do that because I

1033
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:24,050
learned how to do flat out all the time,
it turns out I'm kind of wired for that.

1034
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:27,380
So it's better for me.
That's better.

1035
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,230
Um,
I'm loved doing clinical work.

1036
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:34,550
It's sometimes people wonder too how you
can do it because you say more people

1037
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,350
bring their problems to you all the
time.

1038
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:41,351
Right.
But it like that because social work is

1039
00:59:41,371 --> 00:59:42,980
like that,
I think.

1040
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:46,530
I think you're insane to be a social
worker if they do with thinking about

1041
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:52,420
all the jobs that we'll just hammer you
to death over a five year period that

1042
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:54,290
I'm teaching junior high school kids.

1043
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,480
But see,
the thing about being a clinical

1044
00:59:59,481 --> 01:00:01,850
psychologist is the people who come to
do you have problems.

1045
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:05,090
But they don't want to happen.
That's why they're coming to see it

1046
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:07,070
when,
so what you're doing isn't dealing with

1047
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:09,860
people who have promised.
You're dealing with people who want you

1048
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:13,820
to get rid of their problems.
And so the trajectory is up hill and it

1049
01:00:13,821 --> 01:00:16,850
doesn't really matter how bad the curves
situation because if there's hope in the

1050
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:17,631
future,
right,

1051
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:19,740
because you're oriented toward the
future.

1052
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:23,600
And so if you're working with your
clients and they want to have better

1053
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:26,960
lives and you're helping them do that,
that's

1054
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:33,520
it's a fine thing to do.
It's a great thing to be able to do

1055
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:42,250
pursue the professorships instead of
full time clinician work because grab

1056
01:00:43,491 --> 01:00:45,220
her,
secure them that way.

1057
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,400
It depends on the Grad program.
So there's two kinds of,

1058
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,880
there's actually three kinds of clinical
graduate programs,

1059
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,530
the graduate programs that are
characteristic of large research

1060
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:02,700
institutions.
So say like Miguel and Miguel is mostly

1061
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:07,701
a scientific institute institution with
a side Bar of clinical training.

1062
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:11,450
And most research institutions are like
that.

1063
01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:14,340
And so most APA approved,
that's how it used to be.

1064
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,810
Anyways,
APA approved.

1065
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:20,811
American psychological association group
of programs tend to be research oriented

1066
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,110
and they provide technical training.
So what they expect of you if you're a

1067
01:01:25,111 --> 01:01:27,720
student,
there has to be a scientist and to be

1068
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:31,530
trained as a clinician.
Now also Seidi programs,

1069
01:01:31,531 --> 01:01:36,030
they're more common in the U s they'll
charge about $40,000 a year annual

1070
01:01:36,031 --> 01:01:40,410
training basically just as a clinician.
And then there are clinical programs

1071
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:43,490
that are doing major research
institutions but are still stealing

1072
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:47,820
public universities where most of the
emphasis is on clinical training and

1073
01:01:47,821 --> 01:01:49,650
classes on experimental work.

1074
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:54,830
And they're usually not designed to Iran
on geared out producing academics who

1075
01:01:54,831 --> 01:01:57,900
could trade clinical psychologists,
which is what the big research

1076
01:01:57,901 --> 01:01:59,490
universities are for.
And yeah,

1077
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,620
often when you go there,
we deal,

1078
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,470
if you were a successful clinical
student,

1079
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,110
he became a professor.
It was the unsuccessful clinic as

1080
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:11,280
students who became a clinical
psychologist and you know,

1081
01:02:11,281 --> 01:02:13,110
you could say,
well that's because that was all they

1082
01:02:13,111 --> 01:02:13,841
can do.
Now.

1083
01:02:13,841 --> 01:02:18,570
That's a cynical way of looking at it.
In some ways it's true because to be a

1084
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:21,620
professor,
a research institute like the Ot and the

1085
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:24,570
clinical psychologist,
you have to be able to be a scientist

1086
01:02:24,571 --> 01:02:25,404
and,
and,

1087
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,690
and to do everything that's associated
with that.

1088
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,400
So it's,
so it's,

1089
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:34,980
it's a good option if you can pull it
off because you have all the stability

1090
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:38,090
that he was alone with my in there in
university plus you have old

1091
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:41,540
undergraduates and you know,
if you'd like them to graduates,

1092
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,520
if you don't like undergraduates here,
you don't like people,

1093
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,840
you know,
cause I mean undergraduate,

1094
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,960
they're all shiny and clean and you
know,

1095
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,080
they're all happy about their futures
and they're all probably going to be

1096
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:52,190
reasonably successful.

1097
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,840
It cannot be able to undergraduates,
you might as well go big old crime until

1098
01:02:55,841 --> 01:02:58,000
you,
because that's about as good as it gets

1099
01:02:58,001 --> 01:03:00,190
among human beings,
you know?

1100
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:03,360
So anyway,
so if you're a professor,

1101
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,800
you get to stay in the happy meal.
You and then,

1102
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,110
you know,
I do my clinical work in my consulting

1103
01:03:08,111 --> 01:03:10,060
work as well.
So it's sort of like the best of both

1104
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:12,190
worlds.
But there's a lot of,

1105
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,790
there's a lot of preparation that goes
into doing all those things.

1106
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,330
So for example,
you have to do,

1107
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,440
I think I had been 2000 hours of
supervised practice when I came back to

1108
01:03:23,441 --> 01:03:27,700
Ontario after I was in Massachusetts,
even though I was licensed in

1109
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:29,630
Massachusetts.
So there's,

1110
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,740
if it takes quite a bit of work to keep
your,

1111
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,440
cause just after you get your clinical
phd,

1112
01:03:35,441 --> 01:03:36,910
you,
you don't have a psychologist yet,

1113
01:03:36,911 --> 01:03:41,350
you have to do another 2000 hours of
supervised practice.

1114
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,550
And to do that as well as to do what you
need to do in order to pursue an

1115
01:03:45,551 --> 01:03:49,430
academic career means,
you know,

1116
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,580
you're,
you better be efficient.

1117
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,790
So other questions?

1118
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,760
Yup.

1119
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,250
Is that a good play everyone?
Basically.

1120
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,670
Um,
I've heard from a lot of people that you

1121
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:09,671
should look for supervisors who are
working on areas that Uri and the cat

1122
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:14,210
straight a's in 98% do whatever you
want.

1123
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:19,370
If you don't apply everywhere.
And I would say even if you do apply

1124
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:21,090
everywhere,
can almost say no.

1125
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:24,860
You know what a delightful deal you
applied 40 places,

1126
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,050
let's say,
or 30 places for it realistically.

1127
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:31,580
And four people give you an offer and
you fly out there and they try to tell

1128
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:33,790
you how wonderful you are and try to get
you to come in.

1129
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,370
You get to say no to three of them and
pick the best one that's deal.

1130
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:40,190
So that's what you want to set yourself
up.

1131
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,370
So,
and you know if you,

1132
01:04:42,371 --> 01:04:45,850
if you really know what you want,
which is doubtful,

1133
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:50,040
but maybe you do because sometimes
people do and you can specify who you'd

1134
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,060
like to work with and they're interested
in.

1135
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:53,680
You can target it that carefully.
Hey,

1136
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:57,400
more power to you.
But that's very rare and for most people

1137
01:04:57,401 --> 01:04:59,260
is,
it's not a good strategy.

1138
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,960
Look,
I've had lots of students

1139
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,860
asking you about how to get into,
well let's say specifically clinicals,

1140
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,830
graduate school,
and I say applied in lots of places.

1141
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:12,440
Then they don't they,
why do you wait for places and their

1142
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:14,610
threshold students and they don't get
here?

1143
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:16,430
Well that's pretty rough.
You know,

1144
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:18,130
they languished a year,
sometimes

1145
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,640
two years as they try again.
Usually by the second year of not giving

1146
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:23,830
him,
then they listen and apply.

1147
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,360
It's 30 places and then they get it and
then they think juicing will fire them.

1148
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:30,830
That the first year I would have been,
you know,

1149
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,250
waiting at the local bar for two years
while I was trying to get into graduate

1150
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:38,440
school.
So if if,

1151
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,060
if you're 100% credible and you've got
the inside track,

1152
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,550
you know there's normal rules don't
apply to you,

1153
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:48,550
then that's fine.
But it's a numbers game.

1154
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,890
And with most things that are low
profitability,

1155
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,370
the way you maximize your chances of
success has to do with the law.

1156
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,370
As you know,
if you have a one in 10 chance of

1157
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,950
getting into somewhere and you apply to
20 places,

1158
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,430
you know you're probably going to get
into to.

1159
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:07,710
But if you play eight places,
you might get unlucky and get it.

1160
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:08,573
They're not

1161
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:09,893
so

1162
01:06:11,830 --> 01:06:14,570
not here,
not at St George Scarborough,

1163
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:17,690
possibly they're working on,
but it's hard to set up a clinical

1164
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,160
program.
You need a lot of medical faculty and

1165
01:06:20,161 --> 01:06:23,100
you need to be tied in with hospitals.
It's a multi year process.

1166
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:27,750
So not this foreseeable future,
but your classical clinical program,

1167
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,160
Ryerson hasn't been program.

1168
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:30,133
No.

1169
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,500
Is there a clinical program or noisy or
counseling

1170
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:40,330
is plentiful.
Yeah.

1171
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,520
Other questions?
Yeah.

1172
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,630
Change from advising students for quite
a psychology,

1173
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,600
it's easier to like if you're,
it's easier to get into graduate school

1174
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,600
if it's not clinically.
How does that mean?

1175
01:06:56,601 --> 01:06:58,820
It's easy.
It's still hard,

1176
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:01,250
but it's not an impossible like it is
with clinical.

1177
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:05,240
Um,
the problem with that is that although

1178
01:07:05,241 --> 01:07:06,580
it's,
you know,

1179
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:10,320
it's moderately difficult we'll say,
or even extremely difficult to get him

1180
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:15,321
into an experimental program period.
The problem is is that when the

1181
01:07:15,891 --> 01:07:20,891
difficulty comes a little later,
the difficulty then becomes getting a

1182
01:07:20,961 --> 01:07:25,961
job because it's just as hard to get a
job as a social psychologist as it is to

1183
01:07:28,251 --> 01:07:32,060
get a job as any other,
I mean an academic job as any other

1184
01:07:32,061 --> 01:07:35,930
kinds of psychologists.
So the entry barrier for graduate school

1185
01:07:35,931 --> 01:07:39,860
is less at the entrance barrier into the
job market might even be higher.

1186
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,430
So and so what you have to do is all
you're doing and group,

1187
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:44,840
we've got it.

1188
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,710
This is something to remember.
You are not going to graduate school for

1189
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:52,190
the classes.
What do you want to do is barely packs

1190
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,690
because otherwise you're working too
much on the classes because the classes

1191
01:07:56,691 --> 01:08:00,110
are useless there.
You're not going to learn a damn thing

1192
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,330
and all they do is take you away from
what you should be doing.

1193
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:05,810
And what you shouldn't be doing is
publishing papers cause that's all that

1194
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:08,360
matters.
If you publish it on papers,

1195
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:13,810
you'll get a job assuming that you know
you're not flawed in some remark,

1196
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,970
obvious other way.
So,

1197
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,720
so that you've got to remember that when
you go to graduate school.

1198
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:23,900
So if you pass and graduate course you
get a name.

1199
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,290
That's how graduate courses work.
Anything other than the name is that

1200
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,500
failure.
So there's a bunch of complicated

1201
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:33,830
reasons for that.
To pass the graduate class,

1202
01:08:33,831 --> 01:08:36,200
you'd have to do a decent job there.

1203
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:41,220
They're easier than undergraduate costs,
but they don't matter.

1204
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:44,510
You have to pass them because if you
don't know picky on the program,

1205
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,340
but if you passed them,
it's irrelevant.

1206
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:47,990
No one cares.
No one's ever going to look at your

1207
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:52,940
planning graduate transcript for grades
except for maybe the grant.

1208
01:08:52,941 --> 01:08:55,860
You know the,
the fellowship granting agency,

1209
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:58,850
so that's the money exception,
but if you pass the course,

1210
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:01,600
you get an a anyways.
The reason you get a's if you passed the

1211
01:09:01,601 --> 01:09:04,310
courses,
because if you don't get a,

1212
01:09:05,150 --> 01:09:09,020
let's say I give 30% of my graduate
students these,

1213
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,680
then they don't get graduate fellowships
because the graduate fellowship programs

1214
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:16,310
will only get a graduate fellowships to
students who have aids.

1215
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:20,780
So the way the university is to to that
is you get a's if you pass,

1216
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:23,820
otherwise you fail.
So you have to work hard enough to get

1217
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:25,220
ready for the course to pass.

1218
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,180
Have you done that?
Then you have to work really hard to get

1219
01:09:29,181 --> 01:09:31,990
your down publications zone because
that's,

1220
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,840
that's what will be them,
how hot a prospect you are when you

1221
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:39,950
graduate and you want to be in social
psychology.

1222
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,210
Each year was going to be five or six
strategies in North America.

1223
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,520
Everyone wants,
so there the guys on the tail here and

1224
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:53,420
then there's everyone else and everyone
else has a hell of a time.

1225
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,240
It was top five students or six
students.

1226
01:09:56,241 --> 01:09:59,030
They have their pick of jobs.
That's where you want to be.

1227
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:03,530
And to do that you need to publish.
The bar keeps going up because he gets,

1228
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:06,380
even though it's hard to publish because
people tell,

1229
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:10,790
you know computers have made the process
more straightforward,

1230
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,970
right?
It's the journals are right at your

1231
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,860
fingertips.
You don't have to spend a day looking

1232
01:10:15,861 --> 01:10:19,480
for each journal like you did when I was
a graduate student and then the journal

1233
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,280
wouldn't be there anyways cause you can
get them instantly and you can do your

1234
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:24,420
stats on your lap car.

1235
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:29,830
Whereas I had to use a mainframe in 1985
and I tell you manage for that nate name

1236
01:10:29,861 --> 01:10:32,390
for it.
And I used a computer,

1237
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:36,710
you know anything about statistics.
The manual was as long as this table was

1238
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:40,520
one book on metal rods,
that law,

1239
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:45,710
so like to do an a Nova was a nightmare
having just done so.

1240
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:49,640
So some of the barriers to publication
number of followup,

1241
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:53,310
but the consequences of that as the talk
students published form says learning

1242
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:54,860
easier.
You just,

1243
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:59,840
you have to spend the exactly the same
amount of times you would have before

1244
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:02,060
except now even though it's hard,
but you're going to,

1245
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:06,760
you're going to need 10 to 12
publications and a couple of book

1246
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,390
chapters.
Most of those should be first offer.

1247
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:12,380
You should be the first offer on five or
six of those papers and two of them

1248
01:11:12,381 --> 01:11:14,370
should be in picture and then you're
set.

1249
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,940
But I'll tell you,
hit that you better do you run it

1250
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,360
because it's,
it's,

1251
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,550
it's not yet by and the students and the
problem with graduate school,

1252
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,080
and this is something else to understand
it,

1253
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,530
people will leave you alone in Grad
school.

1254
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:32,220
And what that means is you can float
around vacating for five years,

1255
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,280
graduate with one publication and
disappeared.

1256
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:40,740
So it's dangerous graduate schools
dangerous that way because no one would

1257
01:11:40,741 --> 01:11:43,830
be on your case to make sure that you're
one of the top students.

1258
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,010
So you have lots of freedom,
but you are also ask yourself,

1259
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:49,470
you know,
do you want for him and Ken and

1260
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:51,870
tolerate.
So do you want,

1261
01:11:51,871 --> 01:11:54,750
well people float drift if they have too
much freedom,

1262
01:11:55,200 --> 01:12:00,030
can you tolerate the questionnaires?
Can you discipline yourself enough to be

1263
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:02,400
successful without someone?
Basically,

1264
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,260
you know,
I'm watching you a big hey you in the

1265
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:05,160
back of the hip.

1266
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,010
And,
and that's a tough question because

1267
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,770
it's not easy to become that future
oriented and that discipline.

1268
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,920
So,
so that's the social sector.

1269
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,710
The other thing I also mentioned about
social psychologist,

1270
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:23,700
learn of your psychometrics,
cause most of the social psychology is

1271
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:26,940
nonsense.
And there's a reason for that.

1272
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,160
The reason is is that social
psychologists don't do all this and that

1273
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,940
very well and they're starting to clamp
down.

1274
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:37,770
Like all the journalists have adopted
the new code of ethics for publications

1275
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:41,880
and reasonably done it because so much
of what particular this polished and

1276
01:12:41,881 --> 01:12:46,120
social psychology is simply not true.
So learner,

1277
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:48,330
psychometrics,
and third year statistics and that will

1278
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:51,960
redo your website and social psych.
There's lots of things to be discovered

1279
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:55,320
in social psychology,
but you have to be hard headed and not

1280
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:56,610
eat after your career.

1281
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:02,170
So
I don't necessarily make sense or

1282
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:04,203
missions.

1283
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,720
How many good,
what percentage of classes have you

1284
01:13:16,721 --> 01:13:18,250
taken in the last few that were good?

1285
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:23,110
Um,
maybe.

1286
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,560
Okay,
so there you go.

1287
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:30,820
It's worse in graduate school.
So 90% of the time in classes will be a

1288
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:32,950
waste.
Do you want to learn to be a clinician?

1289
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:34,960
You could start now.
We,

1290
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:35,980
Carl Rogers,
we,

1291
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:36,910
Abraham,
NASA,

1292
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,950
we,
Carl Young reading Sigmund Freud.

1293
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,620
If there's lots of great clinicians,
read them,

1294
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:44,020
read them.
That'll help a lot

1295
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,290
isn't that,
doesn't that mean that the system is

1296
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,700
flawed?
Because yes,

1297
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:52,110
all systems are flawed.
Most of them are like really flawed

1298
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,670
systems are murderers.
If you're in a system and it's not

1299
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:56,950
stopping you to death,
it's actually working.

1300
01:13:56,951 --> 01:13:57,784
Not too bad.

1301
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:02,850
If you were supposed to be smart,
they are so wise.

1302
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:05,580
One,

1303
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:08,610
well,
I remember earlier in the lecture I

1304
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,560
thought we talk to you about businesses
right?

1305
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:11,980
I said,
business is run

1306
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,070
on a 5% profit margin.
That means they spin it.

1307
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:18,370
And that's an efficient business because
most businesses fail.

1308
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:23,670
So really well run businesses produce 5%
profit year after year.

1309
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,870
That means they spend 95% of their time
just existed.

1310
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,590
And that's how systems work.
System Spin,

1311
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,700
good system spend.
Only 95% of their time existed.

1312
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:40,630
Bad system spend about 125% of their
time existed,

1313
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,650
which means that not only do they not
produce anything of any value,

1314
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:48,230
a sock resources from other things that
are producing things about.

1315
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,370
And so really look,
it's really important.

1316
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:54,910
I know you're skeptical about this,
but that's because you don't know what

1317
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:57,010
you're talking about and you should
listen to me.

1318
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:02,290
Most systems don't work and a lot of
them are murderers.

1319
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,000
And so if you go off to graduate school,
it's not appointing hard cause you're

1320
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:09,130
not this.
No you're not.

1321
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:10,613
Yeah.
Well

1322
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,260
that's what you,
okay.

1323
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,123
Another question.

1324
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,120
What would you recommend to take the
gre?

1325
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:31,520
Most people usually take it say in the
summer before they start two o'clock and

1326
01:15:31,831 --> 01:15:35,730
that's probably vote right because I
wouldn't push it too close to when you

1327
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:40,620
applaud because it's just the
application process is stressful and you

1328
01:15:40,621 --> 01:15:42,810
probably would want to clutter that was
up much.

1329
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:48,330
I would also say
people do a lot of study for the gre.

1330
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:52,110
It's north at all.
Do you want like the one thing you can

1331
01:15:52,111 --> 01:15:56,440
study for is the psychology of Uri and
the best way to do now sprawling

1332
01:15:56,470 --> 01:16:01,470
breeding introductory textbook or two.
But I wouldn't kill yourself spending

1333
01:16:02,191 --> 01:16:06,300
for the dra because it's not going to
help that much.

1334
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,760
So part of it because it's like the
vocabulary that said

1335
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:16,770
if build up your vocabulary over rated
to 25,000 hours of studying,

1336
01:16:17,310 --> 01:16:18,780
add another hundred hours for that

1337
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:22,370
strong.
So

1338
01:16:24,450 --> 01:16:27,510
during the summer,
maybe early fall and then you probably

1339
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:31,680
have to apply from November to January.
So anyways,

1340
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:34,790
back to your question.
If you want to,

1341
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:36,360
what do you have to do with the
university?

1342
01:16:36,361 --> 01:16:40,170
And this is what you have to do.
Graduate School as well is what the

1343
01:16:40,171 --> 01:16:43,770
institution does.
Is it opens up the space of identity and

1344
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:46,080
the identity is you're a graduate
student.

1345
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:47,850
Okay,
what does that mean?

1346
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,820
Well,
it means any number of things.

1347
01:16:50,821 --> 01:16:53,160
It means you can language for five years
if you want.

1348
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:57,150
But what it does mean is now you have a
stamp of approval on your forehead.

1349
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:02,370
And so you sit around and read and learn
things and you don't have to worry about

1350
01:17:02,371 --> 01:17:06,750
whether or not you're useful because
everyone has said by all of the possible

1351
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:10,170
measurement you appear to be useful.
So that means you can get to have the

1352
01:17:10,171 --> 01:17:11,570
luxury and educating yourself.

1353
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:15,470
Now you can go off to the institution
and 90% of the courses won't be

1354
01:17:15,471 --> 01:17:17,660
worthwhile just like they are hammering
institution.

1355
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:20,180
But some of them will be really
worthwhile.

1356
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:23,780
And so your job is to discriminate
between the things that are worthwhile.

1357
01:17:23,781 --> 01:17:28,550
I'm the thing is the dark and to really
focus on where you can get educated and

1358
01:17:28,551 --> 01:17:30,470
there's lots of places to get educated.
So,

1359
01:17:30,471 --> 01:17:33,960
for example,
you'll have your placements and you'll

1360
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:38,420
have clients and you'll learn I,
that's an opportunity right there to

1361
01:17:38,421 --> 01:17:40,250
learn because that would be the real
thing.

1362
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,300
And you will need people who know what
they're talking about and you want to

1363
01:17:44,301 --> 01:17:46,770
stick to them like glue because they'll
teach you fixed.

1364
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:50,960
But,
and it's okay that systems don't work

1365
01:17:50,961 --> 01:17:55,070
very well because they have to spend
most of their time just existed because

1366
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,880
they're complicated things,
you know?

1367
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:01,040
So
the reason I use the business example is

1368
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,700
because businesses pay a big price for
inefficiency.

1369
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:07,160
They just do was dive into the ground
and disappeared.

1370
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:12,400
And so if even a business can only
manage 5% genuine productivity,

1371
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:18,240
that keeps you a rule of thumb against
what she should judge institutions in

1372
01:18:18,651 --> 01:18:21,140
general,
it's hard to make something work.

1373
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:24,110
And when you look around the world,
most countries don't work.

1374
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:28,150
Most governmental systems don't work and
a lot of them get so out of control that

1375
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:31,640
they killed him.
So what you hope for you hope you can

1376
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:36,590
get into somewhere that has possibility,
opens up a space for you to do what you

1377
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:38,630
can do.
If you're disciplined and ready to go up

1378
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:41,610
and that's good enough.
And so the classes,

1379
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,490
moderate classes,
they're not going to be worthwhile.

1380
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,900
That's okay.
You put in as much effort as you need

1381
01:18:45,901 --> 01:18:49,550
you to pass them and you pay attention
to the things outside of that where

1382
01:18:49,551 --> 01:18:50,540
you're actually learning.

1383
01:18:51,550 --> 01:18:52,383
Awesome.

1384
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,980
Well it depends on the institution that
you go to.

1385
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:01,340
Like if you go into a psy d program,
which is just professional training,

1386
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,980
they won't care if you published.
They're not trying to produce people who

1387
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:07,250
are scientists.
The idea with the ADA programs is that

1388
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:11,570
you cannot be a good clinician unless
you're a scientist and there's some real

1389
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:14,870
truth and that's what the issue is
really hurt people.

1390
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:17,210
Thank you.
Didn't mess up someone's memory.

1391
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:19,610
No trouble.
If you're a foolish clinician,

1392
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:25,240
you can cause a lot of misery and grief
because people especially confused in

1393
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:28,610
vain people,
they'll open themselves up to you and

1394
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:32,430
you can that and whatever.
Oh Kevin,

1395
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:37,190
biases and lack of clarity you bring to
the situation has every possibility of

1396
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:39,560
making things worse for them.
So,

1397
01:19:39,561 --> 01:19:42,820
so the big research institutions,
they want to train the thing

1398
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:44,560
critically and

1399
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,460
as a critical thinker is someone who's
good at getting rid of what isn't

1400
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:53,770
necessary and keeping what is,
you know,

1401
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:55,860
often when you think of critical
thinking,

1402
01:19:55,861 --> 01:19:57,730
you think of criticizing things.
You know,

1403
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:00,090
this isn't good at that.
If that isn't the point,

1404
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:03,520
the point is to say,
well that's not as good as this,

1405
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:06,150
so I'll keep this is that it isn't as
good as this.

1406
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,810
It's what you do when you the pain,
you get rid of what's not perfect,

1407
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:12,780
keep the rest.
And that's what you have to do when you

1408
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:15,210
go and get educated.
As a graduate student,

1409
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:19,620
I would say if you want to be a
clinician re the great clinicians,

1410
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:24,810
you'll learn more from them then then
then from anyone else except your

1411
01:20:24,811 --> 01:20:29,811
clients and with your clients.
Best thing to do with them is listened

1412
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:33,600
to them.
And this is something that Carl Rogers,

1413
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,340
that's one good reason to recall.

1414
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:37,860
Well,
one thing that will Carl Rogers is he

1415
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:42,861
really figured out her list and people
love to be listened to because most

1416
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:47,400
people don't have anybody to talk to.
And because they don't have anybody to

1417
01:20:47,401 --> 01:20:49,260
talk to you,
they can't organize their brands.

1418
01:20:49,290 --> 01:20:51,930
Because the way people organize their
brains is by talking.

1419
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,861
You say,
well,

1420
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:55,380
I've got this problem and I don't know
what do about it.

1421
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:56,011
So he said,
well,

1422
01:20:56,011 --> 01:20:57,360
what's,
what's the problem?

1423
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,200
And they said,
oh,

1424
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:00,690
it might be this,
it might be that you might be this,

1425
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:04,290
maybe it's this reminds me of bath.
And it's like they're laying out the

1426
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:05,970
situation on the table.
So we say,

1427
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:07,770
okay,
we keep telling me less laying the whole

1428
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:09,780
problem.
And then they're afraid of that because

1429
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:10,980
they don't want to weigh in the whole
problem.

1430
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,600
So you convinced them,
it's okay,

1431
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:15,810
lay the whole problem,
we'll worry about sorting it afterwards.

1432
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:18,990
So they made the whole problem and then
they look at it and you think,

1433
01:21:18,991 --> 01:21:21,060
oh,
well this isn't really the problem and

1434
01:21:21,061 --> 01:21:22,860
neither is this and this isn't the
problem with it.

1435
01:21:22,861 --> 01:21:27,410
Neither is that this is the parole.
And then it sorta cut down to size right

1436
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,920
off the bat when you might say,
well,

1437
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:31,880
you know,
what do you want to have happen?

1438
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:34,230
So I'm not sure what I want to have
happen.

1439
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:37,900
So they lay all that out and then they
push away what is it necessary.

1440
01:21:37,901 --> 01:21:41,170
Now they have the problem.
Now they'd have what they would like as

1441
01:21:41,171 --> 01:21:42,700
a solution.
And then you say,

1442
01:21:42,701 --> 01:21:44,110
okay,
well you know,

1443
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,950
what steps can we institute little
stamps that you would actually do to

1444
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,650
transform this problem,
you to this solution.

1445
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,130
And that's very entertaining.
It's very useful for people.

1446
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:58,750
And so one of the things you can do
right off the bat is a junior clinician

1447
01:21:58,751 --> 01:22:00,580
is listen to the person.

1448
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:02,530
And if you don't understand what you're
saying,

1449
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,880
just ask them.
Say,

1450
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:05,890
no I don't.
I can get that.

1451
01:22:05,891 --> 01:22:07,480
So I'm clear.
Or maybe you say,

1452
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,300
you just said that,
but 10 minutes ago you said this and

1453
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:13,540
they seem to be opposite.
And I don't understand how those two

1454
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:17,020
things can both be true.
And by doing it any walk them through

1455
01:22:17,021 --> 01:22:19,270
the process,
like your brain is organized at the

1456
01:22:19,271 --> 01:22:24,271
highest level linguistically.
And so if you walked through people

1457
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:28,460
through a process of carefully
articulating their situation in order,

1458
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,480
this is the brain and you can do that as
soon as a pretty junior clinicians as

1459
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:36,280
long as you're,
as long as you're listening.

1460
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:39,170
So yes.
What would she say?

1461
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,790
That's a good question.
Um,

1462
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,910
well I think there's,
there's two things you need to be

1463
01:22:51,911 --> 01:22:56,110
motivated.
Why do you need to have a clear

1464
01:22:56,111 --> 01:23:00,100
conception of what your life could be
like if it was really good.

1465
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:02,530
So I can say if you,
and this is,

1466
01:23:02,531 --> 01:23:05,350
oh by the way,
here's an extra sentence you guys do.

1467
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:06,180
If you do this,

1468
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:10,150
we'll help you with what
you go to this website

1469
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:20,210
and there's four exercises there.
They're writing exercises and if you do,

1470
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:24,320
then I knew that I knew would be like
three times as efficient as you are now.

1471
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:27,830
It's hard.
One exercise I'll ask you,

1472
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:31,070
write an autobiography.
And the other is another exercise,

1473
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:33,980
Alaska,
to do some personality analysis to

1474
01:23:33,981 --> 01:23:36,710
figure out what your faults are and how
you overcome them.

1475
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:38,360
Another one,
the last few to figure out what your

1476
01:23:38,361 --> 01:23:40,790
virtues are,
how you can capitalize on them.

1477
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:44,360
And then the last one asks you to figure
out,

1478
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,760
here's wanted to ask you to do.
Basically it says,

1479
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,590
here's,
you've got to get yourself in the right

1480
01:23:48,591 --> 01:23:50,240
state of mind.
So here's the state of mind.

1481
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:54,560
Imagine that you were taking,
you were charged with taking care of

1482
01:23:54,561 --> 01:23:56,360
yourself.
Okay?

1483
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,140
So now you're someone that you're
supposed to take care of.

1484
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:03,660
I don't care what you think of yourself
because people are [inaudible],

1485
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,310
you know you don't take care of himself
very well.

1486
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,860
Put that aside.
We're going to assume you're going to

1487
01:24:09,861 --> 01:24:12,350
take care of yourself.
So you're going to figure out what would

1488
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:15,650
be best for you,
not what you want or what would make you

1489
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:18,200
happy or any of those things.
What would be best for him.

1490
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:22,940
So you need to have a vision of that.
And you can ask yourself that three to

1491
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:27,170
five years ago I had the best life I
could have.

1492
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,030
What would that be?
Like?

1493
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:34,450
Loneliness or exercise kind of steps you
through that and asks you to think about

1494
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:38,510
people you admire or you think about
your friends and your family and your

1495
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:41,450
career and the way you structured your
life day to day.

1496
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:46,630
And you try to meditate on what that
would be like if it was off demised.

1497
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,190
Okay.
And then,

1498
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:54,190
and then the exercise steps you through
a process of clarifying that.

1499
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:57,770
Okay,
so now that's your little vision of

1500
01:24:57,771 --> 01:25:00,110
habit.
Okay,

1501
01:25:00,111 --> 01:25:03,170
so now you've got that.
You know what your life could be like if

1502
01:25:03,171 --> 01:25:04,640
you were living at brock.
Okay,

1503
01:25:04,641 --> 01:25:07,520
now you need to do the opposite of that,
which this program,

1504
01:25:07,521 --> 01:25:12,260
why do we also asking everybody has a
sense of how they can fall apart.

1505
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:16,850
All you do is look at how you already
have fallen apart and then you multiply

1506
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:21,000
it out and you think of up with people
that you see on the street or that you

1507
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:25,040
and you seen devastated marriages or who
have terrible relationships with your

1508
01:25:25,041 --> 01:25:26,660
family.
And you think,

1509
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:30,920
okay,
what would my life be like if I really

1510
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:34,600
let it fall apart?
And if you meditate on that property,

1511
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:38,600
that should really scary and it's just
hearing the deeply.

1512
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,660
So you should pick,
there's no way I'm doing that.

1513
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,520
What ever happens,
I'm not giving that.

1514
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,870
So then you've got your little happen
and you've got your little hat and you

1515
01:25:50,871 --> 01:25:55,160
know what the difference between,
and then you can start to conceive of

1516
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:57,950
your day to day life in relationship to
those two things.

1517
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:03,610
And you can decide which one you want.
Does he do that proper?

1518
01:26:04,640 --> 01:26:09,140
I get hit.
It's a DD process because if your life

1519
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:14,440
really gets out of control,
not only you are you miserable beyond

1520
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:18,920
comprehension but still perfectly
capable of making it worse,

1521
01:26:19,170 --> 01:26:24,170
you're a little source of community
pathobiology everywhere you go you make

1522
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:27,620
it worse.
And that's how really that really is

1523
01:26:27,621 --> 01:26:30,650
hell.
And I would recommend that state.

1524
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:34,650
I would recommend that you stay as far
away from here as you possibly can.

1525
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:39,380
So you need to know those extremes cause
those are like the extremes of human

1526
01:26:39,381 --> 01:26:42,290
existence.
And you need to know that they exist and

1527
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:46,130
what they are for you.
And then you can construe your existence

1528
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:49,820
in relationship to those two things.
And that can help me feel motivated.

1529
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,853
So

1530
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,440
and in.
So it's good to do it as a meditative

1531
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,440
process.
Making meditatively is different than

1532
01:26:58,441 --> 01:27:02,450
thinking in a directive way cause it's,
so here's a meditative exercises.

1533
01:27:02,451 --> 01:27:04,640
You can try this.
This is a very useful exercise.

1534
01:27:04,641 --> 01:27:07,800
So try this tomorrow morning.
If you do this regular,

1535
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:10,930
you'll change your life and sees it.
It's a simple thing to do.

1536
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:15,950
Technically sit on the edge of your bed
when you wake up and ask yourself like

1537
01:27:16,081 --> 01:27:19,380
you were asking
a friend,

1538
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,950
not someone you knew well,
but some of you,

1539
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:26,550
you have positive feelings towards you.
You'd like for things to go well for

1540
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:31,560
this person.
Ask yourself what you could do to make

1541
01:27:31,741 --> 01:27:36,420
the day progressed in the best possible
manner.

1542
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:40,710
So you ask yourself what you could do to
do that.

1543
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:43,410
And then you ask yourself,
what do you actually would?

1544
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:46,710
And you'll,
you'll get an answer and the answer will

1545
01:27:46,711 --> 01:27:49,680
drift up from the depths of your
unconscious.

1546
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:50,514
You'll say,
well,

1547
01:27:50,670 --> 01:27:53,400
here's things that I've been avoided.
I should have,

1548
01:27:53,401 --> 01:27:54,830
you know,
chip away at those are the event.

1549
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:59,831
And maybe I'd be this little thing
without getting hosanna full about it.

1550
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:06,000
And then tonight my life would be one
10th of 1% better.

1551
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:10,620
Just very much to go to admission for
someone who isn't very disciplined.

1552
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,170
But one 10th of 1% is the law.
No one in a thousand days at one 10th of

1553
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:19,050
1% if no compounding,
it's a hundred percent better.

1554
01:28:20,610 --> 01:28:21,443
So

1555
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:24,520
those things can be motivated.
One of the things,

1556
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,470
one of the things I've learned from my
own research,

1557
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,380
because I do a lot of research and you
can tell Jerry,

1558
01:28:28,381 --> 01:28:32,470
is because it was very interested in why
people were motivated to do terrible

1559
01:28:32,471 --> 01:28:35,860
things to other b.
And the reason they're motivated to do

1560
01:28:35,861 --> 01:28:38,020
terrible things is because they left
their vice fall.

1561
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:40,360
And your life is hard,
right?

1562
01:28:40,361 --> 01:28:43,980
If your wife is basically tragic in its
essence.

1563
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:48,400
And so life is a difficult word.
And if you don't carry that burden

1564
01:28:48,401 --> 01:28:51,160
property,
it will make you resentful and that will

1565
01:28:51,161 --> 01:28:55,000
make you cruel.
And so if you don't want to be resentful

1566
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:57,400
and cruel,
especially if you know what that means,

1567
01:28:58,060 --> 01:29:02,400
then you'll do what you can put yourself
together because you'd be a force for

1568
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:05,790
good rather than evil.
That's a lot better.

1569
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:10,830
It's a lot better.
There's almost no limit to how much

1570
01:29:10,831 --> 01:29:15,630
people can suffer studying to see,
which is also one of the reasons I

1571
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:20,310
really like the clinical psychologist.
I mean being a clinical psychologist

1572
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:25,230
keeps you very much in touch with the
actuality of people's lives and that's

1573
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:29,430
very unbelievably useful and it's so
useful.

1574
01:29:29,431 --> 01:29:34,431
Like I spend 2025 hours a week every
week helping people walk through their

1575
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:41,811
most difficult problems.
You can't imagine doing anything more

1576
01:29:43,261 --> 01:29:47,700
possibly useful for informing you will
come out to straighten out your own

1577
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:48,534
life.

1578
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:50,663
So

1579
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,220
it's worth doing it seriously.
These are just oxes locally.

1580
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:58,450
We've been doing research with the sweep
exercises.

1581
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:02,080
We used the first,
the future offering on a group of

1582
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:04,490
students have Miguel Hooper academically
struggling,

1583
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:07,690
academic probation,
but there are still a smart,

1584
01:30:07,691 --> 01:30:09,640
right,
if you have to add behind the allocated

1585
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,040
to the gill,
but they were failing.

1586
01:30:12,220 --> 01:30:15,750
So we had to go through this program.
We used to have balance control.

1587
01:30:15,850 --> 01:30:19,340
It was a perfect experimental design.
Um,

1588
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:24,600
we raised their grade point average 25%
drop the drop out rate from 30% to zero.

1589
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:28,330
It's a massive change.
Now we've been using the same program,

1590
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:31,510
the future part of this on a bit at a
business school in,

1591
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:35,950
in broader now we've used it on two
consecutive cohorts of 800 incoming

1592
01:30:35,951 --> 01:30:40,420
students and we draw their drop rate
from 50% to 30% and raised their grade

1593
01:30:40,421 --> 01:30:45,421
point average 25% and I mean I've used
the future authoring program regularly

1594
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:48,910
on,
on people like know,

1595
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,460
and also apply it to,
it'll change your life.

1596
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,450
So people very seldom sit down.
First of all,

1597
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:57,160
you have to think through who the hell
you are,

1598
01:30:58,070 --> 01:30:59,140
right?
Where you come from,

1599
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,990
how did it shape you?
And that's really useful thing to do if

1600
01:31:01,991 --> 01:31:04,750
you're going to be a clinician,
it's like psych when else,

1601
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,610
right?
It kind of gives you a sense of who you

1602
01:31:06,611 --> 01:31:09,130
are.
And then you also have to take some time

1603
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,290
to think,
well what do you want from your life?

1604
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:14,110
Like what sort of,
what sort of features do you want to be

1605
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,390
cause human being.
It's an amazing thing.

1606
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,180
You know,
like we can be just the most wretched of

1607
01:31:19,181 --> 01:31:22,510
creatures,
murderous and corrupt beyond belief.

1608
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:24,640
But a person who has their act together
is,

1609
01:31:24,641 --> 01:31:28,510
I'm like a force of nature and that's a
lot better.

1610
01:31:28,511 --> 01:31:30,850
So you might think,
well you want to be a force of nature,

1611
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:32,830
you know,
cause you got the opportunity.

1612
01:31:32,831 --> 01:31:34,810
You guys are smart,
you're young.

1613
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:36,370
I imagine you're,
you're healthy.

1614
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:38,620
And also you can at least manage
university.

1615
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:41,110
It's like what the hell are you waiting
for?

1616
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,600
Hammer yourself together and see what
you can do.

1617
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:48,400
It's worth it.
Make your life way better.

1618
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:52,473
I'm

1619
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:56,840
imagine that would be better.
So if that's what you want,

1620
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:59,373
no,

1621
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:02,040
it's a good thing to do.
So that's,

1622
01:32:02,041 --> 01:32:04,690
that's,
I don't know any other way that people

1623
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:06,520
would take it now.
Sorry.

1624
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:11,610
I give a lot of agencies.
As you step through your life,

1625
01:32:12,410 --> 01:32:15,310
you will see that there are certain
things that sort of call out to you.

1626
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:18,400
You don't have to grab your attention in
voluntarily,

1627
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:24,100
and that's a very interesting thing
because people think that there are sort

1628
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:27,790
of the masters of their own destiny.
You know that you own you.

1629
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:30,130
People often will make that argument
about suicide.

1630
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:31,570
For example,
it's my body.

1631
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:32,950
I can do what I want with it.
It's like,

1632
01:32:32,951 --> 01:32:33,784
well,
no.

1633
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:38,350
Neither of those things happen to be
true and if you act it out and you'll

1634
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:39,620
pay for it,
but the rent,

1635
01:32:39,621 --> 01:32:41,500
there's reasons it's not true.
It's not.

1636
01:32:41,501 --> 01:32:46,420
Some arbitrary idea is that you're
governed by forces that you don't

1637
01:32:46,421 --> 01:32:49,360
understand,
knows of the forces the psychoanalysts

1638
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:50,010
identify.

1639
01:32:50,010 --> 01:32:55,010
It's unconscious and unconscious forces
are the things that make you interested

1640
01:32:56,411 --> 01:32:58,600
in things because you can't control
that.

1641
01:32:58,610 --> 01:33:01,630
You know that if you're reading some
blood boring paper,

1642
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,570
some other person might find that the
most thrilling thing in the world.

1643
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,850
You can't even concentrate on it.
You'd rather do the dishes or you're

1644
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:12,060
thinking about the girlfriend you hadn't
grade age or or something,

1645
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:14,260
your mind wanders,
he can't focus on this.

1646
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:16,390
You say,
well I have to focus on because there's

1647
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:18,430
a testimonial.
So like your unconscious mind,

1648
01:33:18,431 --> 01:33:19,780
he doesn't care.
It's like,

1649
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:23,740
no,
we'll go back into the carpenter or or

1650
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:26,680
clean out underneath cleaning the dust
bunnies out from underneath the bed,

1651
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:30,250
anything but read this paper and then
there'll be another paper that's twice

1652
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:34,360
as difficult and you're compelled by it.
We'll just stick to it like glue and if

1653
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:36,790
you'll remember it right away and you
think,

1654
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:37,690
oh,
why is that?

1655
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:41,260
Why can,
why is the one thing so easy for you to

1656
01:33:41,261 --> 01:33:44,500
get other things so difficult and even
worst whitehead in choose.

1657
01:33:45,310 --> 01:33:47,200
That's a strange thing because you
think,

1658
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:48,700
well if you were in control you just
say,

1659
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:52,240
well I'm going to be interested in this
paper and well good luck with that.

1660
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:55,130
And so it is new.
Decided what we were interested with

1661
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:57,100
that.
Then you go to ask yourself,

1662
01:33:58,030 --> 01:34:01,330
what the hell is it?
And when you start asking yourself that

1663
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:02,980
question,
that's when you start to become a

1664
01:34:02,981 --> 01:34:06,190
clinical psychologist because that's a
hell of a question.

1665
01:34:06,730 --> 01:34:08,470
So anyways,
in terms of motivation,

1666
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:11,290
one of the things you can learn is to
how is,

1667
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:14,290
how to follow those things that compel
you.

1668
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:18,610
And you have to be careful when you're
doing that because you also have to,

1669
01:34:18,850 --> 01:34:22,960
you have to balance that with the
certain degree of honesty because if

1670
01:34:22,961 --> 01:34:27,430
you're dishonest and deceitful video,
corrupt the workings of your neural

1671
01:34:27,431 --> 01:34:31,630
mechanisms and then the light would be
shining from places you don't want it to

1672
01:34:31,631 --> 01:34:34,480
shrink from.
So if you're going to pursue the things

1673
01:34:34,481 --> 01:34:37,120
that compel you,
which you can do,

1674
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:38,830
which I think is a very good thing to
do,

1675
01:34:38,831 --> 01:34:43,320
that's a quest by the way.
You also have to straight yourself only

1676
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:45,640
ethically because otherwise you will end
up taking some,

1677
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,990
some bad terms and you can get
ridiculously motivated if you do that

1678
01:34:49,991 --> 01:34:53,020
because you'll end up living in a world
where everything is so interesting to

1679
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:56,670
you all the time that you can hardly
stand and know

1680
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:02,090
that's a good place to be.
So,

1681
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,670
um,
I was just wondering.

1682
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:17,530
No,
just some degree on what you do with it,

1683
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:21,390
but I think it's a good idea actually.
You know,

1684
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:25,490
and if you could,
if you could make use of the time and so

1685
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:29,900
you have to decide is do you have
something to do with during that year is

1686
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:33,170
productive and that will further your
development that will make you more

1687
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:34,610
mature.
That would be the best thing.

1688
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:39,700
Okay.
If

1689
01:35:43,590 --> 01:35:44,610
you want it to do,

1690
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:50,811
no,
no,

1691
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:53,320
no you don't.
You remember it look like anybody you

1692
01:35:53,321 --> 01:35:57,520
want to work with is going to be
reasonably sensible because unless you

1693
01:35:57,521 --> 01:36:01,570
want to work with someone who isn't and
anybody who's reasonably since sensible

1694
01:36:01,571 --> 01:36:02,510
is going to think,
well you know,

1695
01:36:02,511 --> 01:36:04,960
this person's young,
they should go kick around a little bit.

1696
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:08,830
You know,
maybe one of the problems with a place

1697
01:36:08,831 --> 01:36:10,450
like the University of Toronto for
example,

1698
01:36:10,451 --> 01:36:12,250
is it Lord for the students here like at
home for their home

1699
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:13,960
undergraduate career.
It's like,

1700
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:16,170
well that's not preparation for graduate
school.

1701
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:17,613
You know?
So

1702
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:22,030
if it will foster your independence and
make you more disciplined and broaden

1703
01:36:22,031 --> 01:36:26,520
your experience,
no one with any sense.

1704
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:28,440
It's been a look on that as anything
positive.

1705
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:37,990
Sorry,
say that again.

1706
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:44,750
Well,
if you're going to go to medicine,

1707
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,710
medical school,
you've probably pursue a career in

1708
01:36:46,711 --> 01:36:48,840
psychiatry.
Yeah.

1709
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,470
And the difference between a
psychiatrist and a psychologist is that,

1710
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:57,420
well the psychiatrist is an MD
psychiatrist can and does prescribe

1711
01:36:57,421 --> 01:36:59,640
drugs.
And there's nothing wrong with that,

1712
01:36:59,641 --> 01:37:01,530
by the way,
if you're a clinical psychologist and

1713
01:37:01,531 --> 01:37:04,770
somebody comes to see you when they're
like suicidally depressed,

1714
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:06,840
what do you tell them as well?
You know,

1715
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:09,630
we're not gonna make a lot of progress
and you kind of risks in the next two

1716
01:37:09,631 --> 01:37:11,280
weeks.
So you might want to think about taking

1717
01:37:11,281 --> 01:37:13,610
some antidepressants so you've got no
energy.

1718
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:14,760
Put your life back together.

1719
01:37:15,090 --> 01:37:17,370
All right?
You don't want to be

1720
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:21,110
dogmatic about any of these things.
So,

1721
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:24,510
so drug therapies could be extremely
useful.

1722
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,810
But generally if you,
if you take the medical group,

1723
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:32,960
you become a psychiatrist,
well you can't prescribe directly,

1724
01:37:37,511 --> 01:37:40,260
but that doesn't really matter because
you'll learn enough about

1725
01:37:40,270 --> 01:37:43,150
pharmacotherapy in graduate school.
So I've know what I need with my

1726
01:37:43,151 --> 01:37:44,890
clients.
I just write them a letter to take to

1727
01:37:44,891 --> 01:37:45,724
there.

1728
01:37:46,620 --> 01:37:47,850
Generally the GP,

1729
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,180
so you'll know you'll,
you'll learn what the basic

1730
01:37:52,181 --> 01:37:56,310
antidepressants are.
Those will be drugs you use most often.

1731
01:37:56,570 --> 01:38:00,360
Do you recommend most often because are
they're blogging he affected or most

1732
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:05,810
conditions that involve excess negative
emotion now and then somebody will need

1733
01:38:06,371 --> 01:38:09,460
an antibiotic.
If you're a clinical psychologist with a

1734
01:38:09,461 --> 01:38:11,320
private practice that won't happen very
often.

1735
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,860
So,
um,

1736
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:19,500
medical schools a long haul.
So if you're interested in primarily in

1737
01:38:20,531 --> 01:38:23,980
working with people in a problem solving
capacity,

1738
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,920
it could be the clinical psychology is a
better choice.

1739
01:38:26,921 --> 01:38:28,780
But you know,
you might be medically oriented.

1740
01:38:28,781 --> 01:38:30,900
Lots of people are medically oriented
and if,

1741
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,740
if,
if the more,

1742
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:36,580
if the more physiological element of
care,

1743
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,690
Pos q and medical schools a good option.
Some people do both.

1744
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:43,660
I'm going to talk about that.
That's,

1745
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:45,460
but you know,
some people do both.

1746
01:38:52,410 --> 01:38:53,410
It'd be focusing on,

1747
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,630
you mean for first year of graduate
school?

1748
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:03,360
First year undergraduate.
Well what you should really give it your

1749
01:39:03,431 --> 01:39:05,560
first year as an undergraduate because
you should,

1750
01:39:05,950 --> 01:39:08,350
you should,
you should take a wide variety of

1751
01:39:08,351 --> 01:39:11,800
courses.
You should sort of find out what you

1752
01:39:11,801 --> 01:39:16,150
might be interested in it and you should
learn to learn to work and learn to

1753
01:39:16,151 --> 01:39:19,360
socialize because those things are,
you know,

1754
01:39:19,390 --> 01:39:22,480
the things that make people successful.
So I talked about two of them,

1755
01:39:22,481 --> 01:39:23,980
right?
Intelligence,

1756
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:27,670
conscientiousness,
that's discipline creativities and other

1757
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:29,320
ones.
But that's pretty hard to develop if you

1758
01:39:29,321 --> 01:39:32,200
don't already have one.
But the fourth thing that makes people

1759
01:39:32,201 --> 01:39:34,900
successful across time is Bradford
social network.

1760
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:39,070
And so learning to socialize and to
develop a large connection,

1761
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:42,010
large social connection,
that's unbelievably useful.

1762
01:39:42,011 --> 01:39:44,240
So you should get good at those when
you're in your first year,

1763
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:46,120
you know,
and that statue pretty.

1764
01:39:46,270 --> 01:39:49,300
So if you come out of your first year,
you're still in university,

1765
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:50,141
you got,
you know,

1766
01:39:50,141 --> 01:39:52,670
five courses under your belt,
Doug decently,

1767
01:39:52,671 --> 01:39:56,230
you have a circle of friends.
He started sort of start to establish

1768
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:59,120
what you might be interested in.
Good.

1769
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:00,280
And I was successful.

1770
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,730
What do you think is the time that you
bought to the site?

1771
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,550
Well,
the first thing I would say is it's

1772
01:40:06,551 --> 01:40:08,410
always better to do something than
nothing.

1773
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:14,140
So don't wait around.
And what I mean by that practically is

1774
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:19,540
if you're not sure what to do,
taking casts and do that and do it hard.

1775
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,780
And as you do it,
you'll learn what's good above what

1776
01:40:22,781 --> 01:40:24,880
isn't.
And then in somewhere down the road,

1777
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:27,010
six months to,
and be in a better position to figure

1778
01:40:27,011 --> 01:40:29,320
out what you want.
If you keep doing that,

1779
01:40:29,710 --> 01:40:31,990
sooner or later you'll figure out
exactly what you want.

1780
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:36,700
But don't wait around waiting is you
don't learn anything when you were

1781
01:40:36,701 --> 01:40:39,400
lingual way.
So it's better to go off and try things

1782
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:42,940
and to try too hard because then you
actually inform yourself.

1783
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:45,070
And other than that,
there's no real rule.

1784
01:40:45,071 --> 01:40:50,071
It takes people,
it takes people of varying amounts of

1785
01:40:51,191 --> 01:40:55,060
time to establish an identity.
If don't have a well capitalized on,

1786
01:40:55,061 --> 01:40:58,720
you have to be,
by the time you're 30 you're starting

1787
01:40:58,721 --> 01:41:00,760
to,
it started to not be good.

1788
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:04,930
And if it's really not there were still
by 40

1789
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:10,720
that's really not so good.
So if you're confused,

1790
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:16,200
get some credentials,
you want to have something to show for

1791
01:41:17,951 --> 01:41:21,250
your effort.
But if you pay attention and you focus

1792
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:22,350
and you work hard,
you'll figure it out.

1793
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:22,600
But

1794
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:23,433
wow,

1795
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:25,651
I,
but I,

1796
01:41:25,651 --> 01:41:29,250
but as I said before,
the best thing to do to begin with this,

1797
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:33,480
you want to see,
you may not know this,

1798
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:37,110
but the schools that you attended before
you went to university,

1799
01:41:37,710 --> 01:41:42,390
they were establishing their basic
structure was established in the late 18

1800
01:41:42,391 --> 01:41:47,391
hundreds and they were originally set up
to teach the children and factory

1801
01:41:47,791 --> 01:41:51,750
workers to be factory workers,
their factories.

1802
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:55,650
You can tell just by looking at them,
even this to some degree,

1803
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:58,290
it's still the factory.
It's the wrong model.

1804
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,790
Probably factories is you're not going
to work in a bloody factor.

1805
01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:06,480
You're going to have a career.
And to have occur,

1806
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:09,000
you have to figure out who you want to
be.

1807
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:14,310
And so one of the things you want to be
doing over the next while is getting,

1808
01:42:14,430 --> 01:42:18,600
this is why I have a liberal arts
education is so useful because a liberal

1809
01:42:18,601 --> 01:42:23,601
arts education helps teach you what a
person could be and that's not the same

1810
01:42:24,451 --> 01:42:25,270
as getting a job.

1811
01:42:25,270 --> 01:42:29,640
And the university is not for getting a
job universities for figuring out what

1812
01:42:29,641 --> 01:42:34,530
sort of person you could be.
And so it's also useful to take

1813
01:42:34,531 --> 01:42:37,590
philosophy courses and to take
literature courses and to broaden

1814
01:42:37,591 --> 01:42:42,480
yourself so that you get a a better idea
of what the difference is between a

1815
01:42:42,481 --> 01:42:45,150
great person and the and the trivial
person.

1816
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,460
And then me.
And that's not a very modern idea

1817
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:50,820
because we'd like to think that all
people are the same and that's that's if

1818
01:42:50,821 --> 01:42:52,890
all people aren't the same,
he must have just stopped doing what

1819
01:42:52,891 --> 01:42:56,010
you're doing right now because you're
the as the same as you're ever going to

1820
01:42:56,011 --> 01:42:59,190
get.
If there's differences in quality,

1821
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:03,540
then you should infer what's high
quality and then you should also know

1822
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:06,240
what that is.
And so if your first year you wouldn't

1823
01:43:06,330 --> 01:43:11,240
get helps to to do some thinking and to
be guided by people who the culture of

1824
01:43:11,241 --> 01:43:15,720
recognizes as great thinkers because
they've thought about what it means to

1825
01:43:15,721 --> 01:43:20,610
be human and why that matters.
And then you might as well aim as high

1826
01:43:20,611 --> 01:43:24,480
as you can.
Hae not be a good thing to start sorting

1827
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:26,130
out the first couple of years
university.

1828
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:31,610
So
graduate programs,

1829
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:36,760
I'm not sure I should go straight or
right off for ask as well.

1830
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,200
It doesn't matter.
Masters are useless.

1831
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:43,530
I mean for,
for

1832
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:47,100
most places,
for clinically,

1833
01:43:47,130 --> 01:43:49,770
most places you can't practice with the
master's degree anymore.

1834
01:43:49,771 --> 01:43:53,900
In most programs have the masters.
I think you could still practice in

1835
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:56,360
Elbert radicle bet,
but I'm not even sure about that

1836
01:43:56,420 --> 01:44:00,550
anymore.
For an academic career generally maybe

1837
01:44:00,570 --> 01:44:02,990
depends on why you want to take the
extra education.

1838
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,660
You know,
if you're going to go into business or

1839
01:44:05,661 --> 01:44:08,870
something like that,
a master's degree might help you.

1840
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:15,090
But if you're after the academic career,
it's a phd is you want,

1841
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:18,200
and then it probably doesn't matter
whether you take a program that has a

1842
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:19,950
master's Mphd or just each,

1843
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:28,350
yeah,
yeah.

1844
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:35,750
Um,
what about,

1845
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,701
well,
I'm less,

1846
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:43,010
I'm less informed about those sorts of
status.

1847
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:46,550
So I mean,
as long as you can practice with the

1848
01:44:46,551 --> 01:44:49,220
master's degree,
then that's no problem.

1849
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:54,221
But if you know
that that's a different career path to

1850
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:58,640
be not as sometimes put you in as a
school counselor or something like that,

1851
01:44:58,940 --> 01:45:01,790
and that's perfectly fine.
What the patient choice.

1852
01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:05,370
It's a,
I won't say in some ways it's a,

1853
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,980
it's a more defined in less demanding
life and that can be,

1854
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,020
that can be extremely useful.
You know,

1855
01:45:13,021 --> 01:45:16,760
what an academic career or something or
a career like that.

1856
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:21,560
It's a very,
it's kind of all consuming and that

1857
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:25,430
isn't necessarily for everyone.
It certainly isn't forever.

1858
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:28,160
And it should.
And it should be for everyone.

1859
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,120
You have to be compelled in that
direction.

1860
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:35,260
It be the choice.
I know you'd have to be more specific in

1861
01:45:44,221 --> 01:45:46,110
the question.
I don't know exactly what you're asking.

1862
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:50,153
Right.

1863
01:45:56,310 --> 01:46:00,460
The best of your best bet is to contact
the college and find out what their

1864
01:46:00,461 --> 01:46:05,010
registration.
Good luck with that because their

1865
01:46:05,011 --> 01:46:08,320
registration rules are pretty vague and
it's hard to pin down,

1866
01:46:08,350 --> 01:46:11,680
but that is what you should do to
protect yourself and you should get it

1867
01:46:11,681 --> 01:46:16,540
in writing because it's all on the phone
that that's nothing.

1868
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,590
You need to get it and run it and I
can't really,

1869
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:22,300
I can't really give you any more
specific information than that.

1870
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:31,850
Yeah,
yeah.

1871
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:41,830
I can't tell you a lot about that
because I looked beside the hold.

1872
01:46:41,831 --> 01:46:45,290
The whole side of the street is outside
of the academic street.

1873
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:49,220
They're professional schools.
They're mostly set up in the US.

1874
01:46:49,290 --> 01:46:53,820
They take a large number of students
feeding the acceptance criteria of much

1875
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:57,150
lower,
but the price you paid for that is the

1876
01:46:57,151 --> 01:46:59,070
incredibly high tuition.
It'll,

1877
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:03,780
he'll walk up by $200,000 debt.
Now that might be okay.

1878
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:07,110
You might get to pay that off because
you being included,

1879
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,660
local mission can be relatively
lucrative.

1880
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,650
Typical hourly.
The rate is maybe first beginner is

1881
01:47:13,651 --> 01:47:18,651
maybe to get your practice going and be
perhaps 102 hundred $25 an hour,

1882
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:23,840
and then that can go all the way up to
the $8,300 an hour.

1883
01:47:23,841 --> 01:47:25,110
Oh Ho.
That's uncommon.

1884
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:30,170
One 75 was probably more typical.
And so if you see six clients a day,

1885
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:34,170
let's say five,
that's $1,000 a day.

1886
01:47:34,650 --> 01:47:39,650
So it's about $250,000 a year.
So you can pay off for $200,000 debt

1887
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,090
pretty fast.
But you know,

1888
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:45,090
if you,
if you set up a successful clinical

1889
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:48,800
career afterwards and there is quite a
financial or a clinical psychologist,

1890
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,680
there's no glut on the market,
although people have to pay you

1891
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:55,430
privately or through the insurance
companies because it's not an old hip

1892
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:56,273
service.

1893
01:48:08,230 --> 01:48:10,240
Yeah,
well there's only about 40 large

1894
01:48:10,241 --> 01:48:13,660
research institutions in North America.
You can find them on the web,

1895
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:16,020
they're the ones you already may know
about.

1896
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:21,060
And then there was a sprinkling of
smaller institutions and their emphasis

1897
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:24,040
on research productivity is a lot less,
or they're not,

1898
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:29,170
they're not as competitive.
So you could attend those places to get

1899
01:48:29,171 --> 01:48:33,370
a decent training as a scientific
thinker at the same time that you

1900
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,930
acquire your clinic license.
It's perfectly reasonable thing to do.

1901
01:48:38,740 --> 01:48:42,230
So that's why at the beginning I said,
you know,

1902
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:46,390
I brought them because there's a big
difference.

1903
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:50,170
There's some difference between
universities and the differences on

1904
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:52,090
trivial,
but there was a massive difference

1905
01:48:52,091 --> 01:48:54,210
between being at a university and not
meeting.

1906
01:48:54,220 --> 01:48:56,740
I wasn't at all.
So if you have the

1907
01:48:58,390 --> 01:49:02,920
privilege of being able to choose which
university you're going to go too well,

1908
01:49:02,921 --> 01:49:03,400
great.

1909
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:06,640
But you don't want to sacrifice the
binary choice,

1910
01:49:07,650 --> 01:49:09,400
the pause,
the binary choice just to

1911
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:14,620
fiddle around with the Diet.
Okay,

1912
01:49:14,621 --> 01:49:16,120
so I'm going to close,
I'm sorry,

1913
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:18,290
I'm just going to get a very quick
overview.

1914
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:20,930
So here's what you did do as a
psychologist,

1915
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:25,300
you're that if you're an experimental
psychologist,

1916
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:29,050
generally you're heading for an academic
career.

1917
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:32,980
However,
there are opportunities and research

1918
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:37,720
enterprises outside of that.
So in businesses for example,

1919
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:42,310
also the activity market for a
psychologist is really opening up

1920
01:49:42,311 --> 01:49:46,490
because psychologists are increasingly
being hired at economics departments and

1921
01:49:46,510 --> 01:49:51,510
business.
And as a junior professor at a psych

1922
01:49:51,731 --> 01:49:54,250
department,
you start with the [inaudible] at the

1923
01:49:54,251 --> 01:49:56,920
business school.
Let's start with the selling of up to 50

1924
01:49:57,570 --> 01:50:00,910
so business schools are having
psychologists because they're figuring

1925
01:50:00,911 --> 01:50:02,560
out that we know what we're talking
about.

1926
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:07,210
Whereas Business Phds and economists and
not,

1927
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:10,420
not usually because their models of
human beings are wronged and they don't

1928
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:11,830
know their statistics very well.

1929
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:15,130
So anyways,
the athletic opportunities for

1930
01:50:15,131 --> 01:50:19,390
experiment with a phd or Spanish,
it's a good time to be a psychologist.

1931
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:23,650
So it's relatively hard to get it.
And when you're in,

1932
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:26,710
you better be productive because you
won't be a credible candidate if you're

1933
01:50:26,711 --> 01:50:28,180
not.
So you've got to get disciplined.

1934
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:31,550
On the clinical side,
there's almost nothing more valuable

1935
01:50:31,551 --> 01:50:34,900
than a clinical degree because you can
work as a clinician,

1936
01:50:35,950 --> 01:50:39,730
can work in a hospital,
you can work in academia and you can

1937
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:43,840
work as a consultant or you can do any
combination of those things.

1938
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:47,230
So it's,
you have a vast range of possibilities

1939
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:50,230
open up for you.
If you have a clinical phd,

1940
01:50:50,410 --> 01:50:54,040
it takes a long time.
It's a six year phd and the new few

1941
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:58,330
years of training after that and it's
hard to get in and when you're in it's

1942
01:50:58,331 --> 01:50:59,800
competitive,
then you have to work,

1943
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:04,360
but if you can pull it off,
it sets you up for a vast range of

1944
01:51:04,361 --> 01:51:08,170
possibilities in your future now and
then

1945
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:12,910
to conclude that personally,
if you want to set yourself up for this

1946
01:51:12,911 --> 01:51:17,911
sort of thing,
learn not to waste time because that's

1947
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:21,190
the one thing you can do that sort of
under your control that will make you

1948
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:23,530
more competitive and start to take a
boat.

1949
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,280
They hard about how you want your life
to be and how you don't want it to be

1950
01:51:27,281 --> 01:51:31,030
because that can increase your
motivation to do things properly.

1951
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:35,110
So
all take,

1952
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:37,170
I guess.
Then there's another question that you'd

1953
01:51:37,171 --> 01:51:38,880
like to think that then we should
probably stop.

1954
01:51:38,900 --> 01:51:41,040
So it was,
anybody have a question that hasn't been

1955
01:51:41,060 --> 01:51:42,210
your sds?

1956
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:51,010
No,
it doesn't.

1957
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:56,050
Here's what you have to realize.
It's not your suffering.

1958
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:01,540
You have your own suffering.
Your client is entitled to,

1959
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:06,541
their suffering is part of their like
adding your own misery for theirs is not

1960
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:12,580
going to help them all doesn't muddle up
your thinking and it encroaches on their

1961
01:52:12,581 --> 01:52:15,520
territory.
You're not there to take over their

1962
01:52:15,521 --> 01:52:18,520
version.
You're here to help them attain clarity,

1963
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:20,850
figure out how to lift properly.
And so it's your,

1964
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:26,030
you have an ethical,
it's ethically required to stay detached

1965
01:52:26,351 --> 01:52:29,290
enough so that you're not damaged by the
encounter.

1966
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:32,830
And you'll learn to do that.
Everybody motors to do that.

1967
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,840
In graduate school,
you'd be surprised like,

1968
01:52:34,841 --> 01:52:37,090
cause it get,
it's a perfectly valid question and

1969
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:41,440
everybody wonders,
but you learn how to do that and it's

1970
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:45,200
still called Ollie.
Do you learn how it's the right thing to

1971
01:52:45,201 --> 01:52:46,640
do?
So

1972
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:51,240
one more question.
Yes.

1973
01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:54,610
The question about,
you said some.

1974
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:00,590
So,
um,

1975
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:02,520
how do you know if they're doing that?
Because they

1976
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:09,060
look at your last year,
this only started happening in the last

1977
01:53:09,060 --> 01:53:10,440
couple of years.
Like I had a student last year,

1978
01:53:11,100 --> 01:53:13,030
two years since she didn't get in
anywhere.

1979
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,860
It was she found out that just because
they looked earlier,

1980
01:53:16,861 --> 01:53:19,680
she had a pretty bad two year or two
years.

1981
01:53:19,681 --> 01:53:24,180
Would you be relevant?
Hopefully she'll solve that by applying

1982
01:53:24,181 --> 01:53:25,710
to more places.
But

1983
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:28,380
as the number of applications grow,

1984
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:33,760
then the reason you know the methods by
which people will be dispensed with get

1985
01:53:34,161 --> 01:53:35,930
more general,
I don't think it's reasonable,

1986
01:53:35,931 --> 01:53:39,050
but that's irrelevant.
Reasonable has nothing to do with like

1987
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,510
your best.
And it's just like I said this to apply

1988
01:53:41,511 --> 01:53:44,780
to more places
and if you don't check weight,

1989
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:49,800
if you're a or a minus 80 80th
percentile junior reasonable bob,

1990
01:53:51,050 --> 01:53:53,540
you're recruiting a candidate,
you hit it hard enough,

1991
01:53:53,870 --> 01:53:56,220
you'll probably find a place to go.
Yeah.

1992
01:53:57,260 --> 01:53:58,380
In the last two years.
Yup.

1993
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:01,180
Yup.
So that's still all right.

1994
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:06,960
So
[inaudible]

1995
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:16,190
thank you.
On behalf of anyone

1996
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:26,900
[inaudible] I said yes,
you may or may not know this,

1997
01:54:32,101 --> 01:54:34,990
but the faculty and the student faculty
ratio of university

1998
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:41,500
campuses for
that is outrageous and you guys put up.

1999
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:48,750
So one of the things you might consider
doing is not putting up some letters to

2000
01:54:48,751 --> 01:54:53,260
the dean about the fact that you're a
450 of you to be shocked.

2001
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:56,880
Me Number
five gram.

2002
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:03,170
Okay,
so 407,000 so you pay $3 million in

2003
01:55:06,430 --> 01:55:09,100
tuition for each professor.
Nam Salary,

2004
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:15,710
50,000 got some
overhead is 300,000 you paid 10 times as

2005
01:55:17,521 --> 01:55:20,330
much as you should.
Her factory seller,

2006
01:55:20,700 --> 01:55:25,110
you're getting screwed and the reason
you're getting screwed as because he put

2007
01:55:25,111 --> 01:55:29,460
up and it's really not good because one
of the things that would help you

2008
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:34,710
progress through your academic career as
a psychologist property is if you could

2009
01:55:34,711 --> 01:55:38,480
actually get access to a professor now
and then I'm talking about things.

2010
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:42,390
So I would highly recommend it to do
this with the PSA.

2011
01:55:43,290 --> 01:55:44,010
Do something

2012
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:49,010
about you're getting ripped off,
there's no excuse for hundreds of one is

2013
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:54,411
appalling.
It's 51 is a decent 451 your subsidized

2014
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:58,620
the whole bloody university and there's
no excuse for it.

2015
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:01,950
And he like,
he doesn't bother me because I just

2016
01:56:01,951 --> 01:56:03,900
don't talk to students.
Right.

2017
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:07,620
Because I have a certain amount of time
and I'll talk to as many students as I

2018
01:56:07,621 --> 01:56:10,100
can and pass that I didn't talk to
students cause I can't.

2019
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:15,410
So it isn't bothering me except that
you what?

2020
01:56:16,591 --> 01:56:19,590
You should do something about it.
This is no excuse for it.

2021
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:22,960
And unless you pushed on university,
they will know what I'm doing.

2022
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:28,020
So when you're paying 3 million bucks
per professor just hired here,

2023
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:31,680
we only know English professors,
but it's not good.

2024
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:35,160
It's like it's the worst faculty,
