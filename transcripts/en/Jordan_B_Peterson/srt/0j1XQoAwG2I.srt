1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,603
So I'm going to talk to you today about 
a different way of looking at what real 

2
00:00:16,411 --> 00:00:19,600
is.
It's not easy to figure out what real is

3
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,434
because we don't really have infinite 
knowledge and so we're always making 

4
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,961
some sets of presuppositions about 
what's most real and really matters what

5
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:32,830
you assume is most real because you base
the decisions that you make that run the

6
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,320
entire course of your life on those 
assumptions,

7
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:36,154
whether you recognize it or not,
and if you get the assumptions wrong or 

8
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:45,190
even if you leave them in complete,
you're going to pay a big price for it.

9
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,463
And,
uh,

10
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,500
the assumptions that we use in our 
culture,

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,290
although they've enabled us to develop a
tremendously potent technology,

12
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,620
are incomplete in ways that have also 
cost us in,

13
00:00:59,621 --> 00:01:04,621
that are extremely dangerous.
Since the scientific age began.

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,663
We've lived in a universe where the 
bottom strata of reality is considered 

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,800
to be something that's dead like dirt.

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,220
It's like it's matter,
it's objective,

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,970
it's
external,

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,553
and there isn't any element of it that 
lends any reality to phenomena like 

19
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,194
meaning or purpose.
That's all been relegated to this 

20
00:01:37,781 --> 00:01:40,510
objective.
And in some ways to the illusory,

21
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,363
but it's by no means self evident that 
that set of presuppositions is correct 

22
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,683
because we lack infinite knowledge and 
there's many things about the structure 

23
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,820
of being that we don't understand the 
main one being consciousness.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,420
We can't account for it at all and we 
can't account for the role it appears to

25
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:05,080
play in the transformation of potential 
into actuality,

26
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,390
which is a role that's been recognized 
by physicists for almost 100 years now.

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,620
And which remains one of the biggest 
unsolved mysteries in science.

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,010
There are other ways of looking at 
what's real

29
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,373
and these other ways have some 
advantages and one of the advantages 

30
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,044
they have is that they protect us 
knowing these other ways of operating 

31
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,190
within reality.

32
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,800
Defining reality protect us from certain
kinds of pathologies.

33
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:34,801
And modern people are prone to a fair 
number of pathologies that stem from the

34
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,510
assumptions of their,
of their,

35
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,430
of the systems they use to define 
reality.

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,840
And one of those pathologies is a kind 
of a nihilistic hopelessness,

37
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,674
which is a consequence of the 
recognition that in the final analysis 

38
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:53,110
nothing really has any meaning.
And because life is difficult and that's

39
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:58,111
a meaning that you can't escape,
being forced to abandon your belief in a

40
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:00,790
positive or a meaning can leave you 
week,

41
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,923
the times when you really can least 
afford to be weak and there's more 

42
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:08,020
important pathologies that it's opened 
us up to two.

43
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
And those are pathologies of belief.
And I think we saw the most horrifying 

44
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:12,994
examples of that.
Hopefully the most horrifying examples 

45
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:18,340
in the 20th century where people whose 
belief systems were shattered,

46
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,323
at least in part by the competition 
between religious and scientific 

47
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:22,564
viewpoints,
turned in large numbers to mass 

48
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:28,960
movements that were in error in every 
way as substitute,

49
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,794
a moral rational in some sense 
substitute for religious beliefs that 

50
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,510
appeared no longer tenable.

51
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,260
And the consequences of that was it was 
just about annihilation.

52
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,050
Because we came close to annihilation 
twice,

53
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:42,850
once in the sixties and once in the 
eighties.

54
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,540
And even without the totality of 
annihilation,

55
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,183
we lost hundreds of millions of people 
as a consequence of pathological belief 

56
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
systems in the 20th century.
So if belief systems become 

57
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,034
pathological,
they po that pathology can pose the 

58
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,470
biggest threat possibly to our very 
existence.

59
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,304
And if you're a Darwinian in any sense,
you have to understand that the things 

60
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,404
that pose the biggest threats to your 
survival are the most real things they 

61
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:15,040
have to be dealt with.
Now,

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,933
here's another way of looking at things.
I'll start with the definition of this 

63
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,614
word.
This word famous thigh is the root word 

64
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:23,284
of phenomenon,
phenomenon and phenomena are the things 

65
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,514
that appear to you and famous by means 
to shine forth and the phenomenologists 

66
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,194
who were interested in,
in the shining forth of things made the 

67
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,164
presumption that the things that 
manifested themselves to you as most 

68
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,160
meaningful word,
the most real things.

69
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,173
And I think you can make a strong case 
that that's actually how your brain is 

70
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,534
wired.
Because your brain is wired to react to 

71
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:49,570
things that have meaning before they 
construct the perceptions that you think

72
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,404
of as objects.
And the reason for that is because the 

73
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:55,750
meaning of things is more real in some 
sense,

74
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,780
but more important than the view of 
things as objects.

75
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,620
And so,
for example,

76
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,400
a famous philosopher,
psychologist,

77
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,380
division said that when you approach a 
cliff,

78
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:09,640
you don't see a cliff,
you see a falling off place.

79
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,463
It isn't that it's an object cliff to 
which you attribute the meaning of 

80
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:18,010
falling off place too.
It's the falling off place.

81
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:18,844
Perception comes first,
and the abstraction of the objective 

82
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,620
cliff,
if it ever happens at all,

83
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:25,900
it comes much later,
much later conceptually,

84
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,600
because even babies can detect cliffs 
and much later,

85
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,434
historically,
poets have noticed this phenomenon 

86
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,710
shining forth reality and they've often 
associated with childhood.

87
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,150
And I think there's good reasons for 
that.

88
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:44,560
I think your brain is not so much of an 
inhibitory structure when you're a child

89
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,720
before it's fully developed.
And

90
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,053
so there's,
there's neurological reasons for noting 

91
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,184
it,
but there's also reasons that stem from 

92
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,870
the level of lived experience you can 
tell when you're around children,

93
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:56,704
that they're open things in a way that 
adults aren't there wide eyed with 

94
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,580
wonder and adults like being around 
children for that reason.

95
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,720
Because although the child takes an 
awful lot of care and is,

96
00:06:07,721 --> 00:06:08,554
uh,
is a,

97
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,643
a terrifying object in some ways to 
behold if you have a relationship with 

98
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,890
the child because they're so vulnerable,
the part of the way they pay you back is

99
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:16,724
they open up your eyes,
your eyes that have been closed by your 

100
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:24,740
experience and that have learned to 
shield out the things that shine forth.

101
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,573
And when you have a child,
you can look through the child's eyes 

102
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,780
again.
And to me it's like they're on fire in a

103
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,614
sense.
They're like a candle or something 

104
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,144
that's burning brightly.
And I think that's also partly because 

105
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
we actually don't screen out fire.
We actually see fire and that's why we 

106
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:37,904
can't not look at it when it's around.
I think the same thing happens when 

107
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,790
you're in love with someone,
if it's,

108
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,450
if it's genuine love,
because genuine love gives you a hint of

109
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:51,830
what could be in the future.
If you could just set yourself right,

110
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:53,840
you get a glimpse of what could be in 
the future.

111
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,050
If you fall in love with someone,
you don't get that without work,

112
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,884
but you get a glimpse of it,
and I think it's because when you fall 

113
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:00,794
in love,
and I believe this is likely a 

114
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,354
biochemical transformation,
is the perceptual structures that 

115
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:08,360
normally stop you from seeing people 
because you really don't see people.

116
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,820
You just see shadows.
They did that,

117
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,723
that that the barriers are lifted 
temporarily and what's really there 

118
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:19,670
shines through and it's overwhelming,
but to stay in that state,

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,140
well,
it requires a tremendous amount of moral

120
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:26,390
effort is really the right way of 
thinking about it.

121
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,993
Words were said about children.
There was a time when meadow grove and 

122
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:32,324
stream the earth and every common sight 
to me did seem appareled in celestial 

123
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:37,244
light.
The glory and the freshness of a dream 

124
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,310
it is not now as it has been of your 
turn,

125
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,250
were soever.
I may by night or day,

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,713
the things which I have seen I now can 
see no more earth fills her lap with 

127
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:53,834
pleasures of her own yearnings.
She have in her own natural kind and 

128
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:00,840
even with something of a mother's mind 
and no unworthy aim.

129
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,000
The homely nurse doth all she can to 
make her foster child,

130
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,560
her inmate man.

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,453
Forget the glories he hath known and 
that Imperial Pellets Palace whence he 

132
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:15,800
came.
And what he means by this is that as you

133
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:18,560
develop as an as a,
as a competent adult,

134
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,394
which which is precisely the.
The direction towards which you should 

135
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,743
develop,
much of what you're doing is actually 

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,353
closing in and narrowing your closing in
and narrowing towards a particular goal 

137
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,434
in a particular way of being.
And that's necessary because as you 

138
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,800
develop,
you have to develop towards a particular

139
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,634
way of being.
Or you don't develop it all and you can 

140
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,620
stay a child forever.
That goes,

141
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,680
that goes sour of its own accord and so 
human beings are destined to close their

142
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:52,931
perceptions in to sharpen themselves and
to focus on very little so that they can

143
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:57,150
at least do that.
But the price we pay for that is that we

144
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,360
start to replace the relationship we 
have with untrammeled reality,

145
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,433
with the shadows that are only complex 
enough to let us do what we need to do 

146
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:06,960
and no more.

147
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,603
And in some sense,
although we become more competent in 

148
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:10,974
other ways,
we've become more blind and we kind of 

149
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,570
know how this happens.
That happens from the bottom up.

150
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:16,404
Now this is the Greek painting and the 
painting as an obvious meaning in a 

151
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:20,724
sense which is that we're blinded even 
to what's right in front of us by the 

152
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:29,751
objects that we see and we think that 
seeing is letting in the light,

153
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:35,400
but it's only letting in a very small 
fraction of the light because we're only

154
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,234
capable of contemplating a small 
fraction of everything whenever we're 

155
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,194
doing any particular thing.
And so very much of what we're doing is 

156
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,540
screening things out.
Very much of your cortex is inhibitory

157
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,140
and the greed is trying to get at that 
with that idea.

158
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:52,570
It's like there's a businessman there,
he's dressed in his uniform.

159
00:09:52,571 --> 00:09:53,404
He can't see beyond the immediate,
the immediate thing that's in front of 

160
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,610
his eyes.
How does that happen?

161
00:09:57,611 --> 00:09:59,040
Well,
let's say you're a baby.

162
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,820
The first thing you learn,
you learn.

163
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,980
You build your body from the bottom up,
your build,

164
00:10:02,981 --> 00:10:05,290
your perceptual and actual structures 
from the bottom up.

165
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,860
You learn to move your arm,
you learned to close your hand.

166
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,910
Then you learn to do things that are 
practical with those abilities.

167
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:15,520
You lift the spoon while you have to do 
that to feed yourself.

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,833
You learn to move a plate.
You learn to set the table that's 

169
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:20,104
starting to become social now because 
you can set the table for you and for 

170
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:25,210
other people.
You learn to make a meal.

171
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:26,044
That's a more complex sequencing of 
motor activities and perceptual 

172
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:30,160
abilities that's very focused.

173
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,983
As you continue to develop the things 
you chained together become more and 

174
00:10:35,571 --> 00:10:38,600
more complex and and but also more 
specific.

175
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,443
You have to care for your family,
which means there's all sorts of other 

176
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,420
things you're not doing.
You have to find a good job,

177
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,283
which almost everyone,
when they're young experiences as the 

178
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,850
contemplation of limitation.
Well not everyone,

179
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,230
but many people think,
oh no,

180
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:52,064
you know,
I'm going to have to settle for this 

181
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,690
role.
I don't want to only be that role,

182
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:59,540
but it's better to be that role that no 
role at all,

183
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,770
and maybe the way through the role to 
the other side is through the role,

184
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:04,604
don't want around it.
There's no avoiding the responsibility 

185
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:09,470
of narrowing and shaping and 
specializing.

186
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,023
Be a good parent.
Well that's the sacrifice you make for 

187
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:15,590
the next generation.
Be a good partner.

188
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,340
The same thing,
be a good citizen.

189
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,473
It's easy for young people in particular
to be skeptical of that because the old 

190
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,710
society is always corrupt and archaic 
and blind to become a member of.

191
00:11:30,711 --> 00:11:31,544
That seems to be in part two to allow 
yourself to adopt that same agent 

192
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:39,740
blindness,
but that thing also educates you.

193
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,574
It shapes every word you speak.
It's something that you have to be 

194
00:11:42,831 --> 00:11:43,664
grateful to even in its agent,
an archaic form and it's part of the 

195
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:51,800
necessities of human responsibility that
you become a good citizen

196
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,050
and that means

197
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,040
in some sense,
giving up more of what could be at least

198
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,390
to sustain.
What is

199
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,050
is a satirical song from the late 
eighties,

200
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
nineties,
English.

201
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,160
I am the very model of a modern major 
general of information,

202
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,140
vegetable,
animal and mineral.

203
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,003
I know the kings of England and I quote 
the fights historical from marathon to 

204
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:20,490
waterloo in order categorical and the 
satire.

205
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,340
He as well,
he has the knowledge.

206
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,610
He's an official functionary and it's 
very difficult to do that,

207
00:12:28,011 --> 00:12:28,844
but in the same way it's very limited in
categorical and of course an artists 

208
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,084
would object to that,
but it's better than nothing at all and 

209
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,300
that's the alternative.

210
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,163
Well above that,
maybe what's above good citizen because 

211
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,474
sometimes good citizen is not so good if
you were a good citizen of Nazi Germany 

212
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:47,700
or a good citizen of the Soviet Union or
of Mao's China,

213
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,920
you know you were narrowed in a 
particular way,

214
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:53,130
but
and then maybe an unnecessary way,

215
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:53,964
but also in a very pathological way.
And so it seems to be that there has to 

216
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:01,980
be something even though adopting that 
restricted viewpoint is necessary.

217
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,053
There has to be something above it.
And I think that's also the thing that 

218
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:05,634
can restore the sense you have of a true
entanglement with the deepest and most 

219
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:11,754
meaningful realities of life.
And that's the issue of being a good 

220
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,260
person.
It's above being a citizen.

221
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:17,094
It's something else that has something 
to do with the development of 

222
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:21,090
individuality.
And I think we're also wired for that.

223
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,380
So it looks like we're wired to lose 
what we had to specialize,

224
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,480
but then once we're specialized to 
reopen,

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,493
once we've got the skills built into our
body and then can handle handle reality 

226
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,150
because we're more adapted and more 
fluid and more flexible than we can.

227
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,983
Start opening the doors again and I,
and I believe that your nervous system 

228
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,410
is set up to help you do that.
If you don't interfere with it.

229
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:44,244
If you notice and you notice that by 
paying attention to the things that 

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,720
manifest themselves to you,
that shine forth as interesting,

231
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,583
they grab you and where you're grabbed 
is where the obscuring map you live in 

232
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,840
isn't obscuring the reality that's 
underneath.

233
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,500
It's like there's a hole in the map and 
the light shines through that and you're

234
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,334
attracted to that and that will pull you
along and that's when your interest is 

235
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:10,950
seized by something that's your nervous 
system doing that.

236
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,480
You don't do that.
It's,

237
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,373
it's an unconscious force.
You could even say it was the world 

238
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:16,194
itself talking to you and the 
phenomenologists didn't feel that way 

239
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,423
and it's a real phenomenon.
It's not a secondary thing and you know 

240
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,830
that because you can't live without it.
You Die.

241
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,703
He stultify you get cynical,
you get nihilistic or you adopt some 

242
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,414
wild belief system if you don't have the
attachment to some genuine life giving 

243
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:36,504
meaning in your own life and it's a hard
thing to follow that because it doesn't 

244
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,224
necessarily put you into perfect 
juxtaposition with society because it's 

245
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,900
not society.
It's not being a good citizen.

246
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:46,734
It's something else.
It's also the thing that rebuilds how 

247
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:50,430
you would be a good citizen.

248
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,460
The Egyptians knew about this a long 
time ago.

249
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,570
They didn't really know.
They knew

250
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,903
because they acted things out and drama 
and portrayed them mythologically 

251
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,160
because they didn't have the capacity to
articulate the ideas fully,

252
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:04,994
but the Egyptians worshiped the human 
eye and they worshiped the eye because 

253
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:09,854
they knew the I was the thing that paid 
attention like we're really visual 

254
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:12,674
creatures and your eyes automatically 
attracted to the things that manifest 

255
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:19,730
themselves or shine forth in front of 
you and you have to look at them.

256
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,673
Okay.

257
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,613
If you pay attention
to the things that shine forth because 

258
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:29,220
what you're seeing is the reality.
Instead of the map,

259
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,820
you're gaining access to the real 
information that's in the world.

260
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,940
It's not prepackaged information because
that can be forced.

261
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,983
It's the real information flowing up 
from the ground of being and if you pay 

262
00:15:39,421 --> 00:15:40,254
attention to that,
it will help you move towards the goals 

263
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:46,070
that you've already established for 
yourself as a good citizen that are,

264
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,840
that are part of the inbuilt value 
structure that you've adopted.

265
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:50,730
But at the same time it will do 
something else.

266
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,833
It will lead you to transform the nature
of those goals because as you pursued 

267
00:15:55,951 --> 00:16:00,951
the thing that guides your interest and 
more and more information is revealed.

268
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,860
Then by absorbing that information which
is learning,

269
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:08,070
essentially you build yourself into a 
different person,

270
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,130
a stronger and more informed person and 
a more,

271
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,173
a more intact person,
a person with more integrity and with 

272
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:15,294
more straight than with more direction,
and at the same time you differentiate 

273
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,850
your map and so you're living more and 
more in the real world,

274
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,863
so as you approach your specific goal,
even if it's a culturally conditioned 

275
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,104
goal,
the learning that you do along the way 

276
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,880
transforms you and it transforms the 
nature of your goal.

277
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,143
Things shine forth.
There's a reason for that and you know 

278
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:38,684
that because when you're attending to 
something you're interested in and 

279
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,040
you're engaged in,
that's when you're alive.

280
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
That's when life is worthwhile.
It's so worthwhile that in those moments

281
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:47,234
you don't even ask the question about 
the question itself goes away because 

282
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:51,824
the meaning that you're united with is 
so powerful that it can push back the 

283
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,490
adversity that would otherwise 
characterize life.

284
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,630
Nisha said,
the person who has a why can bear anyhow

285
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,870
and and that's a really useful thing to 
know because you think,

286
00:17:05,871 --> 00:17:06,704
well,
we're very vulnerable creatures in our 

287
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:11,330
life ends catastrophic and and and 
terrible things happen,

288
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:12,164
and how can we bear that in?
The answer to that is and always has 

289
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:19,331
been that you have to be in sync with 
something that's beyond you because that

290
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:20,834
synchrony gives you the strength that 
you need to bear your terrible 

291
00:17:23,181 --> 00:17:24,014
limitations.

292
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,300
You see this played out.
People know this.

293
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,970
Everyone knows this.
It's just that our culture isn't good at

294
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,100
articulating it.
We've lost a lot of this.

295
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,533
We haven't developed their knowledge 
about this as much as we've developed 

296
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:37,370
our knowledge of the objective world and
we're paying for it.

297
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,160
You see it in weird places on the,
on the right here,

298
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
there's an old symbol at the bottom.
It's called the round chaos.

299
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,350
When the alchemists believed that the 
round chaos was the thing that held,

300
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,110
what was,
what the world was ultimately made up,

301
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,003
the thing that was most real and they 
conceptualize it as something like 

302
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,740
inflammation.
They thought about it.

303
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:57,574
There's a combination of spirit and 
matter and it was a combination of 

304
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:00,774
spirit and matter,
which is what information is in a sense 

305
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:06,150
because when you interacted with it,
you took some of the information and you

306
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:06,984
built yourself out of it,
so that was the spiritual element and 

307
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,134
you took some of the information and you
built the world out of it and that was 

308
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,744
the material element and they thought of
the reality itself is something that 

309
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:16,134
preceded the spiritual and the material 
and that that reality was what showing 

310
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:24,390
for and that's been dramatized and in 
entails modern tales of transformation.

311
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,160
The most interesting places popped up is
in the Harry Potter stories were central

312
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:33,330
to the Harry Potter theme is a game 
called quidditch and inquisitive,

313
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,570
which is a game.
The way you win the game is by playing a

314
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:38,580
game that's sort of outside the 
quidditch game.

315
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,673
You win the quidditch game by finding 
following this thing that beckons this 

316
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,610
golden thing that glimmers and moves 
around you.

317
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:49,800
If you catch that,
then you win.

318
00:18:49,801 --> 00:18:53,520
The game is so does your whole team and 
inside that is.

319
00:18:53,521 --> 00:18:55,890
It is the resurrection stone.
It's a,

320
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,130
it's a diamond that says it's a jewel.
The idea is that if you follow the thing

321
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:03,600
that manifests itself to you as 
interesting,

322
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,123
it will lead you through adversity,
a lead you to do things that are 

323
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:07,884
difficult and as that happens,
but not beyond your capacity because 

324
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,273
it's tempered for that.
What will happen is as you hit yourself 

325
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,590
against the world pursuing what you're 
interested in,

326
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,380
you'll tap yourself into alignment.
Your molecules,

327
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,214
your structure,
internal structure will become non 

328
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,560
contradictory like the internal 
structure of a jewel,

329
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,340
which is something that reflects light.
It makes you hard and durable,

330
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,500
unable to bear the terrible conditions 
of existence without becoming corrupt.

331
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,950
He had said something about this,
we shall not cease from exploration,

332
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,503
and the end of all our exploring will be
to arrive where we started and to know 

333
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:51,111
the place for the first time
and that's five line summary of the most

334
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,633
remarkable elaboration of the nature of 
the relationship between the individual 

335
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:05,640
human consciousness and reality itself 
that's ever been panned.

336
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:06,474
And and,
and the combination of have a system of 

337
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:11,210
thought that's been developing over 
thousands and thousands of years.

338
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:15,020
Which we have lost and cannot properly 
articulate.

339
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,263
I follow what you're interested in.
It'll take you to have adversity and 

340
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:22,644
then through it it'll transform you from
a citizen into an individual and then 

341
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:26,514
the doors will open again and at that 
point you're strong enough to have your 

342
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,104
life
and at that point you're strong enough 

343
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,440
not to fall prey to pathological belief 
systems and work towards the destruction

344
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:40,274
of things.

345
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,213
Thank you.
