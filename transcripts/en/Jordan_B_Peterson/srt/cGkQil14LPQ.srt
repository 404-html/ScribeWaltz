1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,073
Should be this.
And you mentioned these ideas of 

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,840
responsibility,
of virtue of respect.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,153
You've,
I think,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,123
detailed what you think students 
shouldn't do in these examples of like 

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:21,260
protests and these examples of certain 
types of activist tactics.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,333
What advice would you have for students?
How can students make the changes that 

7
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,990
they want to make?
Particularly,

8
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,850
do you have any advice for students 
here?

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,320
Yeah.
Read great books.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,150
Really,
man,

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,283
you've got this four year period that 
has been carved out of your lives by 

12
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,531
society.
They,

13
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,010
they,
it's,

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,050
it's given you an identity,
like a high quality identity and freedom

15
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:42,884
at the same time.
And you're not going to get that again 

16
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:45,410
in your life.
You've got to,

17
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,210
you've got a respectable identity,
university students and complete freedom

18
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:52,460
associated with that or as near as 
you're ever going to get.

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,503
And you've got these unbelievable 
libraries that are full of the writings 

20
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:56,324
of people who are,
who are intelligent and articulate 

21
00:00:58,371 --> 00:01:00,530
beyond comprehension and,
you know,

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,573
and,
and you can go there and you can learn 

23
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:04,040
all this and you might think,
well,

24
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,000
why should you learn it?

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,143
Um,
well you learn it to get a job or you 

26
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,400
learn it to get good grades or you learn
it to get a degree.

27
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,890
And that's all nonsense.
It's nonsense.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:13,993
The reason that you come to university 
to be educated is because there is 

29
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:17,024
nothing more powerful than someone who 
is articulate and who can think and 

30
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,760
speak.
It's power and I mean power of the best,

31
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:26,780
sort of its authority and influence and 
respectability and competence.

32
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,913
And so you come to university to craft 
your highest skill and your highest 

33
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,350
skill is to be found in articulated 
speech.

34
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,060
And if you're,
if you're,

35
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,940
if you're a master at formulating your 
arguments,

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,640
you win everything.
And better than that,

37
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,210
when you win everything,
everyone around you wins too.

38
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,403
Because to transform yourself into,
let's consider you consider your 

39
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:51,890
transformation,
does something approximating the logos.

40
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,200
It means you shine a light on the whole 
world.

41
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,090
Well,
there's nothing more exciting to do with

42
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:56,983
that.
There's nothing better you can possibly 

43
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,694
do.
And to think that you're going to 

44
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,910
university to be,
you know,

45
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,720
trained to have a job,
it's like great.

46
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:03,554
That's a hell of a lot better than being
unemployed and covered with cheeto dust 

47
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:09,470
while you're snacking away in front of 
your video game in the basement.

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,260
But it's not.
It's not a,

49
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,970
and I don't want to have anything 
against video games by the way,

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,230
but it's hardly a triumphant call to,
to being in the world.

51
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:23,330
And that's what universities should be 
calling forth.

52
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:24,800
It's like God,
you people,

53
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,730
you,
you know,

54
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,400
I know what Harvard students are like.
I taught here for five years.

55
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,550
You people are spectacular.
You're spectacular.

56
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,241
You're,
you're,

57
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:33,074
you're,
you're all capable of being world 

58
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,354
beaters.
You transform yourself into something 

59
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:37,784
that's articulated and sensible and 
grounded in history and knowledgeable 

60
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,330
and wise.

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,163
Man,
you can do anything you want and 

62
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,760
hopefully anything you want for good 
because if you have any sense,

63
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,713
everything you want to do would be for 
the good because there's nothing more 

64
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,043
compelling or meaningful or,
or useful in combating the tragedy of 

65
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:55,604
life than to,
than to struggle with all your soul on 

66
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,140
behalf the good and the universities and
forgotten that.

67
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,320
It's why everyone's bailing out of the 
humanities and they should.

68
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
The humanities are corrupt.
They're corrupt because they're not 

69
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,200
telling the students this.
It's so bloody obvious.

70
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,300
It's like learn to think,
learn to speak room to read.

71
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,950
It makes you a super power and 
individual superpower.

72
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,203
You have it under.
I don't understand why that isn't just 

73
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,070
told to students.
It's not that hard to understand it.

74
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,350
Everyone wants to hear it.
It's like,

75
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,310
really?
I could do this.

76
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,480
I can do that.

77
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,500
It's like,
yeah,

78
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:37,501
really you could do that and the whole 
society around you is labored for really

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,033
thousands of years to provide every 
single one of you with this spectacular 

80
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,034
opportunity that you have while your 
undergraduates and graduate students 

81
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,250
here,
man,

82
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,083
they're just,
everyone's just praying that you would 

83
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,394
come here and manifest everything that 
you could manifest and that's what you 

84
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,164
should be doing.
Instead of waving plaque cards and 

85
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,180
complaining about how your old pressed 
for God's sake,

86
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,450
you see these Yale students complaining 
about their oppression.

87
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,050
It's just,
it just leaves me aghast.

88
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,860
It's like,
well,

89
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:07,750
we're against the ruling class.
It's like,

90
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:08,141
no,
no,

91
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:10,840
no.
Your baby ruling class members,

92
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,853
you're young.

93
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:19,460
The

94
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,680
only reason you're not rich is cause 
you're young.

95
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,540
You know that's the best.
Really.

96
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,580
That's the,
if you look at the 1%,

97
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:29,510
even the dreaded 1% you know,
most of those people are old.

98
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,310
Why?
Well,

99
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,160
when you progress through life,
if you're reasonably successful,

100
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,150
you trade in your promising youth for 
your wealthy old age,

101
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:41,060
but you're still bloody old you when you
trade it.

102
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,583
Would you trade your youth for that?
Like if you factor age out of the 

103
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,600
economic equation,
things look a lot different.

104
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,081
One.
Of course,

105
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,540
older people have more money.
If they have any sense,

106
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,250
they'd been collecting it for their 
whole life.

107
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:53,084
Is that somehow unfair?
It's not unfair unless you want to want 

108
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,384
to be poverty stricken when you're 70 
and you and you don't want to be 

109
00:04:59,121 --> 00:04:59,954
poverty,
strict pop poverty stricken when you 

110
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:06,051
were 17 so I just don't understand 
what's happened to the universities.

111
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,740
I can't believe that you're not told 
when you come the first day,

112
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:11,020
look man,
you are right.

113
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:11,923
You're here on a heroic mission.
You're going to take your capacity to 

114
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,720
articulate yourself to levels that are 
undreamed of,

115
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,090
you're going to come out of here.
I'm unstoppable.

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,920
You're going to be able to do anything 
you want.

117
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,790
It's like that's what you're here for.
Instead,

118
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,030
you're taught that,
well,

119
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:26,864
you know the world's a pretty oppressive
place and you're probably the bottom of 

120
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,530
the victim pile and,
and,

121
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,520
and,
and there's,

122
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:32,354
and there's,
there's virtually nothing you can do 

123
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:34,364
about it except no deconstruct the 
patriarchy and it's so rude deed and so 

124
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:39,044
pathetic that,
that the university should be 

125
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,130
embarrassed that that's what they're 
peddling to students.

126
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,350
I'm embarrassed by it.
You know,

127
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,630
I've gone on public record telling 
parents,

128
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,513
how do you well,
send your boys to trade school because 

129
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:51,044
at least they'll learn something useful.
And that's a terrible thing for someone 

130
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,900
like me to say because I do believe that
the,

131
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,023
the being articulated in educated in the
highest possible manner is there's 

132
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,280
nothing that's better for you and for 
society.

133
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,400
And why are the why of the university's 
forgotten this?

134
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,170
Well,
that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,593
Then the philosophy of intense 
resentment and oppression and group 

136
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:17,390
identity and god,
it's just.
