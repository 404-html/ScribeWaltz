1
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,911
Okay.
Well,

2
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,710
since we haven't been at this for 
awhile,

3
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,013
I'm going to briefly review what we've 
come up to him and then where are we 

4
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,914
going?

5
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,213
Okay.

6
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,910
I guess the basic idea,

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,360
well,
maybe I'll start with something instead.

8
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,853
I guess we probably reviewed enough.
I'm going to read you something from 

9
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,270
Tolstoy,
which you probably read or theoretically

10
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:19,220
read.
One of the things we're going to discuss

11
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,743
today please,
the manner in which anomalous 

12
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,380
information,
because that's itself,

13
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,313
the different manners in which anomalous
information can present itself and how 

14
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,584
that,
how anomalous information as a category 

15
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:37,310
is represented.
Basically.

16
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,144
No,
we know already.

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,473
Anomalous inflammation tends to adopt 
symbolism associated with the feminine 

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,940
feminine with chaos because it's a 
normal information,

19
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,370
which is information you don't expect.
Of course,

20
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,743
that produces emotional chaos because it
disrupts your versions of the emotional 

21
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,124
significance of the present and the 
future and conceivably how to get from 

22
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:04,994
one to the other.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,833
Our whole discussion so far has been 
based on the idea that you can look at 

24
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,134
the world from two different 
perspectives and when you're thinking 

25
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,250
about the constituent elements of 
things,

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,710
you can take the straight materialistic 
perspective,

27
00:02:21,711 --> 00:02:23,480
which is a perfectly reasonable thing to
do.

28
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,750
And talk about how things are 
constructed scientifically as if they're

29
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,170
independent object and we've got a long 
way it's doing that.

30
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,443
But there's another way that you can 
look at the world and that's as a place 

31
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,053
that exists as experience and as a place
that exists as a stage for action 

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,140
basically.
And it is the case,

33
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:51,974
I think it's,
it's well known and not frequently 

34
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,873
disputed that the world as a place to 
act is not derived bubble as from the 

35
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,914
world as it exists,
which is to say that you can accumulate 

36
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,310
all the facts you want about a given 
situation or a thing.

37
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,653
And that doesn't tell you how you,
how you should conduct your behavior in 

38
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,464
that situation or around that thing.
And the reason for that basically is 

39
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:18,064
because you have to choose,
you'd have to make decisions about what 

40
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:28,271
constitutes the optimal solution to your
particular emotional problems.

41
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,963
Yes,

42
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,683
and I,
I said before and I've been thinking 

43
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:37,110
about this a lot lately,
I think one of the reasons that

44
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,150
average before,

45
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,683
oh,
the nonacademic community has contempt 

46
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:48,951
for the academic community is because we
have been laboring under the presumption

47
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:52,540
that
knowing facts is,

48
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,880
is what intelligence is for and that's 
not right.

49
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,270
Intelligence is to tell you how to 
regulate your emotions.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,553
That's what it's for.
Can you do that by figuring out how to 

51
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:04,194
behave?

52
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,460
If you've explored something thoroughly 
from this perspective,

53
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,440
that means that you know how to act when
you're there.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,073
It doesn't mean you know everything 
about the situation from the factual 

55
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:30,654
perspective,
and that's obvious because you'll never 

56
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:34,074
find yourself in a situation where you 
know everything from the factual 

57
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:36,984
perspective.
And that brings up another interesting 

58
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,744
point,
which is

59
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,450
how is it that you can stop asking 
questions since you're always surrounded

60
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,284
by an infinite number of mysteries and 
answer to that is as far as I can tell 

61
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,124
it,
you stop asking the questions about a 

62
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:51,984
situation when what you know is good 
enough to get you where you want to be 

63
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:55,644
in that situation.
And that constitutes grounds for 

64
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:01,980
presuming that your exploratory behavior
in that situation has gone far enough.

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,053
So if I want something from you,
despite the fact that I don't know 

66
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:09,270
everything about you or even anywhere 
near anything and everything about you,

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,333
I know you sufficiently when my 
interactions with you produce the 

68
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,530
results that I did,
I did,

69
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:17,364
I desire.
And so that gives us some insight into 

70
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:24,270
how it is that your knowledge can both 
be limited but sufficient.

71
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,703
And that's a useful,
that's a useful piece of information to 

72
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:28,224
have.

73
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,860
You're to explored territory when what 
you do produces what you want.

74
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,590
And the,
from the mythological perspective,

75
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:39,680
explored territory is one of the 
constituent elements of the universe,

76
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,420
right?
That's the no,

77
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,690
that's the patriarchal system.
How unexplored territory,

78
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,210
whenever something you do produce as a 
consequence,

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,570
you don't expect.
And that's,

80
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,463
that's an interesting notion because we 
tend to think of territory as the place 

81
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,660
that you're at.
But this is in a sense a way of making a

82
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,970
leaf up into the idea of a spiritual 
territory.

83
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:06,971
Because psychologically speaking,
you can be in the

84
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,810
psychologically speaking,
despite the fact that you're in the same

85
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,390
place.
You can be in two different places.

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,790
If,
sorry,

87
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,810
let me get this straight.

88
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,690
Even though even if I don't shift 
position,

89
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,940
I can be in two different places.
If I'm talking to you and what I want to

90
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,880
happen happens,
that's one place.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
And if I'm talking to you and something 
or don't expect happens,

92
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,290
that's another place.
Even though I haven't moved,

93
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,500
the emotional significance of those two 
places is entirely different.

94
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:49,090
So those are psychological places and as
far as myth,

95
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,800
mythology is concerned,
it's psychological places that are real.

96
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,300
That's at least with regards to their 
significance for behavior,

97
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:00,330
which is what myth is concerned with.
Genomic was concerned with morality.

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,193
That's,
that's normal.

99
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,070
That's not names.

100
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,143
All right,

101
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,293
so there's the place that you're 
familiar with and that's the place that 

102
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:16,790
you've explored sufficiently so that 
what you want to happen is happening and

103
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,624
there's a place that you're unfamiliar 
with and that's the place that emerges 

104
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,473
when you make a mistake.
And then there's the process that turns 

105
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,484
one into the other,
which is to say that if you make a 

106
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,414
mistake and you continue to explore,
you might be able to modify your 

107
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,120
behavior so that the consequences of 
your mistake vanish,

108
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,463
which basically means that you can 
figure out how you should have behaved 

109
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,804
in that circumstance and that you 
rectify your behavior in the future or 

110
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:44,390
that you can smooth things over so that 
the consequences of your mistake go away

111
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:45,224
now.
So that's the capacity to turn chaos in 

112
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,544
doored.
It's also the case that you can turn 

113
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:52,664
order into chaos
by continuing to explore in territory 

114
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,630
that other people have already defined 
as sufficiently explored.

115
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,720
And that means that the process of 
creative exploration can bring order and

116
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:10,050
it can also bring chaos.
These are forms of the normally here.

117
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,823
Okay.

118
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,550
They're written down in the,
in the manuscript.

119
00:08:14,551 --> 00:08:15,384
The revolutionary hero as a bringer of a
normally is someone who continues to 

120
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:20,484
explore.
When everyone else says we're getting 

121
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:23,064
where we want to be at the present time,
which is just to say they're saying you 

122
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:26,950
should leave

123
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,980
well enough alone.
All right.

124
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,700
One of the things that we've been trying
to do,

125
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,793
we looked at mythological 
representations of the unknown and they 

126
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:46,450
tend to take two forms.
Basically,

127
00:08:46,451 --> 00:08:47,284
they tend to manifest themselves in 
feminine shape and there's a lot of 

128
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:53,950
reasons for that,
but the basic reason is because

129
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,450
it's the unknown that everything comes 
from.

130
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,450
So when you explore something unknown,
you generate new information.

131
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,540
So it's reasonable to conceive of the 
unknown as a matrix.

132
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,913
And the idea of the Matrix is 
contaminated cognitively speaking with 

133
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,820
quick notions of creation and notions of
the source.

134
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,670
And it's reasonable to think of the 
unknown as the source of all things.

135
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:18,504
It's reasonable as a consequence,
I think of it hasn't in the same 

136
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:21,774
category as feminine things.
And the unknown takes the unknown as a 

137
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,684
feminine thing takes on two sets of 
characteristics and one is the creative 

138
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,323
characteristics and the other is the 
destructive characteristics because the 

139
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:38,940
unknown can disrupt things and destroy 
them and it,

140
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,490
but it also serves as the ground for 
everything.

141
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,620
So it has it affectively ambivalent 
status that's permanent.

142
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:47,454
So that's a constituent element of 
experienced on don't always have to 

143
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:50,524
structure.
It frightens you and it makes you 

144
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:54,744
hopeful and it does both of those 
simultaneously and that puts you into a 

145
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,960
state of interest.
I get conflict,

146
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,823
so which,
which has really nothing to do with 

147
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,014
your,
your psychological state as an 

148
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:07,854
individual.
It basically means that no matter who 

149
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:12,114
you are,
if you encounter something I'm known 

150
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,620
those two sets of emotions are going to 
be generated.

151
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,993
And then the other thing we tried to do 
was to think about how the gnome itself 

152
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,300
is structured and that brought us to 
this idea

153
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,150
which which is in its sort of elaborated
form,

154
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,243
which is that
if you know where you're at and what 

155
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:38,184
you're doing,
it means that you have a stable view of 

156
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,520
who you are.

157
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,353
And also where you're going and and also
how to get there and that's all one 

158
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:47,100
thing.
That's one story,

159
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,670
but you're cooperating with someone and 
you're doing something.

160
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,110
Then your story shared,
you've hammered out your differences and

161
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,333
you have to find a territory that's 
founded basically where almost nothing 

162
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:57,744
unpredictable it can happen.
One of the things we tried to do was to 

163
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:04,390
figure out how
while the simple one was the,

164
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,380
yeah,
been a theory about where you want to go

165
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:08,214
and the theory about where you are and 
you have a series of plans to get from 

166
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:15,540
one to the other.
But we also have discussed the fact that

167
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,950
the plans themselves are actually 
theories of the same sword.

168
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,380
So
that diagram presents what are basically

169
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,223
nested stories.
It's like you're a small ambitions are 

170
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:31,780
nested in your bigger ambitions.
You take,

171
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,713
do you come to a class to graduate from 
the class to graduate from the class in 

172
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:39,690
order to get your degree in order to 
pursue your career,

173
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,070
your career as part of your duties as a 
citizen,

174
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,963
so on and so forth.
So the stories and to become nested in 

175
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,474
one another and this nesting also has 
the form of a dominance hierarchy 

176
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,943
because

177
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,663
if we're engaged in a dominance dispute,
what that basically means is that we're 

178
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,650
arguing about whose stories could occupy
a superordinate position.

179
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,843
That's one way of looking at it.
We might also both the arguing in order 

180
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,590
to construct the third story that we can
both agree to,

181
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:15,580
but that doesn't happen very often if 
it's sort of a brute force dominant,

182
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,414
struggled at it.
Just whoever has the most effective 

183
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,730
argument,
the tools at hand,

184
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:22,564
which could also involve physical force.
When I was writing my story takes 

185
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:27,850
precedence or at least in this 
situation,

186
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,790
oh,
that's a dominance hierarchy and

187
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,183
the known which is explored territory.
It's also equivalent to culture is 

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,330
constructed of the Internet of sequences
of internets.

189
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,183
That stories that have been arranged in 
terms of the relative importance over 

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,113
spans thousands and thousands of years.
And one of the things we've been trying 

191
00:12:52,241 --> 00:12:55,510
to do is to figure out,
well if you're,

192
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,880
if you're in the same culture as someone
else,

193
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:02,770
that means that you share at least a 
certain set of stories with that person.

194
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,720
And we've been trying to figure out is 
one of those stories consist of and also

195
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,480
what might be the most superordinate 
story.

196
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,430
Write the story that governs all other 
stories,

197
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,680
which you might think of as the king of 
all stories.

198
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,853
And that's part of the reason why I told
you about the mess of the table and 

199
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:19,554
creation myth
in the Mesopotamian creation at the 

200
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,170
Martech
voluntarily confronts time map who's the

201
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:30,604
agent of chaos and considered thesis and
it makes the world and for the 

202
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,550
Mesopotamians that was the rule of the 
king who came as long as the king.

203
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:43,750
He acted out Marta,
then the culture progress properly.

204
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,250
And so the Mesopotamians sad,
except they didn't say it,

205
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,770
they acted it out,
they act it out.

206
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:53,620
The idea that the most super story 
should be

207
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,730
respect for the process that generates 
all stories.

208
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,830
Right,
and that's,

209
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,860
wow,
that's sort of a paradox.

210
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,960
I guess we represented that

211
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,773
this way.

212
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,343
Do you have a story when you're a child 
and it's basically an authoritarian 

213
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,024
story,
which isn't it someone else's is God 

214
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,220
usually your parents at least if you're 
lucky,

215
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,463
that doesn't work forever because it 
soon becomes evident not because your 

216
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:34,910
parents failed,
but because you change that your parents

217
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:35,744
aren't Gordon,
that there's problems that they can 

218
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:38,424
solve,
which is to say that there are unknown 

219
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:40,574
or anomalous phenomena that emerge that 
your parents can attribute the term 

220
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,843
meaning to.
And usually what that means is that you 

221
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:46,484
have to adopt the,
what it means is that you come to adopt 

222
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:55,301
the beliefs of the then
initiation rituals,

223
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,790
which usually involve,
well Elliot,

224
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:03,170
he says all initiation rituals involved 
the regression to the beginnings.

225
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,873
In fact,
Iliana was convinced that all archaic 

226
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,773
people's,
whenever they attempted to create 

227
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,091
something,
a new,

228
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:11,924
whenever it was,
they always construed the creation of 

229
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,210
something new.

230
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,430
In terms of reference to the cosmo going
with myth,

231
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:21,431
which is
chaos gives birth to the original set of

232
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:26,290
parents who in turn give birth to a 
divine son who in turn separates them

233
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,370
from the archaic people.
Every act of creation replaced the cause

234
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,204
with money.
Yet we know a little bit about why that 

235
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,424
is now too because it does seem that 
whenever you rearrange any aspects of 

236
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:38,744
your story at any level of analysis,
you do go through a routine like that 

237
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,943
says your presumptions are wrong,
which basically means that the meaning 

238
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:46,364
that you attribute to things is not 
stable and you have to readjust those 

239
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,174
and during that period of readjustment
your emotions are dysregulated and the 

240
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:59,120
mythological way of referring to that in
a sense,

241
00:15:59,121 --> 00:15:59,954
at least in part,
you return to the state preceding the 

242
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:07,691
division of order and chaos.
Every act of creation is

243
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,470
has the mythological structure of the 
construction of the world.

244
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,043
Anyways,

245
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,073
the group tells you how to be
and it provides a good answer when 

246
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:21,694
you're an adolescent to the problems 
that poses that are posed to you as a 

247
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:26,680
consequence of your development that 
you're,

248
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,523
Karen's cannot answer.
The problem is is that a group provides 

249
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:35,200
a determined a dancer,
which is a list of rules.

250
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:39,460
Essentially it says that good is such 
and such and that bad or evil,

251
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:40,294
it's such in session,
which is perfectly fine under most 

252
00:16:42,611 --> 00:16:46,990
conditions,
but it does upon location ochre that the

253
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:47,824
fact of the group presents a problem or 
the group's notion of how to adapt to 

254
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,150
the environment is wrong.

255
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,360
That happens,
for example,

256
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:56,194
when if you have a group belief that's 
very strong and I have one that's very 

257
00:16:59,381 --> 00:17:00,214
strong,
we engage in a dispute that results in 

258
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:07,231
our mutual the minds and for me that 
indicates that there's a problem.

259
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,993
I mean,
it's a strange situation because it 

260
00:17:11,501 --> 00:17:12,334
isn't the case that under many 
conditions people will risk their own 

261
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,940
extinction in order to maintain the 
structure of their roots.

262
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,343
So there you can take the position that 
you know the best thing to do is to die 

263
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:27,640
for the fatherland,
which basically means that

264
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,603
even the problem as extreme as the fact 
that your group identification might 

265
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:33,934
kill you isn't sufficient problem to 
indicate that there's something wrong 

266
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,594
with its structure.
I have some extreme authoritarian 

267
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:41,014
position,
but we're going to take the position 

268
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:42,574
that the fact that group
in our caused conflict is an indication 

269
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:48,964
that there's something wrong with the 
idea that the group is the final 

270
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,200
solution to all of your problems.
It's a choice

271
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,943
if you can.
We know that you have to have group 

272
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:05,304
identification in order to make sense of
your emotional experience because you 

273
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:09,474
need a way of limiting the meaning the 
things offered to you to some 

274
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,473
comprehensive aligned acceptable domain.
What we also know that group 

275
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:22,200
identification has its own set of 
problems,

276
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,303
so what we need is a solution that has 
all of the advantages of group 

277
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:28,020
identification without any of the 
disadvantages.

278
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,603
Positive parents are the positive 
alternative three to this chart as the 

279
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,374
capacity not to identify with the group
but to move to a state where giving due 

280
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:49,491
respect to the group you identify with 
the process that brings it into being,

281
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,970
which makes you the agent that it,
no,

282
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,153
which makes you determine that the 
process that constructs the group is 

283
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:02,130
actually more important than the group 
itself and that gives you,

284
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,353
that gives you a way to be,
which basically means a structure that 

285
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,473
regulates your emotions and also 
something that attributes to determine 

286
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,480
the meaning to all of them.

287
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,300
All of these experiences
first and adolescence.

288
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,050
That's identification with her.
And then the second one,

289
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,010
the identification,
the group hero.

290
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,243
Okay.
In the first case it's not 

291
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,010
identification with the parents,
it's reliance on their word dependence.

292
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,400
Yeah,
I was on the crew.

293
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,423
Yeah.
And that would be identification with 

294
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:53,190
the parents are actually in the second 
stage because that's basically,

295
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,880
if you think of the group as sort of an 
abstract,

296
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:56,714
that parent,
which is a perfectly reasonable way of 

297
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:58,704
looking at,
in fact usually what your parents are 

298
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,254
when you're a child.
He's not so much of your parents as 

299
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:06,210
those representatives of the group that 
you have to come into contact with.

300
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,793
Right.
That's part of the reason I think why 

301
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:09,324
it's often difficult because this comes 
up frequently with people who have the 

302
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,223
dependent type of neurotic personality,
so they can't disassociate themselves 

303
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:17,994
from their parents because they don't 
know that their parents know that what 

304
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,560
they see in their parents isn't the 
group and not the parents.

305
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,810
This is especially true.
I think that the father,

306
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,290
your father is more than an individual 
in a sense.

307
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:32,124
He's also the intermediary that you 
first encountered who embodies all of 

308
00:20:36,271 --> 00:20:39,390
culture and as a consequence he's a fit 
a finger.

309
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:40,224
In a sense that's much more powerful 
than P is when construed simply as an 

310
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:47,470
individual.
Yes.

311
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,700
Where is the identification and we kind 
of stuff.

312
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,463
If the,
the goal of the journey is a dedication 

313
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,900
here,
there's a particular,

314
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,950
like you said,
your event and it's on the parents,

315
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,940
which is also a culture.
Where is it?

316
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,590
Right?
It depended on the,

317
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,573
on the cell.

318
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,770
Well,
what do you mean by the cell?

319
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,030
I think in terms of their guys in a 
different form of neurotic.

320
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,310
Yeah.
Oh you mean selfishness?

321
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,230
Yeah.
Oh,

322
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:26,430
I see.
I see what you mean.

323
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,340
We're being being filled by themself 
like self dependence,

324
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,423
so,

325
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,500
oh yeah.
That's why I was reading something about

326
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,334
that just before we came down.
There's a newspaper article about when 

327
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:39,830
the free ball moisture's new papers for 
my sister

328
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:45,380
has been making the claim recently.
The aggressive behaviors associated with

329
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:48,140
inflated self esteem.
Now he puts that,

330
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,230
it's an interesting paper because he 
puts that in the following context.

331
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,483
You know,
in elementary schools and junior high 

332
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:58,280
schools across the United States,
the self esteem movement has been making

333
00:21:58,281 --> 00:22:03,281
great inroads and the self esteem 
movement basically proposes that as long

334
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,230
as you feel good about yourself,
nothing else matters.

335
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,093
And the problem with that is that it 
uses indiscriminate positive 

336
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:10,904
reinforcement,
which I regard actually as a form of 

337
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:13,454
abuse.
So it makes the world unpredictable or 

338
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:19,720
reward you regardless of what you do.
What I'm telling you essentially is that

339
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,030
what you do has zero meaning,
right?

340
00:22:23,031 --> 00:22:25,610
Because it's not informative.
You change your behavior,

341
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,840
nothing happens.
That means you had,

342
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,680
that means you're powerless basically.
Anyways.

343
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,450
Yeah.
I just saw an article in the globe about

344
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,930
that they were saying come studies done 
where they had the head,

345
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,823
uh,
ask a group of Japanese students of 

346
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,700
American students who had both taken.
Right.

347
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,553
Right.
And that's the same article taking math 

348
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:45,224
tests,
how they felt about themselves in the 

349
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,473
Japanese and scored a considerable 
amount of higher and they feel so good 

350
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:54,920
about themselves or the American kids at
that point I felt great.

351
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,721
Yeah.
Right,

352
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:56,450
right,
right.

353
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,283
Exactly.

354
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,320
Yeah.
Um,

355
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,023
but that's another point that if the 
whole point of behaviors to regulate 

356
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:09,280
your emotions and you're able to 
regulate your emotion that way,

357
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:10,660
why bother with,

358
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,990
well,
because they'd only,

359
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,090
no,
that's a good,

360
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,923
that's a perfectly good question.
That that ties into some other social 

361
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,330
psychological research on self 
deception.

362
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:19,164
You actually feeling good about yourself
despite the actual environment only 

363
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:26,380
worked with for a very short period of 
time.

364
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,230
That's the problem.
It's a good short term solution.

365
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,650
You know,
if you can,

366
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,220
if you fail an exam,
you can say,

367
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,360
well,
that's okay.

368
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,650
I'm still,
all right,

369
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,970
well that's,
that's fine.

370
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,420
Except that failing the exam might 
actually mean that you don't get through

371
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,620
graduate school for example,
like sooner or later these,

372
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,500
let's say these,
these,

373
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,363
uh,
these things that you're not going to 

374
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:50,540
pay attention to it,
that you've decided not to pay attention

375
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,810
to,
are going to accumulate and,

376
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:56,990
and beat you up.
So that's the problem.

377
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,930
We know neurotic solutions work.
That's why people use them,

378
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,850
right.
We know that it's true.

379
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,863
It's like
the problem is they don't work in the 

380
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:08,510
long term.
That's why,

381
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,613
let me read you some,
I still have answer answered your 

382
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,930
question.
I just sort of zipped around.

383
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,913
Um,
it's a complicated question and that's 

384
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:20,510
why I'm sort of hitting it from 
different perspectives.

385
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,670
And I know you addressed this issue 
before.

386
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,723
The thing that you're talking about has 
more to do with presuming that you're 

387
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:32,080
right,
despite all evidence to the contrary.

388
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,410
And that's,
that's,

389
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,393
that's worship of the self in the sense 
that you mean and I'm not going to talk 

390
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:43,270
about that anymore because the starting 
next week,

391
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:44,104
everything that we discussed for the 
rest of the course is directly related 

392
00:24:46,571 --> 00:24:47,920
to that.
Look.

393
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,203
We've given this diagram here.
We've talked a little bit about the 

394
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,184
structure of chaos,
the chaos that exists prior to the 

395
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:59,070
division of things into order in chaos.
So that's represented by the drag.

396
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,503
Okay.
We've talked about the unknown and it's 

397
00:25:01,931 --> 00:25:04,210
caused of aspect and it's negative 
aspect.

398
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,763
We've talked about the known in its 
beneficial and secure aspect and as 

399
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:10,774
tyranny,
but we've only talked about the 

400
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:16,510
individual in terms of the positive 
aspect,

401
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,403
which is the process that separates the 
sky and the earth or that distinguishes 

402
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:22,654
between order and chaos.
We've never talked about the negative 

403
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,114
aspect of the individual and I think 
that's probably why this question keeps 

404
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:29,674
popping up in your mind.
In the census we only have five sixths 

405
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,364
of the story and there's a big hole 
where the other sixth should be and 

406
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:39,790
that's what we're going to start to talk
about next week.

407
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,390
So part of the part of the question is 
like,

408
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,350
why is it,
why is it that?

409
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,433
Why would you ever say,
put yourself in a situation where you 

410
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:52,330
tell yourself a story that you know not 
to be true?

411
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,290
It's a very peculiar idea because 
animals don't do that.

412
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,124
I mean,
chimpanzees will use a little bit of 

413
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:58,834
deception on other chimpanzees,
but that's about as developed as 

414
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:05,450
deception seems to be in the animal 
came.

415
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,083
I don't think there's any evidence 
whatsoever that animal's actually ever 

416
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:15,450
fooled themselves,
but we do that all the time now.

417
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,480
That's part of the path it's defined in 
mythology is a very dangerous one.

418
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,993
Part of what we want to figure out is 
why would people be motivated to do 

419
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:26,420
that?
It's like part of it.

420
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,423
Part of the problem is is that you know,
you're cruising along your track and a 

421
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,284
piece of information emerges and you 
think that piece of information is so 

422
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:39,360
terrible that I can't deal with it.

423
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,010
So it's just shunted aside and you're in
a box,

424
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,920
which is your story that you know to be 
insufficient,

425
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,900
but you're also not sufficiently 
convinced of your own adaptive potential

426
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:52,973
to risk stepping outside of the box.
But then you're in in the little trap 

427
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:59,220
that gets smaller and smaller all the 
time.

428
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,953
There's a story in this manuscript about
a north African tribe called the mayor 

429
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,693
boats,
and they do this interesting little 

430
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,144
ritual to Scorpion.
I don't know if this is a true story or 

431
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,074
not.
It might just be a matter that doesn't 

432
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:18,804
matter.
You take a scarf and they put it in the 

433
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:24,180
sand and they draw a big circle around 
it.

434
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,703
And the Scorpion,
who's sort of upset about being 

435
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:29,670
surrounded by these larger creatures 
attempts to escape.

436
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,610
And as soon as it comes up to the,
the groove in the sand,

437
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,940
it just runs around the circle and we'll
cross the border.

438
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,680
So then the mayor both takes the circle 
and divides it in half and the skirt and

439
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:42,420
zips around inside the half,
sir.

440
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,003
And then the mirror divides the circle 
into quarters and the Scorpion is 

441
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,770
getting more and more frantic all the 
time,

442
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,350
confined to the smaller and smaller 
space.

443
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,410
Finally,
they bisect the area so drastically that

444
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,570
the Scorpion can't move and then it 
stings itself.

445
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,463
Yeah.

446
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,953
That's a good story of what happens to 
you if you constantly believe that 

447
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,144
you're in a position,
it's actually better than the one that 

448
00:28:10,411 --> 00:28:13,260
you're in.
I do.

449
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,243
I'm telling you that story again because
I do think it's related directly to the 

450
00:28:16,771 --> 00:28:18,530
question that you're at,
that you're asking.

451
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,090
Yeah,
yeah.

452
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:26,550
Well,
have you started reading paradise lost?

453
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,523
Well,
that's a story about what happens when 

454
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,380
you think that what you know is all that
needs to be.

455
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:32,370
No,
that's right.

456
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:33,204
That's,
that's the adoption of the position of 

457
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:35,484
false on students and the consequences 
of that are that you ended up in a 

458
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,960
situation that's very much analogous to 
that of the skirting.

459
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,633
So

460
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,200
I don't know whether to,
I don't really know whether to close who

461
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:07,190
was in this discussion and start the new
section when you finish it.

462
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,153
Cause we haven't talked about these 
different forms of the normalist 

463
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,274
information yet.
Well we should just go to the next 

464
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:22,750
section.
Let's take a look into

465
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,130
this.
I guess what we'll do,

466
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,023
I'll be

467
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,303
okay.

468
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,603
One of the things that we discussed just
before the class broke was how and why 

469
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,790
is it the stories came to be 
constructive and it's part of the reason

470
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:49,624
that we were interested in you because 
it's obvious that some of the stories 

471
00:29:51,701 --> 00:29:53,650
that you tell yourself,
you don't actually know.

472
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:59,050
For example,
if you would have read Mark Mesopotamian

473
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:02,670
creation myth three years ago,
my guess is that

474
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,303
it would obstruct you as bizarre tale of
not as something that had any meaning 

475
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:14,170
that was relevant to the present time.
It's not that easy to figure out what it

476
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,004
might mean for sort of go on to be 
elected as the highest of all the gods 

477
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,314
and then go out and kind of have to drag
it from the purely a literal 

478
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,310
perspective.
That doesn't seem to be a story that has

479
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:29,040
very much meaning.
Um,

480
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,300
but it's a very old story.

481
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:36,730
And if you track its development 
historically,

482
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,850
you can see how the idea is that we're 
embedded in that story

483
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,723
conditioned all sorts of behaviors that 
we actually engaging in as far as this 

484
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:52,681
is of course open to to any about 
historical interpretation.

485
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,990
But it seems to me that you can make a 
reasonable case that the Mesopotamian,

486
00:30:56,991 --> 00:30:57,824
the idea that there's something divine 
about the capacity of conquer the 

487
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:01,804
unknown and to construct things as a 
consequence developed into the Egyptian 

488
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,650
idea that the optimal pharaoh with 
someone who's similar,

489
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:12,370
Paisley embodied the state and updated 
the state.

490
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,850
And it's not much of a leap from that to
the Judeo Christian perspective,

491
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:21,040
which says that there's something 
eternal,

492
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,320
immortal,
and divine about each person.

493
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,640
Now,
if you accept that line of logic,

494
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,780
then you have to also accept the idea 
that you can act out stories by yourself

495
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:39,010
and with others in huge groups without 
understanding what the stories mean.

496
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:41,583
And the next step of logic after that is
that if you don't understand what the 

497
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:47,170
stories mean,
what form did they make?

498
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:51,010
How is it that they're coded?
But how is it that they exist?

499
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,050
They're not part of the objective world 
so to speak.

500
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:57,400
They're not something that you can talk 
about unless you tell stories.

501
00:31:57,401 --> 00:32:01,870
They're not something you know.
At least you don't know them well enough

502
00:32:01,871 --> 00:32:02,704
to say what they mean,
but nonetheless they conditioned all of 

503
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:05,804
your behaviors.
So the question then is what form did 

504
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:10,090
that take?
That's what this diagram was adapting.

505
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,940
Illustrate
every level of analysis.

506
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,733
The story you tell yourself is informed 
by a variety of sources of information 

507
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:27,610
ranging from the purely behavioral to 
the entirely abstract,

508
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,773
which is to say how your question is how
is it that I should have and the answer 

509
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:38,341
is well you should act and here's a list
of rules that are explicit or you should

510
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:40,154
act like person a acts,
which means that you should imitate 

511
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,394
them,
which is what you'll do naturally 

512
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:48,650
anyways or all act out some hypothetical
sequences and you can,

513
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,020
you can coffee them and that would be 
the whole drama.

514
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:54,800
Or I can tell you a story and you can 
absorb whatever information you can from

515
00:32:54,801 --> 00:32:56,980
that.
Use that to govern your behavior instead

516
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,023
of the stories you tell yourself are 
constructed as a consequence of your 

517
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:02,684
encounter with information at all sorts 
of different levels of analysis and 

518
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:09,830
different stories are coded at different
levels of analysis.

519
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,260
And it strikes me that the farther out 
you go,

520
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,890
as I said before,
the farther out you know,

521
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:23,480
which is the more superordinate the 
story is the less

522
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,473
explicit the story becomes,
which is to say it's more coated in 

523
00:33:29,181 --> 00:33:31,850
procedural knowledge and also the older 
it gets,

524
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,923
which is I do think it's reasonable to 
think that as you move up the hierarchy 

525
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,513
he moved back in time.
That's a good way of looking at it so 

526
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,730
that the stories that you act out at the
most superordinate level of analysis are

527
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,740
unconscious.
And what does that mean?

528
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,963
It means that everyone just act them out
and could hardly even describe them or 

529
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,370
we have some stories about them and 
that's the best we've been able to do.

530
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,490
And no one actually says,
well this is what that story means.

531
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,690
We just act as if the story's true and 
we act as if it's true because,

532
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,050
well that's a,
that's a tough question at least because

533
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:06,884
it works.

534
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,993
And the funny thing is is that the same 
story keeps emerging in culture after 

535
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:12,644
culture.
So it kind of leads you to the 

536
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:14,264
conclusion that there is actually one 
story that works only who knows if 

537
00:34:18,231 --> 00:34:21,290
that's true.
So anyways,

538
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,610
we,
we tried to tie that,

539
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,080
this idea to the idea that there are 
different memory systems.

540
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:28,803
Does that make sense?
I mean did the under d the understand 

541
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,634
how it is that you can figure out how to
behave without being able to come up 

542
00:34:34,461 --> 00:34:36,440
with a description of how it is that you
behave?

543
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,420
Is that,
that seems reasonably clear to everyone.

544
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,254
I mean,
we are conditioning each other's 

545
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:45,020
behavior all the time.
That's the basic idea.

546
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,213
It's right.
Whenever we're engaged in any sort of 

547
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:50,840
interaction,
we're modifying our own behavior and the

548
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:51,674
behavior of others.
And we do that to everyone we encounter 

549
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,003
and everyone does it.
Everyone does it over a huge expanse of 

550
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,640
time.
And as a consequence,

551
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,590
a pattern emerges that we more or less 
all,

552
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,890
etc. And when we don't accept that 
there's a big fight and someone wins and

553
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:07,730
someone loses and whoever wins their 
behavior continues in the future.

554
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,400
So we gathered patterns of behavior over
time and integrate them into a statement

555
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:16,640
that's more or less coherent.
And what we're trying to do is to figure

556
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:19,870
out what's the essence of that coherent 
and long lasting statement.

557
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,733
I agree with what you're saying that um,
people can't come up with a conscious 

558
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,090
representation of how they act,
you know,

559
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,520
or a lot of things.
But I think they do know,

560
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,180
um,
of ways of acquiring,

561
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,820
even if they can't consciously say,
well,

562
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,120
somebody else is doing and then they 
want to give it those behaviors

563
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,880
themselves.
They know that they should imitate other

564
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:41,850
people.
Absolutely.

565
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,693
And I,
that seems to me that's a very peculiar 

566
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:45,624
thing and it's the thing that I think 
provides the strongest evidence for the 

567
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:52,110
existence of something like humans 
archetype.

568
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,210
Because one of the things you could say 
is,

569
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,890
well,
why do you admire someone?

570
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,730
Well you might say it's because they can
get something that you want.

571
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,390
Well that's a pretty mechanistic 
explanation and you don't really have to

572
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:04,224
pause at any underlying predisposition.
It's just that you have to want 

573
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:11,610
something and you have to be able to 
observe that someone else gets it.

574
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:12,444
And maybe that's sufficient.
But it strikes me that the capacity do 

575
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:18,030
admire someone is more deeply rooted 
than that.

576
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:22,290
And it's not purely driven by 
observations that someone else gets what

577
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:23,124
you want more effectively.
And it seems to me that that's actually 

578
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:28,710
one of the things that bootstrap to 
children's development can.

579
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,380
I can remember when I was very young,
well not all that,

580
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:32,550
you know,
you'll get some great one.

581
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,980
How much I admired the boy across the 
street who was in grade three and for me

582
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,400
that was a huge gap at that time.
And he was someone I want it to be like.

583
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:45,510
And I don't really think it was perhaps 
it was at least in part because he could

584
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:46,344
do things I couldn't,
but it seemed to be something that was 

585
00:36:47,971 --> 00:36:50,130
more global than that.
It wasn't,

586
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,233
it wasn't built up.
I think from repeated observations that 

587
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:54,720
uh,
you know,

588
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,440
he could ride a bike faster than me or,
but you know,

589
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,040
maybe that's maybe,
maybe that was,

590
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:02,730
do you think it's just that same sort of
idea but didn't buy it in a more general

591
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:04,200
way?
Like he knows what to do.

592
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,250
I mean there's just,
yeah,

593
00:37:05,251 --> 00:37:07,740
I'm comfortable in doing that.

594
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,350
Well true enough,
true enough.

595
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:11,184
But like
that you sense that his story is better 

596
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,444
than you are.
Okay,

597
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,770
fine.
Fair enough.

598
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,053
But it is also the case that children 
start to imitate at such an early age 

599
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:24,774
that it's hard to believe that the 
reason they're doing it is because they 

600
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,830
drawn an inference.
You know what I mean?

601
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,300
Because like kids,
kids,

602
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,360
there is some evidence that newborns can
imitate.

603
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,210
You may want to take facial gestures.
It's debatable,

604
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,710
but it doesn't take very long after that
to find,

605
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,790
it isn't much after birth that children 
do imitate.

606
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,893
And you can say that's because they are 
driven by these sorts of mechanistic 

607
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:50,604
inferences.
But it looks to me like it's something 

608
00:37:51,511 --> 00:37:53,250
more,
more profound.

609
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,203
I want to just tell you one other piece 
of evidence that's something equivalent 

610
00:37:57,331 --> 00:38:00,000
to this.
People will have to Rett Syndrome,

611
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,343
types of disinhibition,
disinhibition of procedural memory 

612
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:05,820
habits is what it looks like.

613
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,043
Uh,
if you feed them little bits of 

614
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,450
antipsychotic medication alone,
often damp and out there motor ticks,

615
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,820
but they're called techs and the people 
take them a ticket,

616
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,820
something like that.
You know that ticks can be very complex.

617
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,654
Like people who are,
have tourette's syndrome can do very 

618
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:20,994
complex things.
I saw a film once of a sculptor who had 

619
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,880
two rats and he was a realistic 
sculpture and he was very,

620
00:38:26,881 --> 00:38:27,714
very good at it.
He had two nets unbelievably badly and 

621
00:38:30,401 --> 00:38:34,380
his motor behaviors completely 
dysregulated and basically he'd sit down

622
00:38:34,381 --> 00:38:37,840
and kind of motor tic would get them and
so he'd get up and walk over and then he

623
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:41,890
could sort of control it.
So we adjust the stereo and that was it.

624
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:42,724
Like it was all involuntary behavior 
until they go up near the Stereo and 

625
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:45,714
then you can control it enough to to 
just add his twist to the behavior and 

626
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,534
then he'd come back and sit down and he 
was like bouncing up and down like this 

627
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:53,330
all the time and that's how we do with 
sculpture.

628
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,233
Like you'd be sitting and he'd have a 
tick and he'd get up and he move and 

629
00:38:57,311 --> 00:38:59,930
then has gone from being over there.
He pick up his knife and make it

630
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,550
two rats.
The reason I'm telling you this story is

631
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,130
because people with Tourette's syndrome 
are very,

632
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:10,540
very,
very imitative.

633
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:11,933
Like there's a story actually where I 
used to live in northern Alberta a 

634
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,930
little bit farther north.
There's a group of how to rights.

635
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,080
I think they were a hunter rights.
They might've been mennonites.

636
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,953
Anyways,
the problem with these isolated 

637
00:39:21,521 --> 00:39:24,250
religious populations as they tend to 
get someone in bread,

638
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,360
and one of the consequences of this in 
this northern colony was very high rates

639
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:29,260
of Tourette Syndrome.

640
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:33,130
One of the,
one of the stories I remember about that

641
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,510
was all of these,

642
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,960
I think you were mennonites sitting in a
church together.

643
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,460
A bird flew into the church and they all
flat,

644
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,123
large proportion of population 
involuntary flap their hands because 

645
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:47,250
they were imitating the bird and two 
rights.

646
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,533
One of the things the two reds also does
to people is give them an uncanny 

647
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,283
ability to mimic and caricatures or 
other people by copying their motor 

648
00:39:55,531 --> 00:39:56,750
habits.
Yeah.

649
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,043
Anyways,
the reason I'm telling you this is 

650
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:04,230
because it looks like the capacity to 
mimic is something that's underneath the

651
00:40:04,231 --> 00:40:06,750
capacity to form abstract 
representations.

652
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,060
It's more,
it's more primordial.

653
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,260
Oh,
so this is,

654
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,140
this is just to say that it's 
biological.

655
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,330
It's hard wiring.
That's right.

656
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,510
That's what I'm saying now.
That's why I was talking about the why.

657
00:40:18,511 --> 00:40:19,344
I think there's some support for the 
union notion of an architect with 

658
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:22,524
regards to the mutation is you can come 
up with a good explanation for why 

659
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:29,640
people imitated by saying,
I see that what you do is more efficient

660
00:40:29,641 --> 00:40:30,474
than what I do,
and I think that does drive invitation 

661
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:33,174
to some degree,
but there's also another level of 

662
00:40:34,261 --> 00:40:36,000
invitation and it's,
it's more

663
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,150
how do you,
how do you select what?

664
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,850
What's the,
what's the selection process?

665
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,320
Why the boy that you focused on?

666
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,410
Well,
that's a good,

667
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,670
that's a good question.
I mean,

668
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,703
yeah,
I guess I don't know what level of 

669
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:50,850
analysis you're asking that question.
Do you mean in general,

670
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,840
why do people do it?

671
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,340
You're the way you're describing 
mutation without the inferential part.

672
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,903
I mean,
it's not as a result then what's the 

673
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:00,920
process?

674
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,070
That's a good,
now that's it.

675
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,250
That's a very good question.
I guess I would,

676
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,793
hm.

677
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,170
I don't know the answer to that.
I guess I would.

678
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,620
I would surmise,
did I ever show you that picture,

679
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:18,750
that eastern picture of the recurrent 
artists sat?

680
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,570
Fuck you remember that?
Yeah.

681
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,543
The image of basically the image of the 
savior that's constantly recurring 

682
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,050
throughout time.
I think that,

683
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,093
I think that the notion that we have an 
innate sense of what's appropriate 

684
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,030
globally is true.
So I would say that,

685
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,470
but it's,
it's,

686
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,780
it's,
it's like with gray leg geese I guess is

687
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,310
a great like goose will attach itself to
something.

688
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:49,850
So it has the capacity to develop an 
exceptional attachment,

689
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:51,583
but it also has to see something in its 
environment for that capacity to 

690
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:56,990
manifest itself.
Right?

691
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:57,824
That same printing,
and I suspect that's what our general 

692
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:00,824
proclivity is like.
It's like say it's analogous to the 

693
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,413
notion of the possibility for developing
condition fears more easily to some 

694
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:09,380
phenomenal than others.

695
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,630
So like if I want to make you afraid of 
something,

696
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,183
say I take you into the lab and I show 
you some pictures of an electric outlet 

697
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,993
and I give you an electric shock.
Every time you see one or I show you a 

698
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,560
picture of a snake and I give you an 
electric shock,

699
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,453
every time you see it,
you'll develop conditioned fear to the 

700
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:28,040
picture of the snake faster than to the 
picture of the electric outlet.

701
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,413
So it's not exactly as if you're 
innately afraid of the snake is just 

702
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:33,674
that in the presence of a snake you're,
it's easier for you to develop fear and 

703
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:39,224
my guess is,
but we kind of have the same or similar 

704
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:45,260
sort of mechanism operating with regards
to heroic behavior.

705
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,430
It's it's,
we have the capacity this to no one when

706
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:54,431
we see it and it's at the level of a 
global pattern recognition.

707
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:58,610
So that's a speculation

708
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,003
isn't everything that we know how to do.
Irritation or their child learns how to 

709
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:06,490
speak by imitating.

710
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,883
Well that's a good,
that's another good example of the same 

711
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:13,470
sort of things the child does not 
exactly learn to speak by imitating.

712
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,720
Child has to have the capacity to speak.
It's like if you take a chimpanzee,

713
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,820
no matter what you do,
the chimpanzee,

714
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,220
it's not going to learn to be a concert 
pianist.

715
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:24,803
It's because the chimpanzee doesn't have
the capacity to imitate that sort of 

716
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:28,374
behavior.
It's also the case that no matter what 

717
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:30,744
you do with chimpanzee,
let's start going to learn to talk 

718
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,210
because the chimpanzee doesn't have the 
capacity to imitate speech.

719
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,073
Now,
some people say that's because of the 

720
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:41,490
structure of this,
the morphology of its speech unit,

721
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,980
but they're not very good at 
manipulating symbols either.

722
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,170
You know,
they can get a little ways,

723
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:49,680
but not very far.
A child will pick up language very,

724
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:50,550
very rapidly.

725
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,010
What's that never hears?
Well then no,

726
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,350
and there also seems to be a certain 
critical period,

727
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,400
like if a child isn't exposed to 
language within a certain span of time,

728
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,653
say at least by the age of 13 and 
there's not gonna be any language 

729
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:08,230
development.
It's not,

730
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,350
and it's not just imitation.
You see,

731
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,800
because the grammatical children make 
standard types of grammatical errors

732
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,620
that they didn't hear their parents 
make.

733
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,370
So it isn't straight invitation.
That's what skinner thought.

734
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:29,000
Part of the way it's not true because 
children don't hear what Bait,

735
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,960
the grammatical errors that children 
make.

736
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,943
Parents don't make.

737
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,600
So they
know.

738
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,490
They act as if they learned moles.
Yeah.

739
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,930
Right.
But that's different,

740
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:40,770
right?
It's different.

741
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,990
Yeah.
That language is,

742
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:43,824
the language is not invitation.
Like I have a problem with them is very 

743
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:52,401
much a and hardwired right.
Capacity Children's say words or coach,

744
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,030
they have syntax ability that they've 
never heard from them.

745
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:57,923
Right.
They can put him down and work together 

746
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,043
and create sentences that spontaneously 
they know that they've never heard 

747
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,393
before in your life.
Therefore I don't think it's really 

748
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,670
comparable,
you know,

749
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,840
just that.
Um,

750
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,353
I think that both language and the myths
that we understand that we about layout 

751
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,110
or don't understand fully tap into the 
unconscious because you know,

752
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:22,944
like these men,
we understand them have symbols just 

753
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:29,790
like the snake now and that tax more 
into our unconscious.

754
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,190
Then you know,
the electric,

755
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,770
I think it's reasonable.
Noam Chomsky,

756
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,190
whose name you're undoubtedly familiar 
with is very famous nyt.

757
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,523
He's positive,
the existence of a language acquisition 

758
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,400
device,
which is not really all that informative

759
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,000
at the top concept because it doesn't 
really say what it is,

760
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:49,260
but he says,
well,

761
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,273
you need the capacity to develop 
language as well as exposure to the 

762
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:55,530
appropriate environmental stimuli 
nights.

763
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,170
I would,
I really do thing.

764
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,320
But something similar operates at the 
mythological level.

765
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,303
It's like we're hardwired to appreciate 
the structure of a narrative we now 

766
00:46:07,661 --> 00:46:08,820
otherwise you don't see,
I mean,

767
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:12,300
how else do you explain the capacity of 
children to be interested in stories?

768
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:14,460
It's not like you teach them that it's 
the,

769
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,980
if they weren't bloody well interested 
in stories,

770
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:17,814
you couldn't teach them anything.
It's like that's the precondition what 

771
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,810
you can grab that and then use it to 
final information into them.

772
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:27,030
But you don't teach that it's their 
first.

773
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,440
And I think that's,
um,

774
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,440
well I think that's a form of grammar 
and really what we're looking at in,

775
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,160
in large part because the grammar of 
mythologies.

776
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:39,840
So like your recognition of your Roy boy
was like a pattern.

777
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,853
I mean,
it's not like a process of inference 

778
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:46,620
from just discrete behaviors right.
Boy does this and I know.

779
00:46:46,621 --> 00:46:47,251
Yeah,
right.

780
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:48,084
I mean that may contribute to it,
but it's around it's recognition of a 

781
00:46:50,071 --> 00:46:51,750
pattern of behavior.
That's right.

782
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,573
He matches.
That's exactly right cause he matches a 

783
00:46:56,161 --> 00:46:56,994
pattern that's late in the ideas or 
could it be a pattern you learn as a 

784
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:05,970
child with your parents?
Well it could be.

785
00:47:05,971 --> 00:47:07,980
I mean,
yeah you can't.

786
00:47:07,981 --> 00:47:12,750
You can make a plausible case for the 
mechanistic,

787
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,113
for the mechanistic acquisition of some 
of this sort of thing except for the 

788
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:22,551
fact that imitative behavior seems in 
some ways pre abstract and also that

789
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,560
I don't think children learn to be 
interested in stories.

790
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,390
I really don't.
I think they have that first.

791
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,033
Do you have anything useful comes to us 
in the form of a story or a pattern of 

792
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,054
some sorts and it makes sense 
evolutionarily that there's going to be 

793
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:41,650
huge selective pressure to be interested
in patterns and stories.

794
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:42,820
Well,
if that's how they,

795
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,680
that's how you learned to behave.
I mean,

796
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:46,420
yes,
it isn't the case that,

797
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:48,670
well,
here's an example.

798
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:53,200
This is a good example.
I went into Montreal last week and talk,

799
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,093
I'm working on an experimental project.
They're dealing with children who fight 

800
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:58,744
in school.
So we have a population of kids that 

801
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,940
were tracked from kindergarten right 
till they graduated basically.

802
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,163
And in six of the first 10 years of 
their schooling they were rated by 

803
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:09,364
teachers for fighting.
So we can identify kids who are stable 

804
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:16,400
fighters over the long term travel.
It's interesting about these kids,

805
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,553
you know,
you hear the standard routine about 

806
00:48:18,581 --> 00:48:20,020
antisocial personalities.

807
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,650
They don't feel any anxiety,
for example.

808
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:29,220
But these kids are extraordinarily 
anxious and I just had an honors student

809
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,263
write me a thesis about men who abused 
their wives enough to be brought to the 

810
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,870
attention of courts and convicted.
Um,

811
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,930
they tend to be criminal as you'd 
suspect,

812
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:42,610
have lower Iqs,
but they're very,

813
00:48:42,611 --> 00:48:44,650
very,
very anxious and depressed,

814
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,950
which again doesn't fit very well with 
the classic picture that he,

815
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,793
social personality,
it looks more like an antisocial 

816
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,210
personality,
feels anxious,

817
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:55,030
but can't use that anxiety to regulate 
their behavior.

818
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,630
Those two phenomena being separable,
just to say you could be very,

819
00:48:58,631 --> 00:48:59,464
very anxious,
but unless you know what to do with the 

820
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,040
information,
that's not very useful and there's a lot

821
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,620
of reasons for believing.
That's true.

822
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,300
Um,
anyways,

823
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,660
I still want to stay focused on your 
question.

824
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,250
Okay.
So you have these kids.

825
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:14,050
I've tried to figure out what are these 
kids like?

826
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,113
Well,
they're aggressive because they fight 

827
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:17,644
and teachers rate them is fighting.
That's the one thing we really know 

828
00:49:19,121 --> 00:49:19,954
about them,
but they're very anxious and they're 

829
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:21,364
very depressed.
I think the gentleman I'm working with 

830
00:49:23,981 --> 00:49:27,430
there has been studying antisocial 
behavior in children for a long time.

831
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,500
Uh,
he's,

832
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,190
I've told you before,
the children's aggressive behavior peaks

833
00:49:32,191 --> 00:49:34,000
at two and then goes down hill.
From there.

834
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,583
You're more aggressive at two,
then you are at any other time in your 

835
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:37,834
life.
It gets socialized somewhere around 

836
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:41,950
between two and three.
You learn these behavioral patterns.

837
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:45,220
What happens if you don't learn?
That's the question.

838
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:48,070
That's what's relevant to your topic.
Well,

839
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,630
trump Nye said he's the character who 
rented this study said,

840
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:53,883
you know,
when you're an adult and you don't fit 

841
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:56,860
into your peer group,
like you really don't fit in,

842
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:01,360
you get put in prison said these kids in
kindergarten,

843
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,470
they're already in prison.

844
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,383
There's just no walls around them.
But just to say that because they 

845
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,880
haven't learned the proper behavioral 
rituals,

846
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:11,403
they're ostracized by their peer groups 
so they don't fit into the standard 

847
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:17,014
hierarchy outside that hierarchy.
They build their own hierarchy and it's 

848
00:50:21,431 --> 00:50:24,640
based on force,
the toughest kid.

849
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:29,670
So all the kids who get thrown out 
cluster and the toughest kid wins.

850
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:31,003
And that's the genesis.
I'm going only the anti social 

851
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,150
personality,
but that whole anti social lifestyle,

852
00:50:36,151 --> 00:50:36,984
it's the same in prisons.
The dominant tire can prison is the 

853
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,380
meanest son of a bitch rules.
Well,

854
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:45,320
that's because outside of the proper 
dominance hierarchy,

855
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,383
the property development,
it's hard to be normal socialized 

856
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:48,554
behavior.
That's the default strategy for the 

857
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:52,910
erection of dominance.
Higher at the most mackerel,

858
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,170
uh,
moral system.

859
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,180
That's what needs are as well.
It's the most,

860
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,390
it's the most natural.
If you're,

861
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,400
if you're very impaired,
that's the sort of freeze the motion.

862
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,231
That's right.
It's,

863
00:51:02,231 --> 00:51:03,830
it's the most primitive then,
I mean,

864
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,030
in a sense it's,
well,

865
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:09,080
it's what you'll come to if you're not 
given anything else.

866
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:10,640
Right,
right.

867
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:11,563
That's right.
It's what you'll come to if you're not 

868
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:14,870
given anything else.
That's a good way of putting it.

869
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,670
So when you say,
well,

870
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,990
it's very important to pick up on the 
appropriate sorts of behaviors as well.

871
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,880
Just an a story about why it's so 
important.

872
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,110
And if you don't learn to be properly 
prosocial,

873
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:27,020
like these kids,
they don't,

874
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:29,390
if someone else has heard,
they won't go over to comfort them.

875
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,170
They don't know how to,
even if you're highly aggressive and you

876
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:35,120
find a load and you're quite anxious and
depressed,

877
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,100
if you're helpful and you know how to 
share,

878
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,670
that's enough to get you into the group.
It's,

879
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:40,643
it's,
if you're lacking even the most 

880
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:45,560
rudimentary forms of,
of nonaggressive social behavior,

881
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,610
then you were an outcast.

882
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,443
And that's the consequence of not 
picking up these initial for whatever 

883
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:50,930
reason.
So yeah,

884
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:54,380
the consequences are very severe.
So these kids,

885
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:55,214
by the way,
I think they're the ones that are 

886
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:58,570
indiscriminate,
reinforced because that's how you ruined

887
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:01,880
a child.
It's like you make sure that the rewards

888
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:02,714
and punishments they received are 
completely uncorrelated with their 

889
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:09,821
behavior because that makes them 
powerless completely and makes the world

890
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:11,864
very frustrating place.
I remember I had a friend in 

891
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,104
adolescence,
he drove a white truck and that truck 

892
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:20,114
was dented on.
Every quarter panel was a pickup truck 

893
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,623
including insight quarter panels where 
various parts of people's bodies had 

894
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,830
come into contact with,
with the dash or the roof or whatever

895
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,780
before he was 16 he racked four or five 
vehicles.

896
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:41,270
The most dramatic example of which was 
one day I went and a job and on the main

897
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,090
street of our small town in the middle 
of winter,

898
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,790
I looked up the street about three 
blocks in.

899
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:51,791
There was a small convenience store 
there with a truck parked halfway inside

900
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:54,134
of it covered with the tarp and it was a
white truck and I thought that's very 

901
00:52:57,381 --> 00:52:59,150
likely my friend.
Anyways,

902
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,570
he was indiscriminately reinforced 
because every time he wrecked the truck,

903
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,940
he just gotten underway.
You know what ever said stop.

904
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:13,400
Anyways.
Okay,

905
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,800
so back now,
were there other,

906
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,340
are there other questions?
Okay,

907
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:20,450
let's have a question.
Yeah.

908
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,793
Okay.
So it's the difference between someone 

909
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:25,590
like,
I don't know much about would happen,

910
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,220
maybe Jesus

911
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,700
or something.
Cool.

912
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,103
Could you say that a lot of the 
behaviors that they learned came from 

913
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:34,470
their parents and then they added to 
that in their,

914
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,393
in their lifetime.
So is the difference between that and a 

915
00:53:37,481 --> 00:53:40,380
and a and a child who doesn't,
who's antisocial,

916
00:53:40,381 --> 00:53:41,214
whatever it is that they are there,
they are not given the opportunity to 

917
00:53:43,711 --> 00:53:44,560
learn,
um,

918
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:48,480
those adaptive behaviors or social 
behaviors,

919
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:50,500
whatever the cause of the peer group 
ostracized.

920
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:51,721
Yeah.
Well,

921
00:53:51,721 --> 00:53:53,500
I guess,
I guess if you,

922
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:55,500
if you thought about it in this terms,

923
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,730
well those kids are even followed up at 
this point.

924
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:05,690
It's hard to say.
It's hard to say because they don't ever

925
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:07,760
have anyone reliably that they can 
depend on.

926
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:10,970
Even in Charlotte.
So like this

927
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,350
success here is a precondition for 
success here.

928
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,693
It's right.
These kids are identifiable at 

929
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:19,634
kindergarten.
It's like they didn't even get to the 

930
00:54:21,141 --> 00:54:23,180
point where they're acceptable to a peer
group,

931
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:28,370
so the question is what happens to you 
if you don't even make it here?

932
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,790
I guess what happens is that you're 
thrown out into chaos where you organize

933
00:54:31,791 --> 00:54:34,400
yourself according to the principal we 
just discussed,

934
00:54:34,401 --> 00:54:37,430
which is what can you do when you can't 
do anything else?

935
00:54:37,431 --> 00:54:40,340
The answer being hurt,
right?

936
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,260
It doesn't really,
and that that,

937
00:54:42,261 --> 00:54:43,094
of course it's pretty much just 
dependent on your on how mean you are 

938
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:47,060
and your size I guess.

939
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,063
Okay.

940
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:58,523
Okay.
I'm going to read you something from 

941
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,073
tolstoy in this will help us discuss the
different sorts of different manners in 

942
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:09,420
which and the homeless inflammation can 
present itself.

943
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,040
This is in toasters convention 
confessions.

944
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,413
I remember that when I was 11 years old 
at high school boy named Devola Dinka 

945
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,343
now long since dead,
visited us one Sunday with an 

946
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,240
announcement of the latest discovery 
made at school.

947
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:29,340
If discovery was that there is no god 
and the things they were teaching us,

948
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:30,174
we're nothing but fairy tales.
This was in 1838 I remember how this 

949
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:34,614
news captured the interest of my older 
brothers even let me in on their 

950
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:40,980
discussions.
I remember that we were all very excited

951
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:44,040
that we took this news to be both 
engaging in entirely possible,

952
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,493
okay

953
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,333
tolstoy's confession or basically a 
description of the consequences of 

954
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:58,281
having been exposed to that piece of 
information on his entire life and it is

955
00:55:58,411 --> 00:56:02,820
the case or it was the case for him that
at least by his own interpretation,

956
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:05,843
the dramatic consequences of that 
discovery didn't manifest themselves 

957
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:11,760
fully in his consciousness until he was 
middle aged and well,

958
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,960
well established.
As a successful author say,

959
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:18,510
well,
he hit a piece of,

960
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,493
he hit a piece of anomalous information 
while he was pursuing some relatively 

961
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,733
trivial task and was unable to determine
the proper magnitude of that anomalous 

962
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:30,094
information for perhaps 40 years.
It kept moving up the hierarchy of 

963
00:56:34,511 --> 00:56:37,030
stories destroying them as it went

964
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:41,990
because his,
as Nietzsche pointed out,

965
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,163
Judeo Christian morality which 
characterized the behavior of the 

966
00:56:49,641 --> 00:56:54,641
Russians in 1838 is predicated on the 
idea that there is a god.

967
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,730
If that's the most fundamental 
presupposition,

968
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,540
and if you blow that presupposition,
then you blow the morality.

969
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,360
Now,
you may not know that it's gone,

970
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,793
but the fact just the fact that you 
don't know that it's gone doesn't 

971
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:09,854
necessarily mean that it will.
It'll disappear whether you know it's 

972
00:57:16,341 --> 00:57:17,620
gone or not.
Neat.

973
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,910
You said at one point that if you kill 
the roots of a tree,

974
00:57:19,911 --> 00:57:23,270
eventually the branches will die.
You might take a long period of time.

975
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:24,943
Anyways,
tolstoy said since ancient times when 

976
00:57:28,941 --> 00:57:29,774
the life of which I do know something 
began people who knew the arguments 

977
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:33,734
concerning the vanity of life,
the arguments that reveal to me its 

978
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:41,060
meaninglessness live nonetheless 
bringing to life a meaning of their own.

979
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:44,630
Since the time when people somehow began
to live,

980
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,380
this meaning of life is being with them 
and they have led this life up to my own

981
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,214
time.
Everything that is in me and around me 

982
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:52,154
is the fruit of their knowledge of life.
The very tools of thought by which I 

983
00:57:56,691 --> 00:57:59,240
judge life and condemn it were created 
not by me,

984
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:00,074
but by them.
I was born educated and have grown up 

985
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:05,270
thanks to them.
They dug the iron,

986
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,193
taught us how to cut the timber,
tamed the cattle and the horses showed 

987
00:58:08,841 --> 00:58:09,674
us how to sow crops and live together.
They brought order to our lives as the 

988
00:58:13,641 --> 00:58:14,474
mythological ancestors.
They taught me how to think and how to 

989
00:58:17,751 --> 00:58:18,584
speak.
I had their offspring nurse by them 

990
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,123
reared by the talk,
by them I think according to their 

991
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:27,270
thoughts,
their words and their,

992
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,480
I have proved to them that it is all 
meaningless.

993
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,973
I mean have them with me as it happens 
with everyone who contracts that fatal 

994
00:58:35,521 --> 00:58:36,354
internal disease.
At first there were the insignificant 

995
00:58:38,431 --> 00:58:41,190
symptoms of an ailment which the patient
ignores.

996
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:44,803
Then these symptoms recur more and more 
frequently until they merge into one 

997
00:58:47,151 --> 00:58:47,984
continuous duration of suffering.
The suffering increases and before he 

998
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:54,980
can turn around the patient discovers 
what he already knew.

999
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:56,803
The thing he had taken for a mere in 
disposition is in fact the most 

1000
00:58:59,571 --> 00:59:02,050
important thing on earth to him is in 
fact,

1001
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,030
and that's the story of the information 
moving up.

1002
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:10,031
Thy are historics I think.
I guess this is conference there.

1003
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,013
You could draw an analogy to,
to discovering that you have a fatal 

1004
00:59:14,331 --> 00:59:15,200
illness.
I mean,

1005
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:18,470
let's say you wake up one morning and he
says,

1006
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,270
and he makes them,
he uses the metaphor,

1007
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,350
you have a stitch in your side,
anything.

1008
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,520
Well that's going to make it much more 
difficult to get to work.

1009
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,920
So you construe the anomalous event with
regards to to a particular story.

1010
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:35,083
You say,
well,

1011
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,630
this,
this thing which I am now in calibrating

1012
00:59:38,631 --> 00:59:42,000
has the status of a minor inconvenience,
right?

1013
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:46,880
When you say it's only going to 
interfere with a story that's nested way

1014
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:47,714
down,
but it doesn't go away and perhaps it 

1015
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,860
gets worse and you start to wonder,
well,

1016
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,290
perhaps it's more serious than I 
thought,

1017
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,124
which means there's more to this bit of 
enormous information that first met the 

1018
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:58,994
eye.
It sort enough the next day so that you 

1019
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:03,800
have to stay in bed.
So then you start thinking,

1020
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:04,903
well,
what's the proper level of analysis to 

1021
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:09,320
consider this anomalous information with
respect to,

1022
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,593
and you don't know,
well they need to go to the doctor and 

1023
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:15,560
the doctor says,
well you need some more tests.

1024
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,830
While this information is starting to 
think of it,

1025
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:20,003
this is the best way to think of it.
It's only metaphor that it's only 

1026
01:00:22,341 --> 01:00:25,580
metaphor.
Wherever something anomalous occurs,

1027
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,460
there's a hole in the way that you look 
at the world.

1028
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:29,743
And that whole can widen or narrow 
depending on your interpretation and 

1029
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:34,610
what you see through the whole is the 
unknown.

1030
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:37,640
And your job in a sense is to keep all 
the holes covered.

1031
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:38,863
Now here's something the unknown is 
peaking its head through and you don't 

1032
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:42,254
know how big the thing that's keeping 
his head through is it's just the tail 

1033
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:45,764
of a dragon or just the nose of a drag 
as about whether you're trying to do is 

1034
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:49,484
to figure it out.
So I guess interject came out maybe 

1035
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,960
because the way and find out what 
someone's dominance hierarchy is.

1036
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:57,290
Go ahead.
How do you mean?

1037
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:57,940
Well,

1038
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,190
use the example of a good example of an 
athlete.

1039
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,013
Um,
let's say that you get the stitch and 

1040
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:06,640
you get some stitching your side at 
first you think to yourself,

1041
01:01:06,641 --> 01:01:07,474
well,
you know this,

1042
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,313
this make it difficult for me to get 
through my day and you keep going and 

1043
01:01:11,261 --> 01:01:15,040
um,
it gets worse and worse and you see what

1044
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:17,530
level of analysis they take it to next,
do they next day,

1045
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:18,364
well I need to,
this will because this will interfere 

1046
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:24,100
with my schoolwork.
Do I need to,

1047
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:25,540
um,
my off my sports?

1048
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:27,610
Or is it the other way around that,

1049
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,100
that me with the status of the various 
nested goals and stuff,

1050
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,374
right?
Are you going to see that by forcing 

1051
01:01:35,731 --> 01:01:38,010
someone into the novel or,
I see what you're saying.

1052
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:41,100
So if I put a limitation on your 
behavior or if one emerges,

1053
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,353
you're going to determine what's worth 
tossing and that'll give you what's 

1054
01:01:45,721 --> 01:01:47,050
worth throwing away.
Basically.

1055
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,760
If you can only do 90% of the things 
that you're doing right now,

1056
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:54,450
what falls into the category of the 10% 
that can be eliminated?

1057
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,000
Sort of,
I think more along the lines of what are

1058
01:01:57,001 --> 01:01:59,520
the order in which you would consider.
Yes,

1059
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:00,330
yes.
Fair enough.

1060
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:01,770
Fair enough.
So yeah.

1061
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,260
Well that's,
yeah.

1062
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:06,510
Well I think that's perhaps part of the 
reason why,

1063
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,441
uh,
you know,

1064
01:02:07,441 --> 01:02:08,274
people who have recovered from a very 
serious illness or sometimes people who 

1065
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,590
aren't even going to be covers say,
well,

1066
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:15,540
at least this has taught me what was 
important.

1067
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:17,063
So that's,
that's a perfectly reasonable 

1068
01:02:18,421 --> 01:02:20,760
observation.
So anyways,

1069
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:23,190
you go to the doctor and what your 
attempt is,

1070
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,160
when you ask the doctor what is going 
on,

1071
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,293
what you're basically saying is like,
what subsection of my nested stories is 

1072
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:34,170
this event going to destroy?
Right.

1073
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,740
That's what you want to determine.
I read this is quite interesting.

1074
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:40,200
You see and that's a terrible situation 
to be.

1075
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:41,034
And so you're at the doctor and you were
faced with something that's unknown so 

1076
01:02:43,861 --> 01:02:46,170
that then you're very anxious,
high red,

1077
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:49,653
all the educational attempts so far to 
convince homosexual men to use condoms 

1078
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:56,820
have resulted in failure globally.
Um,

1079
01:02:57,490 --> 01:02:58,323
when AIDS first manifested itself,
there was a decrease in the kind of 

1080
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:05,110
behavior that spreads aged and an 
increase in use of condoms for,

1081
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,120
for a substantial period of time.
But you know,

1082
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,630
the days is sort of running the mail,
so to speak.

1083
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,420
The behaviors have basically returned to
baseline level.

1084
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,373
And there is some studies that 
demonstrate that men who engage in 

1085
01:03:16,931 --> 01:03:17,764
extremely high risk sexual behavior are 
more anxious and depressed before they 

1086
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:24,010
are diagnosed with aids.
And then after.

1087
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:30,690
And the reason for that I think is that
any possibility has been,

1088
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,350
that's right.
That's right.

1089
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:35,020
Any defined actuality is better than the
know.

1090
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:37,480
And that's,
that's a good story for illustrating how

1091
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:38,314
that's the case.
Like it's better to know than not to 

1092
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:42,904
know.
No matter what it is that you know 

1093
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,130
there's definitely the breath is worst 
than yes.

1094
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:50,170
That's what it means.
That's what it means.

1095
01:03:50,171 --> 01:03:51,004
That's why.
That's why in psychotherapy people will 

1096
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:53,704
always will continue to do things that 
they know will hurt them rather than 

1097
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:59,650
risk change cause threat.
That's right.

1098
01:03:59,651 --> 01:04:00,484
That's what people do like hope it's 
better than reward and punishment is 

1099
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,270
better than threat.
Right,

1100
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,250
so our primary reinforcers are less 
salient then our secondary reinforcers.

1101
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:15,010
It is peculiar.
It is peculiar,

1102
01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:15,903
but I think that is the case because it 
is drugs that for a while it is drugs 

1103
01:04:19,091 --> 01:04:19,924
that activate are the systems that 
mediate hope that we find most 

1104
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:23,793
enthralling and it is the key.
I do believe that like the devil you 

1105
01:04:27,971 --> 01:04:28,804
know is the better one.
You don't that it's the oldest though 

1106
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:33,523
that that's one of the reasons why this 
sort of theoretical approach is so 

1107
01:04:35,561 --> 01:04:38,290
useful is because it gives you insight 
into why people won't change,

1108
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,510
but why won't they change?
Well,

1109
01:04:40,511 --> 01:04:43,990
in order to change,
you have to stop believing in it.

1110
01:04:43,991 --> 01:04:45,790
Stopped doing what you're doing.
Well,

1111
01:04:45,791 --> 01:04:46,870
what does that mean?
Well,

1112
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:49,180
it means for an intermediary period of 
time,

1113
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:55,510
all things are novel and all normal 
things produce anxiety.

1114
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:58,990
And if you're terrified of anxiety and 
you don't believe that you can cope with

1115
01:04:58,991 --> 01:04:59,824
it,

1116
01:05:01,790 --> 01:05:02,623
you can't do it.

1117
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:04,293
So what are the jobs you have as a 
psychotherapist is not to minimize the 

1118
01:05:07,841 --> 01:05:08,674
anxiety that you're a patient feels,
but to endeavor to demonstrate to them 

1119
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:14,650
that they can tolerate more of it than 
they think.

1120
01:05:14,651 --> 01:05:15,484
Yeah,

1121
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,983
that's catalog.
That's your attempt to capitalize 

1122
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,084
identification with the hero.
It's just the fact of anxiety isn't so 

1123
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,254
bad.
It's the fact that you think that you 

1124
01:05:27,371 --> 01:05:29,680
can deal with it.
That's what's so bad.

1125
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,023
Cause you're never going to convince 
anybody that the world is not a 

1126
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:35,110
threatening place.
So

1127
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,680
okay.
Anyway.

1128
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:39,514
So one of the things that you're doing 
when you engage in exploratory behavior 

1129
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,604
is trying to figure out at what level of
analysis that particular normals piece 

1130
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:46,954
of information actually where it's 
actually most appropriately conceived 

1131
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,773
them,
which is to say what does it mean that 

1132
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,030
you're trying to fit it into a 
framework?

1133
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:55,864
While it store basically says that his,
this piece of information that he 

1134
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:04,000
accidentally encountered at school,
which is pretty much inevitable.

1135
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:05,853
No,
the Russians in 1838 we're still pretty 

1136
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:10,840
backwards society compared to the rest 
of Europe in Europe had gone through.

1137
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,673
It's,
it's great contact with the idea that 

1138
01:06:13,871 --> 01:06:17,200
God was dead as early as,
as the,

1139
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,980
as the times when Galileo came into 
conflict with,

1140
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:21,423
with the Catholic church,
I mean this would be going on in Europe 

1141
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,674
for a long time,
for 400 years before the news washed in 

1142
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:28,294
from western Europe over Russia.
Russia was a feudal society that was 

1143
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:35,740
tottering on very on,
on shaky legs,

1144
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:38,320
just read,
just waiting in a sense for something to

1145
01:06:38,321 --> 01:06:39,154
push it over.
The news from western Europe pushed it 

1146
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:41,794
over.
It took to a story 30 years to figure 

1147
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:44,353
out or for the information to have its 
full impact on total store and I would 

1148
01:06:47,141 --> 01:06:47,974
say that I think it's reasonable to say 
that what that information did to 

1149
01:06:52,121 --> 01:06:52,954
Tolstoy,
he did to the whole culture 50 years 

1150
01:06:55,451 --> 01:06:56,284
later.
That's why I want you to read those Dsq 

1151
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:58,914
is the devils,
because Dostoevsky's writing about a 

1152
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:07,711
Russia that had held on to feudalism 200
300 years longer than it actually should

1153
01:07:09,611 --> 01:07:10,444
have the last year,
a peon country to undergo a modern 

1154
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:14,584
revolution.
When we know the consequences of the 

1155
01:07:15,821 --> 01:07:17,380
revolution,
it's Orthodox.

1156
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:18,214
Christianity was pushed over,
left a huge void in the Russian psyche 

1157
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:24,940
that was filled by Marxism.
Anyways,

1158
01:07:25,150 --> 01:07:25,983
tolstoy was a genius and one of the 
consequences of being a genius is that 

1159
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:32,230
those things that eventually happened to
everyone have to you first.

1160
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:33,663
So

1161
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:38,990
that's,
that's an interesting thing.

1162
01:07:38,991 --> 01:07:40,040
You know,
it seems to me that

1163
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,270
we did,
we do.

1164
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,650
This is,
this is a strange,

1165
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:50,700
strange thing to think.
I guess we tend to think that the future

1166
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,833
happens everywhere at the same time.
It's like we all come into contact with 

1167
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:57,970
the future at the same time,
but that's not really true.

1168
01:07:57,971 --> 01:08:00,750
You know,
the people that we think of as geniuses,

1169
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,950
our people in whom the future happens 
first and then usually isolates them.

1170
01:08:04,951 --> 01:08:06,580
That's why they look like profits.
I said,

1171
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:10,030
I think in a sense it's almost as if the
future pours through them first,

1172
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,530
then out into the culture.

1173
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,053
Yeah.

1174
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,233
I mean it depends on what,
it depends on what you think of 

1175
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:19,694
thinking.
If you think I'm thinking of something 

1176
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:21,674
you do,
then that whole line of argument is 

1177
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:24,974
nonsensical.
But if you think of thoughts as 

1178
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:27,320
something you encounter,

1179
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:29,973
okay,

1180
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:31,990
then it starts to make it a little bit 
more sense.

1181
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,063
Anyways,

1182
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,493
the thing that had taken for a myriad 
disposition is in fact the most 

1183
01:08:40,331 --> 01:08:44,410
important is in fact,
this is exactly what happened to me.

1184
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,920
I realized that this was northern,
it's definitely element,

1185
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:48,093
but something very serious ended.
If the same question should continue to 

1186
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:51,214
recur,
I would have to answer them and I tried 

1187
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:55,810
to answer the questions seem to be such 
foolish,

1188
01:08:55,811 --> 01:08:57,220
simple,
childish westerns.

1189
01:08:57,570 --> 01:08:59,710
But as soon as I laid my hands on and 
try and resolve them,

1190
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:02,020
I was immediately convinced,
first of all,

1191
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:02,993
but they were not childish and foolish,
but the most vital and profound 

1192
01:09:05,561 --> 01:09:08,560
questions in life.
And so I couldn't believe that no matter

1193
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:10,870
how much I bought them,
there was no way I could resolve.

1194
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,633
So tolstoy had not only thought here he 
was the paradigmatic example of having 

1195
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:23,770
gone there.
Right?

1196
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:24,723
He was as successful as you could 
possibly be within the confines of a 

1197
01:09:28,381 --> 01:09:29,214
group and even perhaps have made some 
movements towards the next stage of 

1198
01:09:33,371 --> 01:09:34,204
development,
given that he was undoubtedly a very 

1199
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:37,930
creative individual.
So he says it,

1200
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:38,920
he says himself,

1201
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:46,550
I should have been considered a 
completely happy man.

1202
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:48,830
This was when I was not yet 50 years 
old.

1203
01:09:48,831 --> 01:09:51,980
I had a good loving and beloved wife 
find children and largest state that was

1204
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:55,580
growing and expanding without any effort
on my card or the never before.

1205
01:09:55,581 --> 01:09:57,620
I was respected by friends and 
acquaintances,

1206
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,513
praised by strangers and could claim a 
certain renown without really diluting 

1207
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:03,044
myself were over.
I was not physically and mentally 

1208
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:06,104
unhealthy on the contrary,
and I enjoyed the physical and mental 

1209
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,360
vigor such as I have rarely encountered 
among others my age

1210
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,290
physically I could keep up with the 
peasants working in the fields.

1211
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,153
Mentally I could work eight and 10 hours
at a stretch that's suffering any after 

1212
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:22,610
effects from the strain.
And in such a state of affairs,

1213
01:10:22,611 --> 01:10:24,200
I came to a point where I could not 
live.

1214
01:10:24,650 --> 01:10:25,483
And even though I fear death,
I had to employ ruses against myself to 

1215
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,570
keep from committing suicide.

1216
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:34,500
Perfect example of an entirely well 
adaptive matt,

1217
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,363
he encountered with a piece of anomalous
information that blew his ability to 

1218
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:38,864
believe in all of the determinant 
meanings that his group identification 

1219
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:45,080
have provided for him.
And as a consequence,

1220
01:10:45,081 --> 01:10:50,081
he descended in voluntarily into chaos 
and just about died as a consequence.

1221
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,493
He said,
and details this to some degree in his 

1222
01:10:53,470 --> 01:10:57,620
confessions made tolstoy literally was 
suicidal for a long period of time.

1223
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:00,640
So
it was three,

1224
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,330
one of the tragic consequences of 
abstraction.

1225
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,183
I mean,
this is,

1226
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:07,500
it's coming from the top down there and 
there's no right.

1227
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:11,060
You should be unhappy from a practical 
point of view.

1228
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,410
Right.
Well that's,

1229
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,070
that's one of the things that I wanted 
to sort of deal with today is,

1230
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,610
I mean,
this story,

1231
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,690
this story,
is this,

1232
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,313
right?

1233
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,113
I mean,
what toss do I encountered was a 

1234
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:28,150
stranger idea.
I'm the problem with an idea.

1235
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:32,020
This is why the pen is mightier than the
sword.

1236
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:37,470
The problem with an idea
is that once it's up here,

1237
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:42,390
you can just say it like you can make 
your point in,

1238
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,860
in a paragraph or two.
Say if the point is uh,

1239
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:47,763
it's absurd to believe in religious 
presuppositions and you buttress that 

1240
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:52,803
with page of or to have documentation of
the reasons why it's absolutely obvious 

1241
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:00,750
that it's absurd.
Then you're,

1242
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,383
you're providing information who's ease 
of communication belies its danger and 

1243
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:11,680
also obscures how difficult it was for 
the information to have being generated.

1244
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,993
That's the thing about abstraction is 
that for me to make a statement like 

1245
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:22,411
that
mapped over a long span of time that any

1246
01:12:22,901 --> 01:12:23,734
number of people may have had to die in 
order to make that information in order 

1247
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:29,290
to generate that information.

1248
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:30,243
And I think that's part of the reason 
why we're so constantly interested in 

1249
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:34,294
the story of Galileo.
He was someone who produced a piece of 

1250
01:12:37,871 --> 01:12:42,871
anomalous information and was branded 
the heretic by the Catholic Church.

1251
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:44,253
And he was like,
here's a person who opened the doorway 

1252
01:12:46,121 --> 01:12:46,954
for the,
for the scientific overthrew religious 

1253
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,864
ideas.
But the fact that we can commonly 

1254
01:12:52,751 --> 01:12:53,584
discuss issues like that now is a 
consequence of the fact that centuries 

1255
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:00,170
of battles about ideas like this,
if taking me,

1256
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:03,490
have taken place in the past,
sometimes purely intellectually,

1257
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,593
sometimes as the consequence of actual 
wars all compacted up into a few 

1258
01:13:08,681 --> 01:13:11,410
abstracted phrases that can easily be 
delivered,

1259
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:14,170
also delivered across cultures.
And that's

1260
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:17,403
so will you can see the actions of 
strangers can become abstracted up into 

1261
01:13:21,941 --> 01:13:26,830
words and then transmitted well,
that's the thing that's so funny is that

1262
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:27,933
once it's abstract,
you can be a very ineffectual 

1263
01:13:31,931 --> 01:13:32,764
personality and nonetheless have the 
capability to have a huge impact on 

1264
01:13:37,481 --> 01:13:38,314
things because you can serve as the 
carrier of information that you could 

1265
01:13:42,011 --> 01:13:42,844
not possibly have generated yourself.
And that's part of the reason why our 

1266
01:13:46,001 --> 01:13:48,880
technological power makes us so 
increasingly dangerous.

1267
01:13:48,881 --> 01:13:49,714
I think because we have access to all 
the power that people have developed in 

1268
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:58,270
the past,
regardless of whether or not we have the

1269
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:02,550
kind of personalities that are capable 
of using that power wisely.

1270
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:07,360
So there's politics in a nutshell,
right?

1271
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,033
Not just politics though.
It's the case with every field of 

1272
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:11,404
endeavor.

1273
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,000
It doesn't matter where you look,
it's the case.

1274
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:17,763
And as,
as we develop our technological power 

1275
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:22,120
more and more,
that's increasingly the case.

1276
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,670
That's why someone like,
I don't remember his name,

1277
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,563
a character in the,
in Southeast Asia who brought down 

1278
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:28,744
Barings Bank.
That's a good example of the power of 

1279
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,320
abstraction.
That's right.

1280
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:33,154
He's playing with nothing and devastated
the whole community because he's just 

1281
01:14:38,591 --> 01:14:40,510
playing with abstractions and they were 
just numbers.

1282
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,373
They're bits even.

1283
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:46,620
But because things hadn't been 
abstracted upsell so tremendously,

1284
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,053
his casual movements had huge impact.
What makes it an homeless idea of 

1285
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:56,671
threatened and not just a ridiculous,
I mean why go go?

1286
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,670
It was so positions would threatened.
Why were they perceived of as,

1287
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:02,683
I mean not as substitute.
That'll be the speculations are just 

1288
01:15:04,251 --> 01:15:05,610
theory.
It was considered.

1289
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,230
That's good.
That's a really good question.

1290
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,300
I suspect.
Look,

1291
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:16,230
that's a really good question because it
also ties in with other peculiarities.

1292
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,073
Like you pointed out for example that 
well and everyone knows this to be the 

1293
01:15:20,871 --> 01:15:21,704
case.
You know sometimes you're a prophet 

1294
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:25,984
crying in the wilderness,
which basically means that you have a 

1295
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:30,130
message that no one listened to and the 
reason for that is,

1296
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,930
well it might be because you're,
you know,

1297
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:32,764
you're,
you're fundamentally deranged and what 

1298
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:35,614
you have to say has no relevance,
but it also may be that you're so far 

1299
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,114
ahead of your time so to speak,
that no one that you talked to can 

1300
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:43,234
understand what you're saying,
which is very much related to the 

1301
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:45,964
question that you're asking.
I guess I would say that there must be 

1302
01:15:48,671 --> 01:15:50,500
an op then this,
this,

1303
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,650
this ties into the last chapter that 
we'll discuss,

1304
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:54,543
which has to do the ability to use your 
interest as a motive regulating your 

1305
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:00,634
progress.
The gods ski said there's a zone of 

1306
01:16:02,921 --> 01:16:03,754
proximal development.
This is a complicated thing to try and 

1307
01:16:07,881 --> 01:16:11,420
understand and I really haven't gotten 
it completely straightened out.

1308
01:16:11,421 --> 01:16:13,040
All of this diagram helps a bit.

1309
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,660
You're saying if you're faced with an 
anomalous piece of information,

1310
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:21,420
what makes it meaningful instead of 
incomprehensible?

1311
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:27,770
And it must be that there must be,
like if the idea is here,

1312
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,120
maybe it's pretty easy to move it to 
here,

1313
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,410
but maybe it's pretty difficult to move 
it to here if it's here.

1314
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:41,040
So I would say like the reason that the 
reason that the Russians,

1315
01:16:41,041 --> 01:16:41,874
tolstoy for example,
was so overwhelmed by the idea from 

1316
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:48,810
Europe is because at other levels of 
analysis,

1317
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:49,644
they already knew the idea.
So it was like dropping us a seed 

1318
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:58,140
crystal into a supersaturated solution.
It was the ground was already prepared.

1319
01:16:59,010 --> 01:16:59,843
And I also think that's why people 
sometimes experience things as 

1320
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:04,650
revelations is they already know.
You already know.

1321
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,240
Sorry,
I tell you a piece of information.

1322
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:10,970
This is very much relevant to 
mythological teaching because again,

1323
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:16,390
what we're discussing in this class,
everyone knows at least up to about here

1324
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,420
already.
So when you say move it to here,

1325
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:24,350
well I can always make reference to what
you already know here

1326
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,270
also.
That's

1327
01:17:30,210 --> 01:17:31,043
so I,
I sit with my children and I watched 

1328
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:35,940
bugs bunny cartoons or any movie for 
that matter.

1329
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:37,023
They're the oldest one is four and I see
by watching my daughter how much of 

1330
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:42,594
what's portrayed in the movie is opaque 
information and that's because she 

1331
01:17:46,921 --> 01:17:48,750
doesn't understand any of the 
references.

1332
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:52,140
Like yesterday we were watching Casper,
she doesn't know.

1333
01:17:52,141 --> 01:17:55,890
What it goes to is now you can really 
explain to anyone when it goes to is,

1334
01:17:55,891 --> 01:17:57,780
you know,
because while you think about it,

1335
01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:00,540
that's complicated.
I mean it's really complicated.

1336
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:01,374
You have to,
there are a lot of presuppositions 

1337
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,070
involved in understanding what it goes.
Yes.

1338
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,203
For her that's just opaque information.
It's cause she doesn't share like the 

1339
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:10,674
movie,
all the movie presumes a certain shared 

1340
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,840
frame of reference.
Right.

1341
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:18,060
A shared background knowledge

1342
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,610
and that's that.
That's

1343
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:22,973
is it.
Is it related to the way of knowing and 

1344
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:26,880
not just the idea?
I mean

1345
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:34,450
the church had a way of knowing God all 
day or in a different way of knowing.

1346
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:37,660
Right.
It wasn't just the idea that was new.

1347
01:18:37,990 --> 01:18:39,400
It was a way of knowing.

1348
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,920
Yes.
But that was certainly true in his case.

1349
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:44,830
That's right.
Well that's because the,

1350
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,363
the church I think was most concerned,
although it didn't know that explicit 

1351
01:18:49,361 --> 01:18:51,650
and being with the knowing as knowing 
how to behave.

1352
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:53,053
Whereas Galileo was on the track of 
knowing as knowing facts and well we 

1353
01:18:57,891 --> 01:18:59,690
know what the consequences of that of 
being,

1354
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:01,670
we haven't been able to distinguish them
very well.

1355
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:03,313
But you know,
if you,

1356
01:19:03,450 --> 01:19:07,130
I noticed wandering through various art 
museums in Europe,

1357
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:07,993
I mean
I don't understand many of the 

1358
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:14,480
renaissance paintings.
They don't mean to me,

1359
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:15,373
they don't even look to me like they 
look to the people who painted them 

1360
01:19:17,301 --> 01:19:19,310
because I don't know the mythological 
reference.

1361
01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:20,203
Even the Christian ones for that matter,
a lot of the paintings lost on me and 

1362
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:24,944
that's because
if we share a community that means our 

1363
01:19:28,281 --> 01:19:32,390
unconscious presuppositions are 
identical and so we can communicate at a

1364
01:19:32,391 --> 01:19:37,391
level where having those shared 
presuppositions as implicitly accepted,

1365
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:38,774
we can toss information back and forth 
that like at the level of abstraction 

1366
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:43,850
where we don't yet agree.

1367
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:47,660
I guess that must be the story.
Well,

1368
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:48,494
if you and I are talking,
there's a whole bunch of things we're 

1369
01:19:50,001 --> 01:19:54,620
not talking about that we already agree 
about and so we don't have to talk about

1370
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:56,810
them.
What we talk about are those things that

1371
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:00,380
add a level of analysis where there's 
still some dispute.

1372
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:05,060
And I guess that as things become 
increasingly beyond dispute,

1373
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,930
they all go also get encoded farther 
back down the hierarchy.

1374
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:14,010
So
in this class for example,

1375
01:20:14,011 --> 01:20:15,870
we're not at each other's throats,
amber,

1376
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,603
because,
and we don't ever argue about the 

1377
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:20,430
propriety of that.
It's,

1378
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:23,130
it's so much accepted that it's not even
an issue.

1379
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:24,990
There's no aggressive behavior.

1380
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,760
It seems to me that part of this year 
of,

1381
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:30,983
uh,
of anomaly must come from a recognition 

1382
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,730
or an unconscious recognition perhaps of
human nature,

1383
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:41,020
which is that,
uh,

1384
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,470
exploration is intrinsically rewarding.
I mean,

1385
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,840
would you agree that that is true?
It seems that

1386
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,280
exploration for explorations sake seems 
to be something that motivates people.

1387
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:52,123
I mean,
and I noticed one of the things that 

1388
01:20:52,471 --> 01:20:54,810
Tulsa,
I said was that Venus and his brothers,

1389
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:57,990
they brought the strain chai idea of 
home from school.

1390
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:59,910
One of the first things he says is that 
we were more than,

1391
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,310
we're more than happy to entertain this 
idea.

1392
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,600
Right.
Why?

1393
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,190
But simply because it's,
it's new.

1394
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,920
Anything that's new is interesting.
Right?

1395
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:10,733
Right.

1396
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:12,781
Yeah.
Well,

1397
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:14,760
they were definitely interested in the 
information.

1398
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:18,240
Partly I think because it told them 
something they already suspected.

1399
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:19,280
So to some,
you know,

1400
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,570
it was a receptivity.
Right?

1401
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,463
Right.
The ground was busy that it's almost as 

1402
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:28,760
if it was an unarticulated experience.
Right?

1403
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,693
Absolutely.
It provides a way of articulating and 

1404
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:35,010
that's the crystal hits the water.
Right?

1405
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:39,520
But it doesn't put the experience there.
It articulates great.

1406
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,363
Great.
As long.

1407
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:41,380
Okay.
There's,

1408
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:42,323
there's,
and you'll see this later in the 

1409
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,410
manuscript too,
um,

1410
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:49,500
when Moses gets the rules,
the 10 commandments from God,

1411
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:52,283
he's on the top of a mountain,
which is a standard place of 

1412
01:21:54,721 --> 01:21:57,060
enlightenment when he comes to,
or illumination,

1413
01:21:57,061 --> 01:21:57,894
when he comes down the mountain,
his face is glowing so brightly that no 

1414
01:22:01,081 --> 01:22:05,760
one can look at it.
Now what Moses did like he's,

1415
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,920
let's assume for the present time that 
if he is not a mythological figure,

1416
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:13,620
he's at least a myth of sized historical
figure.

1417
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,780
I mean the notion of the law giver is 
fairly prevalent in archaic communities.

1418
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,580
I mean the same role is played by Hammer
Hammer,

1419
01:22:21,581 --> 01:22:22,860
Rab die,
for example,

1420
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,850
someone who codifies the law.
While the notion there is again,

1421
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,013
like what Moses did basically could be 
construed as having observed how 

1422
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:36,540
everyone behaved in essence anyways,
he codafide it,

1423
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:38,243
right?
So he took information that existed at 

1424
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,990
the level of creative behavior,
imitation,

1425
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:43,771
play,
ritual,

1426
01:22:43,771 --> 01:22:44,610
drought,
a myth,

1427
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,310
religion and maybe even literature.
And he said,

1428
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:49,680
well look,
this is what we're doing.

1429
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,733
I can,
and the consequences that that appeared 

1430
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,640
as a revelation.
And I think part of the reason I'd be,

1431
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,960
I'd be trying to figure,
because you do this in therapy too.

1432
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:00,660
You say to someone,
look here,

1433
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:03,360
here's a pattern of behavior.
First of all,

1434
01:23:03,361 --> 01:23:06,280
that in itself could be revelation.
You say the person says,

1435
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,530
you know,
I've noticed myself doing that.

1436
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,420
They're quite interested in that piece 
of information.

1437
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:15,970
I think the asset that's generated as a 
consequence of encountering that sort of

1438
01:23:15,971 --> 01:23:16,804
information is partly due to 
apprehension of all the possibilities 

1439
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:25,561
that are then revealed.
Like the more as you move information up

1440
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:26,614
the hierarchy of abstraction,
the information becomes more and more 

1441
01:23:29,141 --> 01:23:29,974
powerful,
which basically means that you can do 

1442
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:33,640
more with it with less work,
right?

1443
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,390
That's why money is more powerful than 
barter.

1444
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,040
It's more abstract.
So that,

1445
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,423
so it's more flexible and I think when 
you move information up a level of 

1446
01:23:45,071 --> 01:23:45,904
abstraction,
it produces a release of an effect 

1447
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:49,084
because you get an intimation of the 
possibilities that are released as a 

1448
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:53,380
consequence of the increase in 
abstraction.

1449
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:57,520
I also think it's the case that if I can
tell you,

1450
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:00,130
well look,
your story is such and such,

1451
01:24:00,131 --> 01:24:02,470
but you act this way and this is your 
theory.

1452
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:03,843
Well then you have the possibility of 
moving those three levels of analysis 

1453
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:12,300
into an isomorphic arrangement so that 
your north three people anymore,

1454
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:16,300
one who act some way,
what do you have?

1455
01:24:16,301 --> 01:24:19,240
A badge is another way.
And one of the plans,

1456
01:24:19,241 --> 01:24:20,074
a third way.
You're one person who all of whose 

1457
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:24,350
efforts are devoted towards attaining,
we'll say,

1458
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:26,200
man,
I also think that that's,

1459
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:27,383
well,
that's,

1460
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:30,610
that's the,
the utility of the integration.

1461
01:24:30,670 --> 01:24:34,330
And I think when one of the things that 
we admire in people naturally,

1462
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:35,853
I think is the consequence of the 
unification of the operation of those 

1463
01:24:41,141 --> 01:24:42,520
three systems,
which is to say,

1464
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,590
who do you admire?
Well,

1465
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:47,500
someone who doesn't say anything more 
than is necessary,

1466
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,440
so to speak,
and who acts out what they tell you.

1467
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:55,690
Um,
I was about to say that I think at times

1468
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:56,883
you're talking about positive ethic and 
I think that how's it of apic works in 

1469
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:00,844
this direction if you're talking about 
procedural as the outside and that 

1470
01:25:03,820 --> 01:25:05,780
attraction towards the middle,
Andy,

1471
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:08,020
because I think that,
um,

1472
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,770
I think when you present,
once you have a level of abstraction,

1473
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:16,210
the best way to present to somebody else
is not by,

1474
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,493
by telling them,
but about presenting it in as 

1475
01:25:18,911 --> 01:25:21,670
procedural.
They need as big a,

1476
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:23,860
a circle as possible,
which is probably is,

1477
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:25,650
which is probably more difficult to do.
Um,

1478
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:30,680
well this sort of the okay information 
that's behavioral anyways.

1479
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,903
Yeah,
well that's Freud thought that merely 

1480
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:34,634
becoming conscious of something was 
sufficient to bring about a cure or at 

1481
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:37,964
least at the early stages of his career,
but by the end he realized that unless 

1482
01:25:40,491 --> 01:25:41,324
it had to be transformed from pure 
conscious awareness back down to the 

1483
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:47,170
level of behavior did it,
you didn't know it.

1484
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,553
Knowing it means that it's embodied.
I think that's the point that you're 

1485
01:25:50,961 --> 01:25:51,794
making.
What Tulsa was doing is that he was 

1486
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:54,134
moving from abstraction maybe into 
procedural and that produce negative 

1487
01:25:58,010 --> 01:25:59,530
effect.
Yeah,

1488
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,800
but it wouldn't be.
Yeah,

1489
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:04,430
and this
I would say,

1490
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,533
I would say that your interpretation is 
accurate but that it wouldn't 

1491
01:26:07,251 --> 01:26:09,190
necessarily have to produce negative 
effect.

1492
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,033
The problem is is the tolstoy encounter 
that information and voluntarily was 

1493
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:16,970
sort of accidental in a sense.
He was walking along as it's a hell of a

1494
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:19,250
piece of information for a 12 year old 
school boy.

1495
01:26:20,210 --> 01:26:21,043
You know,
it's like it's a piece of information 

1496
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:24,830
that you can say in one sentence,
go on his dad.

1497
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,393
That took like literally thousands of 
years of concentrated effort and any 

1498
01:26:30,231 --> 01:26:33,980
number of wars to produce and then you 
can hand it to someone on a plate.

1499
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:36,410
This is also part of the reason why are 
this this,

1500
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:37,940
this is kind of a leap,
but it makes it,

1501
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,833
it's exactly the same sort of thing.
It's why a lot of foreign aid projects 

1502
01:26:41,811 --> 01:26:42,644
don't work is because there's a lot more
information embedded in the things that 

1503
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:47,774
we distributed.
Then we think that there's a good 

1504
01:26:49,401 --> 01:26:51,350
example,
um,

1505
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,980
in the,
in the South Pacific islands,

1506
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:56,323
the introduction of steel axis to the 
stone age population devastated their 

1507
01:27:00,111 --> 01:27:02,480
whole culture.
And part of it was missionary work.

1508
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:06,710
But the thing is these colleges had 
progressed to the point where if you are

1509
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:07,544
at the top of the dominance hierarchy,
you had access to a stone ax and we 

1510
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:12,170
think about a stone ax,
you know,

1511
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,300
who cares basically.

1512
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,493
But when there aren't that many of them,
and when that's the thing that's the 

1513
01:27:18,061 --> 01:27:18,894
hot,
the most technologically advanced 

1514
01:27:21,171 --> 01:27:22,004
product you have still an ax is a symbol
of ultimate value as well as the stone 

1515
01:27:26,801 --> 01:27:29,330
Max.
And when you distribute steel axes,

1516
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:31,760
which the missionaries did relatively 
indiscriminately,

1517
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,960
it was very hard on the story that the 
Pacific Islanders told cause you think,

1518
01:27:37,431 --> 01:27:38,690
what does that mean?
It's like,

1519
01:27:38,691 --> 01:27:39,890
okay,
it's a steel ax.

1520
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:42,680
What's a steel ax for?
Well it's for cutting down trees and you

1521
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:45,350
can do a better job with the steel ax 
then you can with a stone ax.

1522
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:48,380
But the thing is,
it's like Elvis Presley's guitar,

1523
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,690
right?
Elvis Presley's guitar is just,

1524
01:27:50,691 --> 01:27:52,550
it's not just a thing to make music 
with.

1525
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:57,610
It's also Elvis Presley's guitar and it 
steel ax is not just a thing to cut down

1526
01:27:57,621 --> 01:28:02,621
trees with its a cultural artifact that 
has sort of embedded in it a whole bunch

1527
01:28:02,661 --> 01:28:03,494
of implicit messages,
partly about the relative power of two 

1528
01:28:06,051 --> 01:28:06,600
cultures.

1529
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,433
And in large part that it's like if you 
have to work your whole life to get a 

1530
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:11,984
stone ax and then your four year old 
child walks down the street and brings 

1531
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:14,774
home the steel ax,
this is going to be somewhat hard on 

1532
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:18,290
your,
on your,

1533
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,140
uh,
on your frame of references.

1534
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,363
Hey Dad,
the people down the street or getting 

1535
01:28:23,991 --> 01:28:28,730
away machines that create money.
So anyways,

1536
01:28:28,731 --> 01:28:32,090
so when we introduce our artifacts into 
alternative cultures,

1537
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,313
we are putting a lot more into the 
culture than we actually think because 

1538
01:28:35,901 --> 01:28:36,734
the artifact,
it's like Marshall Mcluhan said the 

1539
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:40,784
medium is the message.
Artifact is something other than just 

1540
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:46,250
have to,
it has a story that's embedded in it.

1541
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:48,163
So now you're tolstoy's case,
it's almost the artifact was rather a 

1542
01:28:51,471 --> 01:28:52,490
story.
I mean it was,

1543
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:53,973
yeah,
it was an idea crystallized that 

1544
01:28:55,251 --> 01:28:57,140
experience that was already there.
Right?

1545
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,020
Right.
Well,

1546
01:29:00,021 --> 01:29:00,821
yeah,
it was something,

1547
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:03,810
it something abstract it up anyways,
so,

1548
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,850
okay.
So anyways,

1549
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:10,410
well normally seen information can come 
in the form of a strange idea.

1550
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,330
I guess what I was trying to do with 
this with,

1551
01:29:15,331 --> 01:29:16,164
this is something I didn't really 
recognize until this morning when I was 

1552
01:29:19,381 --> 01:29:20,460
working on this stuff.
Again,

1553
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:25,880
anomalous information can,
can enter your purview at every,

1554
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,753
at any level of abstraction.
I guess that sort of leads is that 

1555
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,413
someone can,
if someone acts differently than you 

1556
01:29:32,251 --> 01:29:33,090
act,
say,

1557
01:29:33,091 --> 01:29:34,860
well,
why does that bother you so much?

1558
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:37,230
The beer.
Let's take the Germans for example,

1559
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,420
prior to the Second World War.
Okay.

1560
01:29:39,421 --> 01:29:41,990
Their culture is a little unstable as 
kind of dance,

1561
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:46,740
very high rates and London,
terrible inflation and immense threat of

1562
01:29:46,741 --> 01:29:50,880
communism from the east and a nontrivial
threat.

1563
01:29:50,881 --> 01:29:53,080
I mean the communists took over Russia 
after all.

1564
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:56,370
So you know,
there's enough novelty,

1565
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,350
enough normally floating around in the 
air,

1566
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,184
so to speak,
to make everyone perfectly well 

1567
01:30:00,301 --> 01:30:01,630
uncomfortable.
Um,

1568
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,103
under those circumstances,
anybody who acted differently with a 

1569
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:09,263
additional anomaly that I think it 
appeared as pretty much as something 

1570
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:14,130
pretty much intolerable.
So

1571
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:18,023
under normal circumstances,
it's possible that the alternative 

1572
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:23,460
behaviors of someone who's different 
than you aren't doing the pose that much

1573
01:30:23,461 --> 01:30:24,294
of a problem to you,
but all you have to do is perturb the 

1574
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:31,350
system to some degree to make that sort 
of anomalous information,

1575
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:32,663
that much more intolerable state.
If someone's from a culture that's 

1576
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:37,044
different than you,
even if you don't talk to them and even 

1577
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:40,710
if they don't come into contact with you
that much,

1578
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:41,753
the mere fact that there are around is 
definitive evidence that a story that 

1579
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:51,180
isn't your story can be as success can 
make someone as successful as you are or

1580
01:30:51,181 --> 01:30:52,014
perhaps even more successful.
Sometimes you can tolerate that and 

1581
01:30:54,421 --> 01:30:58,710
sometimes you can't.
So anomalous information can come in the

1582
01:30:58,711 --> 01:31:02,310
form of pure procedure that's acted out 
by someone else.

1583
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,110
Sometimes that's not a problem but 
sometimes it is

1584
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:12,960
the final.
This is even less abstract.

1585
01:31:12,961 --> 01:31:15,570
I guess I wanted to read you something 
cause I can't,

1586
01:31:17,700 --> 01:31:21,530
I can't make the argument is well is 
that a road

1587
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:28,363
page one 68
the question here is what can disrupt 

1588
01:31:36,031 --> 01:31:40,950
you I guess and the things that can 
disrupt the,

1589
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,350
we can come in the form of direct 
challenges,

1590
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,083
indirect challenges to your cultural 
structure and these are all things that 

1591
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:53,930
are other cultures basically agree
or sorry.

1592
01:31:54,660 --> 01:31:58,890
These two things are other cultures,
the stranger and the stranger.

1593
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:05,070
This is schismatic movement within your 
own culture and this is the unknown.

1594
01:32:05,771 --> 01:32:08,590
Doing its thing more or less all by 
itself.

1595
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:13,870
So cultures come to a halt.
Well,

1596
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:16,330
let's say you're a culture.
This is a good example,

1597
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:19,630
I suppose.
You raise goats.

1598
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:25,420
So you have an agrarian culture.
The prime with goats is theirs that they

1599
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:26,254
produce.
They produce environmental 

1600
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:30,130
transformations.
Goats like to live in deserts.

1601
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:34,540
And the thing about guns is that if you 
put them out somewhere soon,

1602
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:35,374
what you have is a desert.
And the problem with deserts is that 

1603
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:41,140
they don't support that many goats.
So the point is,

1604
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:43,930
is that if you have an adaptive 
structure of one source,

1605
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:45,003
the consequences of that adaptive 
structure can be the transformation of 

1606
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:48,394
the environment in such a way so that 
the adapter structure no longer no 

1607
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:52,090
longer works.

1608
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:53,673
MMM.

1609
01:32:54,690 --> 01:32:55,523
Now this took me a long time to work out
because mythological representations of 

1610
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:01,883
the emergence of the negative unknown 
are always contaminated with 

1611
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:11,010
mythological representations of the 
tyranny of the known.

1612
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,300
And it's almost as if from the 
mythological perspective of it,

1613
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:19,460
there's no difference between
the over dominance of this.

1614
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:21,483
Yes.

1615
01:33:22,730 --> 01:33:23,900
And the emergence.

1616
01:33:29,090 --> 01:33:29,923
Oh.

1617
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,470
And I thought,
how the hell could that be?

1618
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,380
Why would that be?
Let me just read you something here.

1619
01:33:46,730 --> 01:33:50,600
The insufficiency of cultural adaptation
cannot easily distinguished from natural

1620
01:33:50,601 --> 01:33:53,510
catastrophe.
This society light on its feet,

1621
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:54,344
so to speak,
is constantly in a position to adapt to 

1622
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:56,624
the unexpected,
even to the rapid and catastrophic kind 

1623
01:33:58,750 --> 01:33:59,583
of expected,
even to transform such change into 

1624
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:05,810
something positively beneficial.
Likewise,

1625
01:34:05,811 --> 01:34:09,030
this means that that affect and 
cognition earns more than with that.

1626
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:12,500
I think it's a funny,
think about it this way.

1627
01:34:15,470 --> 01:34:18,590
Germany and Japan lost the Second World 
War in England.

1628
01:34:18,591 --> 01:34:20,540
One,
you'd never know it now,

1629
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:23,680
and that's partly because,
well,

1630
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:27,590
it's part of it because the Americans in
a fit of historical anomaly,

1631
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:29,253
it gave their enemies money instead of 
killing the ball and their last 

1632
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:37,040
historically as lose to lose the war.
The United States,

1633
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,053
the only country that ever really,
one of them were against us as Vietnam 

1634
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:42,030
and look where they are now.
Right?

1635
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:44,330
Whereas you're looking at Japan and 
Germany.

1636
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:47,810
Well,
we made it.

1637
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:48,913
It's the same.
It's a good example of of the Integra 

1638
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:55,880
relationship between this and this 
because the Germans,

1639
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:02,080
the Japanese underwent a catastrophe,
a sociological catastrophe.

1640
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:07,280
Who's consequence was something very 
beneficial in the final analysis.

1641
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:10,850
Okay.
The point is is that

1642
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:13,663
it's,
you can't necessarily distinguish the 

1643
01:35:18,081 --> 01:35:18,914
valence of unexpected phenomenon from 
the pattern of behavior that's 

1644
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:28,301
manifested in its presence,
which is to say that it's very difficult

1645
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:33,821
to specify a particular situation that 
is in and of itself negative

1646
01:35:37,070 --> 01:35:41,330
without any relationship to how you act 
in the face of that thing.

1647
01:35:42,410 --> 01:35:44,370
So let me,
let me read you the,

1648
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:48,170
you have to think about this from,
from the perspective of image,

1649
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,730
myth and literature constantly represent
the parch kingdom.

1650
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:55,280
This society victim on its most 
frequently by drought,

1651
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:59,310
which is the absence of water concretely
in the water of life or spirit.

1652
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:02,930
Symbolically,
it scorched as a consequence of the over

1653
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:05,120
prolonged the dominance of the ruling 
idea,

1654
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:09,110
this idea in the narrative and 
frequently in there as well.

1655
01:36:09,111 --> 01:36:09,944
And he is the king,
the ancestral spirit representative of 

1656
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:15,890
his people made tyrannical by age or 
pride,

1657
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:16,783
unbearable disappointment or we're doing
under the influence of some malevolent 

1658
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:23,750
and advising force development of such 
circumstances.

1659
01:36:23,751 --> 01:36:24,531
Call,
of course,

1660
01:36:24,531 --> 01:36:28,010
for the entrance of the hero who's the 
lost son of the true king,

1661
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,950
raised in secrecy by alternative 
parrots,

1662
01:36:31,070 --> 01:36:31,903
the rightful ruler of the kingdom,
whose authority was undermine during 

1663
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:37,280
vulnerable youth or who had been 
journeying in far off lands.

1664
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:41,750
It was presumed yet here overturns the 
tire and regains his proper place.

1665
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:45,430
The gods please by the reestablishment 
of the proper order,

1666
01:36:45,431 --> 01:36:49,340
a lot of the rain once more to fall and 
the story of this type,

1667
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:50,503
the creative aspect of the unknown or 
nature is locked away metaphorically by 

1668
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:58,010
the totalitarian.
No opinion of the current culture such a

1669
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:00,470
state of affairs might be represented.
For example,

1670
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:04,070
by the sleeping princess in the kingdom 
brought to a standstill.

1671
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:07,490
What by some alternative variant of the 
existence of the treasure,

1672
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:08,324
hard to attain paralyzed by patriarchal 
despotism or frequently by fear of the 

1673
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:14,264
terrible mother kingdom remained 
stagnant while the princess nature and 

1674
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:18,614
your benevolent guys waits for the kiss 
of the hero two week her awakened and 

1675
01:37:21,951 --> 01:37:24,200
revitalize beauty.
Subsequently we animate,

1676
01:37:24,260 --> 01:37:25,093
sir.

1677
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:27,583
Yeah.

1678
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:34,830
See these stories basically say that if 
the unknown,

1679
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,533
if the environment is turn,
if the environment has turned against 

1680
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:48,494
you,

1681
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:51,840
kill the king.
Okay.

1682
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,570
Because whether you know it or know him,
he's a tyrant.

1683
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,860
And so from the mythological 
perspective,

1684
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:05,220
there's no such thing as the negative 
aspect of the unknown as such.

1685
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:09,210
It's always only maybe it in 
relationship to a ruling idea.

1686
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:12,150
And the mythological idea is that if 
it's negative,

1687
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,150
there's something wrong with it.
We wouldn't idea.

1688
01:38:14,690 --> 01:38:17,130
That's the basic notion.
It's a strange idea.

1689
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:18,960
And let's be honest,
obviously the circling the wagons,

1690
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:22,510
sorry.
Do you have to elaborate on like,

1691
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:23,570
like,
like,

1692
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,520
uh,
becoming more rigidly holding onto you,

1693
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,570
right.
When facebook,

1694
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:32,430
it's not precisely the,
it's not precisely the officer because,

1695
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,551
okay.
And then I'll,

1696
01:38:37,551 --> 01:38:39,180
I'll get,
I'll get back to this.

1697
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:46,260
If the,
if the environment has become,

1698
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:48,053
has turned against you,
then that's a sign that it's time to 

1699
01:38:52,261 --> 01:38:57,261
sacrifice the cake because
this,

1700
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:01,770
the unknown is only negative in 
relationship to an idea.

1701
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:02,910
We already know that.
Right?

1702
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:03,744
I mean,
that's what we've been talking about 

1703
01:39:04,201 --> 01:39:06,000
with regards to the structure of these 
stories.

1704
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:06,834
All lawns that you construe the 
motivation valence of something with 

1705
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:15,660
respect to your current story.
So the mythological story basically says

1706
01:39:15,661 --> 01:39:18,690
if negative things are happening all 
around you,

1707
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:23,130
it's not the environment as an objective
thing.

1708
01:39:23,131 --> 01:39:24,840
There's something wrong with the way 
you're living.

1709
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,950
That's why well say in an archaic exists
in an archaic society.

1710
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:33,060
It's actually frequently happen is if 
things aren't working out,

1711
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,820
like there's a foot long drought,
it's time to kill the king.

1712
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,860
When you think about a stupid idea that 
is,

1713
01:39:37,861 --> 01:39:38,371
you know,
they quit,

1714
01:39:38,371 --> 01:39:40,350
the Kale is the king has to do with the 
drug.

1715
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:41,633
But the point is,
the point of the story is that the 

1716
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:49,170
environment in large part is the 
consequence of your adaptive response.

1717
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:53,130
It's a presence,
at least in terms of its valence.

1718
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:54,713
So it's a very intelligent to kill the 
cane when things aren't going well 

1719
01:39:56,611 --> 01:39:59,610
because after all,
the king is the pattern of behavior that

1720
01:39:59,611 --> 01:40:00,444
constitutes the kingdom.
And if the kingdom isn't going very 

1721
01:40:02,521 --> 01:40:03,354
well,
which means that the negative space of 

1722
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:06,870
the great mother is constantly a very 
well.

1723
01:40:07,020 --> 01:40:10,330
And who do you sacrifice when you 
sacrifice them to the grapevine?

1724
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:11,553
Right.
In hopes that her causative facebook 

1725
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:15,450
reappeared.
And the funny thing is it works.

1726
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:17,760
This is another,
this isn't,

1727
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,970
again,
that's like you,

1728
01:40:19,971 --> 01:40:23,550
you people are going to have to evaluate
these ideas over a longer time,

1729
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,830
I suspect.
But I'll tell you,

1730
01:40:26,070 --> 01:40:26,903
I've never read anything anywhere that 
explains why people engaged in 

1731
01:40:29,731 --> 01:40:32,970
sacrificial rituals.
It's nothing that ever made any sense to

1732
01:40:32,971 --> 01:40:34,160
me,
although people did it all.

1733
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,290
So this makes sense.
It's ridiculous.

1734
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:38,124
The thing that people
participate in activities like that in 

1735
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:45,780
so many places over such long periods of
time for no reason whatsoever.

1736
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:47,310
Well this is not ideally interact.
You know,

1737
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:49,800
cause like if what you're doing isn't 
working,

1738
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,350
kill it,
do something else.

1739
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:54,063
Good thinking.

1740
01:40:57,870 --> 01:41:02,650
So I don't understand why you'd have the
why in that diagram,

1741
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:04,630
you know,
where are the opposite each other?

1742
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:05,803
Well,
it's the positive aspect of our culture 

1743
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,450
that protects you from the negative 
aspect of it.

1744
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,110
But it was like snacks.
Yes,

1745
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:13,990
that's right.
They're stacked discs.

1746
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,520
That's right.
It would be better if you had to do four

1747
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:20,043
more faces so that they are,
the positive aspects of the Cape 

1748
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:25,540
couldn't line up with the positive 
aspect.

1749
01:41:26,910 --> 01:41:27,743
And so

1750
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:30,413
because in that case you'll have to 
shoot him if he'll sketch that or 

1751
01:41:33,111 --> 01:41:36,690
appreciate because I know the right,
there's something like there's something

1752
01:41:36,691 --> 01:41:38,580
missing,
just a receipt where the

1753
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,400
indicating king where the negative 
sinus.

1754
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,730
Yeah.
We'll just make it a go

1755
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:56,370
here
where the no weekend and also,

1756
01:42:19,630 --> 01:42:20,850
yeah,
yeah,

1757
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:22,223
yeah.

1758
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:28,360
Well I don't know either.
Thinking about

1759
01:42:30,430 --> 01:42:32,200
the idea that since there are stack 
this,

1760
01:42:32,201 --> 01:42:35,560
the uh,
the known blocks you from the,

1761
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:36,850
yeah,
but that's still works,

1762
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:37,684
right,
because this is still inscribed inside 

1763
01:42:39,371 --> 01:42:41,470
the circle.
So then this,

1764
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:43,630
right?
Yes.

1765
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,051
No.
Well,

1766
01:42:44,051 --> 01:42:45,910
but then you have them,
you don't have the positive,

1767
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:47,020
I mean,
if it's,

1768
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,120
if it's not something that works by 
blocking,

1769
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,210
then you have the positive aspect of the
known you.

1770
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:52,123
Oh,
right,

1771
01:42:52,170 --> 01:42:53,950
right.
Positive aspect of the unknown,

1772
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,980
which is what,
and the other way to help them there.

1773
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:58,360
But yeah,
right.

1774
01:42:58,361 --> 01:43:00,880
The negative because the negative of the
negative of the,

1775
01:43:01,010 --> 01:43:02,490
but that's true.
They're more blacks.

1776
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,200
The positive.
This is true too though because they say

1777
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:09,130
that good is the enemy of the better,
which is to say that you know,

1778
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,410
well
you don't want a divorce,

1779
01:43:12,411 --> 01:43:13,244
you had keyboard is,
well a divorce you might keep the 

1780
01:43:16,151 --> 01:43:16,984
keyboard on,
a computer is laid out so that you can 

1781
01:43:18,461 --> 01:43:19,294
type slowly.

1782
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,463
And the reason for that is because it 
was designed on a for a manual type 

1783
01:43:23,631 --> 01:43:26,740
partner and really fast typists with jam
and the keys.

1784
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:31,360
So some bright character figured out how
to separate the most commonly used keys.

1785
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:32,643
So that really fast type is good and Jim
and manual type Rick horshack keyboard 

1786
01:43:36,821 --> 01:43:37,654
where the key is that use most are laid 
out very close to each other and you 

1787
01:43:39,971 --> 01:43:43,470
hardly have to move your fingers at all.
Now I would like to,

1788
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,240
I'd like to learn to use it,
divorce,

1789
01:43:46,241 --> 01:43:49,030
Shaq keyboard,
but I already know how to use the qwerty

1790
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:50,800
keyboard.
So I don't,

1791
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:53,023
and that means that what I know stops me
from learning something because what I 

1792
01:43:56,061 --> 01:43:56,894
know is good enough,
it stops me from learning something 

1793
01:43:58,461 --> 01:44:00,260
better.
So I'm off to say,

1794
01:44:00,261 --> 01:44:02,030
I mean I see your objection.
It makes sense.

1795
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:05,450
It's sometimes it's hard to make the 
jump.

1796
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:06,284
Not saying that it's wrong,
I'm just saying that there's sort of 

1797
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:09,560
mixing the metaphor of blocking with the
metaphor of,

1798
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:11,480
of revealing.
Right,

1799
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:12,350
right,
right.

1800
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:13,703
Well yeah,
I'll have to keep this in mind and see 

1801
01:44:15,681 --> 01:44:18,890
if there's a way of balancing both.
So then we're,

1802
01:44:18,891 --> 01:44:21,980
the reaction to threat in the 
environment is to clean.

1803
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:24,660
You are rigidly to the kid as opposed to
kill the kid.

1804
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,470
Right now it would be the negative,
negative,

1805
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:37,280
I don't know.
Yes,

1806
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:39,080
that's right.
I see what you mean.

1807
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,430
Yeah,
that's exactly what happens.

1808
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:41,293
Good short term solution.
But no walk in the long term cause 

1809
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:44,810
damage to your father.
You know,

1810
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:49,610
all you're doing is accumulating is knew
what you're doing is like here's a whole

1811
01:44:49,910 --> 01:44:52,760
bunch of disasters.
You can have them one at a time,

1812
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:58,120
over a long span of time or you can 
shove them all into a clump out there in

1813
01:44:58,281 --> 01:44:59,114
the future and go along merrily until 
you fall into them and have them all at 

1814
01:45:01,941 --> 01:45:02,720
once.
Right.

1815
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,050
So,
and that's basically the,

1816
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:06,140
that's the authoritarian answer to the 
problem,

1817
01:45:06,141 --> 01:45:08,000
right?
That may certainly the way that's right.

1818
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:08,930
Yes,
yes,

1819
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:09,913
yes.
But one of the things I want to make 

1820
01:45:10,731 --> 01:45:12,990
more clear in the second half of this 
manuscript,

1821
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:14,830
which isn't very well laid out right 
now,

1822
01:45:14,831 --> 01:45:18,200
it's that there are three patterns of 
response to a normal.

1823
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:22,160
One is face it and do something about 
it,

1824
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,370
which is basically admitted there,
number one,

1825
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,413
and then engage in whatever modification
of your story is necessary to produce 

1826
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:33,440
something positive from your encounter 
with it.

1827
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:34,933
The second one is circle the wagons,
which is to say some anomaly is facing 

1828
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:40,724
me from outside.
I'm afraid of the known because I've 

1829
01:45:42,821 --> 01:45:45,920
sacrificed my relationship with the 
hero.

1830
01:45:46,670 --> 01:45:47,503
That's what an authoritarian does.
I'm not creative like the emperor's 

1831
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,980
creative for me,
I just do what he says.

1832
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:57,163
When you circle the wagons,
you also restrict the amount of novelty 

1833
01:45:59,931 --> 01:46:04,931
that exists within your constricted 
environment and dampen down your aspect,

1834
01:46:05,801 --> 01:46:06,890
act as a consequence,
right?

1835
01:46:06,891 --> 01:46:09,980
Because you make everyone the same,
which is what authoritarians too.

1836
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:12,890
So that's one way of going about it.
Wrong.

1837
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:13,933
The other way of going about it wrong is
it supposed to be the king is dead long 

1838
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:19,874
live the king.

1839
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:23,750
The wrong way of going about it is the 
king is dead period,

1840
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:26,750
period and people are motivated to do 
that.

1841
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:27,920
That's the thing.
It's like you'd say,

1842
01:46:27,921 --> 01:46:28,754
why the hell would someone do that?
Because we already know that you need 

1843
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:32,660
the king around or you're flooded with 
anxiety,

1844
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:35,780
so why kill him?
While the thing is people do that,

1845
01:46:35,781 --> 01:46:36,614
you know that's that artistic or 
rebellious sort of sort of style of 

1846
01:46:39,771 --> 01:46:40,604
adaptation.
But the problem with having a king is 

1847
01:46:42,831 --> 01:46:43,664
that you have to do what he says and 
that's the price you pay for your 

1848
01:46:45,681 --> 01:46:46,514
security.
You might be willing to get rid them if 

1849
01:46:49,411 --> 01:46:52,560
you can't stand any responsibility.
And that's the,

1850
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:55,740
that's the alternative,
improper mode that a patient,

1851
01:46:55,741 --> 01:47:00,741
I think that's where you get this right 
in Chinese medicine there order

1852
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:05,303
and chaos and if you're ill it's because
you have too much yin and Yang or you 

1853
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:13,513
have too much Yang.
You note about the end and the job that 

1854
01:47:14,611 --> 01:47:18,120
the Chinese doctor is to analyze you,
so to speak,

1855
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:22,440
to ensure that the balance between the 
two phenomena is optimal,

1856
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:23,274
which means that you're here instead of 
over here in the authoritarian zone of 

1857
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:29,570
the world are over here in the chaotic 
zone.

1858
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:36,863
Okay,
so next week we start talking about 

1859
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:42,750
this.
The final part of the story,

1860
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:45,660
which is
this,

1861
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:49,710
which is I'm interested in you see,
as we know,

1862
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:55,020
we know that you have a very good reason
for protecting your culture,

1863
01:47:55,560 --> 01:47:57,390
which is that it regulates your 
emotions.

1864
01:48:00,780 --> 01:48:01,613
What I'm interested in is given that 
it's necessary for you to maintain your 

1865
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:05,814
culture,
even in the face of threats from other 

1866
01:48:06,991 --> 01:48:07,824
cultures,
are there patterns of personal behavior 

1867
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:12,054
that amplify it's are there patterns of 
personal behavior and amplified the 

1868
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:20,880
danger of culture and patterns of 
behavior that reduce it?

1869
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,253
So is there something about your 
relationship to your culture that can 

1870
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:29,520
either exacerbate intrinsic problems of 
group identification or reduce them?

1871
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:32,430
And that's what we're going to try to 
find out in the last part of the course.

1872
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,683
It's like culture's necessary.
The problem with the necessity of 

1873
01:48:36,511 --> 01:48:41,280
culture is that it virtually ensures the
existence of conflict.

1874
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:42,803
Given that,
is there a way to act to make it worse 

1875
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:47,700
or to make it better,
and that's what we're going to talk

1876
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:50,203
so.
