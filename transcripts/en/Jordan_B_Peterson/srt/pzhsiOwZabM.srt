1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,023
Yeah,

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,110
you really can't tell the meaning of 
someone's life till the very end.

3
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,580
It's for the same reason,
right?

4
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:38,414
Is that
how all the pieces fit together in the 

5
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,434
story or in the life is not necessarily 
determined until the final moment and I 

6
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,800
think that's part of the reason too.
Why among Catholics,

7
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,260
for example,
in Christians in general,

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,590
there's an idea that salvation can 
always be attained,

9
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,880
right?
Right up until the last moment.

10
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,620
No matter what your life was like and 
you think,

11
00:00:57,621 --> 00:01:01,480
well that's a pretty cheap trick because
you can run around doing terrible things

12
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:02,314
your whole life,
but as long as you get it together the 

13
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:04,910
last second,
then you're Scott free.

14
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:07,130
But if you think about it in terms of a 
story,

15
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:07,964
then you can understand how that could 
conceivably be the case and it's for 

16
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,130
this reason,
of course,

17
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:13,964
that this lecture in particular makes me
nervous more than any of the other ones 

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,990
I do because I've been telling you a 
story that's basically 40 hours long.

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,823
Right?
And it's spoken for them and then who 

20
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:27,800
knows how long and it's written for him 
and it's.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,673
It's complicated to pull it together 
properly and that's partly because as 

22
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:32,444
far as I've been concerned,
we've been talking about issues in 

23
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,550
psychology that are more difficult than 
any other,

24
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,260
first of all,
conceptually,

25
00:01:39,261 --> 00:01:40,094
even from a neuropsychological 
perspective because I've been offering 

26
00:01:42,261 --> 00:01:43,094
you a model of the way the brain 
processes the environment that I think 

27
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:46,784
is really novel and and I think it 
reflects the current state of 

28
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,910
neuroscience and but,
but more than that,

29
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:56,090
there's the problem that we've been 
dealing with issues all the way along of

30
00:01:56,091 --> 00:02:00,530
life and death and of war and 
destruction and have the possibility for

31
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:01,364
all clearheaded optimism.
A possibility which as we've discussed 

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,350
more or less escape tolstoy say for most
of his life.

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,213
Right?
Because when tolstoy woke up from his 

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,240
delusions,
he looked at the world and he said,

35
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,950
well,
clearly it's such a terrible place.

36
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,790
That as if you're not looking at it 
through the veils of illusion,

37
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,780
there is no way that you can do anything
but stand in opposition to it.

38
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,150
Once you understand its basic structure,
right?

39
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:28,984
Suffering and innocent suffering and 
complete vulnerability and the whole 

40
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:38,491
existential mass that makes up life out 
turns out that tolstoy overcame his

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,200
rationally induced cynicism in a kind of
mystical way.

42
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,183
He had a dream that he was suspended 
from some transcendent space by a belt 

43
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:53,984
around the middle of his waist,
which hung them over a period of chaos 

44
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:00,550
and in that image he found and fair 
enough,

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,490
it's a powerful image,
but it's not well delineated.

46
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,383
Right,
and it worked well for tolstoy and you 

47
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:08,410
can see that the image has power,
but you can't.

48
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,020
You can't grab it with your rational 
mind.

49
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:11,854
You can't take it into pieces and 
analyze it as an argument and that's 

50
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,020
what we do if we're intellectuals,
right?

51
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,854
We try to understand the detailed 
structure of something and I think the 

52
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,284
detailed structure of what tolstoy 
apprehended as optimistic is actually 

53
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:28,804
comprehensible and we've been working 
towards that and circling around to the 

54
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:38,461
entire course of this lecture series,
but I found with this material that with

55
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,740
each circling around the target,
it gets clearer and clearer.

56
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,643
It's a funny thing.
It's like you're looking at something 

57
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:49,030
that's too complicated to see all at 
once,

58
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,864
so you have to look at it from multiple 
different perspectives and again and 

59
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:53,680
again,
and each time you look at it,

60
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,903
it becomes clearer and clearer.
That still the case for me when I go 

61
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:59,020
through this material,
every time I go through it,

62
00:03:59,021 --> 00:03:59,621
I think,
oh yeah,

63
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,454
that piece fits there and that piece 
fits there and that's how that makes 

64
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
sense and oh,
that's a lot more remarkable than I 

65
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:06,874
thought it was to begin with and so on,
and it seems fundamentally 

66
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,454
inexhaustible,
and of course that's what you'd expect 

67
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,340
from deep,
deep stories,

68
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:13,174
right?
Stories that have been around for 

69
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:14,974
thousands and thousands of years 
wouldn't have been around for thousands 

70
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,560
and thousands of years unless they were 
in some sense,

71
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,394
inexhaustible,
and we've talked about some of the 

72
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,610
processes that might contribute to that.

73
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,443
Inexhaustible it.
So at the beginning of the lecture 

74
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,214
series,
I told you to consider the assumption 

75
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:35,050
that there was more than one way of 
looking at the world.

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,483
Right?
There was the standard materialist sort 

77
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:38,914
of scientific viewpoint,
which was that the world was made up of 

78
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:44,470
objects independently existent us among 
them,

79
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,070
the objects have no intrinsic value one 
way or another,

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,340
and the issue of meaning per se wasn't 
included in that account,

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,540
and then I said,
well wait,

82
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,374
there's another way of looking at the 
world that we spent just as much time 

83
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,870
developing that we utilize even more,
and that's the narrative.

84
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,903
That's the narrative way of looking at 
the world to consider the nature of the 

85
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:07,954
experience rather than the nature of 
objects as real to consider your 

86
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:12,754
experience as real,
even though it includes things that 

87
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:18,280
can't be easily and tangibly identified.
Things like emotions,

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,120
which of course you find compelling 
sometimes even beyond your will.

89
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,480
Things like motivational states,
fantasies,

90
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,170
ideals,
all the things that compel your behavior

91
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,213
and give you some sense that there's a 
direction to life and people who study 

92
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:34,774
emotion and perception have come.
To understand that the act of 

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,910
transforming the world into something 
simply made out of objects is incredibly

94
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,744
difficult.
It's so difficult that we haven't been 

95
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,500
able to design machines that can do it 
at all.

96
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,630
It turns out also that when we look at 
the world,

97
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:51,880
we're not just looking at it with our 
visual systems,

98
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:52,714
but we're looking at it with our motor 
output systems and our emotions so that 

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,000
when you look at something like a chair 
which just stands there for you,

100
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:00,834
like an object,
it turns out that the mechanical 

101
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:04,464
systems,
the motor systems that you would use to 

102
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:07,404
use the chair to sit on it,
are activated during the act of 

103
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:10,254
perception.
It also turns out sometimes that when 

104
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,950
you look at something,
especially if it's something you've done

105
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:16,170
to understanding that it's and that 
scares you,

106
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,860
you actually react to it,
conceptualize it with your body and with

107
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,034
your emotions before you have any idea 
what it is from the perspective of an 

108
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:26,784
object.

109
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,550
When you look at the world and when you 
think about the world,

110
00:06:33,551 --> 00:06:34,384
you have to do it from a motivation.
I'm motivated perspective and an 

111
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:38,134
emotionally written perspective.
You can't even see the world without 

112
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:44,200
being gripped by your motivation and 
emotional states,

113
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:45,034
and so the idea that rationality or 
perception is somehow separate from or 

114
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,870
or superordinate to
perception and emotion is just wrong.

115
00:06:56,021 --> 00:07:00,010
We understand now that you can't even 
think without being motivated.

116
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:03,340
You can't see the world without being 
motivated and that means you always look

117
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:07,300
at the world through a kind of Lens and 
the Lens is a narrowing lands and it has

118
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,340
to be because the world is so 
complicated.

119
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:10,174
You can't see it all at once.
You're only seeing tiny slices of it in 

120
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:13,864
time and tiny slices of it in space and 
and even then you have to narrow it to 

121
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,454
only those things that are relevant to 
you at that moment and we don't know 

122
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:22,420
exactly how you do that.

123
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,403
We know that it takes years and years of
perceptual work in infancy say so that 

124
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:32,380
you managed to build up an object 
conception of the world.

125
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:33,214
That's probably all you're doing in the 
first two or three years of life and 

126
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,294
you're doing it constantly and it's just
as complicated as learning language say 

127
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,120
are even more complicated.
Most of it's invisible and we don't know

128
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:46,360
how children do that and by the time 
they can talk,

129
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:49,780
they've already done it so they can't 
even tell us what they're doing.

130
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,973
It takes a long time to build up an 
object world and when you look at the 

131
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,320
world,
when you go from point a to point b,

132
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,183
even when you're doing something as 
simple as looking for food and in the 

133
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,453
kitchen,
you ignore everything about the world 

134
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,484
that isn't relevant to making yourself a
peanut butter sandwich and you focus in 

135
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,190
on those few things that are the 
refrigerator,

136
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,630
the food,
the knives,

137
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:13,690
the cutlery and so on and everything 
else is screened out.

138
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,700
Then you can't help but look at the 
world through that kind of lance and the

139
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,340
lenses change and you can be 
indifferent,

140
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,790
motivational states and they can change 
because of internal transformations.

141
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:27,370
You're not hungry or thirsty or you're 
not thirsty.

142
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:28,204
You're interested in someone or somebody
is telling you a story and then you 

143
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:35,170
adopt their motivational framework and 
you can see the world through their eyes

144
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:38,350
and now we know what the neural 
machinery for that and we already talked

145
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,184
about that so we can toss back and forth
these motivational rains that frames of 

146
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,520
reference and that gives us insight into
someone else's world.

147
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,073
You can look at the world endless 
numbers of ways and what you're trying 

148
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:54,550
to do is out of its infinite richness,
so to speak,

149
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,620
is pull out parts of it that are useful 
for you while you're moving from point a

150
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,454
to point b,
and this can be a chair if you want to 

151
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,394
sit down,
but if you want to take the light bulb 

152
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,134
out of the ceiling,
then it's then it's a stool or a table 

153
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,070
and whether or not it's a chair or a 
stool or a table depends just as much on

154
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,370
what you're doing as it does on what it 
is.

155
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,193
And I think that's part of the reason 
why human beings can be so infinitely 

156
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:19,231
creative.
Right?

157
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,670
For us,
the world isn't fixed.

158
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,710
We never know what it's going to bring 
forth,

159
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,500
so 100 years ago,
if someone would have said,

160
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:29,550
well,
you could build a machine on a wafer,

161
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,443
a centimeter square out of sand,
and if you have enough of those 

162
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:35,964
machines,
then everyone in the world can be 

163
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:37,614
connected and everyone in the world can 
have an infinite library of verbal 

164
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,250
material.
Right?

165
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,560
That's impossible,
but it's not impossible.

166
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:48,561
It turns out that Silica has those 
properties and we can build unbelievably

167
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:54,540
powerful machines out of nothing,
and so then that kind of makes you think

168
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,374
about just what this.
Nothing that we're building things out 

169
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:57,954
of his right because it seems to be able
to reveal a constant array of 

170
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,054
properties.
Properties that are essentially 

171
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,990
unlimited and its capacity to reveal 
those properties seems to depend as much

172
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:12,930
on our ability to interact with it.
Whatever that is,

173
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,003
as it does on whatever the stuff is,
and we know even from a strict object 

174
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,423
perception of the world that the stuff 
that things are made of is a lot more 

175
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:27,950
complicated than we had originally 
presumed.

176
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:32,480
Even as materialists,
because materialists realists,

177
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:38,850
their philosophy only holds down to the 
subatomic level of analysis.

178
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,580
Deterministic worldview below the 
subatomic level of analysis.

179
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:43,414
There's nothing deterministic at all and
the stuff that things are made of is so 

180
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,440
mysterious that we can't even.
We can't grasp,

181
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,274
but we can't comprehend it.
So it turns out that rather than the 

182
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,100
story world be being dependent on the 
object world,

183
00:10:57,101 --> 00:10:57,934
it might be the other way around.
The object world is dependent on the 

184
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:00,784
story world and that implies at least to
some degree that the story world is 

185
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:06,040
actually more real.
Whatever that means,

186
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,950
and then I told you that,
well,

187
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,840
the real problem of life isn't so much 
what do you do when you're around things

188
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,674
that you understand?
The real problem of life is what do you 

189
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:21,340
do when you encounter something you 
can't conceptualize?

190
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,174
And I think a good recent example of 
that was the bombing of the world trade 

191
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:25,984
towers,
which people were compelled to watch 

192
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:29,770
over and over and over and over.

193
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,010
And if you ask someone,
well what is it that you're watching?

194
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:33,940
They would say,
well,

195
00:11:33,941 --> 00:11:36,700
I'm watching the world trade towers fall
down,

196
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,170
but then you might say,
well,

197
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,450
why are you watching it over and over 
and they would say something like,

198
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,010
well,
I can't believe it.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,250
I can't believe it's happening,
and what does that mean?

200
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,300
It means something like whatever it is 
that's happening here,

201
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,200
whatever's being blown apart exceeds my 
ability to model.

202
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,153
As a consequence,
I have to expose myself to it again and 

203
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,320
again and again and again to try to 
understand what's falling,

204
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,580
what's falling exactly.
Is it just the.

205
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,090
Is it just the Towers is at 20,000 
people,

206
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:04,924
is that the financial system of the u?
S is the stability of the Western world 

207
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,033
is at the beginning of world war three 
or as the former CIA director just 

208
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,210
mentioned in theu ,
s the beginning of world war for what is

209
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:17,044
it exactly that you're looking at when 
something happens that you don't 

210
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:19,834
understand

211
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,431
and then you say,
well,

212
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,264
how do you react to that?
And it turns out that you react mostly 

213
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:31,400
with your body,
not with your mind,

214
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,800
not with your perceptual systems,
not with your thoughts,

215
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:34,634
but with your emotions and your body,
and that means you sweat and you panic 

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,100
and you feel depressed and you feel hurt
and you feel ashamed and you're prepared

217
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:43,934
for a catastrophe,
which is stress and all that basically 

218
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,264
noncognitive.
And what that means is that when you 

219
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,560
encounter something you don't 
understand,

220
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:56,561
the first manner in which you conceive 
of it is embodied emotional,

221
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,003
physical way.
Before you develop up an object 

222
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:02,030
representation or cognitive 
representation,

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,940
you may not ever get it like an event 
like that,

224
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,863
or a worse event can throw someone into 
a tailspin that's so extreme that they 

225
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:11,360
never get out of it.
So you'll see,

226
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:12,550
for example,
sometimes,

227
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,600
and this is more true among elderly 
people,

228
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:15,434
if their spouse dies,
the probability that they'll die in the 

229
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,243
next year,
say from a heart attack or something 

230
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,770
like that,
increases substantially.

231
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,083
Why is that?
It's because they're conceptual frame 

232
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:30,560
was so dependent on the existence of 
their spouse.

233
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:31,394
Say someone they've lived with for 25 
years that the anxiety and uncertainty 

234
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,673
caused by their anomalous disappearance 
there death is so extreme that it sends 

235
00:13:41,451 --> 00:13:42,284
their body into a physiological state 
that's basically unbearable and that 

236
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:45,794
does the men,
and when you start to understand what 

237
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,380
having your preconceptions rattled 
really means,

238
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:56,381
then you also start to understand why 
people are so motivated to protect their

239
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,880
ideological territory.
Right?

240
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,430
Because ideological territory,
that's how you see the world.

241
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,293
That's your story and you can't have 
your fundaments rattled all the time 

242
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:10,520
because it throws everything into chaos 
and that puts you in this terrible,

243
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,550
panicky cortisol written stressful state
that's really hard on you physically.

244
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:16,904
So we know for example,
that if you're in a state where you're 

245
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,320
chronically exposed to threat or 
punishment,

246
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:24,920
which is the case in depression,
say you produce a lot of cortisol,

247
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:27,800
which is a stress hormone and cortisol 
is toxic.

248
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,783
So the more of it you produce,
the more you kill off your hippocampal 

249
00:14:30,851 --> 00:14:33,920
cells and you really need them because 
they are key to memory.

250
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,193
You do in your immunological system.
There's all sorts of negative side 

251
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,194
effects of cortisol poisoning,
increased incidents of cardiovascular 

252
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,520
disease,
heightened grade of cancer,

253
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,500
plus it's just no fun,
right?

254
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:47,540
It's the worst thing that can possibly 
happen to you.

255
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,600
Essentially.
If something I know it happens to you in

256
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,220
blows frame of reference,
right,

257
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,560
knocks you for a loop,
sends you to the underworld,

258
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,394
however you want to construe it,
that's really going to upset your 

259
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,110
bandwagon and throw you into a state 
that you do virtually anything to avoid.

260
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:03,944
But by the same token,
there is a possibility that inside that 

261
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,950
chaotic mess,
there's something you really need,

262
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,590
and what's the logic there?
Well,

263
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:15,230
the logic is something like this.
When you look at the world,

264
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:16,064
you only see a fragment of it and that's
good because it's pretty overwhelming 

265
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,930
and the fragments generally more than 
enough,

266
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,393
but all the information that you've ever
gathered in your entire life to build 

267
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:30,350
yourself out of and to make your life 
stable has come as a consequence of your

268
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:33,230
ability to explore what you don't 
understand,

269
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,110
and that's an unlimited capacity,
right?

270
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,560
No matter how much you explored,
how much information you gather,

271
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,753
there's always the possibility that 
there's way more information out there 

272
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:46,730
and that means if you have a problem and
you see that it's a problem,

273
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,683
even though that's frightening,
it's also a gateway into a domain of 

274
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:56,081
possibility and the possibility is this 
richly informative background that could

275
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,910
in principle provide you with any answer
you need,

276
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,490
but and then you can take one more 
thing.

277
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,710
The old Gods Mars,
say the God of war,

278
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,030
Venus,
the god of love,

279
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,850
they're all internalized for us,
right?

280
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,500
We know that angers the psychological 
state and that love is the psychological

281
00:16:15,501 --> 00:16:16,334
state,
but if we look at our great religious 

282
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,890
traditions,
Christianity say or Buddhism,

283
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,993
just to take two as an example,
we still have this notion that what 

284
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,720
these figures represent is something 
external.

285
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,570
Well,
you might say how primitive,

286
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,273
right?

287
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,270
Just as primitive as the idea that the 
god of war is something external,

288
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:41,420
is the idea that this sort of figure is 
supposed to be something external.

289
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,780
It's supposed to be something embodied,
right?

290
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,550
It's a story about the nature of 
individual moral responsibility.

291
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,270
So the idea is something like this,
well,

292
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,243
reality itself,
the existence of things seems to depend 

293
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,923
on the existence of a finite observer so
that we can see things from a 

294
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:03,614
perspective.
If you don't see things from a 

295
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,410
perspective,
everything is the same.

296
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,333
There's nothing delineated.
But if there's going to be delineated 

297
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,470
things,
small things,

298
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:13,304
insufficient things,
and they're going to be aware they're 

299
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,770
going to be vulnerable as a part of 
their limitation.

300
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,940
And so you say,
well,

301
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,303
limitation is a precondition for being 
and that means suffering is part and 

302
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:25,940
parcel of being.

303
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,390
Dostoevsky said,
clearly,

304
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,970
look,
I'll give you all the cake you want.

305
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,460
You got a big house,
you got nothing to do,

306
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:39,020
but watch TV,
right?

307
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,780
And propagate the species.
Are you happy?

308
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,340
Dostoevsky says,
well,

309
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:44,174
no.
Why?

310
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,133
Well,
because human beings are really 

311
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,440
fundamentally know,
ungrateful and insane,

312
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,453
so if you give them some little 
comfortable niche to occupy themselves 

313
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:54,600
with so they don't have anything to 
worry about,

314
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,970
the first thing they're going to do,
just like Adam and eve,

315
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,833
basically are just like Gautama Buddha.
They're going to run around looking for 

316
00:18:01,021 --> 00:18:03,450
the apple,
looking for the snake.

317
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,420
Looking for the trouble to smash the 
frame into bits,

318
00:18:06,421 --> 00:18:07,254
no matter how comfortable it is,
just so they can get access to little 

319
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:12,600
chaos and have some fun,
and so then you think,

320
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:14,910
well,
maybe it's more like the purpose of life

321
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,250
isn't to avoid chaos because we like 
chaos.

322
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,210
It's entertaining,
right?

323
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:19,044
It keeps us alert and awake and it gives
us something to do that really has no 

324
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,840
end and so maybe the answer is something
more like,

325
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,780
well,
forget the frame of reference and forget

326
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:28,614
the chaos,
but hit the balance right between the 

327
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:31,411
two.
Right?

328
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,244
So that you've got one foot where it's 
reasonably comfortable and you've got 

329
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:35,634
one foot out there where it's kind of 
exciting and dangerous and that's 

330
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:40,710
perfect,
and then you think the state you want to

331
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:44,430
attain that makes you resistant to even 
the greatest anomalies.

332
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,533
Anomalies of death say,
or vulnerability or mortality is 

333
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:50,370
exactly.
That's that position,

334
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:51,204
right?
Balance Straight between the forces of 

335
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,724
chaos and the forces of order or between
Yin and Yang and how do you know you're 

336
00:18:58,171 --> 00:19:00,960
there because that's what it really 
boils down to.

337
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:03,240
How do you know that you were there and 
then you think,

338
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,350
okay,
it's pretty simple.

339
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,340
You Watch with your eyes open,
just like Solzhenitsyn Watch.

340
00:19:10,341 --> 00:19:13,630
Do you think I don't know everything,
so let's see what I do.

341
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:15,370
No,
no preconceptions.

342
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,204
I'm not going to shield myself from the 
truth with some second rate frame of 

343
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:20,854
reference.
We don't believe in those anyways 

344
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:24,610
because they're always fragmental.
I'm just going to watch.

345
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,820
So when am I not miserable?
And then you think,

346
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:29,710
well,
I'm not miserable when I'm interested in

347
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,690
something,
I get interested in something.

348
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,390
I don't exactly know why I get 
interested in.

349
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,830
It catches me.

350
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:40,743
What are the,
what's the phenomenology of being 

351
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,460
caught?
Are Not self conscious.

352
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:47,130
When I'm engaged in something,
I'm more like a child,

353
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,910
which is why children have intimations 
of immortality.

354
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,744
I mean engaged in this process.
I don't think about myself so I'm not 

355
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,334
self conscious.
I lose my sense of temporality because 

356
00:19:58,741 --> 00:19:59,574
it seems like I can do whatever it is 
that I'm doing thing that I enjoy for 

357
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:03,654
hours and the time flies by and I'm not 
even really aware of the surrounding 

358
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:11,190
world and none of my existential 
concerns are paramount at that time.

359
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,180
Every need is suppressed by my 
engagement in the activity.

360
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,830
And then you say to yourself,
well,

361
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,860
yeah,
I find that only happens like you know,

362
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,530
10 minutes every three days or something
when I'm being particularly miserable,

363
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,700
but you might say,
well,

364
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,550
the fact that it happens at all is 
probably worth paying attention to.

365
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,460
I mean if you believe that your 
experience is real,

366
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,413
like real,
the fact that you can get into a state 

367
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:33,204
like that at all,
it's worth paying attention to and so 

368
00:20:34,411 --> 00:20:35,390
then you might say,
well that's,

369
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,493
that's where your sense of ethics really
starts to arise is what makes you 

370
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:40,891
interested.
Well,

371
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,840
it might be just as cracked and,
and,

372
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,853
and peculiar as.
It's something you could possibly 

373
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:45,954
imagine,
right?

374
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,280
Your parents are against your friends or
against it.

375
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,860
Even you're against it when you're 
thinking clearly,

376
00:20:50,861 --> 00:20:51,694
but there's still this reality that 
something compels you and then you 

377
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:56,261
think,
well,

378
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,660
can you trust it?
And I think,

379
00:20:58,661 --> 00:21:02,500
well that's a tough question because I 
read a long time for a long time,

380
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,334
I read accounts of serial killers 
because I was really interested in what 

381
00:21:07,091 --> 00:21:08,230
motivated them.
Right?

382
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,900
And they're an interesting breed in many
ways,

383
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:13,420
which is why there's such a popular 
fascination with them.

384
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,790
And so then you think about a story like
that and you think,

385
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,760
Geez,
maybe you can't trust your interest.

386
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,530
Right?
Maybe it'll take you somewhere.

387
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:23,230
You don't want to go like seriously 
where you don't want to go.

388
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,370
How do you know that if you really let 
yourself be who you could be,

389
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,263
that you'd end up somewhere good.
And so then the income to the second 

390
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,890
part of the story,
which is something like this.

391
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,800
Let's say that you're a very,
very,

392
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:39,670
very finely tuned biological machine,
right?

393
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,990
Kim Do a computer and then you say,
okay,

394
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,470
you take a computer and you feed it 
false information.

395
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,950
What do you get out?
False information,

396
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,540
right?
Well,

397
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,750
you've stuck with this computer,
it's very complicated.

398
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,560
You kind of reside in it in some manner 
you don't understand,

399
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,723
and yet you're prone pawn occasions 
either to deny it information 

400
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,680
altogether.

401
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,513
When you walk away from something you 
know you shouldn't walk away from or 

402
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,510
defeated it,
bad information,

403
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,700
and so then what if,
what if this was the case?

404
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:13,534
What if it was the case that the systems
that Orient you with regards to your 

405
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:17,854
interest can become pathologized by any 
relationship you have with yourself 

406
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:25,120
that's predicated on bad faith,
and so then you think,

407
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:25,954
well,
that's why there's an ethical aspect to 

408
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:32,410
this redemptive process,
like a real strenuous and strict ethical

409
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:33,940
aspect.
It goes something like this.

410
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,013
There are things that you can do.
Find yourself engaged with the world at 

411
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:43,030
such a level that your existential 
concerns could disappear and we can even

412
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:43,864
understand that biochemically to some 
degree because if you're really 

413
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:46,834
interested in something,
you get a dopamine release and 

414
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:51,730
exploratory dopamine release.
That's great.

415
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,760
I mean that's associated with positive 
effect with confidence,

416
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,830
with increased immunological 
functioning,

417
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,520
with better memory functioning with 
learning everything you want.

418
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,880
It's also potently antianxiety,
lytic and analgesic,

419
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,743
which means that if you're really 
pursuing something that's compelling to 

420
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:12,490
you,
you're much more resistant biochemically

421
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,960
to punishment,
disappointment,

422
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,310
depression,
pain,

423
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,890
threat,
etc. And it's not because you're blind,

424
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,013
it's not blind.
It's becAuse your nervous system is 

425
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:24,070
optimally tuned to make you maximally 
resistant.

426
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,310
And so then you might think if you were 
optimally tuned,

427
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,490
how resistant would you be?
You don't know,

428
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:32,223
right?
Because it's a spiral that never stops 

429
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:38,720
moving uphill.
We don't know what the upper end is.

430
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,240
We have exemplars that might indicate 
what that upper end could be,

431
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,400
but we don't actually know.
So then you think,

432
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,600
okay,
well here's the,

433
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,950
here's the rule.
Say something like this.

434
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,690
If you looked at the world from this 
perspective,

435
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:55,370
which is something you have to decide if
you're,

436
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,730
you know,
you find compelling and reasonable.

437
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The rule is this,
you're always gonna run into anomaly,

438
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,683
right?

439
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,121
And,
uh,

440
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:10,530
normally it's always going to look to 
look to you like,

441
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,450
like this,
and it's no bloody wonder.

442
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:15,890
You want to run away from that.
I mean,

443
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,230
in some ways is your whole body's 
telling you,

444
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,820
watch out.
And for good reason,

445
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:20,654
because It's no joke,
but then it was more to the story 

446
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:27,650
because the anomalous thing,
that's everything you don't know and you

447
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:28,520
might say,
well,

448
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,770
you're going out with someone and you 
want to have a longterm relationship.

449
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:33,230
They betray you.
How could there be any good in that?

450
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,193
Because that certainly what you're going
to ask when you first encounter the 

451
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:38,864
unexpected information,
but then you might think could be that 

452
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,900
I'm a little too naive for my own good,
right?

453
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,003
People pull me in a little more than 
they should or I'm not sufficiently 

454
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:49,903
careful when I enter into intimate 
relationships with people or I don't 

455
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:52,934
treat people right or I don't have a 
good conceptualization of myself or I'm 

456
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,980
chasing after the wrong person.

457
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,773
Well,
that's all going to be very annoying to 

458
00:25:00,681 --> 00:25:01,970
learn,
but if you don't learn it,

459
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:02,804
you're going to be in big trouble.
So maybe the best thing to do and then 

460
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,830
normally have that sort of hits you this
to think,

461
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,090
okay,
yeah,

462
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,700
it's a dragon.
No doubt it will eat me,

463
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,970
but if I don't let it eat me,
then they'll just be another one waiting

464
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,804
around the corner and it will probably 
be a little bit bigger and if I get 

465
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,264
eaten by enough of them,
I'm not really going to want to be 

466
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:19,754
around much and maybe I'm not going to 
be willing to help other people be 

467
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:22,784
around much either.
It doesn't seem like a very good 

468
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:25,610
alternative to me.

469
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,703
Back in 1957,
some new gnostic writings were 

470
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:36,050
discovered in a,
in a cave.

471
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,863
They were discovered by these two arab 
guys who went out to kill the man who 

472
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:43,844
killed her father.
They took them out into this cave and 

473
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,000
they killed them and when they were 
burying them,

474
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:47,834
they found exam for a full of papers and
papyrus and they took them home and 

475
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:52,664
their mother used a bunch of them to 
like cooking fires with and one day one 

476
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,330
of their friends who is an antiquities 
dealer showed up and he said,

477
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:00,860
you know,
you shouldn't be burning those.

478
00:26:00,861 --> 00:26:05,861
Those are about 1500 years old and they 
look like very early gnostic gospels.

479
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,274
And the gnostics were this branch of 
christianity that was pretty violently 

480
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:10,544
suppressed by the emergence of orthodox 
christianity and the gnostics believed 

481
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:17,810
that faith was a good thing,
but knowledge was all right too.

482
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,123
And they wrote gospel accounts say of 
christ's life that were knowledge 

483
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:27,330
predicated as much as revelation 
predicated say,

484
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,660
and this is one of the quotes from one 
of those gospels,

485
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:30,494
the gospel of thomas,
which is actually one that the only one 

486
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:34,820
that got out,
Carl Young,

487
00:26:34,821 --> 00:26:38,660
got ahold of him interestingly enough,
and this is one of the quotes,

488
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:39,494
and I really liked this.
This is a non canonical saying of 

489
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,310
christ.
And the saying is,

490
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,940
if you bring forth what is within you,
what you bring forth will save you.

491
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,340
If you do not bring forth what is within
you,

492
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,000
what you do not bring forth will destroy
you.

493
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,270
And I think that's a pretty good line to
close off the class.

494
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,870
So thank you for attending.
