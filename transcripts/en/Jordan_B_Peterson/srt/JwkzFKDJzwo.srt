1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,180
Hi there,
I guess I'm on.

2
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:52,930
My son isn't here tonight,
so I'm doing this in my

3
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,870
relatively technologically clueless 
manner.

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,673
Um,

5
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,140
here's one thing I've noticed about 
getting older.

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,393
I have
kept up with computer technology pretty 

7
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:06,684
well I would say,
but I do find maybe because of the 

8
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,980
demands on me in the last year,
maybe I'm not stupid or it's possible.

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,050
So anyways.
Hi everyone.

10
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,160
Nice to see you here.
It looks like I've got the chat working.

11
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,180
Is Everything working?

12
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,163
Looks like it.

13
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,933
All right,
so I'm going to start with some 

14
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,770
questions that people sent me.
Anyways.

15
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:33,440
Thank you for all beat,
all of you for being here.

16
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,720
By the way.
It's very much appreciated.

17
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,583
It's quite remarkable as far as I'm 
concerned that you tune in to listen to 

18
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:44,800
me talk with you.
I definitely do appreciate it.

19
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,173
So I'm going to start with some of the 
questions that people sent me earlier 

20
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:51,280
and I'll keep an eye on the chat youtube
chat as well.

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,120
So,
um,

22
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,060
hopefully the audio is good.
What about that?

23
00:01:55,061 --> 00:02:00,061
How's the audio guys?
So now Adam,

24
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:04,150
w dot Patterson asked me a question that
got 410 volts.

25
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:06,070
He said,
um,

26
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,863
I am a web software developer.
Are you hiring or can I volunteer for 

27
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:11,890
anything?
I can build anything.

28
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,250
I can automate things.
I could simply be an assistant of sorts.

29
00:02:15,251 --> 00:02:17,080
Thank you for your time.
Well,

30
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:19,970
what I would like to say about that is 
first thank you out.

31
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,003
It's much appreciated on a lot of people
have volunteered their time to me and 

32
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:26,524
their and their technological expertise 
and as much as I'd like to make use of 

33
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:32,140
it.

34
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,973
That simple truth of the matter is that 
I'm sufficiently overwhelmed by the 

35
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:38,014
complexity of my life at the moment,
that it's very difficult to undertake a 

36
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:44,740
new collaborative project with anyone 
mean generally speaking,

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,850
before all this political,
um,

38
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,400
what would you call it before all these 
political events overtook my life.

39
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:58,060
I was already scheduled probably about 
six months to a year out.

40
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:00,280
You know,
all my was already eaten up.

41
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,114
And of course,
the addition of everything that's 

42
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,024
happened in the last year or two that 
has occupied my time to a degree that 

43
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,890
is,
was,

44
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
is really somewhat unimaginable.
And so I just can't take on additional 

45
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,923
help,
which is so strange because you think 

46
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,890
that help is help and that it would save
time,

47
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:21,251
but,
you know,

48
00:03:21,251 --> 00:03:22,084
it's very difficult to enter into a 
collaborative relationship with someone 

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,360
and especially if you want to give them 
credit and do things properly.

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,660
So,
um,

51
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,893
at the moment I'm afraid that I can't 
entertain any such offers even though 

52
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:37,960
I'd like to.
And there may come a time in the future,

53
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:38,794
especially when I'm hopefully starting 
to work more on this online university 

54
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:43,290
project.
Um,

55
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,763
I've got a few projects to finish up 
before that to the new personality 

56
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,124
tasks,
which we've just about got all the bugs 

57
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,894
worked out of.
And also the high school version of the 

58
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:56,380
future authoring program are all.
We're all set up long before any of this

59
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:59,080
happened.
So I have to clear them out before I can

60
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,914
concentrate on a new project that I 
finished a book over the last couple of 

61
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,330
years to called a 12 rules for life and 
antidote to chaos,

62
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,164
which is now available by the way,
if you're interested on Amazon for 

63
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,610
preorder.
Um,

64
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,163
and so anyways,
this is my roundabout way of saying 

65
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:17,974
thank you very much,
but I can't accept more help at the 

66
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,300
moment because my time is too restricted
to make proper use of it.

67
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,193
So I'm clay's nor,
and how to use the results in the new 

68
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:30,994
personality tests for progress in life.
Try to compensate some sites that that 

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,810
received fewer points.
Well,

70
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,663
at the risk of sounding self serving.
That's actually why we developed the 

71
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:46,750
self authoring suite was to help people 
improve their,

72
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,853
let's say performance and mental health.
Now we don't have direct evidence that 

73
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,720
will,
that will improve personality,

74
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,040
but I suspect that that evidence would 
take a very long time to accumulate.

75
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,650
What we do know is that the self 
authoring suite,

76
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:03,790
especially the future authoring suite,
helps people,

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,830
helps university students,
for example,

78
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:06,664
stay enrolled in university.
It increases the probability of that by 

79
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:12,760
about 25 percent and increased his grade
point average by about the same.

80
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:17,761
And there's good theoretical reasons for
assuming that writing is a good way of,

81
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,060
of um,
as writing about yourself and about your

82
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:27,061
past and about your future is a good way
of catalyzing personality transformation

83
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,564
because it appears that personality,
the human psyche is organized at the 

84
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,160
highest level of abstraction.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Using something like self narrative and 
a well developed narrative makes a frame

86
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,904
for your life and helps you stabilize 
your negative emotions and also 

87
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:43,714
experienced more positive emotion 
because you only experienced positive 

88
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,971
emotion in relationship to a goal.
And that can make goal directed activity

89
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:52,990
a lot more rewarding.
So you know,

90
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,824
it's a lot easier to engage in 
activities that aren't intrinsically 

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,380
rewarding if they're linked to something
that you really find important.

92
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,380
And so I would say if you want to work 
on your personality,

93
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,150
well,
the first thing you have to do is figure

94
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,984
out who it is that you want to be.
And then you have to make a plan and 

95
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,300
maybe you have to clean up your past as 
well.

96
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,134
And the self authoring suite was 
designed quite carefully in order to 

97
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:19,880
help people do that with a relative 
minimum of effort.

98
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,020
Not that it's easy because it's not,
but a relative minimum minimum of effort

99
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:26,360
compared to other technologies,
let's say,

100
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,853
and like,
like longterm psychotherapy and to make 

101
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,470
it cost effective as well.
So.

102
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
Okay.
So another question voted up 77 votes.

103
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,080
Australia is holding a plebiscite on 
whether to legalize gay marriage.

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,550
I'm against the yes campaign,
but only because it's backed by Cultural

105
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,383
Marxists.
I'm curious to hear your views on gay 

106
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,394
marriage.

107
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,870
Well,
I would be against,

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,020
it was backed by Cultural Marxists 
because it isn't clear to me that,

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,820
um,
it will satisfy the ever increasing.

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,080
What would you call a demand for an 
assault on traditional modes of being.

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Now with regards to gay marriage 
specifically,

112
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:18,210
that's a really tough one for me 
because,

113
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,240
you know,
I can imagine

114
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,590
I can't do anything really other than 
spout platitudes about it.

115
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:34,790
I suppose unfortunately,
you know,

116
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,280
is if the marital vows are taken 
seriously,

117
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,653
then it seems to me that it's a means 
whereby gay people can be integrated 

118
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,314
more thoroughly and to standard society 
and that's probably a good thing and 

119
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,340
maybe that would decrease promiscuity,
which is a public health problem.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,070
Um,
although obviously that's not limited to

121
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,600
gay people.
Um,

122
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,750
although gay men tend to be more 
promiscuous than average,

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,273
probably because there's no women to 
bind them with regards to their sexual 

124
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:12,331
activity.
The problem is,

125
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:16,870
is that it does seem to me to be part of
a wedge and it isn't obvious to me that,

126
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,903
that legalizing gay marriage has done 
anything to decrease the demands that 

127
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:25,460
the radical left neo marxists types are 
placing on traditional society.

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,180
So,
um,

129
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,980
those are my views.
I know they're confused,

130
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:32,883
you know,
because I'm in favor of extending the 

131
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,163
bounds of traditional relationships to 
people who wouldn't be involved in a 

132
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:41,604
traditional longterm relationship.
But I'm concerned about the undermining 

133
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,390
of,
of traditional modes of being,

134
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,224
including marriage,
which is technically and historically 

135
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:55,170
been a union between a man and a woman.
Fundamentally,

136
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,150
the purpose of raising children in a,
in a stable and,

137
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,063
and,
uh,

138
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,210
um,
an optimal and stable environment.

139
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,313
So,
and marriage has already taken a fair 

140
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,910
bit of damage over the last few decades.
You know,

141
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,780
poor people are increasingly less likely
to be married and that's really not good

142
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:16,500
for them as far as I'm concerned.
Hi,

143
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:17,334
I'm currently going through a hard time 
as a first time mum with a nine month 

144
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,424
old.
I feel depressed and anxious and I'm 

145
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:25,380
highly neurotic and volatile.
Can you suggest anything to help me be a

146
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,214
better mom?

147
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,091
Well,
you know,

148
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:30,060
lots of people have a hard time with.
They're nine months old.

149
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:33,360
I guess the first question would be,
are you getting enough sleep?

150
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,910
Do you have enough help?
Are you eating enough?

151
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,040
Especially in the morning,
you know,

152
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,993
and you're gonna feel highly neurotic 
and volatile to some degree because 

153
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,803
while you've been through quite a 
physiological trauma and it's very 

154
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:49,761
demanding to have a newborn baby.
So the best thing I could say,

155
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,693
not knowing you,
is to make sure that you have people 

156
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,000
around that you can talk to about your 
baby and that you can and,

157
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,030
and that you can take a break when you 
need to and have someone spell you.

158
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,770
I mean that's often the role that a 
husband plays in the first year of,

159
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,050
of a baby's life,
is that he can,

160
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,723
he's supposed to watch the mother to 
make sure that she doesn't get 

161
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,304
overwhelmed by the demands of the baby.
And so I would hope that you're able to 

162
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:19,530
ask for support when you need it and not
to be afraid of asking for support,

163
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,364
especially to get a rest and to get 
something to eat because that's really 

164
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,630
important,
especially in the morning.

165
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,473
Other than that,
I can't tell you anything really 

166
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,304
specific unfortunately,
given that I don't know anything about 

167
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,150
the specifics of your situation.
Um,

168
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,870
if it gets out of hand,
you know,

169
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,933
you should go.
The other thing I should say as if it 

170
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,190
gets out of hand,
you should go speak with your,

171
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,960
with your doctor,
with a professional,

172
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,770
because you might have postpartum 
depression.

173
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,973
There's some dispute about whether that 
exists and as an independent diagnostic 

174
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:53,640
entity,
but you can certainly be physiologically

175
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:54,474
stressed and if you have a 
predisposition to depression then that 

176
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:00,330
kind of physiological stress and sleep 
disruption can bring it on.

177
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,600
So I would say if it really gets out of 
hand,

178
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,950
don't hesitate to go talk to someone 
professional.

179
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:05,870
You know,
it,

180
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:06,570
it,
it's,

181
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,403
it may be necessary to do that because 
you don't want to fall too far down a 

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,490
whole,
that's for sure.

183
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,850
So
Emma Joe Lovano,

184
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,740
vic says,
Dr Peterson,

185
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:20,574
I want to thank you.
I guess this isn't a question for what 

186
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:22,674
you do.
I'm a 22 year old girl and your videos 

187
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:26,940
are helping me so much with figuring my 
life out.

188
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,510
You are alone are helping me be braver 
everyday.

189
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,080
Well,
I'm really happy about that.

190
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,780
You know,
and I like your emphasis on bravery,

191
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,614
you know,
because one of the things that we've 

192
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,170
learned as clinicians say is that when 
you help people overcome anxiety,

193
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:42,570
it isn't that you make them less anxious
necessarily.

194
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,493
Although I think you could do that to 
some degree by having people confront 

195
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,800
some of the demons in their past,
but instead of making them less anxious,

196
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,080
you make them braver and that's not the 
same thing.

197
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,943
Right?
Because there's lots of reason to be 

198
00:11:54,431 --> 00:11:57,100
anxious.
The world's full of uncertainty and fear

199
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,560
and reasons for fear and reasons for 
pain,

200
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,413
but to be braver means to confront those
voluntarily and that's really a good 

201
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,534
thing.

202
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,700
When will the next Bible lecture 
occurred?

203
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,693
October 24th.
They'll be three of them before the end 

204
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,860
of December and I want to keep them 
going into the future.

205
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,694
They,
they've been quite successful I would 

206
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,690
say,
and I would like to go through the whole

207
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,060
book,
although that would probably take me the

208
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:19,894
rest of my life,
but I do really think it's necessary 

209
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:22,444
because it is the case that the.
The specific narratives and the 

210
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,413
metanarrative that are,
that are embedded in the biblical 

211
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,124
stories and its surrounding literature 
are at the fundament of Western culture 

212
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:37,990
and we need to reconnect with that in 
order to make sure that our,

213
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,913
that our culture stays strong and I 
don't think it's particularly strong 

214
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:45,190
right now and that's a very bad.
That's a very bad thing for everyone.

215
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,024
It leads to nihilism and despair and and
in an ability to plan for a meaningful 

216
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,790
future and cynicism and all of those 
things,

217
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,624
and that's especially bad for young 
people because when you're young and 

218
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,620
your life is ahead of you,
it's the last.

219
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,790
It's the last time that you need to be 
nihilistic and cynical.

220
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:06,220
It's definitely not good.
So

221
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,943
Shark Pyre to says,
how can you dispute the theory that 

222
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:19,690
Jesus is just a rewrite of the Sun God 
myth?

223
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,843
Well,
I wouldn't necessarily dispute that 

224
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:26,690
theory,
although I would dispute the just.

225
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:31,210
I mean the strange things about the 
biblical stories and let's say about the

226
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,600
new testament stories,
is that they echo across multiple levels

227
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:39,370
of analysis and so there is an 
astrological element to the Christ.

228
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,500
A story,
um,

229
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,560
that you wrote about a fair bit in a 
book called Ion,

230
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:45,394
which is a very terrifying book and 
there are echoes of the myths of the 

231
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:49,090
sudden God.
And,

232
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,433
but the funny thing is,
and this is one of the things I can't 

233
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,910
really understand about the biblical 
stories,

234
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:55,744
is that they manifest themselves at 
multiple levels of interpretation 

235
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:00,544
simultaneously.
And you could say that that's merely a 

236
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,110
consequence of continual historical 
reworking.

237
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,944
And I suppose that could be the case,
but the fact that they manifest 

238
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:10,624
themselves as a personal story and as a 
cosmic story and as a historical story 

239
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,484
and as a mythological story and that it 
all works at the same time strikes me 

240
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:20,044
as,
as pointing to something that's really 

241
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,340
somewhat beyond our current level of 
understanding.

242
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,333
I can't elaborate on that a lot because 
it would take us into places that I 

243
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:30,544
really would rather not go.
But I do believe that there's something 

244
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,870
synchronous using young's terminology 
about,

245
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,930
uh,
about a death and resurrection story.

246
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,273
And the synchronous element is,
is associated with the fact that the 

247
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:48,400
story echoes across so many levels of 
analysis.

248
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,910
And my sense is that when something 
echoes across many levels of analysis,

249
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:58,010
that means that it's approaching 
something like a very deep truth.

250
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,293
So I know that isn't normally how we go 
about determining what constitutes 

251
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:03,104
truth,
but we don't know everything about how 

252
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:05,774
to determine what constitutes truth yet.
And there are many things that we have 

253
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:13,280
yet to figure out and that's certainly 
one of them as far as I'm concerned.

254
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,323
So there is a Sungard myth element,
certainly parallels between Christ and 

255
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,180
horace,
for example.

256
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,373
But
that doesn't mean you can just say it's 

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
just a rewrite.
I don't think that the,

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,400
I don't think that that's historically 
or a psychologically accurate.

259
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,510
Have you watched rick and morty?
No,

260
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,673
I haven't.
Many people have told me to watch rick 

261
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,640
and Morty,
although they said it's very dark and.

262
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,860
Well that doesn't bother me so much I 
suppose,

263
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:46,640
although I'm plenty dark perhaps without
adding to it.

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,960
So.
But um,

265
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,450
I would like to watch it and I probably 
will.

266
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:53,990
So I would love for you to do come and 
do a talk in Montreal.

267
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:55,520
Well,
you never know that might happen.

268
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,860
I've been talking to Gad Saad about that
a fair bit,

269
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:58,723
you know,
he's coming to Toronto November 11th so 

270
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,294
we can do the talk.
That was shut down by Ryerson back in 

271
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,950
August,
so I'm looking forward to that.

272
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,353
So
what's the best way to stop drinking 

273
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:14,300
alcohol and start doing my best?
In my psychology degree,

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,630
it's affecting my study,
but I can do very well if I stop.

275
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,070
I'm 26.

276
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,860
Well,
Paul,

277
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,103
what I would say is I think you should 
do the future authoring program and you 

278
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,144
should really concentrate.
There's a section in it that helps you 

279
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,050
determine what your positive view of 
your future would be,

280
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:40,220
but another section that helps you 
determine what would happen in your life

281
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,054
if you're negative habits got out of 
control and one of the things that can 

282
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:47,420
really help you control your alcohol 
intake is to really,

283
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,254
really think through what you're giving 
up and where you could be in five years 

284
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:57,011
if you don't get it under control and 
proclivity to alcoholism can be a really

285
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,880
vicious thing.
You know,

286
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:02,240
lots of people get dragged down into the
mud by alcohol,

287
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,993
excessive alcohol intake,
especially if they're sensitive to the 

288
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,840
opiate response that alcohol can 
produce.

289
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,600
And you can tell that if you,
when you drink,

290
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,040
you know,
you get alert and,

291
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,030
and,
and,

292
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,893
uh,
let's say more enthusiastic and 

293
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,710
energetic and then you don't want to 
stop drinking.

294
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,943
That's uh,
that's definitely a bad sign with 

295
00:17:21,111 --> 00:17:21,944
regards to developing alcoholism.
So I would say you need to figure out 

296
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:26,534
something that's,
that's more important to you that 

297
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,310
drinking and also think through very 
hard.

298
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,620
The negative consequences of continuing 
your.

299
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:36,350
You're at about the age 26 where you 
should stop.

300
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,830
I mean guys who are going to stop 
generally start slow down pretty,

301
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,890
pretty intensely around that age.
Um,

302
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,820
you know,
get also treating your psychology,

303
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:49,470
studying as a fulltime job can also be 
helpful.

304
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,510
So,
you know,

305
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,443
get up at eight morning or 7:30 in the 
morning and start hitting the books by 

306
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:58,590
nine and put in a 68 hour day.
And then even if you do keep drinking,

307
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,310
at least you're moving forward.
So that's what I say about that.

308
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,160
Are you a science fiction fan?
You referenced timelines,

309
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:08,994
starship troopers in lecture,
and your ideas often remind me of Harry 

310
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,600
Selden's plan from Asia mobs foundation 
series.

311
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,321
Hey,
well,

312
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,410
when I was a kid,
which is quite a long time ago now,

313
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,593
um,
I lived in this town called Fairview 

314
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,303
Alberta,
which was a town of about 3000 people a 

315
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,390
way the hell north 350 miles northwest 
of Edmonton.

316
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,570
And I have this neighbor across the 
street across the La actually.

317
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,630
And he had a huge science fiction 
library.

318
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,460
It must've been,
I don't know,

319
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,590
5,000 books there,
19 seventies,

320
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,443
1960,
19 seventies classics like Heinlein 

321
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,870
then.
And how's it Marvin?

322
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,093
He would let me go over there and take 
like 20 books at a time and I was 

323
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:49,874
reading about a book a day at that point
and I read science fiction like mad 

324
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,850
probably till I was about 19 or so and 
maybe a little younger than that.

325
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,950
And then turn more to classic literature
when I got to college.

326
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:02,150
And,
and,

327
00:19:02,151 --> 00:19:02,984
uh,
also partly as a consequence of some 

328
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:07,550
lessons that the local librarian taught 
me about what to read.

329
00:19:07,551 --> 00:19:08,384
So I was a science fiction fan.
I haven't read science fiction for a 

330
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:15,290
very long time,
although I was pretty happy with it when

331
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,970
I was a kid.
So

332
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,930
Richard Vanc carpet and says,
yes,

333
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:35,990
I have,
I phobia.

334
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:37,570
And would love to hear about anxiety.

335
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,203
Well that's a,
that's a rough thing to have 

336
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,150
agoraphobic.
So agoraphobic,

337
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,103
get increasingly isolated and afraid of 
things outside of their domain and 

338
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:53,530
familiarity.
And often what happens with agora phobia

339
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:56,320
is that people who develop it or afraid 
of two things,

340
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,723
they're afraid that something is going 
to go dreadfully wrong with their 

341
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:01,960
health,
especially with regards to their hearts.

342
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:02,794
So they start to become afraid that 
maybe they'll have a heart attack and 

343
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:05,974
that they'll die in public,
far from a hospital and that don't make 

344
00:20:08,681 --> 00:20:11,280
a fool of themselves while they're doing
it or well,

345
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:11,791
they,
well,

346
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,624
they think they're done.
So it's a combination of two fears and 

347
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:15,904
one is fear of mortality.
And the other is fear of social 

348
00:20:18,401 --> 00:20:19,234
judgement.
And you might think about those as the 

349
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:21,334
two main categories of feared that 
possessed people because one is 

350
00:20:24,131 --> 00:20:24,964
associated obviously with mortality and 
death and the other is associated with 

351
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:29,224
exclusion from the group,
which of course can lead to mortality 

352
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:32,290
and death.

353
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,780
And so the agoraphobic skip the worst of
both worlds.

354
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:38,200
And it's often a disease of middle aged 
women,

355
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:39,034
but not always.
And there are often people who've been 

356
00:20:40,811 --> 00:20:41,644
somewhat dependent in their previous 
lives and then undergo some traumatic 

357
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:45,784
event like a divorce or the death.
Someone close and at the same time are 

358
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:50,854
perhaps experiencing heart palpitations 
that are associated with menopause that 

359
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:59,070
brings ideas of mortality to mind.
And that can trigger a panic attack,

360
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,850
which is a very,
um,

361
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,960
what would you call it,
unpleasant experience to say the least.

362
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,323
Um,
and then that fear of panic attack 

363
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:09,584
starts making people avoid.
And that's when Agora Phobia develops 

364
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,670
out of anxiety disorders with panic 
attacks.

365
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:15,504
So you go out and maybe you go to a mall
and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe 

366
00:21:19,241 --> 00:21:20,950
you start thinking about,
well,

367
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:21,784
your heartbeat and about the fact that 
someone close to you has died and maybe 

368
00:21:24,671 --> 00:21:25,504
then you become aware of your heartbeat 
and you start to panic because you feel 

369
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:32,500
that maybe it's the beat is irregular or
or that or that.

370
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,080
You can't detect it as well as you 
usually can.

371
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,350
And then that makes your heart 
accelerate because it makes you afraid.

372
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:39,184
And then you get more more.
What would you call sensitive to that 

373
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,070
and that makes your heart rate beat even
faster.

374
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:45,904
And then you panic.
You want to get to the hospital to get 

375
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:48,754
checked out to make sure that you're all
right and then you make your fatal 

376
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:52,594
mistake,
which is that you avoid going back to 

377
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,054
the mall and then you go to a grocery 
store and the same thing happens and 

378
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:00,310
then you start to avoid going to the 
grocery store.

379
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,413
Then you start to avoid avoiding the 
subway or taxis or crowds or anywhere 

380
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:07,990
you might get trapped and wouldn't be 
able to get to the hospital.

381
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,123
Soon you end up avoiding everything and 
that's when your life really starts to 

382
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,140
become a living hell.

383
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,460
So the basic way to treat or a phobia.
There's two ways.

384
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,520
One is to develop some control of 
breathing,

385
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,383
to do progressive relaxation,
and the way you do that is that you 

386
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:25,714
start with your start by concentrating 
on your toes and your feet and your 

387
00:22:29,531 --> 00:22:31,940
ankles and your shins,
your knees.

388
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:36,400
You move all the way up your body and 
let the tension flow out of your muscles

389
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:41,401
and regulate your breathing calmly and 
carefully so that you can learn to relax

390
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,963
and then you go out.
You go out voluntarily am start to 

391
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:49,690
confront the things you're afraid of.
So for example,

392
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:50,524
if you're afraid of the mall,
maybe you go to the parking lot and you 

393
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,580
look at them all and then you walk close
to the door and you look inside,

394
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,793
you know,
and then you go home because that's 

395
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,020
enough for one day.
But you do progressive exposure.

396
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,123
And that's the base,
one of the basic rules of psychotherapy 

397
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:08,770
is that if you're afraid of something,
you progressively and voluntarily expose

398
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,604
yourself to it,
and that generally it's the voluntary 

399
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:13,840
exposure that's curative,
right?

400
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,790
Accidental exposure could make you 
worse,

401
00:23:15,791 --> 00:23:16,624
but voluntary exposure can be curative 
and that's sort of associated with the 

402
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,340
myth of the hero and the Dragon.
You know the hero is the person who goes

403
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:28,390
out voluntarily to confront the dragon 
and overcome it and get the treasure.

404
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:32,170
And so if you voluntarily expose 
yourself to things you're afraid of,

405
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,230
like no more than you can tolerate,
then you'll find that you get braver and

406
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:40,600
you learned that you can tolerate the 
fear and that can chase the agora phobia

407
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:41,434
back,
but it's very important to do it on a 

408
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:46,700
regular basis.
And if you agoraphobic full fledged,

409
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:47,534
agoraphobic and should probably consult 
professional help because it's very 

410
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:54,050
tricky condition and it can be very,
can really impair you badly.

411
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,230
So that's what I would recommend.

412
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,033
Hi Jp.
I'm wondering how the computer program 

413
00:24:01,691 --> 00:24:05,890
that rates university courses as 
worthwhile or not is coming along well.

414
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,933
It isn't rating them as worthwhile.
It's rating the mess postmodern Neil 

415
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,460
Marxist or not and it's actually fully 
developed.

416
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,450
I was going to launch it and I didn't.
I didn't design it a,

417
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,373
somebody volunteered to design it and 
presented it to me and it seems to work 

418
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:21,970
very well.
Um,

419
00:24:21,971 --> 00:24:22,804
I was going to launch it at the end of 
August so that this year is university 

420
00:24:25,781 --> 00:24:26,614
students could benefit from it,
but there was the Charlottesville event 

421
00:24:29,321 --> 00:24:30,154
and then I got busy and I also wasn't 
feeling great and so I just didn't hit 

422
00:24:34,031 --> 00:24:34,864
the window of time properly.
But I hope to be able to launch it for 

423
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,023
the January incoming class to do a video
about what's wrong with the university 

424
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,550
system.
That many things that are wrong with the

425
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,650
university system and to launch the 
website.

426
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:48,484
At the same time.
I also had people suggest to me that 

427
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:54,220
maybe it wasn't a good idea that it 
would increase polarization,

428
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:57,070
but I've thought about that for about a 
month and a half.

429
00:24:57,071 --> 00:24:59,320
And I think that the benefit to the 
consumer.

430
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:03,550
So that would be the informed student 
outweighs any danger of polarization.

431
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:04,384
And besides that,
something has to be done because the 

432
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,500
situation in the universities is really 
ridiculous.

433
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,873
So.

434
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,420
All right,
so let's see what else we've got here in

435
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:14,380
the chat room.

436
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,550
Dvs S,
k e r three.

437
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,820
That's quite a mouthful.
Says I'm studying to be a teacher,

438
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:27,550
but I'm also an introvert.
Could this be a big problem?

439
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,190
Can I still be a successful teacher?
Actually,

440
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,533
what seems to predict success at 
teaching best is intelligence and 

441
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:38,230
conscientiousness.
That's the data so far.

442
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:41,860
So if you're conscientious,
then you'll probably be fine.

443
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:46,270
I mean extra introverts have a harder 
time speaking in front of groups,

444
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,800
but you can learn to do that.
You know,

445
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:50,950
an introvert can become a very 
successful public speaker.

446
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,770
May Not enjoy it the same way that an 
extrovert might.

447
00:25:53,771 --> 00:25:56,260
But that doesn't mean that you can't 
learn the skills.

448
00:25:56,261 --> 00:25:57,094
And what I would recommend for an 
introvert is the same thing that I do 

449
00:26:00,071 --> 00:26:02,650
when I'm lecturing is I never talked to 
the whole group.

450
00:26:02,651 --> 00:26:04,660
You know,
it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,

451
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:05,494
I'm always picking out individuals in 
the group and talking specifically to 

452
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,130
them.

453
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,963
So I'll make a point to an individual 
and I watched their face and see if 

454
00:26:12,731 --> 00:26:14,530
they're nodding and understanding,
right,

455
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,620
because that way you make contact with 
the entire audience and then,

456
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,833
you know,
we'll all talk to someone for about 15 

457
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,300
seconds or so.
I don't want to put them on the spot too

458
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:23,134
much and then I shift my attention to 
someone else and I sort of pin point 

459
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,334
around the room and that keeps everybody
in the room focused on what I'm saying 

460
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:34,090
because each person reflects the entire 
crowd back to you.

461
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:34,924
And so I would say if you're an 
introvert or if you want to speak in 

462
00:26:37,121 --> 00:26:39,670
public in general,
forget about the damn crowd.

463
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,740
It doesn't exist.
Speak to people one on one at a time and

464
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:47,330
an introvert can do that just fine.
So you know,

465
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,570
that's where your strengths would be.
I would say you're,

466
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,473
you're much more likely to be 
unsuccessful as a teacher if you don't 

467
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:57,270
work hard at it.
And if you're not interested in it.

468
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,490
So if you're an introvert,
I wouldn't worry about that.

469
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,090
I don't think that that'll be the 
biggest problem that you'll face.

470
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,003
So

471
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,590
sure.
Nick's are overrated.

472
00:27:18,591 --> 00:27:19,424
Says ditch your barber,
like my barber quite a bit to hit his 

473
00:27:22,761 --> 00:27:23,594
haircuts a little shorter than I'm 
accustomed to and there's some reasons 

474
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,020
for that.
But uh,

475
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,610
um.
Oh,

476
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,433
what can I say?
How hair grows back and it will be just 

477
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:34,970
as beautiful as I was before.
No time.

478
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:35,893
So I guess that's how that.
See now Richard Van Copeland says my 

479
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:41,300
haircuts looking fresh.
So who's that?

480
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,210
Nick's are overrated.
Take the APP.

481
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,560
Yeah.
So,

482
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,713
um,

483
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,510
would you consider having a discussion 
with Thomas Soul that Sam,

484
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,590
dogen,
dogen,

485
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,560
dogen probably.
Oh yeah,

486
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:03,394
I definitely considered it.
I'm thinking hard about reaching out to 

487
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,273
him.
I have some discussions coming up that 

488
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:08,654
you might be interested in.
So I'm going to talk on Jocko willink 

489
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,283
podcast and he was the leader of the 
Navy seals team in Ramadan and he's 

490
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,294
quite the tough character.
I met him down in San Diego a while 

491
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:24,290
back,
a month ago or so,

492
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,124
and that was very interesting.
I have a video already prepared that's 

493
00:28:30,501 --> 00:28:32,420
an interview with our out in hers,
the elite,

494
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,563
um,
it was done by skype and needs some 

495
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:37,310
editing and so that's been a bit 
delayed.

496
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,133
I interviewed or discussed,
I had a discussion with Nina Paley who 

497
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:43,580
was a great animator.
You guys should look her up.

498
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,313
That's Nina Paley.
She animated a lot of the Old Testament 

499
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,380
and set it to music and I think your 
animations are unbelievably beautiful.

500
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,340
And the meeting,
she has great musical tastes.

501
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,880
They're illegal videos.
Basically she's making an illegal movie.

502
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,550
Um,
but anyways,

503
00:29:01,551 --> 00:29:02,384
I really liked your stuff.
I also had a discussion with Claire 

504
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,590
Lehmann who runs quill at,
which is a new newsmagazine online,

505
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:14,140
which I think has got real promise and 
we had a good discussion and um,

506
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,610
let's see.
Is that helped?

507
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,920
I think that's it on and you probably 
know or maybe you don't.

508
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,063
Um,
I just finished a discussion with 

509
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:22,904
Camille Paglia and we went down there.
I took a film crew down there to 

510
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:31,331
Philadelphia and met her at her 
university and we talked for a couple of

511
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,310
hours and that was really interesting.
She's quite the fireball,

512
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:38,870
that woman and unbelievably verbally 
fluent and sharp.

513
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:42,910
And so I finally met someone who could 
more than me and,

514
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,010
and uh,
that's probably good.

515
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,263
So,
but I really enjoyed speaking with her 

516
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,680
and I think about 100,000 people have 
watched that now in a day,

517
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:51,640
so that's pretty good.

518
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,473
So we talked about postmodernism and the
malaise that confronts the modern 

519
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:58,960
university and all of those sorts of 
things.

520
00:29:58,961 --> 00:30:02,320
So Robin Deon says,
do you ever Miss Montreal?

521
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:03,700
Hey,
I was just in Montreal.

522
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,700
I went there to saw,
saw a band called half moon run,

523
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:07,534
which are abandoned.
I would highly recommend they were 

524
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:09,634
playing with the Montreal Symphony 
Orchestra and I got invited to meet one 

525
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,960
of the singers and also go in and see 
the concert,

526
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,040
which was excellent.
And Yeah,

527
00:30:18,041 --> 00:30:20,260
I'd Miss Montreal.
Montreal is a great city for you.

528
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:23,170
Americans who are listening should go 
visit Montreal.

529
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,630
Man.
It's a cool place and spend a week there

530
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:26,510
in the summer.
It's,

531
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,890
it's a really good city in every way.
So

532
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,133
yeah.
So

533
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:41,550
it seems we are bound to repeat history 
and what his old becomes new again.

534
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,030
Why is it that we can't seem to find 
equilibrium within a society?

535
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,750
Ideas begin with good intentions,
but lead towards the extreme.

536
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,040
Yeah.
Well,

537
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,023
the reason we can't find equilibrium is 
because the environment that we live in 

538
00:30:54,391 --> 00:30:56,490
isn't an equilibrium,
and so I.

539
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,440
I kind of imagine it this way.
It's like we're,

540
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,543
we're traversing the back of a giant.
This is obviously a symbolic reference 

541
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:08,670
of the giant serpent and it's and it 
weaves back and forth and you don't know

542
00:31:08,671 --> 00:31:11,250
at any moment which way it's going to 
curve and turn.

543
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:15,030
And so sometimes it turns to the right 
and sometimes it turns to the left.

544
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:15,864
And what that means politically is that 
sometime we have to turn to the right 

545
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:19,164
and sometimes we have to turn to the 
left and we don't know exactly when 

546
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,260
those,
what you call,

547
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
we don't know exactly how to time that.

548
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,853
And so what we all have to do is keep 
our eyes open and tell the truth and 

549
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:32,184
discuss things with each other,
especially with people who have 

550
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:35,004
political beliefs that are different 
than us so that we can ensure that we 

551
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:40,350
haven't tilted too far.
One way or the other,

552
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,940
and that's why I'm an advocate of free 
speech or one of the many reasons I'm an

553
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:49,470
advocate of free speech is because it's 
the continual dialogue between people of

554
00:31:49,471 --> 00:31:50,304
different temperamental types that keeps
us oriented as close as we can to the 

555
00:31:53,941 --> 00:31:54,774
center of the serpents back.
And so there is no permanent 

556
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:58,104
equilibrium.
There's only the equilibrium that's 

557
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:04,521
produced by continual negotiation and a 
democracy is a formalized negotiation.

558
00:32:04,831 --> 00:32:06,260
And so,
um,

559
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,621
and,
and,

560
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:10,170
and it's free speech that keeps it 
healthy and alive.

561
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,200
So there's no permanent equivalent 
equilibrium state except death.

562
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,290
And it's always negotiation in 
relationships too,

563
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,124
like if you have an intimate 
relationship or a familial relationship 

564
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:25,800
or even a friendship,
there's no final equilibrium state.

565
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,633
You have to communicate with each other 
honestly all the time and keep the 

566
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,474
relationship moving to adjust the 
environment that the relationship is 

567
00:32:33,481 --> 00:32:35,970
operating in.
That's how it stays alive.

568
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:38,850
And in an intimate,
longterm intimate relationship like a,

569
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,920
it's a continual,
uh,

570
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,300
it takes continual effort.
I mean,

571
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,153
it's worthwhile effort and that,
but you have to be conscious and awake 

572
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,480
to keep your relationship alive and you 
have to be communicating all the time.

573
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,883
Well,
maybe not all the time because you can 

574
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:57,881
overcommunicate too,
but I'm so well,

575
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,180
so that's why we can't reach a state of 
permanent equilibrium.

576
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,193
Okay.
Let's go back to the previously 

577
00:33:08,731 --> 00:33:13,731
submitted questions.
How can I overcome my fear of driving on

578
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:15,120
freeways?
Well,

579
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,180
one of the things you could do,
this is Ellis,

580
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,343
is do a fair bit of imagining driving on
freeways and try to make the imagining 

581
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:26,790
as realistic as possible,
but then the other thing you can do is,

582
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,340
again,
it's graduated exposure.

583
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,174
If you're afraid of driving,
go drive with someone you trust in a 

584
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,384
parking lot on Sunday morning when 
there's no one there and then drive 

585
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,164
around the block and the street that 
isn't busy and then go to a slightly 

586
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:40,794
busier street and then go to the 
slightly busier street and then find a 

587
00:33:43,831 --> 00:33:47,760
highway that's like a,
just a two layer so that you know,

588
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,020
you could practice merging and that sort
of thing.

589
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:50,854
And you've got to build a plan,
say with 20 degrees of difficulty with 

590
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:55,853
the highest degree of difficulty,
maybe being more merging onto a busy 

591
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:03,210
four lane highway and you can go at 
night and practice merging onto the busy

592
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:05,040
highway because they won't be busy at 
night.

593
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,263
So I would say what you do is you break 
it down into small steps and then 

594
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:13,410
practice each step until you're bored 
with the step and when you're bored with

595
00:34:13,411 --> 00:34:14,244
it,
that means you're no longer anxious 

596
00:34:14,881 --> 00:34:17,520
about it and don't quit,
you know,

597
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:20,490
like stick at it because it's really 
useful to overcome a fear.

598
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:22,350
And once you've identified it,
fear,

599
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,453
then you've identified something to 
overcome that can definitely make you 

600
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:26,184
stronger.
So like good luck with it and get 

601
00:34:28,531 --> 00:34:29,364
professional.
Like take a driving course if you need 

602
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:33,890
to as well and find someone to work 
with.

603
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:36,540
It isn't going to make you nervous and 
isn't going to harass you,

604
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,750
but don't quit.
It's really important to overcome a fear

605
00:34:39,751 --> 00:34:44,751
like that.
No,

606
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,530
I just picked something I shouldn't have
clicked.

607
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,200
Actually.
I'm pretty happy with myself.

608
00:34:50,201 --> 00:34:51,820
My son isn't here.
As I mentioned,

609
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,790
I'm still not like destroying this 
completely,

610
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,270
although I may have done it now.
No.

611
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,740
Hmm.

612
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:24,560
See that's what happens when you brag 
because now all I've got is one question

613
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:28,820
from pigeon hole and not all of them.
Let's see.

614
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,010
Got It.
Back to chart

615
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,530
was the trick.
So Hey,

616
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,140
I'm,
I'm actually managing this up too badly.

617
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,030
So let's see here.

618
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,700
Some more questions from the,
from the Youtube people,

619
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,663
Dr Peterson.
I'm really hoping you can share your 

620
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,350
thoughts on the daigous shooting.
Yeah.

621
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:07,523
Well,
what I would do is recommend the 

622
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,833
biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel 
would say because I think that that's a 

623
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,694
good summary of the state of mind that 
somebody has to be in in order to do 

624
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:23,070
what was done at Los Vegas.
So you have to be very,

625
00:36:23,071 --> 00:36:23,904
very embittered by lights in order to do
that sort of thing and you have to be 

626
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,420
searching for revenge,
I would say.

627
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,770
And it's not,
you know,

628
00:36:31,771 --> 00:36:32,604
you might think,
well it's only revenge on other people 

629
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:36,780
because you've developed hatred for 
people,

630
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:39,930
but it's deeper than that.
It's not just hatred for people.

631
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,243
I would say it's hatred for being itself
and and the desire to take revenge on 

632
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:46,314
being for the outrage of the tragedy and
suffering that's associated with being 

633
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,913
and maybe the tragedy and suffering 
that's been part and parcel of your own 

634
00:36:54,931 --> 00:36:55,764
life and that makes you embittered and 
then past embittered becomes outraged 

635
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,474
and past outraged becomes well homicidal
or even genocidal and that's terrible 

636
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,480
state of mind to be in.

637
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,900
It's a hellish state.
Well,

638
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,463
I believe that the best way to 
conceptualize the state of mind that 

639
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:14,934
someone has to be in in order to do 
something like the columbine shootings 

640
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:18,144
for example,
or what happened in Las Vegas is that 

641
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,950
you're really an now you have to speak 
about it.

642
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,813
Religious languages,
you're really out for revenge against 

643
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:25,344
God for the outrage of creation.
That's what it looks like to me and 

644
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,263
that's a state of mind that's truly 
hellish and you could get there by 

645
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:35,010
broody long enough.
Now it's also possible.

646
00:37:35,011 --> 00:37:37,800
I mean this guy didn't have any previous
history,

647
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:40,320
criminal history or anything like that 
and he's pretty old.

648
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:41,154
So you know,
there's also also also the possibility 

649
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:44,724
of some kind of neurological pathway log
that that might be characteristic of 

650
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:48,931
him,
you know,

651
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:49,764
some degenerative neurological disease.
There was a kid years ago at the 

652
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,630
University of Texas at Austin who 
climbed up on the tower there and shot a

653
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:01,050
number of people with a high powered 
rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on

654
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:01,884
his hypothalamus and had reported like 
these being overcome with extreme 

655
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,500
feelings of rage.
And so that's another possibility.

656
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:15,501
But I would say the embitterment 
hypothesis is the strongest one.

657
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,150
I would also say too,
I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this

658
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:21,984
today,
is that one of the ways of controlling 

659
00:38:23,581 --> 00:38:24,414
this sort of thing would be for the 
press to agree not for there to be a 

660
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,554
blanket agreement,
not to publicize the name or any other 

661
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:34,320
identity markers of the people who do 
the shooting.

662
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,890
Because there's also this

663
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,590
really,
what would you call it,

664
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,753
arrogance.
It's a kind of arrogance and pride last 

665
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:43,504
ditch,
arrogance and pride that that is 

666
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:48,910
associated with the fantasies that drive
this sort of behavior.

667
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:51,430
And the fantasy is something like,
well,

668
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,250
after I do this,
everyone will know the who,

669
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,960
who the hell I was,
you know,

670
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:59,710
even though maybe I was ignored or 
unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead,

671
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:03,010
everybody's going to know who I was and 
what I did and you know,

672
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:06,100
so there's this underground desire for 
fame,

673
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,653
I guess it's notoriety,
but notoriety might be preferable to 

674
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:11,860
being ignored.
And so,

675
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,013
you know,
there's a lot of talk about gun control 

676
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:15,064
and that's understandable,
especially with regards to automatic 

677
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:17,824
rifles.
Although I also understand why the 

678
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,530
people who are gun owners are afraid of,
of,

679
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:29,590
of allowing what they regard as one of 
their fundamental rights to be infringed

680
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:30,730
upon.
Um,

681
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,953
but it would certainly be useful if we 
stopped giving people who do this sort 

682
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:38,560
of thing now,
$100,000,000 worth of free publicity and

683
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,170
all the notoriety they can manage.
So,

684
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,023
you know,
that's another way of thinking about 

685
00:39:42,911 --> 00:39:44,500
controlling it.
So,

686
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,560
and Tony was.
Sylvia says,

687
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,330
you need a break,
have a glass of wine.

688
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,040
Relax.
Yeah.

689
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,260
Well,
I was just up.

690
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,180
I have this little cabin up north of 
Toronto,

691
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,860
about three hours north that my wife 
bought with some money that her dad left

692
00:40:06,861 --> 00:40:08,000
her,
gave her.

693
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:11,930
Actually,
he's still alive and I was up there this

694
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:12,763
weekend and it was relaxing.
I was working a bit on this new 

695
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:16,724
personality scale and on the video,
but I did relax a bit and I'm actually 

696
00:40:22,101 --> 00:40:22,934
feeling a lot better than it was for the
last and a so the mornings are still 

697
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:28,844
rough,
but by this time of night I'm feeling 

698
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:31,694
vaguely human,
so thank God for that because it was 

699
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:35,480
pretty brutal.
So anyhow,

700
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,513
Franklin says,
fans are cancer for the authentic 

701
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:42,780
individual.
Well,

702
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,410
that's a tough one.
You know,

703
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,840
I mean,
cancer know that.

704
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,110
That's too,
that's too dramatic.

705
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,110
I mean,
I guess that what you're pointing out is

706
00:40:55,111 --> 00:40:58,320
the danger of fame and I can certainly 
appreciate that.

707
00:40:58,321 --> 00:41:00,630
I can't say that I'm particularly 
comfortable with it,

708
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,870
which might seem to be rather 
hypocritical as it isn't.

709
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,670
Like I've shied away from exposing my 
views in public,

710
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,523
but I felt that I was driven to that by 
necessity and also by my desire to 

711
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:14,960
educate people.
Um,

712
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,613
however,
I would say despite the fact that I'm 

713
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:18,894
somewhat uncomfortable with it,
I think that's mostly because of the 

714
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:22,900
responsibility,
you know,

715
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:26,040
what I've been terrified for a whole 
year that I say something,

716
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,020
you know,
unforgivably stupid and

717
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,100
demolished myself in public and you 
don't feel guilty and horrible about

718
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,520
that for the rest of my life.
And so far I'd be fortunate there's been

719
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,410
some close calls,
but I've been fortunate,

720
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:40,670
but,
you know,

721
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:43,940
now when I go places,
people often recognize me.

722
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,220
Even at this little town we went up to 
this weekend,

723
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,054
there were two people that came up to me
in the parking lot and we're excited to 

724
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:52,430
meet the and you know,
the vast majority of encounters,

725
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:53,264
all of the encounters that I have with 
people in public and have been really 

726
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,073
wonderful.
I have to say that the people have been 

727
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:02,360
extremely friendly and you know,
sometimes they're a bit star struck,

728
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:05,450
which I find strange.
I can see the projection,

729
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:06,290
you know,
so it's,

730
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:11,490
it's unsettling for me,
although I'm not judging anybody for it.

731
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,700
It's just a strange thing to observe.
Um,

732
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,020
but,
you know,

733
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,210
I can't complain about the fact that 
people are,

734
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,253
are,
uh,

735
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,543
are,
are positively predisposed to what I'm 

736
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:25,360
doing.

737
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,870
I mean,
it's such a privilege.

738
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,960
I can't imagine what it would be like to
be hated publicly.

739
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:32,390
I think that would just kill me.
I really think that.

740
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,380
But um,
so I mean it's,

741
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,243
it's,
I suppose there's the possibility of 

742
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:41,330
having that sort of thing go to your 
head and it's,

743
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,340
it,
I mean that happens to people,

744
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:44,174
but I think I've said this before,
maybe on the q and a's I have a pretty 

745
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:50,480
sensible family and I have a pretty.
Um,

746
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,393
what would you say?
I have a pretty good sense of my 

747
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:57,550
limitations.
I would say,

748
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,510
um,
let's,

749
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,383
we could even call it an acute sense and
so I'm not particularly worried that 

750
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,210
this is going to go to my head in some 
way that,

751
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,213
that would

752
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:10,953
no

753
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,570
inflate my ego or something like that.
Huh?

754
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,570
I mean,
I think one of the things I have noticed

755
00:43:16,571 --> 00:43:19,690
is that I might be a little less patient
with people when I'm speaking.

756
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:20,933
I'm because I'm more used to that,
more used to that might be good for me 

757
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:28,360
to be listened to and so I have to watch
that,

758
00:43:28,361 --> 00:43:29,194
but I'm pretty,
I've always been pretty noisy and 

759
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:31,234
talkative and so that's probably 
something that's plagued me or being a 

760
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:37,360
characteristic of me ever since I was a 
little tiny kid.

761
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:40,440
I mean,
I used to talk all the time when I was a

762
00:43:40,441 --> 00:43:42,670
little little,
little guy.

763
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,980
I mean,
I think my cousin Eric Bonus,

764
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,053
he probably listens to this.
He used to call me motor mouth and that 

765
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:51,310
was about exactly right.
I was like a miniature Camille Paglia.

766
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,870
So,
um,

767
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,350
anyways,
I can't complain about having let's say,

768
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:58,870
fans.
So people have been unbelievably good to

769
00:43:58,871 --> 00:44:01,630
me and I'm really grateful for that.
So

770
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,610
what is the best way to find a routine 
when you're diagnosed?

771
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,440
Bipolar?
Well,

772
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:15,274
I would say a couple of things.
The first is try to set your sleep wake 

773
00:44:22,061 --> 00:44:25,990
cycle stabling,
so pick a time in the morning to get up.

774
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,213
That's the most important thing is get 
up at the same time every morning and 

775
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,503
that that might be difficult both when 
you're mad mannequin when you're 

776
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:35,070
depressed,
but the closer you can stick to that,

777
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:35,904
the better.
And I would also say try to stabilize 

778
00:44:37,351 --> 00:44:38,184
when you go to bed and maybe a little 
later rather than a little earlier 

779
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,060
because you don't want to be laying 
there flipping around like a,

780
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,370
like a fish trying to go to sleep.
Um,

781
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:50,883
you want to stabilize your sleep wake 
routines because bipolar disorder is in 

782
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:55,534
part a circadian rhythm disorder.
And so anything that destabilizes your 

783
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:00,004
secret and rhythms is going to increase 
the probability that you'll have an 

784
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:05,110
episode.
And that includes flying.

785
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,930
I do believe that at Gatwick airport 
there's,

786
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,103
in England,
there's a special team that deals with 

787
00:45:11,051 --> 00:45:13,810
people whose main mainly has been 
triggered by the overnight flight.

788
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,033
So,
and then the other thing I would say is 

789
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:20,860
stabilized the times you eat because 
these basic biological rhythms,

790
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,753
eating and sleeping in particular are 
part of what stabilize your nervous 

791
00:45:24,161 --> 00:45:26,110
system.
And if you have bipolar disorder,

792
00:45:26,111 --> 00:45:31,000
then you're likely to be
very susceptible to destabilize,

793
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,390
destabilize routine,
routinized activities,

794
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,090
routinize your life to the degree that 
that's possible.

795
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,960
And I would say the other thing you 
could do is use a calendar,

796
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,660
you know,
and like a Google calendar or whatever,

797
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,010
whatever calendar.

798
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,033
And I would say that's a good thing for 
everyone who's listening to think about 

799
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:54,241
so one to plan out your days and your 
weeks and you don't plan to prison,

800
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,653
right?
You use the calendar to design the days 

801
00:45:57,611 --> 00:45:58,444
that you would like to have.
And so part of that is going to be 

802
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:00,874
responsibility obviously because you 
have to keep up with your 

803
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:07,630
responsibilities or they overwhelm you 
and they multiply like hydrus and.

804
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,990
But you need to plan for things that you
really want to do as well.

805
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:12,850
And the calendar can really be your 
friend.

806
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:13,684
And I would say of all the things that 
you can do to organize yourself and 

807
00:46:16,571 --> 00:46:17,404
routinize yourself.
Learning to use a calendar is probably 

808
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:21,513
among the foremost.
And it doesn't matter if it takes you a 

809
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:25,180
year to get good at it.
You know what I mean?

810
00:46:25,181 --> 00:46:28,060
You've got the rest of your life then to
benefit from that.

811
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:30,130
And you should make friends with the 
calendar.

812
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,960
Like I said,
I don't treat it like a prison,

813
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,390
but it's really important to,
to,

814
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,210
um,
stabilize yourself as much as possible.

815
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,410
So
periphery Pete says,

816
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,010
I fell asleep listening to you.
My battery died.

817
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,873
I got to change it.

818
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,070
All right.
It looks like everything is okay.

819
00:47:56,071 --> 00:48:01,071
Again,
I use it a reflex camera my and um,

820
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,290
it has a battery.
No electrical plugins.

821
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,300
So I'm afraid I'm at the mercy of its 
batteries,

822
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,700
the very high quality camera though.
So I think it's worth,

823
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,150
worth the trouble.
Anyways,

824
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:18,570
periphery Pete said I fell asleep 
listening to you,

825
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:19,501
which,
you know,

826
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:21,690
that doesn't sound so good.
So that part's not so good.

827
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:22,524
But this part is good.
The next day my 60 filter less 

828
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,870
cigarettes a day habit disappeared.
Not sure what you said,

829
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,270
but thank you Claire X.
Hey.

830
00:48:30,271 --> 00:48:31,104
Well,
if you can figure out what you were 

831
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:33,090
listening to,
um,

832
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:34,223
maybe I can make a tape of things to 
listen to by Jordan Peterson while 

833
00:48:37,261 --> 00:48:39,540
you're falling asleep to fix your 
cigarette habit.

834
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,250
But anyways,
I think that's great.

835
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,510
Don't,
don't start again.

836
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,610
Or if you do,
make sure you quit.

837
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:45,444
Again.
I'm really glad to hear that and I've 

838
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,830
never had that particular talent pointed
out to me before.

839
00:48:49,831 --> 00:48:52,740
So that's pretty interesting and 
comical.

840
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:54,623
So
do you believe there's a strong 

841
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:03,060
undercurrent of gnosticism in our 
country?

842
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,380
GNOSTICISM,
by the way,

843
00:49:04,381 --> 00:49:05,214
is the doctrine heretical doctrine from 
a classical Christian perspective that 

844
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:10,044
you can attain religious insight through
understanding that's an oversimplified 

845
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,840
view,
but um,

846
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,810
things like the sacred feminine and 
hatred of the created world.

847
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,210
God,
that's a complicated question.

848
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:31,190
I think there's an undercurrent of 
wanting to be gnosticism in our country.

849
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,113
You know,
I think that people believe they can 

850
00:49:33,981 --> 00:49:37,460
come to religious enlightenment through 
understanding,

851
00:49:37,461 --> 00:49:38,294
but that they are generally less willing
to do the work that would be necessary 

852
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:45,740
to do that.
Then then is in fact necessary.

853
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,813
It takes an awful lot of study,
like it took me years of reading young 

854
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,240
to really start to understand what he 
was talking about.

855
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:53,991
10,
you know,

856
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,790
you could think about young as a 
gnostic,

857
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:59,330
but most people who talk about young 
haven't read anything he wrote.

858
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,823
While that's true,
often of things that people talk about 

859
00:50:02,931 --> 00:50:03,764
in general,
but I mean I think there is a place for 

860
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:08,600
understanding and religious belief or 
other.

861
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:11,480
Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this 
biblical lecture series,

862
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:12,583
but I think it's pseudo gnosticism 
fundamentally and it's people putting 

863
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:21,440
forward ill considered opinions in the 
place of solid religious,

864
00:50:21,441 --> 00:50:24,200
symbolic doctrine and I think that's a 
big problem.

865
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:29,201
I think it's part of what makes us weak 
and I think we are at the moment week in

866
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:32,420
our foundations as a civilization,
so

867
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,653
I have trouble regulating my emotions.
I have a suspicion it's to do with the 

868
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:44,330
fact that I'm 90 percentile and 
openness,

869
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,373
conscientiousness and neuroticism and 
second percentile in agreeableness and 

870
00:50:49,341 --> 00:50:52,130
extroversion.
Any tips on dealing with that?

871
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,420
Yeah,
well,

872
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:58,660
if you're really high in openness and 
you're really high in neuroticism,

873
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,523
that can be a rough combination.
The conscientious news should actually 

874
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:02,644
help with that,
although it might make you a bit 

875
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,450
perfectionistic.
Um,

876
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:06,663
the problem with being high in openness,
which is creativity and interest in 

877
00:51:09,581 --> 00:51:10,414
ideas and high in neuroticism,
which is tendency towards anxiety and 

878
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:14,314
emotional pain,
is that like open people like to break 

879
00:51:16,901 --> 00:51:19,180
open boxes,
conceptual boxes,

880
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:21,490
and see what's inside,
like Pandora's box,

881
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:26,491
but people are high in neuroticism or 
are more likely to respond negatively to

882
00:51:27,311 --> 00:51:28,144
complexity and uncertainty.
And if you're an open person and you're 

883
00:51:30,581 --> 00:51:32,050
always thinking of new things,
you,

884
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:33,750
you tend to,
um,

885
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,350
saw off the branch that you're sitting 
on on a regular basis.

886
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:42,910
And that can be pretty destabilizing.
Any tips on dealing with that?

887
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,520
Well,
I would repeat what I said earlier.

888
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,990
I think that one of the things that you 
do if you're high in anxiety,

889
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,290
is to stabilize your sleep wake cycles.

890
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,153
So get up at the same time.
Go to bed at the same time and eat at 

891
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:57,814
the same time.
Make sure that you eat breakfast and a 

892
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:00,514
big breakfast too.
That's heavy on fat and protein because 

893
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,420
if you're hungry and then you stress 
yourself,

894
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:09,040
especially if you're high in 
neuroticism,

895
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:09,874
you destabilize your,
your insulin production system and it 

896
00:52:13,031 --> 00:52:15,010
will restabilize till you go to sleep 
again.

897
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:15,844
So I would say like two things.
One is have a big breakfast and then 

898
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,960
also if you're feeling particularly 
anxious,

899
00:52:22,961 --> 00:52:23,794
try eating something,
not carbohydrates and see if that helps 

900
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,993
because you,
you might be somewhat permanently 

901
00:52:30,371 --> 00:52:35,350
dysregulated in your insulin,
stress-related insulin production.

902
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,213
That would be worth trying.
I would also say that you should shield 

903
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:43,741
yourself to some degree from news 
sources and sources of bad news,

904
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,210
especially,
um,

905
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:48,940
catastrophic news because most of it 
isn't news.

906
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:49,774
It's the repetition of things that we 
already know full well and there's 

907
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:57,670
reason to protect yourself from an 
onslaught of negative information,

908
00:52:57,671 --> 00:52:59,800
especially when it's not really 
necessary for you.

909
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:00,633
I mean,
I don't think you should bury your head 

910
00:53:01,631 --> 00:53:02,464
in the sand,
but constant exposure to the 

911
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:05,134
catastrophes of the world,
especially when there's nothing you can 

912
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:12,970
do about those catastrophes even 
hypothetically,

913
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,520
is something that can really destabilize
people.

914
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:17,890
I often tell people in my clinical 
practice,

915
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,993
um,
which isn't operating right now by the 

916
00:53:20,381 --> 00:53:21,214
way,
to shield themselves from news reports 

917
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:27,390
because it's too much.
If you're depressed and anxious,

918
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:28,224
it's just not something that you need.
It's not helpful to you second 

919
00:53:31,321 --> 00:53:33,960
percentile in agreeableness and 
extroversion.

920
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,300
Well,
you know,

921
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,063
one of the things that you can do if 
you're that low in agreeableness that 

922
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:41,514
shouldn't disregulate your emotions,
but it might interfere with your 

923
00:53:43,531 --> 00:53:45,190
relationships with other people you 
know,

924
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:48,810
because you might be a little bit harder
to.

925
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,543
You might take other people's feelings 
into consideration less than might be 

926
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:55,074
good for you.
One of the things that people who are 

927
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:57,564
low in agreeableness can do is to try to
think of things they could do for other 

928
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:02,550
people and make that a practice.

929
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,733
You know,
like maybe once a week you could 

930
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,050
consciously do someone a favor or give 
someone a gift,

931
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:12,270
something like that.
And practice being,

932
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,910
um,
what would you call it?

933
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,220
Compassionate and polite,
you know,

934
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,730
that'll expand your personality rather 
than transforming it.

935
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:23,550
So then maybe you could have the 
advantages of being disagreeable,

936
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,384
which means you're tough minded.
And skeptical and competitive and and 

937
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,560
those can all be really good things,
but it would be nice to be able to leave

938
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:32,394
it out a little bit with some with the 
ability to take other people's 

939
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,650
perspectives a bit more and to take them
into account.

940
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:40,020
And then you know,
if your relationships improve,

941
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:40,854
that can also improve your emotional 
stability because one of the ways that 

942
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:45,384
people regulate their anxiety is by 
having people around them that they get 

943
00:54:47,761 --> 00:54:48,594
along with because you know,
if you're upset people then they upset 

944
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:52,734
you and especially if you're high in 
neuroticism and that can increase your 

945
00:54:56,911 --> 00:54:59,130
anxiety and your pain.
So

946
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,493
Mr David says,
should I hide my antifeminist 

947
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,830
anti-feminism I presume as I studied 
university to become a nurse?

948
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,630
Well
look,

949
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,753
you shouldn't make unnecessary enemies 
and you probably shouldn't mouth your 

950
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:21,014
opinion more than necessary,
but I think you risk damaging your soul 

951
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,220
under certain circumstances when you 
don't say what you think.

952
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,990
So I wouldn't hide it because I think 
it's dangerous to hide it.

953
00:55:32,991 --> 00:55:33,824
And you also won't find out,
find the other people that you listened 

954
00:55:36,111 --> 00:55:38,120
to,
but I would say be prudent.

955
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:39,130
You know,
um,

956
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:43,370
don't falsify your opinions when you're 
writing.

957
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,263
That's a big mistake.
Don't falsify your opinions when you're 

958
00:55:46,161 --> 00:55:49,130
speaking.
You can always choose not to speak,

959
00:55:49,131 --> 00:55:49,964
you know,
but if you feel that you would be doing 

960
00:55:53,511 --> 00:55:54,344
damage to your integrity,
then you have to say what you have to 

961
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,510
say.
Do it carefully and,

962
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,780
and prepare for the consequences,
you know,

963
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,720
uh,
probably prepare beforehand I would say.

964
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,380
So I think the hiding is a bad idea,
like I said,

965
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:11,540
but don't make unnecessary enemies,
you know,

966
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:13,280
because there's just no utility in that.

967
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,140
How important do you believe the 
American right?

968
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,270
Is the American right to bear arms and 
maintain malicious?

969
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,820
Is it equivalent to the right to free 
speech?

970
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,213
Well,
I don't think anything is equivalent to 

971
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:28,360
the right to free speech or the 
responsibility for free speech.

972
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,490
Um,
how important do I believe that?

973
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:33,910
That right is Jesus?
That's a tough question.

974
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,560
You know,
my dad's a hunter,

975
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,680
he has 200 rifles,
something like that.

976
00:56:38,681 --> 00:56:42,100
They're all single shots because he 
believes the naming carefully.

977
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,170
Um,
the culture I come from,

978
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,190
which is northwestern Canada,
is a rural culture,

979
00:56:48,191 --> 00:56:49,024
a hunting culture.
People take their guns seriously there 

980
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,440
and it is definitely part of their 
lifestyle.

981
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:54,274
I mean,
my dad hunted his whole life and we ate 

982
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:58,240
wild meat almost all the time I was 
growing up.

983
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,683
Um,
I think that the right to bear arms is 

984
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,560
one of the markers of a,
of a free society.

985
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,483
I don't think it's reasonable that only 
the police and the army should be 

986
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:13,690
allowed to be dangerous.
I'm having said that.

987
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,530
Well,
I think I'll just leave it at that.

988
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,860
I mean I feel obligated in some sense to
go farther,

989
00:57:23,070 --> 00:57:25,650
especially with regards to what happened
in Las Vegas,

990
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:26,484
but
it seems to me that mostly what happens 

991
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:30,534
after these mass shootings is that the 
event gets absolutely politicized and 

992
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,300
people take their standard positions and
there's no moving either side and that's

993
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:40,890
too bad.
But,

994
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:41,724
um,

995
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,143
I think that it's unfortunate to use an 
event like the Las Vegas event or the 

996
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,880
columbine shootings to make political 
capital.

997
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:59,870
And I think that's usually what happens.
And so I'm not going to do that.

998
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,520
I think it's an important,
right.

999
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:02,623
I believe that the individual should be 
allowed or even encouraged to be 

1000
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:06,890
dangerous,
but controlled.

1001
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,290
No.
So along with that,

1002
00:58:09,291 --> 00:58:14,210
right is a responsibility and,
and I guess maybe from the NRA,

1003
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,670
there should be more discussion of 
responsibility.

1004
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,500
Is that possible?
Now?

1005
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,630
Seems to me to be reasonable.
So

1006
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:36,690
any advice for a person with intense 
chronic pain that wants to become.

1007
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,280
Who wants to become a uh.
Oh,

1008
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:44,140
sorry.
It switched on me.

1009
00:58:44,141 --> 00:58:44,974
Oh,
there we go.

1010
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,510
Crayola sheep says any advice for a 
person with intense chronic pain?

1011
00:58:48,511 --> 00:58:50,790
Who wants to become a contributing 
member of society?

1012
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,970
Specifically having the self discipline 
to push through pain,

1013
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:56,310
to take care of responsibilities?
Well,

1014
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:59,190
the first thing I would say is that if 
you have intense chronic pain,

1015
00:58:59,191 --> 00:59:02,520
then my heart goes out to you because 
now it's really awful.

1016
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,610
And so I think that you can cut yourself
a break.

1017
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:06,503
I think the fact that you want to become
or continue being a contributing member 

1018
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:12,054
to society,
society is a testament to your 

1019
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,373
fortitude.
I guess the first thing I would ask you 

1020
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:18,570
is if your pain has been reasonably 
managed,

1021
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:19,463
you probably know this and I'm not 
giving you any medical advice because I 

1022
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:22,994
can't,
but you might want to note that there 

1023
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:25,994
are antidepressants that are quite 
effective as longterm pain medications 

1024
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:31,520
and you may already know that,
but if you don't,

1025
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:32,803
then you should check that out because 
they're not addictive and they can be a 

1026
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,340
very effective adjunct.

1027
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,320
I would also say that the literature on 
chronic pain tends to indicate that more

1028
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:43,154
activity is better than less and that 
and that's partly because when you get 

1029
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:50,090
engaged in something that's meaningful,
let's say,

1030
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:51,583
and important to you,
that that activates the dopaminergic 

1031
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:56,714
system,
the same system that Takeda activates 

1032
00:59:58,251 --> 01:00:01,730
and that can produce a fairly pronounced
analgesic effect.

1033
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:02,564
So I would say everything that you can 
do to get yourself occupied with things 

1034
01:00:06,411 --> 01:00:09,170
that you regard as important and 
worthwhile is actually probably going to

1035
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:13,760
help you manage your pain better.
It looks like inactivity is a bad,

1036
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,090
is bad.
Generally speaking for chronic pain,

1037
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:17,924
I mean obviously that's not the case.
If the sort of activity that you're 

1038
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:21,854
engaged in is of the type that will 
aggravate an underlying chronic 

1039
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:30,950
physiological condition,
but I would say make a plan,

1040
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,590
make a daily plan,
make a weekly plan,

1041
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,060
um,
make it,

1042
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,403
you know,
push yourself a little bit farther than 

1043
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:42,170
you can go comfortably on a weekly basis
and see how far you can get any year.

1044
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,570
That's because what's your choice?
I mean,

1045
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,913
you're laying there.
Suffering is not preferable to doing 

1046
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,530
things and suffering,
not generally.

1047
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,180
So I would say like more power to you 
for trying and,

1048
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,130
but,
but also do keep in mind that activity,

1049
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:03,340
meaningful activity is a good analgesic.
So I'm Eric Butler says sheesh.

1050
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,950
Canadians never get it.
Well,

1051
01:01:06,951 --> 01:01:08,570
I didn't know we get it sometimes.
Eric,

1052
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:09,590
come on now,
you know,

1053
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:11,360
give us a break.
We're just.

1054
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,520
Canadians were freezing to death half 
the time.

1055
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,713
So you know,
we do pretty well given the fact that 

1056
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:17,804
every day here in the winter is the 
equivalent of a national catastrophe in 

1057
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:21,314
the U.
s.

1058
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:26,080
So anyways,
I'm Betsy Kirkland.

1059
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:28,310
It says,
if the second amendment is taken away,

1060
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:30,530
there will be nothing to protect your 
freedom of speech.

1061
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,810
That is how important.
Yes.

1062
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,411
Yes.
Well,

1063
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:34,640
that is certainly the argument that 
people who are

1064
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,350
motivated to protect the second 
amendment make,

1065
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:41,270
and I'm not going to oppose that.
So

1066
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,300
freedom of speech is not licensed to 
bully.

1067
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,010
Yes,
actually it is.

1068
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,480
That is exactly what it is.
That's clique zero.

1069
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:53,314
Two zero.
Three.

1070
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:56,700
Freedom of speech is licensed to bullet.
It's licensed to offend.

1071
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:57,923
It's licensed to disrupt.
It's all sorts of things that are 

1072
01:02:01,621 --> 01:02:02,454
unpleasant and upsetting and um,
that doesn't mean that you should go 

1073
01:02:07,471 --> 01:02:09,810
around bullying or being disruptive or 
upsetting.

1074
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,330
That isn't the same thing,
but that is exactly what it is.

1075
01:02:12,331 --> 01:02:15,210
So I'm afraid please zero to three are 
wrong.

1076
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,463
Now.
Then you say use some discretion and 

1077
01:02:17,551 --> 01:02:18,510
thought,
well yes,

1078
01:02:18,511 --> 01:02:19,344
of course that's perfectly reasonable 
advice and that is what people should 

1079
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:23,730
do.
But you know,

1080
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,870
what constitutes discretion is often 
something that has to be discussed.

1081
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:28,704
And I would say that the threat to 
freedom of speech is being put forward 

1082
01:02:33,781 --> 01:02:36,810
very strongly by people who say things.
While it's not as,

1083
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:40,050
it's not the same as the licensed to 
bullying and bullying,

1084
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:43,500
by the way generally speaking is it is a
sequence of physical auctions.

1085
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,780
When it's verbal bullying,
which also can occur,

1086
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,960
then that has to be put into somewhat 
different category.

1087
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:49,794
If you're interested in bullying,
there's a great book and seriously 

1088
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:53,244
interested in it.
There's a great book by a guy named Dan 

1089
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:58,140
always called bullying.
I think that's what it's called,

1090
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,880
what we know and what we can do about 
it.

1091
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:02,480
Dan Always,
and if you know,

1092
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:04,290
if you're actually concerned about that 
sort of thing,

1093
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:07,260
you could read that book and see if 
there are places that you could put what

1094
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:09,990
he advises in schools,
for example,

1095
01:03:09,991 --> 01:03:10,980
into practice.
So,

1096
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,720
um,

1097
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,553
you look young,
asked what moment triggered your 

1098
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:35,340
obsession with the topics outlined in 
the biblical series and maps?

1099
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:38,820
Well,
that's a good question.

1100
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:41,880
I actually don't know the answer though.
I wouldn't say it was a moment.

1101
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:47,070
I know that from the time I was about 16
until the time that I was 24.

1102
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:50,100
So I had recurrent nightmares about 
nuclear war.

1103
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:51,533
And so that was certainly part of it and
they were very vivid and very realistic 

1104
01:03:55,410 --> 01:04:00,410
and so and certainly my reading 
especially about the Holocaust,

1105
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:02,013
I'm also.
And then later Solzhenitsyn's accounts 

1106
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,730
of the Gulag archipelago,
for example,

1107
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,550
the horrors there.
That was also a major contributor.

1108
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:13,823
It was my concern about the Cold War.
I would say that was really the trigger 

1109
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:19,290
in general because I wanted to 
understand.

1110
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:20,143
I took a political science degree first 
and looked at it from a political 

1111
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:23,214
perspective,
but most of my professors by the time I 

1112
01:04:25,741 --> 01:04:26,574
was in my third or fourth year,
insisted that the reason that people 

1113
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:30,144
fought the reasons that people thought 
were economic and I never did believe 

1114
01:04:33,931 --> 01:04:34,764
that because,
well people fight about the things they 

1115
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:37,914
value,
but it isn't the obvious why people 

1116
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:43,380
value the things they value,
you know,

1117
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:44,214
so it's a psychological issue as far as 
I'm concerned with and not an economic 

1118
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:48,740
issue.

1119
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,573
And so it was my discomfort,
dissatisfaction with the standard 

1120
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,104
political science view point directing 
team point combined with this strange 

1121
01:04:57,901 --> 01:04:58,734
obsession I had about the Cold War.
Maybe that's associated to some degree 

1122
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:04,170
with my proclivity to depression.
I mean,

1123
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,130
who knows,
you know,

1124
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,570
I don't know.
I was obsessed with it and I,

1125
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:12,060
it isn't obvious why things grip you and
shake you like a rat,

1126
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:14,400
you know,
I guess some,

1127
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,353
there's something about that that seems 
to be associated with people used to 

1128
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:19,570
call it destiny.
So,

1129
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,173
um,

1130
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,750
but it certainly wasn't obsession when I
was 23 or 24 when I started writing maps

1131
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:29,840
of meaning I was thinking about it 16 
hours a day,

1132
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:31,970
like top speed,
just nonstop.

1133
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,710
And the only relief I could get from it.
Rudy was to go work out with weights,

1134
01:05:36,711 --> 01:05:41,060
which I did for quite a long time.
I gained about 35 pounds in about a year

1135
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:41,893
and a half working out with weights and 
I had to quit because I was eating so 

1136
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:46,010
much.
It was taking up like half my life.

1137
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:47,200
So,
um,

1138
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,520
anyways,
I don't know what it was,

1139
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:50,354
you know,

1140
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,420
who knows,
who knows what,

1141
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:56,200
what darkness lurks in the bottom of a 
soul.

1142
01:05:56,370 --> 01:05:57,640
No one,
why it's there.

1143
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:00,063
Maybe it was also the fact that I could 
see in myself the tendencies that might 

1144
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:07,270
lead people to do terrible things and I 
was also very,

1145
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,104
very curious about that,
so maybe that was an encounter with the 

1146
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,100
union shot.
It was something like that.

1147
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,250
Jeremy says,
will you lecture in the Netherlands?

1148
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,420
Yes.
As a matter of fact,

1149
01:06:16,421 --> 01:06:19,850
I'm coming to the Netherlands in January
to lecture there.

1150
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:21,303
I'll put the link to that up on my 
website at some point in the relatively 

1151
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:25,540
near future.
So

1152
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:36,553
saga strike.
I've heard depressed people who stopped 

1153
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:40,550
antidepressant said they never helped in
the first place.

1154
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:42,260
What do you say to that,
Mr Peterson?

1155
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,190
Hey,
that,

1156
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:44,023
that certainly possible.
I'm antidepressants don't necessarily 

1157
01:06:48,081 --> 01:06:48,914
work for everyone.
My personal opinion is that 

1158
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:57,220
antidepressants work quite well for many
people whose lives are in decent order,

1159
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,640
so they have friends,
they have family that love them,

1160
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:02,474
they have a career,
they're educated approximately to the 

1161
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,210
level of their intelligence.
They have things to look forward to,

1162
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,450
but for some reason their mood is 
extremely distorted.

1163
01:07:11,451 --> 01:07:12,284
Him and and negative and I've seen 
antidepressants have miraculous effects 

1164
01:07:16,401 --> 01:07:20,090
or people like that.
I think they're less likely to work when

1165
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:20,924
people have a plethora of life problems,
which isn't exactly the same thing as 

1166
01:07:25,401 --> 01:07:28,660
being
depressed,

1167
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,330
you know,
like you think having a terrible life is

1168
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:33,164
not the same thing as being depressed.
Although the two can overlap and it 

1169
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,570
isn't obvious to me that people who,
you know,

1170
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:41,210
maybe they have a drinking problem or a 
drug abuse problem,

1171
01:07:41,211 --> 01:07:42,044
mender unemployed and they have a 
pathological family and their friends 

1172
01:07:45,741 --> 01:07:48,620
aren't good for them and um,
you know,

1173
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:49,131
they,
they,

1174
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:49,964
they have a string of failures behind 
them and they don't have much to look 

1175
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:53,330
forward to in the future.

1176
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:54,163
And all about it's,
it's a lot for an antidepressant 

1177
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,130
overcome.
But under those circumstances,

1178
01:07:58,131 --> 01:07:58,964
maybe the antidepressants can help stave
off feelings of like suicidal feelings 

1179
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:04,634
and that sort of thing.
But antidepressants don't work for 

1180
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:07,454
everyone,
but some people they work really well 

1181
01:08:09,981 --> 01:08:11,210
for it.
If you're depressed,

1182
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:13,340
they're definitely worth a try.
You know,

1183
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:15,740
in a month if they're going to work.
Also,

1184
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:16,574
there are a variety of different kinds 
of antidepressants and you have to 

1185
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:22,070
figure out dose and you have to figure 
out when you should take them during the

1186
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,750
day and you and you have to figure out 
type,

1187
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,240
so they're,
they're not a cure,

1188
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:27,074
they're a tool for helping control 
negative emotion and they can be very 

1189
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:31,490
effective.
So,

1190
01:08:31,491 --> 01:08:34,280
but that doesn't mean that there aren't 
people that they didn't help.

1191
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,620
So that's what I would say about that.

1192
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:47,710
What the player formerly known as most 
cops says.

1193
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,470
What do you think the role of 
psychedelics will be in the future?

1194
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:51,603
Marijuana will most likely be somewhat 
legal everywhere in the US and this may 

1195
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:57,700
push someone to try stronger.
PSYCHEDELICS is this bad?

1196
01:08:58,210 --> 01:08:59,043
Let's start with the first one.
I have no idea what the role of 

1197
01:09:01,031 --> 01:09:05,830
psychedelics will be in the future.
I know that the FDA just cleared ecstasy

1198
01:09:05,831 --> 01:09:08,260
for use for post traumatic stress 
disorder,

1199
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,333
so that's very interesting.
I know there's some very interesting 

1200
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:14,260
work being done at Johns Hopkins on 
silicide mushrooms,

1201
01:09:14,261 --> 01:09:16,360
which seemed to be very effective,
for example,

1202
01:09:16,361 --> 01:09:17,194
in helping people stop smoking.
I think that we don't know anything 

1203
01:09:20,231 --> 01:09:22,210
about psychedelics at all.
I mean,

1204
01:09:22,211 --> 01:09:25,540
we know that they seem to have an effect
on the serotonin system,

1205
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,240
but that's a pretty broad brush stroke.
Um,

1206
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:29,403
I think they are incalculably I'm 
peculiar and that they reveal things 

1207
01:09:36,731 --> 01:09:40,870
about the structure of the world that we
are beyond ignorant about,

1208
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:41,880
beyond ignorant about.

1209
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:44,080
I have no idea what role they'll play in
the future.

1210
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:46,480
I don't know what to think about 
psychedelics at all.

1211
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:47,833
Um,
marijuana will most likely be somewhat 

1212
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:52,690
legal everywhere in the US and this may 
push some to try stronger.

1213
01:09:52,691 --> 01:09:53,524
PSYCHEDELICS is this bad?
I suppose it depends on how they're 

1214
01:09:56,231 --> 01:09:57,064
used,
whether or not it's bad and what the 

1215
01:09:58,121 --> 01:10:01,090
intent is.
I think they are very bad party drugs.

1216
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:05,140
Psychedelics aren't,
aren't for fun.

1217
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,900
I don't think that that's the right way 
to use them at all.

1218
01:10:07,901 --> 01:10:08,734
I think they need to be used seriously 
and they need to be used in a manner 

1219
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,174
that's life affirming and they need to 
be used in a manner that's commensurate 

1220
01:10:16,451 --> 01:10:20,470
with genuine exploration and they need 
to be used carefully or they can cause a

1221
01:10:20,471 --> 01:10:21,304
lot of trouble.
So Carl Jung said beware of unearned 

1222
01:10:25,091 --> 01:10:28,000
wisdom and I think that's very wise.
So,

1223
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,770
um,
anyways,

1224
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:34,480
I hope that we continue investigating 
them scientifically because there's much

1225
01:10:34,481 --> 01:10:38,920
to be learned there much more than we 
can imagine as far as I'm concerned.

1226
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,563
Ha [inaudible] says,
what's up with all these frog 

1227
01:10:54,731 --> 01:10:57,030
occurrences?
I've never seen such synchronicity,

1228
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,730
man.
I don't know what to say about that.

1229
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:01,043
I had some frog synchronicity 
occurrences earlier this year that just 

1230
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:07,230
about made me think so.
I don't know.

1231
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:08,663
I have,

1232
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,090
I have no idea what to make of it.
Um,

1233
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:19,490
it leaves me speechless.
That's all I can say about that.

1234
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:20,410
You know,
I,

1235
01:11:20,410 --> 01:11:23,720
I do get Carl young had some strange 
ideas and,

1236
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:25,860
and one of them was synchronicity,
you know,

1237
01:11:25,861 --> 01:11:30,020
the fact that things could line up in a 
way that seemed meaningful and you know,

1238
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,960
much as I don't understand how that 
occurs.

1239
01:11:32,961 --> 01:11:36,530
I've experienced it many,
many times and it very convincing ways.

1240
01:11:36,531 --> 01:11:37,364
And so it's,
it's one of the things that leads me to 

1241
01:11:39,081 --> 01:11:41,690
think that the world isn't structured 
the way that we think it is.

1242
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:46,280
I think it's structured more like a 
symphony where where and there are times

1243
01:11:46,281 --> 01:11:48,680
with dis,
different parts of the world,

1244
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,350
different parts of being could come into
harmony spontaneously and,

1245
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:56,390
and all pointed in the same direction 
and why that happens.

1246
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,940
I have no idea.
All right.

1247
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,590
I don't understand it at all.
So.

1248
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:11,683
All right,
so let's go back to the preexisting 

1249
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:18,221
questions.
Semen.

1250
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:33,440
Eric says,
apologies for the weird question.

1251
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,170
Have you ever performed a ritual 
sacrifice?

1252
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:40,040
No,
I haven't and it is a weird question,

1253
01:12:40,041 --> 01:12:42,110
although I can understand why you would 
ask it.

1254
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,460
I have performed psychological 
sacrifices,

1255
01:12:51,461 --> 01:12:52,294
you know,
I suppose when I decided to give up 

1256
01:12:53,861 --> 01:12:54,694
something that I needed to give up so 
that I could move forward into the 

1257
01:12:57,971 --> 01:12:58,804
future.
Right.

1258
01:12:58,810 --> 01:13:00,780
That certainly happened when I quit 
smoking.

1259
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:02,223
When I more or less quit drinking.
I still have a drink from time to time 

1260
01:13:05,231 --> 01:13:06,064
now,
but I quit for 20 years and that was a 

1261
01:13:07,931 --> 01:13:11,680
sacrifice.
I couldn't continue to drink again.

1262
01:13:11,681 --> 01:13:12,514
I said I was from northern Alberta.
It was pretty hard drinking culture and 

1263
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:18,220
I really liked alcohol,
but I couldn't drink and write and do my

1264
01:13:18,221 --> 01:13:21,760
phd and manage my family 
responsibilities.

1265
01:13:21,761 --> 01:13:25,150
It was too much and so I stopped and 
that was a good thing.

1266
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,340
So that was a sacrifice.

1267
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:39,940
You are very critical of postmodernism,
an egalitarianism wave of the sixties.

1268
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,600
Isn't there a danger of throwing the 
baby out with the bathwater?

1269
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:46,540
Are there positive things about these 
movements at the moment?

1270
01:13:46,570 --> 01:13:47,950
No,
not really.

1271
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:50,260
I don't think there's much positive 
about them at all.

1272
01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:53,740
I think they've gone way too far.
I think they dominate the humanities.

1273
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,053
The postmodernism mean the fact that the
postmodernist point is that there is a 

1274
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:05,490
very large number of ways to interpret 
any closed set of phenomena,

1275
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:08,510
something like that.
Any limited set of phenomena,

1276
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,740
and that's true,
but it's,

1277
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,590
it's shallow,
it's very,

1278
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:13,170
very shallow doctrine.
And uh,

1279
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:14,443
and if,
if I'm throwing the baby out with the 

1280
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,460
bathwater,
then it's a baby that needs to be thrown

1281
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:19,294
out.
Afraid are the positive things about 

1282
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:22,120
these movements.
Not at the moment.

1283
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,720
I can't see anything positive about it.
I think it's,

1284
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:26,703
it's degenerated into ideological clap 
trap and I think it's destroying the 

1285
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:30,544
universities.

1286
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,880
So the egalitarian wave of the sixties,
that's a different issue I would say.

1287
01:14:35,981 --> 01:14:36,814
I mean at mean I don't think it's 
reasonable to deny the utility of the 

1288
01:14:42,431 --> 01:14:45,180
civil rights movement in the 19 sixties 
for example.

1289
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:46,014
And,
or,

1290
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:47,560
and,
and you know,

1291
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:48,394
there were movements before that,
like the labor movement that had real 

1292
01:14:50,681 --> 01:14:51,514
justification for being.
It isn't that everything that always 

1293
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,560
happens on the left is bad.
I don't think that at all.

1294
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:58,053
I think that the people who are,
let's say on the lower end of the 

1295
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:06,220
economic distribution,
need a powerful voice in politics.

1296
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,423
Um,
I think that's only fair and I mean 

1297
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:16,650
there is room for an egalitarian 
oriented east folks,

1298
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:17,493
but that isn't what equity is.
This has become completely ideological 

1299
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:21,934
and there's just no,
there's just no excuse for it as far as 

1300
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:25,630
I'm concerned.
So,

1301
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:26,763
um,

1302
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,073
if you plan on doing meetups with more 
intellectuals like Camille and Sam 

1303
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,580
Harris,
who would be your pick?

1304
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:44,620
I'm,
well,

1305
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:47,320
I'm going to meet Jonathan Heit.
That'll be good.

1306
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:50,440
I really admire his work.
I think he's a really good guy,

1307
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:52,240
so I'm looking forward to talking to 
him.

1308
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:55,300
I'd like to talk to Thomas Soul.
I think it's.

1309
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:58,270
So I think that would be interesting.
Um,

1310
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,290
the rest of it,
I have to think more about that.

1311
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:03,124
I mean,
but those are two that I would 

1312
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:08,110
definitely like to talk to you.
I'm going to speak with Jocko willink.

1313
01:16:08,111 --> 01:16:10,330
I think I mentioned that.
So that might be interesting.

1314
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,440
Will there be a third talk with Sam 
Harris?

1315
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:18,160
Maybe this time with Sam as your guests 
and you taking your gloves off?

1316
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,400
I don't have any plans for a third talk 
with Sam.

1317
01:16:21,401 --> 01:16:23,500
I wouldn't be opposed to it,
although I think we,

1318
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,693
I think we've probably got about as far 
as we were going to get in or a second 

1319
01:16:27,521 --> 01:16:28,354
discussion.
I think the two discussions together 

1320
01:16:29,741 --> 01:16:31,660
actually worked quite well.
Um,

1321
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:36,170
so I think,
I think,

1322
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,180
and this is no,
I'm not saying this in any negative way,

1323
01:16:41,181 --> 01:16:45,260
but I think the third discussion might 
be might be beating a dead horse.

1324
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:46,893
I'm like,
I'm not interested in particularly in 

1325
01:16:49,811 --> 01:16:54,110
putting Sam on the spot and you know,
and it's also possible that he would put

1326
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,880
me on the spot.
It isn't necessarily,

1327
01:16:55,881 --> 01:16:57,920
but I would come out Victoria,
so to speak.

1328
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,143
I mean he's a very sharp guy and there's
many compelling arguments to be made in 

1329
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:05,720
favor of atheism even though I think 
that overall it's,

1330
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:07,490
it's,
it's,

1331
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:08,413
it's a stance lacks.
I don't think it contends with its 

1332
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:13,214
opponent fairly because I don't think 
that the atheist community in general 

1333
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:20,170
takes the thought of serious religious 
thinkers.

1334
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,950
Seriously.
I think they tend to struggle

1335
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:22,930
now,
but you know.

1336
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:27,480
Well,
okay.

1337
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:31,843
Could you please offer advice for 
individuals with high intelligence but 

1338
01:17:34,131 --> 01:17:34,964
low extroversion and low agreeableness 
and making and maintaining social 

1339
01:17:37,491 --> 01:17:41,720
connections and friendships?
Well,

1340
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:42,670
I would.
That's Roger,

1341
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,910
Roger.
I would say

1342
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:48,680
make a plan.
Again,

1343
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:54,460
spend some time on it weekly.
Go to things like meetups.

1344
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:57,910
There's a site called meetup.com.
That's a good place to meet people.

1345
01:17:57,911 --> 01:18:00,430
Do whatever you have to meet people,
take a course,

1346
01:18:00,490 --> 01:18:02,800
strike up a conversation,
you know,

1347
01:18:02,801 --> 01:18:05,230
and,
and ask questions and listen that that's

1348
01:18:05,231 --> 01:18:07,420
particularly good.
If you're low in agreeableness,

1349
01:18:07,860 --> 01:18:10,240
um,
people really like to be listened to,

1350
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:11,103
you know,
you don't want to pester them with 

1351
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:12,874
questions too badly,
but you can get an awful long ways by 

1352
01:18:15,371 --> 01:18:16,204
listening to people and asking them 
questions people hardly ever get 

1353
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:22,060
listened to and they're so damn help,
happy when you do it,

1354
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,800
that,
that,

1355
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:24,963
that

1356
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:27,380
they're likely to open themselves up to 
you very,

1357
01:18:27,381 --> 01:18:28,214
very rapidly.
So get them talking and when they say 

1358
01:18:31,761 --> 01:18:34,610
something you don't quite catch your 
understand and ask them about it.

1359
01:18:34,611 --> 01:18:35,444
And,
and,

1360
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:36,293
and that can help you move forward,
but put some time into it like you need 

1361
01:18:40,161 --> 01:18:42,650
to be going out at least once a week,
um,

1362
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:46,280
and find some social places that you can
go to regularly.

1363
01:18:46,281 --> 01:18:49,610
That's another thing you can do is pick 
a couple of hangouts,

1364
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:52,130
like a local bar or something like that 
or whatever,

1365
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,590
but go there regularly and say hi to the
people who own it and run it.

1366
01:18:56,591 --> 01:18:57,424
And you know,
eventually you'll be a regular and then 

1367
01:18:59,511 --> 01:19:01,370
you can start to meet people by doing 
that.

1368
01:19:01,371 --> 01:19:02,204
But you know,
it might take you two or three years to 

1369
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:04,514
get good at it.
I've seen people go to go from being 

1370
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,403
afraid to strike up a,
to have a conversation with a friend in 

1371
01:19:12,951 --> 01:19:14,120
a,
in a coffee shop,

1372
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,980
you know,
like have a panic attack,

1373
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:18,650
thinking about that to actually doing 
stand up comedy.

1374
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:21,630
So you can really move yourself along 
ways if you,

1375
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:24,620
if you make a long time plan.
So

1376
01:19:26,510 --> 01:19:28,900
okay,
John Dam don't.

1377
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,073
I've only got three dogs after that says
how should the manager used the preto 

1378
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:37,070
principle in his favorite work?
I find myself constantly focusing on the

1379
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,050
bottom five,
20 percent that causes 80,

1380
01:19:39,051 --> 01:19:41,780
95 percent of the team's poor 
performance.

1381
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:42,740
Oh,
that's easy.

1382
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:43,813
Then managerial literature,
the solid managerial literature is 

1383
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:47,623
absolutely crystal clear on this.
Spend all your time with your highest 

1384
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:51,704
producers and put your lowest producers 
where they can do the least amount of 

1385
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:57,560
damage.
The probability that as a manager,

1386
01:19:57,561 --> 01:19:58,394
you're going to be able to solve the 
problems of the poorest five to 20 

1387
01:20:02,001 --> 01:20:04,850
percent of your work.
A team is zero.

1388
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,040
You just don't have the time or the 
resources at your disposal.

1389
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:09,263
So what you should definitely do in 
order to increase performance is to 

1390
01:20:13,921 --> 01:20:17,580
concentrate on your top performers.
I know that's not what managers do.

1391
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:19,080
They do exactly what you say.

1392
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:21,450
They focus on the bottom five to 20 
percent,

1393
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,420
but that's exactly the wrong thing to do
as a manager.

1394
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:25,793
Focus on your best people.
They're hyper productive as you already 

1395
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:28,890
know.
So,

1396
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,560
um,
you know,

1397
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:31,823
maybe you need to reconceptualize the 
way that you're interacting with your 

1398
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:35,154
people,
but you should have regular 

1399
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:40,110
conversations at least with those that 
you think are outstanding.

1400
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:41,810
Let them know that you really,
um,

1401
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,403
what would you say that you're really 
happy with their performance and see 

1402
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:47,724
what you can do to get obstacles the 
hell out of their way because as a 

1403
01:20:50,521 --> 01:20:51,354
manager,
essentially what you should be doing is 

1404
01:20:53,101 --> 01:20:53,934
identifying the top performers and then 
doing everything you can to clear out 

1405
01:20:57,031 --> 01:21:00,000
the obstacles in their path.
That's the right way to think about it.

1406
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:01,283
And also to give yourself enough time to
develop a medium to longterm plan and 

1407
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,650
start fighting fires on a day to day 
basis.

1408
01:21:07,651 --> 01:21:08,484
You need at least 90 minutes a week to 
think about where you want things to be 

1409
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:14,340
going into medium to long term.
So,

1410
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,473
but I can't over emphasize the 
importance of dealing with your top 

1411
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:21,900
productivity,
your talk,

1412
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:25,110
your highest,
your most productive people.

1413
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:27,750
That's where all the gains are.
That's where all the games are.

1414
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,090
How are you doing?
Someone is asking you,

1415
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:34,103
um,

1416
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,213
you said some place that you felt like 
you were at times dancing on broken 

1417
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:39,641
glass?
No,

1418
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:40,474
I think I said that I was,
I always felt like I was dancing on 

1419
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:45,070
broken glass.
Are you getting enough rest?

1420
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:48,400
And rnr is the food sensitivity getting 
worked out?

1421
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:51,580
I think maybe the food sensitivity thing
is getting worked out.

1422
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:52,414
I think it's at the basis of,
of this depression that's been plaguing 

1423
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:57,063
my family for generations,
but I haven't figured out exactly what 

1424
01:22:00,371 --> 01:22:01,204
it is yet.
I'm working very hard on that with my 

1425
01:22:03,071 --> 01:22:07,000
daughter who also seems to have the same
problem and it is absolutely brutal.

1426
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,340
It's absolutely brutal,
so I'm,

1427
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,823
am I getting enough rest in rnr?
That's hard to say because with the 

1428
01:22:15,821 --> 01:22:18,640
responses that I'd been having that 
ignoring my health back,

1429
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:19,474
it's,
it's hard to discriminate between risks 

1430
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:22,023
and R and r,
the lack of that and just getting 

1431
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:24,514
walloped by,
by eating what appears to be the wrong 

1432
01:22:26,861 --> 01:22:29,830
thing.
So it's so funny because you know,

1433
01:22:29,831 --> 01:22:30,664
for years I was very skeptical of anyone
who was concerned about gluten 

1434
01:22:36,371 --> 01:22:37,204
sensitivity and that sort of thing,
but I sure learned that that was 

1435
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:43,340
arrogant.
So yeah.

1436
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,333
Well,
I found many times in my life that you 

1437
01:22:46,121 --> 01:22:46,954
have to be aware of what you are 
judgmental about because many things 

1438
01:22:49,721 --> 01:22:51,780
come back to haunt you.
So

1439
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,013
Dr Peterson,
do you have suggestions for how to make 

1440
01:23:02,401 --> 01:23:04,200
a schedule that doesn't make you a 
tyrant?

1441
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,153
I've watched your previous videos,
but I'm struggling to make a weekly 

1442
01:23:07,121 --> 01:23:09,670
schedule that is productive.
Hey Joshua,

1443
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:15,210
start by making a weekly schedule that 
you want really like,

1444
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:16,173
imagine that you're designing your 
schedule so that you can have the life 

1445
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,380
you want.
Just start with that,

1446
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:23,500
like be easy on yourself to begin with.
You know,

1447
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:24,334
you'll get better at it,
you can add more responsibilities as 

1448
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:28,060
you,
as you practice,

1449
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:29,133
so,
so start by just scheduling and a few 

1450
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:34,900
things that you'd like to do and then 
load it up over time,

1451
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:36,970
but remember like get,
get your attitude,

1452
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:37,804
right.
I'm using this schedule so that I can 

1453
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:44,020
have the days and the weeks and the 
months that would make my life,

1454
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,540
that would optimize my life,
right?

1455
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,120
Not so that I should do what I need to 
get done.

1456
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:50,770
I mean,
obviously that's necessary,

1457
01:23:50,771 --> 01:23:53,110
but that's not the right goal.
So

1458
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:01,130
what are your thoughts on students 
taking adderall?

1459
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,410
Are there any longterm effects?
Um,

1460
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:04,573
there are long term studies of the 
utility of adderall for attention 

1461
01:24:09,321 --> 01:24:11,330
deficit disorder,
hyperactivity,

1462
01:24:11,331 --> 01:24:12,164
and the results are basically negative.
There is no evidence that the 

1463
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:19,190
medications help with academic 
performance over the long run.

1464
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:24,140
I think that adderall is an amphetamine.
It is addictive.

1465
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:27,500
It can sensitize you to other dopamine 
agonists.

1466
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:30,760
So I would generally say it's something 
to be avoided.

1467
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:34,970
You also want to really watch it in 
combination with marijuana for example,

1468
01:24:34,971 --> 01:24:35,804
or psychedelics because you can get 
unlucky and trigger a psychotic episode 

1469
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:43,490
and that is not a good thing because 
once you have one psychotic episode,

1470
01:24:43,491 --> 01:24:46,790
you're a bit on the broken side and it's
hard to put yourself back together.

1471
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:51,791
So I would say use it sparingly if at 
all.

1472
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:53,173
It's not,
it's not a good plan and especially not 

1473
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:57,320
something good to be doing habitually.
So,

1474
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,130
um,

1475
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,193
any reading tips for becoming teachers 
who don't want to be corrupted by the 

1476
01:25:05,691 --> 01:25:08,030
current teacher education at the 
universities?

1477
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:09,380
Well I would say,
you know,

1478
01:25:09,381 --> 01:25:11,450
you can,
I have a reading list on my book,

1479
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,900
on my website,
Jordan Peterson built column.

1480
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:16,730
You could go look there.
I'm going to add some more books to read

1481
01:25:17,030 --> 01:25:19,940
as much classic literature as you can 
read history,

1482
01:25:19,941 --> 01:25:22,700
like going to the libraries and,
and,

1483
01:25:22,930 --> 01:25:26,360
and look at great books programs.
That's what I would say.

1484
01:25:26,361 --> 01:25:29,240
And you have to educate yourself at the 
university,

1485
01:25:29,241 --> 01:25:29,811
you know,
I mean,

1486
01:25:29,811 --> 01:25:33,240
that's always been the case and it's 
even more the case now is,

1487
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:34,843
is a
go back and go back and read great 

1488
01:25:39,151 --> 01:25:40,650
literature,
Great Philosophy,

1489
01:25:40,651 --> 01:25:41,484
great thinkers,
and you will learn a tremendous amount 

1490
01:25:43,921 --> 01:25:44,880
that way.
And I,

1491
01:25:44,881 --> 01:25:45,714
I think otherwise there's no way you can
avoid being corrupted by the current 

1492
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:49,644
teacher education at universities.
The education faculties are absolutely 

1493
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:54,180
dreadful.
Absolutely dreadful.

1494
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:55,613
So

1495
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,113
yeah,

1496
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,120
George Gabriel on drugs says,
Jordan,

1497
01:26:15,121 --> 01:26:15,954
please help me.
I'm 99th percentile and openness and 

1498
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:20,160
zero with percentile and 
conscientiousness.

1499
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:24,630
Yeah.
Well how old are you?

1500
01:26:24,660 --> 01:26:25,790
That's the first thing.
If you're,

1501
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:26,723
if you're young,
that's because younger people are less 

1502
01:26:30,361 --> 01:26:31,194
conscientious.
So that's one thing to keep in mind if 

1503
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:36,870
you're very open like that,
you need to be doing something creative,

1504
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,450
but you're going to have to learn how to
discipline yourself.

1505
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,433
There's just no way around it.
And I would say go do the future 

1506
01:26:42,601 --> 01:26:44,220
authoring program.
That's a good start.

1507
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:45,683
And you'll have to learn how to schedule
your time then and how to get up at the 

1508
01:26:49,051 --> 01:26:51,360
same time everyday.
And it's going to be a real struggle,

1509
01:26:51,390 --> 01:26:52,960
but you know,
you,

1510
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:54,163
you can do it.
I've had students who were very high in 

1511
01:26:55,681 --> 01:26:56,514
openness and low in conscientiousness as
graduate students and they disciplined 

1512
01:26:58,981 --> 01:26:59,814
themselves.
You need to find something that you're 

1513
01:27:00,571 --> 01:27:01,404
really interested in that you're willing
to pursue and then you have to hit it 

1514
01:27:04,081 --> 01:27:07,860
hard.
So that's what I would say.

1515
01:27:07,861 --> 01:27:08,694
But do the future authoring program and 
get yourself a plan and start the 

1516
01:27:11,221 --> 01:27:14,110
implemented in every time you fall 
astray,

1517
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:15,263
then get back at it and you know,
you may have to build up your 

1518
01:27:17,761 --> 01:27:21,040
conscientiousness over a number of years
and,

1519
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:22,470
but it's worth doing.
So

1520
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,030
my favorite Tom,
late song,

1521
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:31,823
I really like cold water.
My son does a vicious version of cold 

1522
01:27:35,131 --> 01:27:36,720
water,
but I really like cold water.

1523
01:27:36,970 --> 01:27:39,270
Um,
what else?

1524
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,760
I like hoists that rag and that's pretty
decent song.

1525
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:51,080
I like dozens of Tom Waits songs are
what else?

1526
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:56,423
I have this mental tick where when 
anyone asks me a question having to do 

1527
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:03,100
with a name names immediately damaged 
from my mind anyways.

1528
01:28:03,101 --> 01:28:06,250
So I really like cold water.
I think that's a great song.

1529
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,813
Is it wrong to turn down a promotion?
Is withdrawing from overwhelming 

1530
01:28:12,431 --> 01:28:13,264
additional responsibility,
the equivalent of ignoring God's called 

1531
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:17,860
Abraham?
Not necessarily.

1532
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:20,080
It depends on what it is that you're 
doing.

1533
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:22,570
Instead,
like if you have a better option,

1534
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:27,340
then take the better option.
If you're afraid,

1535
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:28,683
if it's just fear,
then you might want to find somebody to 

1536
01:28:31,031 --> 01:28:31,864
talk to about that and,
and walk through your fears and make a 

1537
01:28:34,451 --> 01:28:35,284
plan because you know it's possible that
it's the equivalent of ignoring God's 

1538
01:28:38,591 --> 01:28:40,550
called Abraham.
Um,

1539
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,583
you know,
if it's,

1540
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:44,170
if it's pure fear,
then I would take a look at that.

1541
01:28:44,530 --> 01:28:46,300
But if you have a better option,
well,

1542
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:47,163
you know,
it's up to you to decide the course of 

1543
01:28:48,881 --> 01:28:50,980
your life.
So I wouldn't say that necessarily.

1544
01:28:50,981 --> 01:28:52,480
It's a bad thing,
you know,

1545
01:28:52,481 --> 01:28:53,314
not everyone wants overwhelming 
responsibility at work and people are 

1546
01:28:57,671 --> 01:28:58,504
interested in their private lives and 
they're interested in their friendships 

1547
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,760
or their or what they do outside of 
work.

1548
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,190
So.
And I think that's all valid,

1549
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:09,150
but if it's just fear,
then you need to find someone to talk to

1550
01:29:09,151 --> 01:29:09,984
and talk it through to make sure that 
you're not throwing away an opportunity 

1551
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:13,470
that hey,
you know,

1552
01:29:13,471 --> 01:29:15,600
the other thing too is that,
you know,

1553
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,780
what's your mood like?
Are you depressed?

1554
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,770
Like maybe you're underestimating your 
ability.

1555
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,870
Somebody thinks you're worthy of 
promotion.

1556
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:24,870
And you have to remember too that when 
you get promoted,

1557
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:29,871
like almost everybody feels like an 
imposter for the first year when they're

1558
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:32,940
promoted to a new position because you 
don't know what the hell you're doing.

1559
01:29:33,330 --> 01:29:34,130
You know,
so you're,

1560
01:29:34,130 --> 01:29:37,770
you're kind of acting out the role 
before you're qualified to do it.

1561
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:38,970
But that's okay.
You know,

1562
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:40,260
it's,
it's,

1563
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:44,640
it takes awhile to fit into a new skin.
So if you're a perfectionistic,

1564
01:29:44,641 --> 01:29:46,410
that's another thing to take into 
account.

1565
01:29:46,411 --> 01:29:47,244
So,

1566
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,273
all right,

1567
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:03,143
I'm not very religious,
but your way of presenting the biblical 

1568
01:30:04,951 --> 01:30:07,800
stories have given me a respect for 
their function in society.

1569
01:30:07,801 --> 01:30:12,330
How do I address those who actively 
oppose the wisdom on atheist principles?

1570
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:15,171
Well,
look,

1571
01:30:15,171 --> 01:30:16,004
I think what you do is you say what 
you've found carefully and if they 

1572
01:30:21,591 --> 01:30:24,980
refuse to listen and just like put up an
impenetrable wall,

1573
01:30:24,981 --> 01:30:27,650
then you shut the hell up and go find 
someone else to talk to.

1574
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,513
You know,
that's the doctrine behind norb casting 

1575
01:30:30,621 --> 01:30:32,120
pearls before swine.
There's,

1576
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,023
there's a good rule,
which is if you're not being listened 

1577
01:30:35,571 --> 01:30:36,404
to,
then shut up because you're not where 

1578
01:30:37,671 --> 01:30:38,504
you think you are.
There's something going on that you 

1579
01:30:40,491 --> 01:30:41,324
haven't put your finger on.
You're not in the place that you think 

1580
01:30:43,911 --> 01:30:44,744
you're in.
And so you could also turn from 

1581
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,360
convincing to questioning,
you know,

1582
01:30:50,361 --> 01:30:54,200
if someone's very,
very set in their views,

1583
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:55,034
instead of opposing them,
you can ask them to elucidate their 

1584
01:30:57,291 --> 01:30:59,600
views and you can use that questioning 
process.

1585
01:30:59,601 --> 01:31:04,490
It's like a socratic dialogue to dig 
into their fundamental principles.

1586
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:07,640
And sometime that's a good way of 
opening up a space for dialogue.

1587
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:08,983
So

1588
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:16,210
what do you make of the gnostic gospels,
for example,

1589
01:31:16,211 --> 01:31:17,740
the Gospel of Thomas?
Well,

1590
01:31:17,741 --> 01:31:20,980
I've read the Gospel of Thomas and I 
think it's a remarkable document.

1591
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,700
There are things in it that are 
extraordinarily powerful.

1592
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:26,500
Uh,
I closed maps of meaning,

1593
01:31:26,501 --> 01:31:28,840
in fact,
the book I wrote in Nineteen Ninety nine

1594
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,020
with a quotation from the gospel of 
Thomas,

1595
01:31:32,021 --> 01:31:34,810
and it's really interesting too that the
first person you go to,

1596
01:31:34,811 --> 01:31:35,644
his hands on that Gospel was Carl Young,
which I think is an amazing example of 

1597
01:31:39,011 --> 01:31:39,940
synchronicity,
right?

1598
01:31:39,941 --> 01:31:40,774
The first of the gnostic gospels that 
was released into the broader world 

1599
01:31:45,971 --> 01:31:49,810
ended up in Carl Jung's hands.
Absolutely amazing historical fact.

1600
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:51,123
So
they seem to be to be extraordinarily 

1601
01:31:54,161 --> 01:31:54,994
interesting.

1602
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:56,893
Um,

1603
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:00,430
and I read them,
I suppose in some ways the same way that

1604
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:01,264
I read the Canonical Bible.
I'm trying to extract out what wisdom 

1605
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:07,720
there is in them or what wisdom I can 
understand anyways and utilize it to the

1606
01:32:07,721 --> 01:32:09,580
degree that I can.
So

1607
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:14,013
in one of your videos,
you mentioned about the power that 

1608
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:16,744
creates order from chaos,
but can also create chaos from 

1609
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:22,000
pathological ordered.
Can you expand and explaining the latter

1610
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:22,920
one?
Well,

1611
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,093
the logo logos,
that's the human capacity for 

1612
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:27,900
consciousness and,
and uh,

1613
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,990
and communication and awareness.
And I think that it's,

1614
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:32,853
it's actually the,
it's actually one of the fundamental 

1615
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,380
prerequisites for being itself,
right,

1616
01:32:37,450 --> 01:32:40,930
which is one of the things that makes me
different from a standard materialist I,

1617
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,260
I don't believe that there can be being 
without consciousness.

1618
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:48,820
And so I think of consciousness as a 
primary element of well of reality.

1619
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:52,300
It's irreducible element of reality,
something like that,

1620
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,180
a prerequisite for reality.
That's another way of thinking about.

1621
01:32:56,260 --> 01:32:58,540
And that's the logo.
So essentially,

1622
01:32:59,470 --> 01:33:00,303
and it's respect for the logo.
So I would say that's the deepest 

1623
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:05,110
doctrine of the,
of the biblical stories.

1624
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:08,230
Now,
what is the logos do?

1625
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:09,153
Well,
you can see this in Christ story most 

1626
01:33:12,491 --> 01:33:15,280
particularly.
So Christ is often presented as a social

1627
01:33:15,281 --> 01:33:17,680
revolutionary.
All cast,

1628
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:21,850
I suppose,
in the same mold as Moses,

1629
01:33:21,850 --> 01:33:24,990
Moses,
Moses opposed the Egyptian tyranny,

1630
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,780
like Christ opposed the tyranny of the 
Pharisees and the scribes.

1631
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,550
And Moses produced tales as a 
consequence of opposing the tyranny,

1632
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,393
right?
He first chaos was the crossing of the 

1633
01:33:37,991 --> 01:33:38,824
water and Moses was a master of water.
And that's the same symbolically as 

1634
01:33:41,711 --> 01:33:42,544
being a master of chaos.
But after he freed the Hebrews from the 

1635
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:47,074
Egyptian tyranny,
while they entered a period that was 40 

1636
01:33:49,661 --> 01:33:50,494
years long,
so the story goes of almost on almost 

1637
01:33:53,381 --> 01:33:54,580
complete chaos,
right?

1638
01:33:54,581 --> 01:33:58,270
Abandonment in a desert,
tremendous moral confusion,

1639
01:33:58,271 --> 01:33:59,104
lack of direction and purpose.
And so sometimes the hero is the person 

1640
01:34:02,531 --> 01:34:06,490
who makes order out of chaos.
But sometimes the hero is the person who

1641
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:10,810
makes intermediary chaos out of an order
that's become too tyrannical.

1642
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:12,213
And so it's,
it's best to think of the logo says the 

1643
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:15,574
forest that keeps order and chaos in 
balance rather than transform rather 

1644
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:23,450
than generating order out of chaos or 
chaos on the border because it did.

1645
01:34:23,650 --> 01:34:28,120
The logos operates to do one of those 
two things depending on the situation.

1646
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:29,463
And so it's frequently generating order 
out of chaos because there's plenty of 

1647
01:34:32,951 --> 01:34:35,020
chaos.
But there's also plenty of tyranny,

1648
01:34:35,021 --> 01:34:38,620
in which case the hero or the person who
embodies the logos is,

1649
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,813
is,
is struggling to destroy the tyrannical 

1650
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,850
king and replace him with someone that's
more,

1651
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:46,883
um,
it's playing a more reciprocal and 

1652
01:34:49,211 --> 01:34:51,850
property negotiated game.
So,

1653
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,430
all right,
everyone,

1654
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,073
I'll answer like two more I would say.
And then I have to stop because I'm 

1655
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,090
getting fuzzy minded.
So

1656
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:07,310
to what extent do you think your tips 
for young people clean your room,

1657
01:35:07,311 --> 01:35:08,144
make a schedule,
read great books are predicated on your 

1658
01:35:10,011 --> 01:35:12,410
own personality?
Well,

1659
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:15,770
I think they're predicated on my 
personality to some degree.

1660
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:16,623
Um,
I think that a lot of my 

1661
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:21,140
conscientiousness such as it is,
has been learned.

1662
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:24,410
I think I disciplined myself 
particularly in graduate school.

1663
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:29,411
So I don't think it was necessarily an 
intrinsic part of my personality.

1664
01:35:29,421 --> 01:35:30,254
I think it's something that I learned to
do because I felt that I had something 

1665
01:35:32,721 --> 01:35:34,910
that was worthwhile to do.
So

1666
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:42,010
it's very difficult to answer it beyond 
that because,

1667
01:35:42,011 --> 01:35:42,844
you know,
I am affected by my own personality 

1668
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:45,604
obviously.
Although I think that I give advice 

1669
01:35:47,831 --> 01:35:50,170
that's pretty balanced across all the 
dimensions,

1670
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:51,004
you know,
like I think that you should be capable 

1671
01:35:53,261 --> 01:35:54,094
of speaking in public fluently and that 
you should be able to communicate with 

1672
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:00,124
groups of people.
I think that you should be able to be 

1673
01:36:01,421 --> 01:36:02,254
solitary and work on your own.
So that covers extroversion and 

1674
01:36:04,541 --> 01:36:05,374
introversion.
I think that working on control of 

1675
01:36:08,230 --> 01:36:10,430
negative emotion is important.
Um,

1676
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:11,673
and so that's partly dealing with 
anxiety and stress and that's the 

1677
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:14,944
neuroticism dimension.
I think that you should be agreeable 

1678
01:36:17,621 --> 01:36:20,620
when it's necessary and disagreeable 
when it's necessary.

1679
01:36:20,621 --> 01:36:23,590
And so that's a broadening alone.
The agreeableness dimension.

1680
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:24,813
I think that discipline is really 
important in a complex society like 

1681
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:30,640
ours.
Discipline is extremely important and so

1682
01:36:30,641 --> 01:36:31,474
I think that being able to be 
conscientious and reliable and orderly 

1683
01:36:34,721 --> 01:36:35,554
to some degree is necessary,
but that you should be able to withdraw 

1684
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:42,490
from that when necessary so that you can
take a break and have some fun.

1685
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:43,873
Um,
I think you could risk becoming over 

1686
01:36:46,211 --> 01:36:48,280
committed to your work or two year 
endeavor.

1687
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:50,860
So I do think that that's something that
I risk

1688
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:55,270
maybe I trained myself to be too 
industrious.

1689
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:57,190
It's certainly possible,
um,

1690
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,473
openness.
Well that might be a place where I have 

1691
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,800
a personality predicated blind spot 
because I'm very,

1692
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:10,180
very high in openness and,
but I do believe that there's utility in

1693
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:13,450
exposing yourself to the world of great 
ideas.

1694
01:37:13,451 --> 01:37:15,480
And that's not for everyone,
you know,

1695
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,333
I mean there are people who are 
fundamentally conservative in their 

1696
01:37:18,851 --> 01:37:21,730
orientation and more power to them I 
suppose.

1697
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:22,593
But um,
if you're going to read then you should 

1698
01:37:25,091 --> 01:37:28,750
read great things and if you're 
interested in the life of the intellect,

1699
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:29,613
the philosophical life,
then then there's much to be learned by 

1700
01:37:32,231 --> 01:37:33,670
reading great books.
So.

1701
01:37:34,240 --> 01:37:35,073
So I don't think that I'm overwhelmingly
biased with regards to my own 

1702
01:37:39,401 --> 01:37:41,080
personality,
but you never know.

1703
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:42,430
I mean,
it's hard.

1704
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,323
It's hard for.
It's hard for someone to judge that 

1705
01:37:46,721 --> 01:37:48,820
about themselves.
So

1706
01:38:17,570 --> 01:38:18,403
can one reason with a stalker.
My Stalker is highly intelligent and 

1707
01:38:21,651 --> 01:38:23,360
rational.
Making him scarier.

1708
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,400
I'm beginning to work with police and 
lawyers.

1709
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:27,590
But wondering if you have experienced in
this realm,

1710
01:38:29,270 --> 01:38:30,470
I would say

1711
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:34,620
not knowing the specifics of your 
situation.

1712
01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:36,023
No,
you can't really reason with the 

1713
01:38:37,441 --> 01:38:38,274
stocker.
The stocker is already gone beyond the 

1714
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,750
realm of normal social behavior,
you know,

1715
01:38:45,751 --> 01:38:46,584
and I would say with most stockers,
assuming that you're dealing with the 

1716
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:53,010
genuine article,
that they tend to be a little bit on the

1717
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,810
paranoid side or maybe a lot on the 
paranoid side.

1718
01:38:55,811 --> 01:38:56,644
And the problem with people who are 
paranoid is that they have adopted a 

1719
01:39:00,841 --> 01:39:05,430
couple of axioms as absolutely fixed and
there's no shifting them.

1720
01:39:05,431 --> 01:39:09,310
So I would say,
you know,

1721
01:39:09,311 --> 01:39:11,620
I hate to give advice in a situation 
like that,

1722
01:39:11,621 --> 01:39:16,621
but I wouldn't say that the probability 
of using reason is precluded by the fact

1723
01:39:17,981 --> 01:39:20,680
of the stalking behavior.
So good luck with it.

1724
01:39:20,681 --> 01:39:21,910
That's very scary.
It's hard.

1725
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:22,744
It's hard for people to be protected 
from someone who's intent on following 

1726
01:39:26,681 --> 01:39:29,770
them and perhaps making their life 
miserable.

1727
01:39:30,430 --> 01:39:31,263
So

1728
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:36,033
insights on how I would overcome or live
with my fear of Nellis and 

1729
01:39:38,801 --> 01:39:40,960
disappointment in Matt,
Mike,

1730
01:39:40,961 --> 01:39:42,490
the novel.
Well,

1731
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:44,680
here's something that you might 
consider.

1732
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,023
So when you're a child and you're naive,
then you trust people because you're 

1733
01:39:49,241 --> 01:39:50,074
naive and you don't know any better and 
you don't know that people can hurt you 

1734
01:39:52,571 --> 01:39:55,750
unless you're a very unfortunate child.
So your,

1735
01:39:55,960 --> 01:40:00,960
your trust isn't a virtue.
It's just a sign of your innocence,

1736
01:40:00,971 --> 01:40:01,804
let's say.
And that kind of innocence isn't a 

1737
01:40:03,701 --> 01:40:05,500
virtue,
it's just lack of experience.

1738
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:06,850
But when you're older,
Mike,

1739
01:40:07,390 --> 01:40:11,170
courage or trust isn't,
is a hallmark of courage.

1740
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:15,700
You extend your hand to people and you 
extend your trust to people knowing full

1741
01:40:15,701 --> 01:40:19,180
well that you can be bit like you might 
be bitten by a Cobra,

1742
01:40:19,181 --> 01:40:21,910
you can be betrayed and disappointed by 
people,

1743
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:26,080
but you extend your hand in trust 
because of courage,

1744
01:40:26,081 --> 01:40:29,890
because you decide to take the risk and 
by taking that risk,

1745
01:40:29,891 --> 01:40:32,680
you open the door to the best in people 
and,

1746
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,580
but you won't see that door open unless 
you first take the step to trust.

1747
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:41,970
And so I would say you have to practice
trusting people.

1748
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,113
You know,
you have to share things that are 

1749
01:40:46,871 --> 01:40:47,704
somewhat private.
You have to ask people for small favors 

1750
01:40:50,651 --> 01:40:51,484
and trade small favors and you have to 
that knowing full well that you can get 

1751
01:40:54,941 --> 01:40:55,774
hurt.
So think about it as an act of courage 

1752
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,160
instead of,
um,

1753
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:02,020
instead of naivety or,

1754
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:02,750
or,
or,

1755
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,950
or,
or,

1756
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:05,233
or,

1757
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,400
well,
instead of naive t,

1758
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:10,310
let's leave it at that.
So that's what I would recommend.

1759
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:17,090
All right everyone,
I'm going to stop.

1760
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:18,493
So once again,
thank you very much for listening to me 

1761
01:41:22,791 --> 01:41:24,650
tonight.
I hope that it went well.

1762
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:28,520
Um,
I can never tell when I'm doing this,

1763
01:41:28,521 --> 01:41:32,390
but they seem to be popular.
I'm very pleased that you all

1764
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,890
spend so much time putting these 
questions together and,

1765
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,800
and watching my videos and listening to 
me,

1766
01:41:39,801 --> 01:41:44,540
I,
I'm genuinely and continually amazed and

1767
01:41:44,541 --> 01:41:46,610
grateful about that.
So,

1768
01:41:46,611 --> 01:41:47,444
um,
I hope you all have a good month and 

1769
01:41:49,521 --> 01:41:54,521
that you continue working as hard as you
can on putting yourself together because

1770
01:41:55,310 --> 01:41:56,143
the more together people there are,
the better things are going to go for 

1771
01:41:58,851 --> 01:42:00,950
everyone.
And it's very important,

1772
01:42:00,951 --> 01:42:01,784
as I pointed out before,
that you get your individual life in 

1773
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:09,671
order.
So good night everyone and uh,

1774
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:13,730
keep up the good work man.
See Ya.
