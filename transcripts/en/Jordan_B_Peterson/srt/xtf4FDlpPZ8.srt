1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,210
Well,
I have a question.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:04,943
I guess I'd like to know a little bit 
more about why you specifically chose 

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,650
the title,
the master and the emissary.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
Yeah.
That,

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,533
that's uh,
an attempt to explain what I believe to 

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,140
be the relationship if he needs and 
habits,

7
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,440
fears,
um,

8
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,510
that like most other things in life,
the in equal and asymmetrical and one of

9
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,540
the brain hemispheres sees more than the
other.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,010
That is the one that I've designated the
master and it was the right hemisphere.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,013
That's a weird inversion because people 
often think of the left hemisphere is 

12
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,400
the one that's dominant.
They do,

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,320
they do.
Traditionally that's been the case.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,330
Uh,
but um,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,600
as is becoming ever clearer,
the right hemisphere,

16
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,470
this has been a real steep learning 
curve for some people,

17
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,573
but the,
the right hemisphere is in many ways 

18
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:58,140
more reliable,
sees more,

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,210
understands more than the left 
hemisphere,

20
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,120
which is like a sort of high functioning
bureaucrat.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,953
In a way.
The idea of the story was simply that 

22
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:10,200
certain matters needed to be delegated 
not to only because as it were,

23
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:11,034
the master couldn't do everything.
He needed an emissary to go abroad and 

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,783
do some of it,
but also that he must not get involved 

25
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,623
with a certain point of view.
Otherwise he'd lose what it was if you 

26
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,194
did see.
So that's what I'm really saying there 

27
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,020
is,
there was a good reason why evolution,

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,740
really speaking,
the two brain hemispheres are separate.

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,960
And when you see it doesn't get 
involved,

30
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,600
what's the advantage of,
of that,

31
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,200
that detachment from the involvement?
Well,

32
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,770
it's that,
um,

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,450
Ramonica Hall who you know,
is a great histopathologist.

34
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,590
Yep.
Um,

35
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,493
one of his findings was in primates are 
more inhibitory neurons and then any 

36
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:56,910
other animals.
And there are more in humans than in any

37
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,840
other primate.
And um,

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,220
there are many more being in 
proportionally,

39
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,800
proportionately,
and there are more kinds as well.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,980
So we think that about 25% of the 
entire,

41
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,380
um,
cortex is,

42
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,860
is inhibitory,
right?

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,150
So it's a very strong effect.
And the Corpus callosum seems to be very

44
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:22,590
largely in the end inhabiting function 
in the other hemisphere.

45
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,030
And that is,
I think,

46
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:28,350
because over time the two hemispheres of
had to specialize.

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,600
There are reasons why actually it can't 
be,

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,003
I'm not going to go into now,
but I was talking about just a few days 

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,663
ago.
That'd be evolutionary sake cacciatore 

50
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,423
meeting.
But there are reasons way the Corpus 

51
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:41,004
callosum has had to become more 
selective and to inhibit quite a lot of 

52
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
what's going on in the other hemisphere 
because it enables the two to do 

53
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,064
distinct things.
And of course they have to work 

54
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,394
together.
But usually good teamwork doesn't mean 

55
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:59,770
everyone trained to do the same row.
So differentiation is very important for

56
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:04,180
two elements to work together.
And inhibition is one way of doing that.

57
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,930
So effectively the two takes on the 
world if you like,

58
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,190
that the hemispheres have,
are not easily compatible.

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,150
Um,
and we're not aware of that because at a

60
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:16,984
level below consciousness,
there's a metric control center that is 

61
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:22,480
bringing them together.
So in ordinary experience,

62
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,670
we don't feel we're in two different 
worlds,

63
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,504
but effectively we are.
And they have different qualities and 

64
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,170
different goals,
different values,

65
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,004
different,
different takes on what is important in 

66
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,270
the,
in the world.

67
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,373
And what meeting,

68
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,890
let me ask you about,
I,

69
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:41,960
I've got,
I've developed a conceptual scheme for,

70
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,340
for thinking about the relationship 
between the two hemispheres and I'm kind

71
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,183
of,
I've been curious about what you think 

72
00:03:47,481 --> 00:03:51,260
about it and how it might map on to or 
not you're your ideas.

73
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,100
So I've been really interested in the 
orienting reflex and discovered by socal

74
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:58,160
off,
I think back in about 1962.

75
00:03:58,161 --> 00:03:58,994
Right?
He was a student of Laureus and the 

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,280
orienting reflexes manifested when 
something,

77
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,100
at least in their terminology is 
something unpredictable happened.

78
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,173
I've thought much more recently did.
It's actually when something undesired 

79
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:16,280
happened happens and the laboratory 
constraints obscured that.

80
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,720
And that turned out to actually be 
important.

81
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:18,990
But,
um,

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,653
so,
and I kind of put together the ideas of 

83
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:22,934
the orienting reflects with some of the 
things I learned from young young's 

84
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,680
observations on the function of art and 
dreams.

85
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,040
So imagine that you have a conceptual 
scheme laid out,

86
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,280
right?
We could say that it's,

87
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:34,460
it's,
it's linguistically mediate,

88
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:38,120
it's enforced on the world.
And then there are exceptions to that,

89
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,770
to that conceptual scheme.
And those are anomalies.

90
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,623
Those are the numbers that are 
unexpected and the orienting reflex 

91
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:44,804
orients you towards those.
And so those are things that aren't 

92
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:50,930
fitting property in your conceptual 
scheme that you have to figure out.

93
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,823
So the first thing you do is react 
defensively essential because it might 

94
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:55,724
be dangerous.
And then your exploratory systems are 

95
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,560
activated.
So,

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,730
and the exploratory systems,
first of all,

97
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:04,580
our enhanced attention from an 
intentional perspective.

98
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,623
But then,
and this is where the art issue sort of 

99
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:08,684
creeps into it.
It's the idea would be something like 

100
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:11,804
the right hemisphere generates an 
imaginative landscape of possibility 

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,003
that could map that a normally.
So you can kind of experience that if 

102
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:19,760
it's at night,
you know,

103
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,430
like say you're sitting alone at night,
it's two or three in the morning,

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,353
you're kind of tired.

105
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,533
Um,
maybe you're in an unfamiliar place and 

106
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,550
there's a noise that happens that 
shouldn't happen in another room.

107
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,500
You can play with that.
So,

108
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,334
for example,
if you open the door slightly and put 

109
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:37,010
your hand in turn on the light and you 
watch what happens,

110
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:37,844
your mind will fill with imaginative 
representations of what might be in the 

111
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:41,750
room,
right?

112
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,250
So it's like the,
the,

113
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,143
the,
the landscape of anomaly will be 

114
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,920
populated with something like 
imaginative demons.

115
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,023
And that's a first pass approximation.
And it seems to me that that's a right 

116
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,564
hemispheric function.
And then that as you explore further 

117
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:58,880
that imaginative domain,
which,

118
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,043
which circumscribes what might be,
is constrained and constrained and 

119
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,404
constrained and constrained until you 
get what it actually is and that 

120
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,480
specialized in routinized.
It's something like that.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,550
Does that seem like a reasonable,
what do you think about that as well

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,850
for a whole host of reasons?
Um,

123
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,013
one is,
you mentioned a defense and one of the 

124
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,993
ideas behind my hypothesis is that the 
right hemisphere is on the lookout for 

125
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,483
predators,
right?

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,670
Whereas the left hemisphere is looking 
for prey.

127
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,150
And this has been confirmed in many 
species,

128
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,210
have never heard that second part,
amphibians and mammals.

129
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes.
Um,

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,940
uh,
so,

131
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,053
so when you're in left hemispheric mode,
you're more in Predator mode and when 

132
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,060
you'd wave home as well,
I mean,

133
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:45,894
of course we are not uh,
lizards or toads or marmosets or 

134
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,330
whatever.
But in animals,

135
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,780
generally speaking,
this is the case getting and grasping.

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,850
And after all our left hemisphere is the
London.

137
00:06:56,851 --> 00:07:01,700
It controls the grasping hand,
his left hemisphere and uh,

138
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,520
exploring which you mentioned is more 
right hemisphere.

139
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,600
And when the,
when a frontal function is deficient,

140
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,680
um,
people often go into sematic mode of the

141
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:18,170
hand of that side and the left hand,
it's usually explorer,

142
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,250
few emotions,
meaningless ones,

143
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,084
but trying to explore the environment 
and with the right hand it's grasping 

144
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,140
pointlessly at things.

145
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,131
So they,
as it were,

146
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:29,550
the automatic thing is with the,
with the left hand,

147
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:31,860
the right hemisphere to explore with the
right hand,

148
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:32,694
the left hemisphere to grasp.
So when you said exploratory and you 

149
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:36,924
said defense,
and you said also opening up to 

150
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:39,624
possibilities,
these are all aspects of the way the 

151
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:41,964
right hemisphere.
I often say the right hemisphere opens 

152
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:45,684
up to possibility,
whereas the left hemisphere wants to 

153
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,030
close down to a certain team and you 
need both chaos,

154
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,660
chaos,
and order.

155
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,990
And you knew I loved him.
In your talk,

156
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,960
you talked about um,
uh,

157
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,794
chaos and order,
but if I may say so you've seemed maybe 

158
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:02,694
you'd like to gloss that a little.
You seem to suggest that it would be 

159
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,540
good,
we can't get rid of chaos,

160
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,120
but you've seemed to imply that it would
be better if we could,

161
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,133
whereas my view is it chaos and order 
unnecessary to one another and there is 

162
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,220
a proper sort of harmony

163
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,290
well balanced.
Well,

164
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,260
yeah.
Well,

165
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:21,270
okay.
That mean I think that's,

166
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,880
that's as deep a question as you could 
possibly ask.

167
00:08:23,881 --> 00:08:24,714
I would say in some sense some of the,
I would say there's a central 

168
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:31,140
theological issue there.
The issue there is the,

169
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,113
you know,
in genesis the proper environment if 

170
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:38,250
humanity is construed as a garden.
And so I see that as the optimal balance

171
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,084
of chaos and order because nature is 
flourishes and it's prolific in his 

172
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:43,524
chaotic,
yeah.

173
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,930
Then if you add harmony to that,
you have the garden.

174
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,090
So you live in the garden,
you're supposed to tend the garden.

175
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,160
Okay,
so now the garden is created.

176
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:53,010
It's a walled space because eden is a 
wallet space.

177
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,960
It's a pair of day side.
So it's a walled garden.

178
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,190
That's it.
Now the thing is,

179
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:59,970
as soon as you make a wall,
you try to keep what's outside out,

180
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,850
but you can't because the boundaries 
between things are permeable.

181
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,940
So if you're going to have reality and 
you're going to have a bounded space,

182
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,290
you're going to have a snake in the 
garden.

183
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,680
Now then the question is,
what the hell should you do about that?

184
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:11,514
Should we make the walls so high that no
snake can possibly get in or should or 

185
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:18,000
should you allow for the possibility of 
snakes,

186
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,460
but make yourself strong enough so that 
you can contend with them?

187
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,943
And I think there's,
there's an answer there that goes deep 

188
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:24,414
to the question of even maybe why 
theological question of why God allowed 

189
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:29,820
evil to exist in the world.
I agree with you.

190
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,290
It's like,
well,

191
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,423
do you make people safe or strong?
And strong is better and safe might not 

192
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,370
be commensurate with being like,
it might not be possible to exist and to

193
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,550
be safe.
Well,

194
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,580
so existence is predicated on the fact 
that we die.

195
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,420
Well was never safe.
Well it's certainly bounded,

196
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,111
right?
Yeah.

197
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:49,944
Yeah.
I mean it's inevitably wrapped up with 

198
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,960
that sort of finitude.
So there's this old,

199
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,680
there's a lovely,
lovely Jewish id and ancient idea.

200
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,910
It's one of the most profound ideas I've
ever come across.

201
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:03,210
And so it's a kind of a Zen Koan and,
and here it is.

202
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,460
Is that,
um,

203
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,800
so it's a question about the classic 
attributes of God,

204
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,300
Omniscient,
omnipresent,

205
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,403
omnipotent.
What is it being with those three 

206
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,490
attributes?
Lock,

207
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,090
what kind of question is that?
The answer is limitation.

208
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,523
And the second answer is that's the 
justification for being is that the 

209
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,080
unlimited lacks the limited.
Exactly.

210
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:27,300
And so because limited is us

211
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,270
for anything to come into existence and 
needs to be an element of resistance.

212
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:36,690
And so things are never predicated on 
one pole of what is always a dipo.

213
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,550
Everything is,
has that,

214
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,170
uh,
diapers.

215
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,790
Yeah,
it's like a prerequisite for being,

216
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,210
it is and it's imaged in the yen,
yen idea.

217
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,283
Um,
but it seems to me very important 

218
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,593
because in our culture we often seem to 
suppose that certain things are just 

219
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,194
good and other things are just about,
it'd be good if we could get rid of the 

220
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,524
bad ones,
but actually my pursuing certain good 

221
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,450
things that are good within measure too 
far,

222
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:02,284
they become bad and so forth.
But let's go back to her and normally 

223
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:09,290
thing because Ramachandran calls the 
right hemisphere the anomaly detection.

224
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,773
And so I think that that's a very 
important point because there are two 

225
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:15,370
ways you can react to an anomaly.

226
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,473
One is two and both have to be explored.
One is to try and prove that it's not 

227
00:11:21,011 --> 00:11:24,490
really an anomaly and therefore you can 
carry on with things as normal.

228
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,780
And the other is hopeful that that's,
that's the,

229
00:11:28,781 --> 00:11:30,690
that's the typical left hemisphere 
approach.

230
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,270
It doesn't want anything to have to 
shift and quite reasonably,

231
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,240
you don't want to be chaotically 
shifting if you're onto a good thing.

232
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:38,480
Too stressful.
Exactly.

233
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,910
That takes too much work.
And you might actually be mistaken.

234
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,380
So in a way it's perfectly correct to be
wary,

235
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,160
but it's not correct to be so wary that 
you blot out anomalies.

236
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,310
And there's a lot of evidence,
as I'm sure you know,

237
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,483
the left hemisphere simply blocks out 
everything that doesn't fit with it's 

238
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,500
cheap.
It doesn't see it actually.

239
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,334
You're tall.
So it's a hugely important element and 

240
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,084
the right hemisphere going hang on.
But the maybe another way of thinking 

241
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:11,170
that will accommodate this better and 
actually good science needs yes.

242
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,870
To be skeptical about anomalies,
otherwise there'd be chaos,

243
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,913
but it also needs to be able to shift.
And when an anomaly is really large 

244
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:19,540
enough,
right,

245
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,340
right.
Quite a lot of them.

246
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,810
And they don't really fit very well 
into.

247
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,080
Exactly,
yes.

248
00:12:24,081 --> 00:12:25,230
Yes.
So there's a,

249
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,930
there's another observation that you 
made,

250
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:28,820
which I loved it.
I loved this observation.

251
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:32,360
He was trying to account for radical 
personality transformation,

252
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,160
right?
And so his idea was this,

253
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:35,060
and I think it's,
it's,

254
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,210
it's commensurate with the ideas of 
inhibition between the two hemispheres.

255
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,313
So let's imagine the left is habitually 
inhibiting the function of the right to 

256
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,440
keep fear under control.
It does that all sorts of ways,

257
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:46,274
but so imagine that the right is I'm 
reacting to anomalies and it's 

258
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:53,120
aggregating them.
Okay.

259
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:53,954
The left camp deal with them.
So the right is aggregating anomalies 

260
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,940
and maybe that's starting to manifest 
itself in nightmarish dreams.

261
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,100
For example.
It's like all these anomalies are piling

262
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:01,934
up.
It's indication that you're on shifting 

263
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,214
sound.
Also then imagine that the right 

264
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:09,520
hemisphere aggregates normally is and 
then it starts to detect patterns in the

265
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,354
anomalies and so now it starts to 
generate what you might consider a 

266
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,190
counter hypothesis to the left type 
offices.

267
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,333
If that counter or hypothesis gets to 
the point where the total sum in some 

268
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:21,644
sense of the anomalies plus the already 
mapped territory can be mapped by that 

269
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,700
new pattern,
then at some point it will shift and the

270
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:31,310
person will kick into a new personality 
consideration.

271
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,520
It's like a Piagetian stage transition 
except more dramatic.

272
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,533
It is.
And what a Ph [inaudible] stage 

273
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,560
physician is also like and subsumes both
is he galean uh oh fable.

274
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,500
The idea that,
um,

275
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,160
uh,
thing is opposed by something else,

276
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,770
but when it,
when there is a synthesis,

277
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,080
it's not that one of them is an 
isolated,

278
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,530
they're both transformed and taken up 
into the new hoe,

279
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,543
which embraces

280
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,170
before look like look like an 
opposition.

281
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,540
Here's a question for you.
You know,

282
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,813
when I read Thomas Kuhn and I was 
reading top piaget at the same time and 

283
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:10,380
I knew that piaget was aware of Kuhn's 
work by the way end.

284
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,963
The problem I had with Kuehne and the 
interpretation interpreters of coon is 

285
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,600
they don't seem to get something who,
who,

286
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,190
who interpret Kuhn has a moral 
relativist in some sense.

287
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,213
They don't seem to get the idea of um,
increased generalized ability of a 

288
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:29,700
plant.
So let's say I have a theory and a bunch

289
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:30,534
of anomalies,
a crew and I have to wipe out the 

290
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:32,334
theory.
And so then I wipe out the theory and I 

291
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,970
incorporate the anomalies and now I have
another theory.

292
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,700
So that's a descent into chaos.
That's my estimation.

293
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:41,430
That's the old story.
So the anomaly,

294
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,283
yeah,
disruption is the mythical descend into 

295
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:44,604
chaos.
And then you reconfigure this theory 

296
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,650
with the chaos and you come up with a 
better theory.

297
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,813
Okay,
the question,

298
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,883
why is it better?
And the answer is what accounts for 

299
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:56,600
everything that the previous theory,
accountants plus the anomalies.

300
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,790
So there's progress.
Yes,

301
00:14:58,791 --> 00:14:59,624
exactly.
And but coon is often read is stating 

302
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,210
that there is no progress that you know 
there's incommensurate paradigms and you

303
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,670
have to just shift between them.
But there isn't,

304
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,920
there isn't cumulative knowledge in some
sense.

305
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,853
Well I think one thing that when we 
probably would both agree about is that 

306
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:14,934
we don't buy the story that you need 
because nothing can be demonstrated 

307
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,050
definitively,
utterly to be the case.

308
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,093
There is no truth.
I mean I think we both believe that 

309
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:28,944
there are truths,
things that are true or than other 

310
00:15:30,481 --> 00:15:31,770
things.
And indeed,

311
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,960
if we're where we couldn't even talk and
we,

312
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,813
if we did,
and even to say that there are no truth 

313
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,110
is itself a truth statement,
which is,

314
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,993
it's truer than the statement.
There are truths so everybody 

315
00:15:44,281 --> 00:15:46,830
automatically has truth whether they 
know it or not.

316
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,470
Yeah.
Just because you were you,

317
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,280
you said why?
I don't think,

318
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:54,190
it's not only that you can't talk,
you can't even see no,

319
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,024
cause you don't know how to,

320
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,060
you wouldn't know how to discriminate 
what coming into your brain.

321
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,770
So it's inevitable.
Um,

322
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,790
uh,
I think we would agree about that,

323
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,624
but I think that there's maybe a slight 
point of difference between us in the 

324
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:10,860
time I'm very willing to,
uh,

325
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,640
embrace the idea of uncertainty.
And I,

326
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,040
I maybe wrong,
perhaps you could expand on that,

327
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,840
but sometimes you come across as,
as a man who has certainties that

328
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,510
well,
it's a peculiar kind of certainty.

329
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm certain that standing on the border 
between order and chaos is a good idea.

330
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,020
That's a weird,
exactly.

331
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
Exactly.
Yeah.

332
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:34,154
Yeah.
Now you need to be in the sort of 

333
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:37,080
slightly unstable position.
Yes.

334
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,770
You have to.
How do you have to be,

335
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,550
um,
what would you say?

336
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,170
Encountering as much uncertainty as you 
can voluntarily tolerate?

337
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,043
Yeah,
but I think that's equivalent to 

338
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,414
Vygotsky's zone of proximal development.
So when we talked a little bit earlier 

339
00:16:51,081 --> 00:16:52,970
about the idea of an instinct for 
meaning.

340
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,100
So I think what meaning is,
it's,

341
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:55,934
it's,
it's the elaborated form of the 

342
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:01,280
orienting reflex,
but what meaning does its function,

343
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:04,220
its biological function,
which I think is more real in some sense

344
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,054
than any other biological function is to
tell you when you're in the place where 

345
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,613
you've balanced the stability,
let's say of your left hemisphere 

346
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:15,230
systems with the exploratory capacity of
your right.

347
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,230
So that not only are you master of your 
domain,

348
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,730
but you're expanding that domain 
simultaneously.

349
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,883
And when you,
I think that when you're there and it's 

350
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,080
a,
it's a,

351
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,913
it's a kind of a metaphysical place in 
some sense that you're imbued with a 

352
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:28,934
sense of meaning and purpose.
And that's an indication that you've 

353
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:32,840
actually optimized your neurological 
function.

354
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,600
Yes.
And the pimps,

355
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:37,570
we could gloss the idea of purpose 
because I think there's

356
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,670
a difference between,
people get very confused.

357
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,740
I think about the idea of purpose,
particularly

358
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,133
whether there's a problem that 
suggesting there is a purpose and I 

359
00:17:53,161 --> 00:17:56,670
believe there is a purpose or they're,
our purpose is to the cosmos.

360
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:01,671
Not just to me and suggest that somehow 
it's all been predetermined by God.

361
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,060
But this is to misunderstand the nature 
of time,

362
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:06,894
that there are time static slices and 
God is there and he's sorted it all out 

363
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,524
and the whole thing is just unfolding as
Bergson says like ladies fan being 

364
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:16,050
unfurled.
It was extremely boring and,

365
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:16,770
and,
and,

366
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,810
and an entirely static and noncreative 
universe.

367
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,280
But actually something is at stake.
Things are unfolding.

368
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,630
They have overall a direction,
but actually exactly what that direction

369
00:18:27,631 --> 00:18:32,220
is isn't known.
And I know it's a fool who says anything

370
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,054
positive about the nature of God,
but I'm not convinced that God is 

371
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,300
omniscient and omnipotent either.

372
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,330
I think God is in the process of is 
becoming,

373
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,530
God is not only just becoming but is 
becoming family.

374
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,710
So being and becoming more,
becoming,

375
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,443
becoming as important thing.
Why do you think that it's also a 

376
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:57,060
strange segue,
I mean I'm not criticizing,

377
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:59,280
but I'm curious what,
what drove you to that conclusion?

378
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,280
An awful lot of thing is really,
um,

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,330
I think that everything is,
is a process.

380
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,010
In fact,
I'm writing a book called,

381
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,844
there are no things,
there are processes and there are 

382
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,130
patterns.
That's why I think music is so powerful.

383
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,053
Music is one of the most mysterious and 
wonderful things in the universe and I 

384
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,250
didn't think it was a tool foolish of 
people to have thought that the,

385
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,120
you know,
plan a few motions were in a song.

386
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,510
No,
no,

387
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,171
no.
It's great.

388
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,840
It's the kind of music,
I think it is a very important insight.

389
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,623
Music,
you know I've said this in public 

390
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,900
lectures that music is the most 
representative of the arts

391
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,420
and music describes how those parents 
should be arranged.

392
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:47,280
You're using representative in a very 
different way.

393
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:54,070
It depends on what you mean by
representing the ultimate reality of the

394
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,130
cosmos.
Well I would like to say presented in or

395
00:19:57,131 --> 00:19:57,964
that it's not representing anything.
It is actually when we're in the 

396
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:03,330
presence of music,
something is coming into being,

397
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:07,020
which is,
which is at the core of the whole cosmic

398
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:10,140
process.
I think that's why people love music.

399
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,003
I,
they do and I mean I just hardly any 

400
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:16,230
originality in the idea cause lots of 
visitors say this,

401
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,333
that the sort of the movement of atoms 
and the movement of planets and so 

402
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:22,480
forth,
uh,

403
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,210
are more like a dance or more music than
they are like things bumping in track.

404
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,810
Right,
right,

405
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,643
right.
Um,

406
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,513
so uh,
kind of things as patterns that people 

407
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:32,994
have made into tools.
I agree with you and tools and what the 

408
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,920
left hand is who is always looking for.
It's always looking for something new to

409
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:42,030
grasp it.
Ray phase processes that if you,

410
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,953
it's all a matter of time.
Every single thing including the 

411
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:47,980
mountain behind my house,
if you able to,

412
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,700
which is billions of years old,
if you were able to take,

413
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,870
as it were a series of like a time lapse
camera,

414
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,750
you'd see the thing morphing and 
changing and flowing.

415
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,170
Everything flows as eric takes is one 
second.

416
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,573
Everything flows.
It's just a question of over the time 

417
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,320
period that you consider it.
It's a question of the time.

418
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,593
And so taking time out of things and 
considering them in the abstract you 

419
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:14,164
resonated from context,
particularly from the flow and from the 

420
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,850
context of time changes them into 
something else.

421
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,800
And I think that what,
uh,

422
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:21,723
in brief what Plato has done and what a 
lot of the history of more recent 

423
00:21:24,941 --> 00:21:29,941
Christianity has done is two things,
defy God and have an perfect states that

424
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:34,830
are unaltered and torn.
And I think that it is an ever,

425
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,303
ever more wonderfully self
self exploring self actualizing process 

426
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,453
that requires a degree of opposition as 
a stream in order to have the movements 

427
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,320
and the,
and the,

428
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,810
the,
the ideas and patterns in it.

429
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,460
It has to be constrained deck

430
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,773
when I've experienced want,
it's hard to describe these experiences 

431
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,530
but when I've contemplated death deeply,
it's his struck me as a,

432
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,220
as a fundamental repair mechanism.
Like it's part of the mechanism by which

433
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:11,120
new things that are better are brought 
into being.

434
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,013
Absolutely.
And I mean you see that in your own 

435
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:16,840
being because of course without death 
you couldn't live because you're dying.

436
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,763
The things about you that aren't right,
even at a physiological level are dying 

437
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,300
all the time.
They are unfortunately,

438
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,134
you also completely die,
which used to be a bit of the 

439
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:28,480
unfortunate side but more cosmically 
speaking.

440
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:33,250
It does seem to me that death is the is
I dunno man,

441
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,310
I s it's,
I've had intuitions are intimations that

442
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:39,220
death is the friend of being and that's 
like,

443
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:41,330
it's hard to get my head around that.
Pete,

444
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,240
do you agree with you and indeed that's 
being said by the many,

445
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,320
many ways of people then than myself and
maybe even the yourself.

446
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,670
No,
but I mean I think that that's right,

447
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:54,504
that death is predicated on life,
but also that it shouldn't be seen as a 

448
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,480
sort of something that's the negative.
It's,

449
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,200
it's a necessary stage in the process of
being,

450
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:12,150
becoming what it is and since everything
is ramified since nothing,

451
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,830
it's just isolated.
You and I may look or feel as though,

452
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
but as you often eloquently say,
we all have the history and we,

453
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,820
we have in time,
we come from a place,

454
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:26,220
but also as a culture,
we have history.

455
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:29,430
We can't detach ourselves from it were 
expressions of it,

456
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,473
but we're also inevitably dependent as 
all organisms are on the environment 

457
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:37,550
where I end and where the quote 
environment begins is,

458
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,384
uh,
I didn't like the word environment 

459
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,283
nature,
which would suggest something that's 

460
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,170
always been born whereas environments 
around me from which I'm separate.

461
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,320
But anyway,
all of that is connected supposed to.

462
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,273
Yes.
Yes.

463
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,233
So I would see us as like an idiot in a 
stream or like a wave in the seed that 

464
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:59,231
he was never separate
the coming together of physics with,

465
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,220
with this,
with a process philosophy,

466
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,360
a very strong,
when does that book come out?

467
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,700
When I finished writing
and I'm very worried that um,

468
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,160
it's getting bigger and is,
you know,

469
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:13,994
all the time I'm writing it,
I'm seeing more and more of things that 

470
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:20,120
I am really must get to know more about.
It's an ever receding.

471
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,250
Um,
well it's a danger of a book that I know

472
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,203
that aims at something fundamental 
because every run you never hit the 

473
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,520
proper boundaries as it,
I need that war.

474
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,913
I also had experiences,
I would say when I was trying to 

475
00:24:36,711 --> 00:24:38,780
understand as they're imaginative 
experiences,

476
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:41,750
when I was trying to understand,
let's say the necessity of evil.

477
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,973
No,
because that's also a fundamental 

478
00:24:44,331 --> 00:24:47,360
theological conundrum and a metaphysical
conundrum.

479
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,180
How,
why isn't that being as constituted such

480
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:52,010
that evil is allowed to exist,
right?

481
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,390
It's Ivan Carrabba's Arvs.
What critique of our valley,

482
00:24:56,391 --> 00:25:00,650
Osha's Christianity essentially what 
kind of God would allow for this sort of

483
00:25:00,651 --> 00:25:02,080
thing.
The ancient question.

484
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,650
Yeah,
it's an ancient question and I mean,

485
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,720
part of what I thought,
what I've,

486
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,330
I mean I thought about the adversarial 
element to that,

487
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,700
which is that you need to challenge 
because you don't,

488
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,683
you're not forced to bring forth what 
you could bring forth without a 

489
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:17,810
challenge and the greater the thing that
you're supposed to bring forth,

490
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,600
the greater of the challenge has to be 
so you need an adversary,

491
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,523
something like that.

492
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,800
But then I also thought that it would,
it's possible that that,

493
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,063
that being being requires limitation.
You might say optimal being requires 

494
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,510
sprite,
free choice.

495
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,130
I know I'm going through a lot of things
quickly.

496
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,670
Free choice requires the real 
distinction between good and evil.

497
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,800
Without that,
you don't have choice.

498
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,170
Well,
so maybe it's possible to set up a world

499
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:45,290
where evil is a possibility,
but where it isn't something that has to

500
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,580
be manifest,
you know,

501
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:47,414
where,
where it's an option open to you and a 

502
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:49,214
real option and it has to be,
and the challenge that was presented to 

503
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:53,840
you,
but it's something that you can not,

504
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,660
you can not move towards if you,
so if you,

505
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:57,494
so desire,
and that seems to me to be something 

506
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:00,284
like the eth ethical requirement that 
that's the fundamental ethical 

507
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,740
requirement to avoid evil.
Doesn't mean it shouldn't exist.

508
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,480
It's not the same issue.
No,

509
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:09,830
it isn't.
It isn't.

510
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,723
Um,
an I,

511
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,770
I under one could recount it as the need
for otherness.

512
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,760
It goad,
need something other and that other,

513
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,940
if it's not going to be just part of God
has got to be free,

514
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,240
otherwise we'll be no creation.
I mean,

515
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:25,550
the,
the,

516
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,130
the,
the nature that there is something other

517
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,930
than,
than God.

518
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,393
Um,
it may in the end come from and come 

519
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,470
back to,
right.

520
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:37,304
That God,
we know that divine essence or that 

521
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,693
whatever,
but there's a wonderful thing I can't 

522
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,430
figure out either.
Like in,

523
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:46,220
in the Christian idea,
there's the end of time where the,

524
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,163
the evil is separated from God forever.
And I think about that as a 

525
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,510
metaphysical,
well,

526
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,530
you might think if it's a form of like 
imagined,

527
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,460
it's a form of perfection,
a form of striving for perfection.

528
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,190
You fragment yourself,
you challenge yourself,

529
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,310
throw what's not worthy into the fire,
a lasting,

530
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,650
something like that.
And so what it,

531
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,513
what you end up with retained as much 
better than what you started with 

532
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:11,310
through the trials.
Something like that.

533
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,393
Well,
that sounds a bit like the dialectical 

534
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:18,751
process that we've been talking.
And you have alluded to a couple of very

535
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,280
good,
um,

536
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,770
Jewish,
um,

537
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,040
myths and there's one in the [inaudible]
Kavala,

538
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,470
um,
about the creation,

539
00:27:29,471 --> 00:27:30,840
which I don't know if you know it,
but it's,

540
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,170
it's absolutely river thing to me.
Um,

541
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,210
the idea is that the primary being and 
is off the ground of all being,

542
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:45,490
um,
needs something other to come into being

543
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,510
the creation and that creation.
What does that ends off do?

544
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:55,330
It was this his first act as it to 
stretch out your hand and make something

545
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,450
not a bit.
The first act is to withdraw,

546
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,980
to create a place in which the canvas 
something other than dance off.

547
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,870
And so the first stage is called Sim.
Solomon as it sounds negative,

548
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:13,050
as so many creative things do withdraw.
And then in that space the uh,

549
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,253
vessels and a spark comes out of ames 
off and falls into the vessels and they 

550
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:18,984
will shatter.

551
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,450
And that's called a chef a how can
you write?

552
00:28:25,271 --> 00:28:29,050
Yes.
And then there is the third stage repair

553
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,650
in which,
um,

554
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,930
what has just been fragmented is 
restored into something greater.

555
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,410
And so this process carries on and it's 
in my terms,

556
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:41,290
very light.
What happens with the hemisphere.

557
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,980
The right hemisphere is the one that is 
first accepting.

558
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:49,450
It is sort of actively receptive,
if you can put it that way too.

559
00:28:49,451 --> 00:28:50,284
Whatever is new.
You were talking about Algorithm 

560
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,560
Goldberg and so,
um,

561
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,573
and then whatever that is is then sort 
of processed by the left hemisphere at 

562
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,134
the next stage into categories.
So it's bit of that and try to 

563
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,000
understand it,
but of course,

564
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:04,834
whatever it is,
as much bigger than any of the 

565
00:29:05,861 --> 00:29:06,694
categories.
So they all break down and it gets 

566
00:29:08,741 --> 00:29:11,230
restored and the right hemisphere into a
new hole.

567
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,480
Um,
the,

568
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,930
the,
to comb the repair,

569
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:15,910
right?

570
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,900
Tiq Mti candidate.
And I need the,

571
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,100
the,
the kind of

572
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:26,050
easy way of thinking about it is 
learning a piece of music.

573
00:29:26,051 --> 00:29:27,880
Your first of all attracted to it as a 
whole.

574
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,863
You then realize that you need to 
practice that piece at Bar 28 and you 

575
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,160
realize that,
you know,

576
00:29:33,161 --> 00:29:33,550
at,
at,

577
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,383
at bar 64,
there's a return to the dominant or 

578
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,480
something.
And,

579
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,000
uh,
then actually when you go on stage,

580
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,440
you've got to,
um,

581
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:44,710
just forget all about that.
But it's not that that work was lost,

582
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:46,480
it's just that it's no longer present.
Right,

583
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,833
right.
