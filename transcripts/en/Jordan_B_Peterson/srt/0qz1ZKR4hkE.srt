1
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,553
So let's take a look at the structure of
paradise as it's presented in the in 

2
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,223
genesis.
So the first aspect of the initial 

3
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:44,390
paradisical state is unself 
consciousness.

4
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,224
Now,
if you look at factor at an analytic 

5
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:50,810
studies of human personality,
you note that self consciousness,

6
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,240
although it is arguably our greatest 
gift,

7
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,920
also loads almost entirely on the factor
that defines negative effect.

8
00:00:57,921 --> 00:01:02,300
And you might also notice that when you 
say I became self conscious,

9
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,283
you generally put a negative cast on 
that in that I was talking before a 

10
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,620
group of people and suddenly I was 
seized by self consciousness.

11
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,573
And as a consequence of that,
I was flooded by negative emotion and 

12
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:17,240
was fundamentally a mobilized.
So it's a very paradoxical,

13
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,400
a very paradoxical state of being that 
our highest a gift say,

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,383
and the only one that clearly 
distinguishes us from animals is also 

15
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:31,421
that which when manifested,
makes us almost unbearably anxious.

16
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,923
The initial paradise state when Adam and
eve first walk in the garden of Eden is 

17
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:40,460
characterized by an animal like unself 
consciousness,

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,170
Adam and eve,
whatever they are,

19
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:45,500
are not clearly segregated from the rest
of the world.

20
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:47,780
They have no idea,
for example,

21
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:48,614
of their own nakedness,
and if you think about what nakedness 

22
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,613
means,
you immediately understand that that's 

23
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:57,410
also a very profound dramatic 
representation,

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,450
you know,
with children that are around the age of

25
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,010
three or four.
Many of them,

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,993
regardless of their motive upbringing,
start to become very concerned about 

27
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,580
privacy,
say with regards to bodily functions and

28
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,414
also very concerned about ever showing 
themselves without clothing and it's 

29
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,084
perfectly reasonable to presume that 
that's a consequence of their emergent 

30
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,444
self consciousness and event that takes 
place somewhere between the ages of two 

31
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,080
and five and that's a defining moment,
right?

32
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:27,800
That makes them segregated,
will say from their mother.

33
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,633
And so you also have images of paradise 
that float through Western history that 

34
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:38,270
are characterized by the image of the 
unconscious union between the mother and

35
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,021
child.
Right,

36
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:39,854
which is a which has an images stick 
representation that eradicates the 

37
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,040
tension of self consciousness both for 
the mother and for the child.

38
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,933
So the notion that the child is living 
in a paradise will condition that 

39
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:58,421
somehow lost as he or she approaches 
adulthood gives another sort of symbolic

40
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,504
layer.
The notion of the pre self conscious 

41
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,853
paradise,
it's also a place where order in chaos 

42
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,903
are imperfect balance and you know that 
because what paradise means is para 

43
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,083
around days a,
a wall while Eden means delight or a 

44
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,751
place of delight.
Paradise Paradise is a walled garden,

45
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,460
a wild place of delight and a garden is 
precisely that place where the forces of

46
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,140
nature or chaos and the forces of 
culture are held in perfect balance,

47
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,060
right?
That's what a garden is,

48
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,043
its nature given form by culture and 
it's a place that's architecturally 

49
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,063
pleasant,
a place where the intervention of human 

50
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:45,640
activity has produced a kind of 
stability that transcends that of nature

51
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:50,050
because it's a cultural construct,
but also that transcends that of culture

52
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,884
because all of the plants and the other 
growing things that constitute a garden 

53
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:54,904
are somehow transcendent even though 
they're under the cultivating hand of 

54
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,740
culture and the individual.

55
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,790
If you look at the manner in which the 
fall story is represented,

56
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,624
you all can also see that the place of 
previous stability can be regarded as a 

57
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:14,564
kind of paradise.
So if you remember the story of Moses 

58
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,323
leading his people through the desert,
it's clearly the case that when the 

59
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:20,864
Israelites were in the desert,
even though they got away from the 

60
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:25,010
tyranny,
it was easy to look back and say,

61
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:25,844
well,
you know,

62
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,050
tough as it was,
the place that we were before.

63
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:31,070
It was much better than the place we are
now.

64
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:31,904
So it's perfectly reasonable and 
expectable for people who are caught in 

65
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:40,751
a crisis to look back to the time prior 
to the dawn of that crisis with longing,

66
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,493
even if the crisis that they're 
presently experiencing is a necessary 

67
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,600
precondition for further development of 
personality.

68
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,860
So the story that's laid out in genesis 
has has its structure.

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,460
Something like this,
before we became self conscious,

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,990
the world was perfect as a consequence 
of the rise of self consciousness.

71
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,190
We were thrown out of the Garden of Eden
out of Paradise and destined to live the

72
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:05,024
profane existence that characterizes our
president mode of being where we're 

73
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:08,774
subject to knowledge of mortality and 
the possibility of illness and 

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,673
alienation from God.
And wouldn't it be ever so great if we 

75
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:16,334
could only return to that condition of 
unsolved consciousness and make all our 

76
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:25,301
problems go away and you see this kind 
of pathological paradisical reminiscence

77
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,390
manifesting itself in the most banal 
forms of conservatism,

78
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,224
which are always projecting the ideal,
the ideal past somewhere back into the 

79
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,923
unattainable reaches of time and also in
those situations that obtained 

80
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:40,634
psychologically when people are 
absolutely possessed by depression and 

81
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:48,101
anxiety and wish for their consciousness
to come to an end,

82
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,620
if not metaphorically so they desire to 
sleep.

83
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,483
Then actually so that suicide is viewed 
as a kind of unconsciousness who's 

84
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,463
paradisical nature.
The absence of all opposition is viewed 

85
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,420
as clearly preferable to the 
difficulties of actually maintaining.

86
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,450
Being
Julianna says,

87
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,850
the idea of paradise once and then 
paradise lost is not something unique to

88
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,674
western or a great eastern societies.
It's a widespread motif just as wide as 

89
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:27,800
this as the flood motif.
Regardless of where you go in the world,

90
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:32,801
you find this notion when heaven had 
been abruptly separated from the earth,

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,633
that is when it had become remote.
As in our days when the tree or vine 

92
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,704
connecting Earth to heaven had been cut 
or the mountain which used to touch the 

93
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,544
sky had been flattened out,
then the paradisical stage was over and 

94
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,570
man entered into his present fallen 
condition.

95
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,530
In fact,
all myths of Paradise show us primordial

96
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,890
man enjoying a beatitude,
spontaneity and freedom,

97
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,933
which he has unfortunately lost in 
consequence of the fall that is of what 

98
00:07:02,811 --> 00:07:03,644
followed upon the mythical event that 
caused the rupture between heaven and 

99
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:07,904
earth.

100
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,600
As I said,
Eden is delight,

101
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,650
a place of delight by terminological 
definition.

102
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,484
Whereas paradise is a walled garden.
I want to show you what knowing that 

103
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,170
does for analysis of the relationship 
between eastern and Western thought.

104
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,560
So let me tell you quickly the story of 
the Buddha and I'm going to represent it

105
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,883
fundamentally like this.
Buddhist starts his life in what's 

106
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:43,524
essentially a walled garden by all,
by all reasonable comparative analysis 

107
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,130
and as a consequence of his emergent 
self consciousness.

108
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,103
The unselfconscious childlike perfection
of that early state is permanently 

109
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,463
disrupted.
So you have a situation where the 

110
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:01,074
greatest redemption story of the east 
follows precisely the same grammatical 

111
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,230
track as the greatest creation story of 
the West.

112
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,064
So this is the story.
Buddhas farther is visited by an angel 

113
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:12,234
who tells him that his son is going to 
grow up to be the greatest temporal 

114
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,973
profane ruler the world has ever seen,
or a great spiritual leader and his 

115
00:08:20,401 --> 00:08:20,790
father.

116
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,770
Being a pragmatic and conservative man 
decides that there's no possible way.

117
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:26,604
I'm going to allow my son to take the 
ambivalent road of spiritual 

118
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,283
enlightenment.
I'm going to allow him to fall 

119
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,344
completely in love with the world so 
that he will remain attached to his 

120
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:42,390
domain.
So prior to Buddha's birth,

121
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,530
his father constructs a great city with 
walls around it.

122
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,180
And inside that city he removes all 
signs of pain,

123
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,190
frustration,
and disappointment.

124
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:54,024
Any sign of ugliness,
theat and the only people that are 

125
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,234
allowed to exist within the city are 
those who are in perfect mental and 

126
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:05,040
physical health who are paragons of 
beauty and virtue.

127
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,874
And the idea that lurks behind that 
archetypal story is that when a father 

128
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,184
has a child,
the his moral obligation is to shield 

129
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,064
the developing consciousness of that 
child from contact with any of the 

130
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,174
horrors of life that could provide the 
child with an experienced too traumatic 

131
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:26,994
for that developing consciousness to 
apprehend so because it's an archetypal 

132
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:32,400
story that relates to the development of
all people,

133
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:33,234
not just the redemptive savior,
and that's the motif that the Buddhist 

134
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:37,374
story initially follows at good father 
makes his child fall in love with life 

135
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,743
by enticing that child into a direct 
relationship with all that life has to 

136
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:46,770
offer.

137
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,760
So Buddha grows up within this walled 
garden,

138
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:54,761
this unselfconscious paradise,
but precisely because he's been shielded

139
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,840
to this degree and allowed to mature.
His consciousness continues to expand,

140
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,073
and the world outside the boundaries 
that his parents have established for 

141
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,214
him starts to attract his attention.
Now we know already that the forbidden 

142
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:10,471
fruit,
right?

143
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:11,304
The layer of what's outside the walls is
something that human beings just can't 

144
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,890
keep their mangy little paws off.
Right?

145
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,933
We are absolutely uncontrollably curious
and the best way to make sure that we 

146
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:22,824
investigate something is to lay down a 
structure that says whatever you do 

147
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,610
under whatever circumstances,
never look there,

148
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,444
right,
and then the automatic systems that 

149
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:32,694
underlie our orienting and that motivate
our seeking experience are constantly 

150
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,850
pulling our attention precisely to that 
forbidden spot,

151
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,990
compelling us to investigate exactly 
that which has been forbidden.

152
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:47,991
So because Buddha is a consciousness 
developing in a healthy manner,

153
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,193
he immediately becomes curious about 
what lies beyond the the limits that 

154
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:53,934
have been established with him and he 
makes a decision to go outside of 

155
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,140
Paradise.
Right?

156
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,003
Which seems a particularly ridiculous 
thing to do given that in principle he 

157
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:04,860
has everything you could possibly want 
inside the walls,

158
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:09,450
but then again we have the troublesome 
notion of the original sin of Adam,

159
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,284
right?
Which is if any of you are offered a 

160
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,100
forbidden fruit,
again,

161
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:18,960
under circumstances mythologically 
equivalent to those that are obtained in

162
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:19,794
the beginning,
you'd immediately reach your hand out 

163
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:21,954
and take it.
Because what we haven't got for human 

164
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,390
beings is always far more compelling 
than what we have got.

165
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,000
So Buddha goes outside the walls,
but his father,

166
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,700
who's a good father,
although somewhat conservative,

167
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:39,534
decides he's going to rig the game a 
little bit so it gets rid of everybody 

168
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:46,350
that's diseased or unhappy or 
uncomfortable or ugly or old or anything

169
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:48,840
that could possibly disturb the Buddha,
any lines,

170
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:49,674
the streets with flower waving women and
puts pedals on the road and sends his 

171
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:54,794
son out in a gilded chariot.
But the gods who were lurking around 

172
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
right,
the troublemaking gods who represent 

173
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,690
chaos and disorder in the unknown decide
to stand in front of Buddha.

174
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,810
A sick man who hobbles unsteadily 
interview.

175
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,733
And Buddha asks his his retainer 
precisely what this phenomena represent 

176
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,300
sand.
His retainer says,

177
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:16,931
well,
you know,

178
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,764
human beings like you,
sincere human are subject to the 

179
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,490
deterioration of these physical powers 
in an arbitrary way.

180
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,353
And this man is one person who's been so
affected and so buddha is completely 

181
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,353
disenchanted by his exploratory move out
into the terrible unknown and runs back 

182
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:36,244
into the castle walls and shuts the door
and is perfectly happy to think of 

183
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:39,970
nothing for months.

184
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,680
But then as his anxiety habituates and 
his curiosity grows,

185
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,340
he can't stand the notion of never going
outside the walls again and outside.

186
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,174
He goes again and this time where after 
his father prepares the route ever so 

187
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:54,274
carefully,
the godsend insight and old man who 

188
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,394
hobbles interview and mood,
it looks at him in shock and horror and 

189
00:13:00,311 --> 00:13:04,450
says to his retainer,
just precisely what's going on here.

190
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,310
And His retainer says,
well,

191
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,990
that's an old man and everybody gets all
and you're going to get old too.

192
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:15,600
And that's the way of all humanity.
And that's the point at which voted.

193
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Self consciousness expands not to only 
include the possibility of degeneration,

194
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:25,630
but to include the temporal horizon.
That's characteristic of life.

195
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,464
And he finds that so terribly shocking 
that he runs back into the castle and 

196
00:13:29,741 --> 00:13:30,574
shuts the walls down and plays with his 
friends for another six months or maybe 

197
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,620
a year till his anxiety.

198
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,110
Finally habituates.
And he goes out one final time.

199
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,730
And this time the godsend.
A funeral parade for him and he sees his

200
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:47,290
first dad body.
And this is such a terrible shock to him

201
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,120
that he can't even go back to the 
castle.

202
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:49,954
So his father prepares for him a great 
party in the woods near the castle full 

203
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:54,544
of nude dancing women who are perfectly 
willing to flaunt themselves and to 

204
00:13:58,061 --> 00:13:58,894
offer themselves to him.
But Buddha is so absolutely a 

205
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,064
catastrophic,
really shocked by this notion of 

206
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:04,444
emergent death,
that he can't take any pleasure 

207
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:08,110
whatsoever and what's being offered to 
him,

208
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,260
and he leaves the kingdom once and for 
all.

209
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:12,130
And you think,
well,

210
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,470
that's exactly what happens to you when 
you grow up.

211
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:17,380
Right?
If you're reasonably well socialized and

212
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,214
properly looked after,
then your curiosity gets the better of 

213
00:14:20,141 --> 00:14:20,974
you and you keep going out into the 
world until what year parents have 

214
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:26,740
established for you is no longer 
sufficient for you.

215
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,560
And as a consequence of that movement 
out into the world,

216
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,970
you find out all sorts of things 
characteristic of your own life that not

217
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:36,970
only your parents can't precisely 
explain to you,

218
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,983
but even the broader formal structures 
of your culture have a very difficult 

219
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:42,934
time handling.
And when you finally do encounter such 

220
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:50,080
realities and allow their effect on you 
to fully manifest itself all,

221
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:54,860
then you're finally independent and you 
no longer can return home,

222
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,843
but from that point forward,
you are also burdened as Adam is 

223
00:14:58,761 --> 00:14:59,594
burdened when he loses his Paradise Hill
unselfconscious snus with the full 

224
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,040
revelation of what it means to be 
limited and alive.

225
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,190
So what happens to Buddha as a 
consequence of this revelation,

226
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,940
he becomes an apprentice and the 
chronicles of the Buddhist adventure are

227
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:17,834
careful to say that he becomes the 
world's most proficient practitioner of 

228
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,393
Samka,
which was a philosophical precursor to 

229
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:29,810
yoga and then to yoga so he masters all 
the positions and the assanas until he's

230
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:33,380
disciplined physically to an almost 
unlimited degree.

231
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,520
And then he decides that he'll adopt a 
stance of world renunciation,

232
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,710
which is also something he's a 
remarkably good at.

233
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,753
And he starved himself until the chronic
lewis say he resembles nothing so much 

234
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,923
as a pile of dust and then having 
exhausted all the disciplinary 

235
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,400
structures that his sophisticated 
culture has to offer him,

236
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:56,480
but still not precisely finding the 
answer that he's looking for.

237
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,433
He retreats into the forest place of the
unknown and sits himself at the base of 

238
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:06,161
a tree underneath the tree.
He's visited by visions and temptations.

239
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,340
The first division is in essentially 
erotic one life itself,

240
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,203
camps him back out of his self conscious
state into the domain of pure physical 

241
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:18,020
pleasure,
a perfectly reasonable temptation,

242
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,854
right,
and one that is powerful enough so that 

243
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Hindu philosophers say,
b,

244
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:26,000
as their churches and cathedrals are 
covered with erotic drawings.

245
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,390
If you can't get past the erotic 
drawings into the church,

246
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,790
that's the domain that you should still 
inhabit,

247
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,300
right in the dawning phases of life at 
least till middle age.

248
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,133
That's the appropriate motive being to 
be enticed and seduced by the physical 

249
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:43,280
pleasures that life has to offer,
but in the final analysis,

250
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,114
those are not sufficient to solve the 
problem of emergent self consciousness 

251
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:48,523
and so the angel of death visits him and
offered him the opportunity to exist 

252
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,080
permanently in a state of Nirvana.
A very,

253
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:00,320
very interesting twist on this story 
because you have to wonder,

254
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,154
given the association,
say between suicidality and the notion 

255
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:05,654
of paradise that exists underneath that.
If what Buddha isn't being offered by 

256
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:09,524
the angel of death is in fact death and 
this sensation of all the problems of 

257
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:14,084
being regardless,
he rejects that attains enlightenment 

258
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:17,894
briefly and then decides to return to 
the world to share what he's discovered 

259
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,064
with all of suffering humanity.
The idea being that the Buddha who is 

260
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,744
the awakened or enlightened one is 
capable of attaining a transcendent 

261
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:31,964
state,
but also knows fully that because human 

262
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:39,971
beings have a shared social aspect,
it is not possible for any one person to

263
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:43,490
attain redemption until all people 
attain redemption.

264
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,473
The reason being that it's very 
difficult to be transcendent and 

265
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,480
enlightened when you see someone who's 
sick lying in a ditch,

266
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,613
so then we shift from that back to 
genesis and the attempted fall of man 

267
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,670
and read the third chapter,
and they were both naked,

268
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,160
the man and his wife and were not 
ashamed.

269
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,390
Well,
what does that mean?

270
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,090
Well,
Freud pointed out one of human beings,

271
00:18:14,091 --> 00:18:18,170
most common nightmares is to be stripped
of clothing in front of a crowd.

272
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,660
Now,
why would that be precisely?

273
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:21,494
Well,
your naked self is the most vulnerable 

274
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:25,910
aspect of you,
right?

275
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,923
Were all closed and for good reason,
partly that's protection from the 

276
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,820
terrible natural world,
right,

277
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,970
but it also offers this the possibility 
of placing a barrier between ourselves,

278
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:38,354
our vulnerable cells,
and the searching and critical gaze of 

279
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,290
the community,
right?

280
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,124
Because not only are we vulnerable to 
the rigors of nature were also 

281
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:47,443
vulnerable to the depredations and 
criticisms of society and the notion 

282
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:54,890
that a man and a woman could exist naked
and not know.

283
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,723
It is a clear,
is a clear of finger pointing in the 

284
00:18:59,091 --> 00:18:59,924
direction of a story that says these 
people were not conscious or if 

285
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,044
conscious they certainly were not self 
conscious and what's how does the story 

286
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:10,004
develop?
The serpent was more subtle than any 

287
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,980
beast of the field which the Lord God 
had made and he said unto the woman,

288
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,940
Yea Hath God said you shall not eat of 
every tree of the garden.

289
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,430
And the woman said unto the serpent,
well,

290
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,590
we meet of the fruit of the trees,
of the garden,

291
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,770
but of the fruit of the tree which is in
the center of the garden.

292
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,160
God Hath said,
you should not eat of it,

293
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,320
neither shall you touch it,
lest you die,

294
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,700
and the serpent said to the woman,
you won't die,

295
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,390
for God knows that in the day you eat 
thereof.

296
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,820
Then your eyes shall be opened,
right?

297
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,470
A clear pointing to the notion of an 
awakening and an illumination,

298
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,000
and you should be like gods,
knowing good and evil,

299
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:53,834
right?
Which attributes to humanity a dawning 

300
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,953
sense of morality,
explicit morality of faculty for 

301
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,740
comprehension that we do not share with 
any other animal,

302
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,783
and when the woman saw that the tree was
good for food and that it was pleasant 

303
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:10,040
to the eyes and a tree to be desired to 
make one wise,

304
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,053
she took of the fruit thereof and did 
eat and gave also unto her husband with 

305
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:18,650
her.
And he did eat women trouble.

306
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,620
What's the tree?
Well,

307
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,450
we talked about this a little bit 
before.

308
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:24,650
So you say,
well,

309
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,443
if you look at the structure of 
experience from this particular 

310
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,294
perspective,
and you think about that in a vertical 

311
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:34,190
planes with the layers,
one on top of another,

312
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,180
then you can imagine the tree as the 
thing that unites these three layers.

313
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,800
The tree is the domain that unites chaos
and order and the individual,

314
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,900
the structure running up through the 
middle of it.

315
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,913
And you see a representation of that.
Interestingly enough from norse 

316
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:50,650
mythology,
this is egg sale.

317
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,880
The,
uh,

318
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,420
the,
the tree of the gods,

319
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,060
the tree that stands in the middle of 
the norse paradise.

320
00:20:58,061 --> 00:20:58,894
And one of the things that's very 
interesting about this particular tree 

321
00:21:00,941 --> 00:21:01,774
is that if you look at its roots,
it's the roots are covered with snakes 

322
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,404
and serpents.
Sand underneath the snakes and serpents 

323
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,193
is water.
And so that you see that the tree it 

324
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,380
stands at the center of the world is 
rooted in chaos,

325
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,214
fundamentally is rooted in whatever it 
is that constitutes the pre cosmogony 

326
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,913
matrix of being.
And then the central aspects of this 

327
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:30,361
domain are nicely laid out as the domain
of territoriality.

328
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,413
The end of the borders that the 
individual understands and the habitual 

329
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,314
territory that he inhabits,
and then the tree in the center 

330
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,230
represents whatever it is that central 
to this to our mode of being,

331
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,730
and so let's take a look at that in some
detail and flesh it out.

332
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,073
Symbolically.
We find really add is saying the tree 

333
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:55,723
stands hypothetically at the center of 
the world is precisely that structure 

334
00:21:59,081 --> 00:21:59,914
that Sharman climb when they make their 
transition from the normal mode 

335
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,280
diversely being into their transcendent 
mode of being.

336
00:22:06,281 --> 00:22:07,150
So Elliot,
it says,

337
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,223
the symbolism of the ascension into 
heaven by means of a tree is clearly 

338
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:14,910
illustrated by the ceremony of 
initiation of a shaman.

339
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,470
The candidate climbs up a post in the 
middle of his,

340
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,313
your.
His tent reaches with summit and goes 

341
00:22:20,141 --> 00:22:20,974
out by the small coal,
but we know that this opening made to 

342
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,034
let out.
The smoke is likened to the whole made 

343
00:22:26,051 --> 00:22:26,884
by the pollstar in the vault of heaven.
So you can imagine there's a 

344
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,484
conceptualization of the world as 
centered around a particular access and 

345
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:38,060
that the tent is regarded as at least 
Trans Trans.

346
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,903
Literally as a symbolic equivalent of 
that cosmological structure among other 

347
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:44,344
people's,
the tent pole is called the pillar of 

348
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:50,070
the sky and as compared to the pole star
around which the world rotates a,

349
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,600
at least from the visual perspective and
his name Dallas,

350
00:22:52,601 --> 00:22:53,434
where the nail of the sky,
that's the ritual posts set up in the 

351
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:56,464
middle of the court,
is an image of the cosmic tree which is 

352
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:02,350
found at the center of the world with 
the pole star shining directly above it.

353
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,950
By sending it,
the candidate enters into heaven.

354
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,010
That is why as soon as he comes out of 
the smoke hole of the tent,

355
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:12,430
he gives a loud cry invoking the help of
the gods up there.

356
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:14,140
He finds himself in their presence.

357
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,013
The tree is an absolutely archaic symbol
and it seems to me most likely that it 

358
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:28,240
represents the structure of the nervous 
system.

359
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,253
I think a structure that's rooted not so
much in the spinal sensory motor 

360
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:35,770
structures,
but deeply in the autonomic structure,

361
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:40,771
stretching down into the center of the 
body and planting the mind firmly in its

362
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:42,964
material substrate so that the autonomic
system and its projections up into the 

363
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,013
Amygdala and the limbic system and then 
up into the cortex constitute the 

364
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:51,524
interface between the spiritual domain 
that our psyche and habits and the 

365
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,930
material domain that constitutes our 
body.

366
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:02,410
The tree at the center of our being.
What is it?

367
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,980
Tree do well,
it bears fruit well,

368
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:06,360
what sort of fruit?
Well,

369
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,194
there are multiple medieval 
representations that are quite peculiar 

370
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,000
showing Christ,
for example,

371
00:24:12,001 --> 00:24:15,270
as the fruit of the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil,

372
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,850
the fruit of the tree of life,
and what does that mean?

373
00:24:17,851 --> 00:24:18,684
It means that conceptualizations,
like the hero are products of whatever 

374
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:23,844
it is that this tree represents.
The tree is something that produces 

375
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:27,894
fruit.
Fruit is also something that can be 

376
00:24:29,371 --> 00:24:31,890
ingested,
and as

377
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,670
Eric Newman point out,

378
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,390
wherever liquor,
fruit,

379
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,493
herbs,
etc. Appear as the vehicles of life and 

380
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,660
mortality,
including the water and bread of life.

381
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,070
The sAcrament of the host and every form
of food cult down to the present day.

382
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,980
We have an ancient moat of human 
expression before us,

383
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,083
so imagine the idea of the piagetian 
idea of assimilation and then 

384
00:24:58,471 --> 00:24:59,304
accommodation and then understand it's a
similar type of nutritive underlying 

385
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:04,644
metaphorical nature.
The idea being that there is a tight 

386
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,010
analogy between ingesting something 
material and undergoing a transformation

387
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:15,240
of of energy attendant upon that,
right,

388
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,074
which is what happens when you eat and 
ingesting a piece of information which 

389
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,040
offers you a new mode of doing things so
you can say,

390
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:26,360
well,
people will trade work for information.

391
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,223
They will trade food for information.
There must be a kind of equivalence 

392
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:31,854
between work and information and food 
and information because otherwise the 

393
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:39,150
trade wouldn't make sense and then you 
realize that if you're informed,

394
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,283
you can undertake transformations of 
yourself and the material world in a 

395
00:25:43,741 --> 00:25:44,574
much more efficient manner because 
that's what being informed means and 

396
00:25:47,641 --> 00:25:48,474
that means that being informed,
acquiring some information and eating 

397
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:52,884
something are all tied up in a complex 
way into the same metaphorical 

398
00:25:55,891 --> 00:25:56,724
structure.

399
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,450
Eat something forbidden,
transform as a consequence.

400
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,483
Conscious realization is acted out in 
the elementary scheme of nutritive that 

401
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,093
simulation and the ritual act of 
concrete eating is the first form of 

402
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:14,931
assimilation known to man the 
assimilation ingestion of the content.

403
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,040
The eaten food produces an interchange.
Transformation of the body cells through

404
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:24,390
food intake is the most elementary of 
animal changes experienced by man.

405
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,510
How a weary enfeebled and famished man 
can be turned into an alert,

406
00:26:29,511 --> 00:26:30,344
strong and satisfied being or a man 
perishing of thirst can be refreshed or 

407
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:36,140
even transformed by an intoxicating 
drink.

408
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,410
This is and must remain a fundamental 
experience so long as man shall exist.

409
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,741
Eric,
new ones.

410
00:26:42,741 --> 00:26:43,574
Point being that our psychological 
experience of the capacity of 

411
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:49,854
psychological transformation through 
eating is a metaphor waiting to be 

412
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:57,020
applied to the equivalent experience 
that we obtained,

413
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,893
the equivalent excitement and sense of 
transformative possibility that we 

414
00:27:01,111 --> 00:27:06,111
acquire as a consequence of coming 
across some new and truly valuable piece

415
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:07,134
of information.
So you have any idea that the tree that 

416
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,524
stands at the center of the world,
the individual mode of being and 

417
00:27:13,311 --> 00:27:17,130
something that bears fruit and the 
ingestion of that fruit.

418
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:17,964
That idea say or that that piece of 
information is something that can 

419
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,550
produce a permanent transformation.
