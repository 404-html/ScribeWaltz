1
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,490
You know when the computer starts up,
it has to boot.

2
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,950
Bootstrap is what that means at
bootstraps itself by continuing to

3
00:00:41,051 --> 00:00:44,530
engage in more and more complex
processes as it starts up,

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,490
so it starts up with a simple process
and that triggers a more complex process

5
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,690
and that triggers a more complex process
and that way the computer boots itself

6
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,220
into existence.
Well,

7
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,340
that's exactly what we did,
except we did it over like 3 billion

8
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:57,971
years,
right?

9
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,960
We started out as these unbelievably
simple organisms that could pretty much

10
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:06,961
do nothing at all except replicate and
develop much more and more complex forms

11
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:12,040
over this tremendously long period of
evolutionary history.

12
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,740
Right?
So that's how we solve the problem that

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,730
you can't know anything without knowing
something and that you can't have

14
00:01:18,731 --> 00:01:21,490
knowledge without generating it.
It's a little knowledge,

15
00:01:21,491 --> 00:01:23,170
a little more generation,
a little knowledge,

16
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:24,820
a little more generational little
knowledge.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,070
This huge spiraling cross as an expense
extends over vast amounts of time,

18
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,340
information encoded in your body,
right?

19
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:36,460
As part of your,
as part of the nature of your being and

20
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:40,390
information encoded in your culture
reflected inside you and acted out in

21
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,224
the world,

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,940
and as scientists,
you know,

23
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,120
with this 500 year history of science
behind us,

24
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,750
we always believed that it's the
material substrate of things.

25
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:59,920
That's the reality,
but it is more complicated than that

26
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:04,420
because even the material substrate that
we consider us scientists isn't merely

27
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,910
unformed stuff,
right?

28
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,160
It has structure.
It's patterned,

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,450
it's full of information,
and there are physicists working now who

30
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:18,130
believed that conceptualization of the
ground of being the material grounded of

31
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:23,131
being as the information is a more
fruitful metaphor than conceptualization

32
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,020
of the ground of being as like unformed
matter.

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,700
It's not unformed,
right?

34
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:32,701
It's pattern and regular informative so
that if you investigated it reveals

35
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:35,590
order.
That's not just a material structure.

36
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,600
So if you go back to Democritus,
right?

37
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,480
The person who originated the atomic
hypothesis,

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,300
democritus actually says two things.
Not One.

39
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:46,780
He says everything's made out of atoms.
Little bits of stuff,

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,700
but the other thing he says is Adam's
array themselves in space array

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,700
themselves,
and what that means is that the atomic

42
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:58,750
structure of things,
his pattern and the pattern is just as

43
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,460
real.
The atoms themselves,

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,260
it's the pattern.
That's the knowledge,

45
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,011
right?
A pattern.

46
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,970
That's the information.

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,440
So while we encounter as conscious
beings is this complex sleep pattern to

48
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,060
ray,
which we then turned into knowledge,

49
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,190
usable knowledge.
I said,

50
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,410
well,
how would this metaphorical

51
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:24,140
representation work?
And so the way I want you to look at

52
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:27,470
this figure is like this.
Imagine this as distant,

53
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,550
right as lurking in the background.
So this is the ground of all being

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,570
manifesting itself as one primordial
archetype or one,

55
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,410
one metaphor,
one standard mode of metaphorical

56
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:42,800
representation.
Why this figure?

57
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,660
While this is complicated,
I think

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,280
if you show men picture of a beautiful
woman with her eyes avert while you're

59
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:55,340
doing a brain scan,
mapping of their nucleus,

60
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,740
accumbent,
nothing happens.

61
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,770
Why is that relevant?
Well,

62
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:04,190
the nucleus accumbens is part of the
underlying emotional circuitry that

63
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:08,630
governs approach behavior and pleasure
and approach behavior and pleasure very

64
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,840
tightly intertwined.
If you show the same picture of a

65
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:16,550
beautiful woman with her eyes locked on
his is nucleus accumbens will light up.

66
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,250
Why is that?
Well,

67
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,810
it's partly because men are innately
attuned to who to female beauty.

68
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,350
Female beauty has a standard form.
It's replicable cross culturally,

69
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,330
it constitutes the average human human
female form,

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,380
but more than that,
the gays locking is an indication of

71
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:40,340
shared attention and it's also the
indication of the initial establishment

72
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:44,480
of a shared attentional space and it's
an invitation and that invitation

73
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:47,510
activates approach circuits really even
if it's just a picture.

74
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,690
So when you can see this,
if you walk into any drugstore or any,

75
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,360
any,
any drug store that sells magazines,

76
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:57,800
what do you see on the men's magazines?
You see an infinite array of beautiful

77
00:04:57,801 --> 00:05:00,860
women and in the female magazines,
the women's magazines,

78
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,590
you see an infinite array of beautiful
women.

79
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,500
Now just exactly why is that?
Well,

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,260
there's something absolutely compelling
about female beauty,

81
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,280
and then you have to ask yourself,
what the hell does compelling mean?

82
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,210
Okay,
so what compelling means is you're

83
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:22,211
busily engaged in a goal directed task
and something happens in your peripheral

84
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:23,990
vision,
so to speak,

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,620
that attracts your attention.
Now that attention is attracted by

86
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:29,960
processes that are fundamentally
unconscious,

87
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,260
which means processes that occur before
you can think so you can imagine a loose

88
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:42,131
collection of college age males having a
conversation in a bar when someone

89
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:48,791
beautiful walks by and one or more of
them capture out of the corner of their

90
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,320
eyes orientation,
right?

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,300
Unconscious.
Why?

92
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,560
Because there's something about that
pattern form that grips attentional

93
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,530
systems and direct observation towards
it.

94
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,650
So then you think,
okay,

95
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,940
human beings are really,
really complicated pattern processes and

96
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,774
you think,
well,

97
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,470
partly what we're trying to get a handle
on here is the nature of the world and

98
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,920
partly what we know already is that
there are aspects of the world that you

99
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,100
can't understand always and then you
think,

100
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:24,710
well,
people are trying to get a grip on the

101
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:28,010
fact that there are parts of the world
that you can understand so that there's

102
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:32,510
this transcendent element to being that
always escapes encapsulation.

103
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,180
How would you represent it?
Well,

104
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:39,080
it's the transcendent element of things
that always attracts your attention

105
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,590
implicitly beyond your control,
so allow noise or a scream or the cry of

106
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:49,310
a baby or anything horrific,
right?

107
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,890
Blood broken bodies.

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,260
These are stimuli that are so
representative of trouble that you can't

109
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,630
help but attend to them,
and then you can imagine that all of the

110
00:07:05,261 --> 00:07:07,010
stimuli,
so to speak,

111
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:11,090
that you can't help but attend to,
can be a male dominated into

112
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:16,091
representations of the transcendent
aspect of reality,

113
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,790
and that's what you see in this
representation right here.

114
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:25,090
So you see a weird intermingling of
female sexuality plus some very distinct

115
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,600
genital symbolism.
Why genital so imagine that that's a

116
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:34,730
Volvo opening.
Why

117
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,000
before we had any scientific knowledge
at all at school 10,000 years ago,

118
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,900
what the hell is inside a body?
While we knew that,

119
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,430
I guess a little bit from hunting,
right?

120
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,910
We knew the interior of a body.
What is it about the interior of a body

121
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,960
that allows new forms to be generated?
How is it that mothers can give birth to

122
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:54,620
children?

123
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,000
How is it that one form that's complex
and attractive and mysterious can give

124
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:03,170
rise to another form?
Why is that useful knowledge from a

125
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:07,070
representational perspective,
because there's some association between

126
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:10,520
the Feminine Form,
from a metaphorical perspective and the

127
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:14,000
capacity for nature to give rise to new
forms

128
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,240
and then you see a representation of a
typical monstrous form that's Kelly,

129
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:25,241
the Hindu goddess,
the devour and in this representation.

130
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,820
So she's like a more developed version
of tie a mat.

131
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,790
That's a good way of thinking about her.
She's not so much unspeakable anymore.

132
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,760
You could actually say a few things
about Kelly.

133
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,230
You could say,
well,

134
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,040
she's like a spider because she has
eight legs and she weaves a web of fate

135
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:43,821
and you can say,
well,

136
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,060
her web is made out of fire because if
you get too near to her,

137
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,170
you'll burn up and you could say she
glares at you with eyes that are

138
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:54,770
unblinking and you could say she has a
tongue like a tiger,

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,800
and you could say that she carries
weapons of destruction and it has a head

140
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:02,100
dress of skulls and that her hair is on
fire.

141
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,840
And you could say that she's giving
birth to this guy as nature gives birth

142
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:10,080
to human beings and is devouring him at
the same time,

143
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,830
intestines first,
and then you could say,

144
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,620
well,
you could imagine that the first few

145
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:21,621
people that made a representation like
that shock themselves quite badly.

146
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,630
Right?
Because this is a.

147
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,800
This is a representation of,
of fear itself in a sense,

148
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,650
but not exactly.
It's also a representation of those

149
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:36,651
stimuli that if you're human are going
to make you both afraid and compelled

150
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,200
just like.
It's hard to look away from fire even if

151
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,290
it's burning something down.
Then you wanted to have around

152
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,480
rats.
If you raise a route to juvenile status

153
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:56,481
and then washed and cat odor,
it will completely short circuit why?

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,060
Well,
the rats never seen a cat.

155
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,150
So exactly what the hell is it
responding to you think,

156
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:03,811
well,
you can say,

157
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,970
well it's not a conditioned stimulus,
right?

158
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:07,680
Because the routes never encountered a
cat.

159
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,900
There's something deep in the brain of
that wrap that knows something about cat

160
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:17,370
odor was never encountered a cat.
So exactly what is it perceiving?

161
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,110
Well,
in some sense,

162
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,660
I think the notion that it's perceiving
is wrong,

163
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,960
it isn't perceiving,
it's just going like this.

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,070
That's the representation.
While I'm with chimpanzees who are more

165
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:31,440
complex,
there are other stimuli that evoke

166
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:34,530
exactly that kind of response.
Chimps don't like snakes,

167
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,270
dander alive.
Plastic,

168
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,270
rubber doesn't matter.
They don't like snakes.

169
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,970
If you put one in their case,
they get as far away from the snake as

170
00:10:41,971 --> 00:10:45,240
they can as quickly as possible,
and then they look at it because I

171
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,060
suppose if you're a chimpanzee,
even if you don't like snakes,

172
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,590
it's a good idea to know where they are.

173
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,940
Right?
So it's similar to repel,

174
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,470
repelling snake plus attractive.
Yeah.

175
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,600
Well you better look at it and see where
it's going to go.

176
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,650
Chimpanzees don't like unconscious
chimpanzees,

177
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:05,850
so if you knock a chimpanzee out with
anesthetic and you bring the body of the

178
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:07,770
chimpanzee back into the chimpanzee
cage,

179
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,650
the chimps do exactly the same thing
away from the body,

180
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,460
but they look at it.
They don't like masks made of chimpanzee

181
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,640
faces while three year old kids don't
like masks either.

182
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,030
There are these underlying perceptual
primitive,

183
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:26,031
so to speak that likely activate lower
limbic mechanisms in our brains that say

184
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:31,791
to us,
this is a place suddenly where something

185
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,330
unexpected that you probably do not like
or will not like is very,

186
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:39,210
very likely to happen.
So you can imagine that an environment

187
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:44,211
characterized by
unconscious bodies or blood or the

188
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,950
presence of spiders or snakes,
etc.

189
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,730
Might be a place where primates,
such as yourself may encounter things

190
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,680
that they don't know how to cope with.
Therefore afraid.

191
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,080
Right?
SaMe with fear of the dark,

192
00:11:56,081 --> 00:12:00,520
and then you could imagine that the dark
is populated with all of these monsters

193
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,820
of the unknown and you get some notion
of what's happening to children who are

194
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:06,190
afraid of the dark.
Why are they afraid of the dark?

195
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,490
because in the dark,
which is the place you don't know,

196
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,090
learned things that could hurt a
creature like you.

197
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,140
What things,
how we can't exactly say,

198
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,800
but if you give children exposure to
books and to adult conversation and to

199
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:23,470
television soon,
those limbic structures that are

200
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:28,471
populating the darkness with unnameable
fear start to populate it up with

201
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,580
skeletons and vampires and monsters and
so forth and so on,

202
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:37,900
has the representational structures that
the brain is capable of generating,

203
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,550
say,
well,

204
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,700
fear of inducing things are like that.
They're bloody.

205
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,590
They're dangerous.
They look like serpents.

206
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:46,900
They look like insects.
They lurk in the dark.

207
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:48,550
They sneak up on you,
et cetera,

208
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,790
all mangled together into some sort of
monsters form.

209
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,000
Now I want to read you a story.

210
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,350
All right,
so let me give you a little background

211
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,950
to this story.
This story popped into my head in one

212
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,310
chunk like complete,
which I thought was kind of interesting,

213
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:13,311
but it was also a story that emerged in
solution to a problem I'd been thinking

214
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,760
about for a long time because I was
dealing with this guy who didn't want to

215
00:13:17,761 --> 00:13:20,460
grow up.
So he's caught in a kind of peter pan

216
00:13:20,461 --> 00:13:23,400
situation and peter pan pan means
everything.

217
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,263
Hey,
pan,

218
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,200
like pantheistic and peter pan is a
child who won't grow up.

219
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:29,460
Now he's magical.
Well,

220
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:30,121
okay,
fine.

221
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:31,800
Children live in a magical world,
right?

222
00:13:31,801 --> 00:13:34,620
They're rife with possibility.
He's magical.

223
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,060
He doesn't want to grow up,
so he lives in neverland with the lost

224
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:41,310
boys.
Neverland doesn't really exist in the

225
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:46,311
lost boys are obviously boys who haven't
managed to establish some mode of being

226
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,990
and he's in constant battle with captain
hook and captain hook's a tyrant,

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,811
right?
A pirate,

228
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:56,640
a negative manifestation of the negative
archetype of social order.

229
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,140
And captain hook is always fighting
peter pan because peter pan represents

230
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,930
childhood and vulnerability and he
doesn't want to be vulnerable,

231
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:08,931
so they're locked in this sort of
eternal bout and lots of people I think

232
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:14,421
more commonly men but not necessarily
get caught in this peter pan problem.

233
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,640
So I was dealing wiTh

234
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,050
person who was caught in this situation,
didn't want to grow up,

235
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:28,051
wouldn't sacrifice childhood.
And so this story popped into my head.

236
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,550
It's called cock-a-doodle-doo.
Once upon a time there was a man who had

237
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:37,420
a long hard journey ahead of him.
He was trudging along the way over

238
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:41,080
boulders and through brushes when he saw
a little shiny him with big white teeth

239
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,330
and the black toupee sitting by the side
of the road,

240
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,250
he was drumming on a log with two white
bones and humming oddly to himself.

241
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,370
The little gnome said,
john,

242
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,340
why woRk so hard?
Why I walked so fast?

243
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,470
Who knows if you'll ever get there?
Anyway,

244
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,170
come over here.
I have something to show you.

245
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,100
So john walked off the road.
He was sick of walking anyway because

246
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,700
people kept throwing sticks and stones.
Adam little gnome said,

247
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,200
I have a shiny red jewel that I would
like to sell you cheap.

248
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,890
Here it is.
And for beneath his cloak,

249
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:18,080
he pulled the biggest ruby that the man
had ever seen.

250
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,560
It must've weighed 100 pounds and it
shown like the sun.

251
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,010
The gnome said,
do you like it?

252
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,790
It'S an enchanted stone.
What will you offer me for it?

253
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,910
And the man said,
I don't have much,

254
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,430
much money,
but I'll give you everything.

255
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,010
I have the known look displeased.

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,950
So john added,
I could pay some more monthly.

257
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,950
So the gnome excepted,
fair enough,

258
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,180
buy now,
pay later.

259
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,750
Sounds good for me.
I'm all for the installment plan.

260
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,130
So the man gave the gnome all his money
and promise to pay the rest later,

261
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,470
and the gnome walk back into the bush by
the road,

262
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:56,570
clacking his teeth and giggling and
twitching.

263
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,340
The more the man thought about this ruby
and the great deal he got,

264
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,310
the happier he became.
He started back on the road with a light

265
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,320
heart,
but soon discovered that he couldn't

266
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:09,500
make much progress because 100 pounds
was a lot to carry.

267
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,380
He said to himself,
why continue?

268
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:13,910
anyways?
I have what I want.

269
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,090
I'll just stand here holding my ruby.
And when people walk by,

270
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:22,091
they can see how well I've already done.
So he stopped a little while.

271
00:16:22,551 --> 00:16:24,920
One of his little while later,
one of his friends came along,

272
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,000
so I'm standing there.

273
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,130
His friends said,
john,

274
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,610
why don't you come along with me?
I've just opened a new business and I

275
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,130
could really use some help.
Come along quick.

276
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,330
it will be opening soon and thought that
sounded good.

277
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,640
But his friend was in a hurry.
He said he couldn't.

278
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:44,360
He see the ruby.
How could he speed along beside him?

279
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,480
Where would he put his jewel?
So he said,

280
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,280
thanks,
but I have to take care of my jewel.

281
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,370
Maybe I'll see you later.
His friend looked at him like he was

282
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,200
crazy,
but he was trying to get somewhere

283
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,510
quick,
so he just shrugged a bit and said,

284
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,493
okay,
john,

285
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,710
see you later.
And he sped on down the road.

286
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,080
A little while later,
another friend came by and he said,

287
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,310
john,
nice to see you.

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm going back to school.
There are lots of wonderful things to

289
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:09,230
learn.
Great things to do.

290
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,770
The world is full of unsolved problems.
I could use some company.

291
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,880
What would you like to come along?
John thought that sounded pretty good,

292
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,800
but this friend who looked like he was
in a hurry,

293
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,340
he started standing beside the road,
holding the jewel was tiring and he

294
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,670
needed all the energy you had for that.
So he said to his friend,

295
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,310
thanks,
but I have to take care of my jewel.

296
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,430
Isn't it beautiful?
Maybe I'll see you later.

297
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,560
His friend looked at him like he was
crazy,

298
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,360
but he was trying to get somewhere
quick,

299
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,710
so he just shrugged and said,
hope.

300
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:39,560
Everything goes all right with you.
See you later.

301
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,700
Many friends came and went.
In the years,

302
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:46,280
went by,
the jewel got heavier and heavier,

303
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,890
but the man got more and more attached
to it.

304
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,650
The only thing was nobody seemed to
notice how beautiful it was.

305
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,940
People would rush by and talk about
their plans and nobody had a ruby as big

306
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,380
and nobody seemed likely to get a ruby
is big and you think that someone

307
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:05,360
might've had said something like at
least nice ruby john,

308
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,700
sure wish I had one like that,
but it never happened.

309
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,940
Then one day someone new came down the
road.

310
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,670
He was bent over and he was thin and his
hair was gray.

311
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,210
Although he didn't look that old,
he was carrying a big dirty rock

312
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:20,730
carefully in his arms and he wasn't
making much progress.

313
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,090
The strange figure approached and
glanced up at john.

314
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,140
Then he grinned and said,
where are you standing there so stupidly

315
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,820
with a big ugly rock and you're tired.

316
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,100
Old hands.
You look pretty daft.

317
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,400
I bet you wish you had a big ruby like
the one I am carrying.

318
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,070
And john thought this poor man is
diluted.

319
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,580
He's carrying a rock because you have
the ruby.

320
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,900
So he said,
excuse me sir,

321
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,870
but you are sadly mistaken.
I'm the one with the jewel.

322
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,320
I met a little known by the side of the
road and he sold it to me.

323
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,490
I'm still paying for it,
although not so very much.

324
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,880
You are carrying a rock.
Tired.

325
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:58,050
Stranger looked annoyed.
He said,

326
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,520
I didn't know what game you're playing,
mr.

327
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,280
You have a rock.
I have a jewel.

328
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,570
The little gnome you described sold it
to me and he said it was the only one.

329
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,950
I've been carrying it for 20 years and
I'll never let it go.

330
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,950
And john said,
but I'd been carrying mine for 20 years

331
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:14,400
too.

332
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,600
it can be just a rock rocker jewel on
and on.

333
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,120
They argued.
Suddenly I would step the little gnome

334
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,090
as if he'd never left.
Only this time he wasn't so little,

335
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,660
he was bigger and redder and menacing
and his laugh sounded like the rattling

336
00:19:27,661 --> 00:19:30,750
of chains.
Quit arguing youtube.

337
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,450
I've never seen a site quite so
pathetic.

338
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,500
You're carrying rocks,
both of you and if you would have ever

339
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,780
had the sense to put them down for a
second or two,

340
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,350
you would have seen that,
oh well,

341
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,200
at least you were diligent.
I played a mean trick.

342
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,190
I feel bad,
so I'm going to give you What you really

343
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,850
deserve.
Do you want what you really deserve?

344
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,940
and john and the thin stranger nodded,
eagerly.

345
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,390
finally,
they thought you haven't seen anything

346
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:02,730
yet.
It's wrote down your rocks.

347
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:07,020
So john and the thin stranger obeyed
each rock,

348
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:07,920
split down the middle.

349
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,310
When it hit the ground,
outflow the river of ravenous white

350
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:15,480
worms which rushed towards the men and
devoured them whole while they thrashed

351
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:20,481
about and screamed.
Soon nothing was left except a leg bone

352
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:24,030
from each.
The little gnome pick them up and walked

353
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:27,720
off the road.
He sat down by a hollow log and started

354
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:31,610
to drum.
He drummed any waited and he hummed and

355
00:20:31,611 --> 00:20:36,611
hawed a little tune
picture of food feeds the whole Hungary

356
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:39,930
clan,
the image of good mix,

357
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:43,830
the whole healthy men.
Why walk for miles?

358
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,590
Why do the work?
Just smile.

359
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:49,990
The smile,
success after all is a quirk.

360
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,140
Life isn't real.
That's the message I give.

361
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,770
It's easy that way.
Plus who wants to live?

362
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,540
So needless to say,
the guy that I was telling this story to

363
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:10,320
never listened to it and things really
didn't go well for him for a long,

364
00:21:10,321 --> 00:21:14,700
long time and they really didn't go well
for him until he was willing to give up

365
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:16,800
some of the things he was carrying
along.

366
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,080
So he had acquired,
for example,

367
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:24,390
a numBer of things that he couldn't
afford and the fact that he was carrying

368
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:26,730
them right,
paying for them month after month,

369
00:21:26,731 --> 00:21:28,890
man,
he couldn't afford to get an education,

370
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,420
was perfectly willing to sacrifice the
possibility of getting an education for

371
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:36,510
the image of success rather than the
reverse.

372
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:38,970
Right?
And he was completely irritated that the

373
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,120
world,
because he had all these trappings of

374
00:21:42,121 --> 00:21:43,950
success,
which no one he admired,

375
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:46,800
also admired,
and he absolutely wasn't getting

376
00:21:46,801 --> 00:21:49,950
anywhere and he thought that was
tremendously unfair,

377
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,640
but the truth of the matter was that
how'd he put down what he was carrying

378
00:21:53,641 --> 00:21:56,430
for even a moment,
then he would have been able to get to

379
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:01,431
where he wanted to go.
And that's a motif that succinctly and

380
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:07,890
dramatically describes the necessity for
sacrifice.

381
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,020
One of the things you see in
psychotherapy very,

382
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:21,021
very commonly is that the person who's
coming for help does the same damn thing

383
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,880
over and over and over.
And every time they do it,

384
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,680
it has the same consequence bad.
So they ended up with the same kind of.

385
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,560
They ended up in the same kind of
relationship,

386
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,060
right?
It starts out well,

387
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,820
and the person turns against them and
starts to abuse them.

388
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,060
They get abused repeatedly than a dan's.
Then they meet someone else and the

389
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,100
cycle continues.
It doesn't seem to matter who they're

390
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,350
out with,
either they pick a person like this or

391
00:22:46,351 --> 00:22:48,300
they turn the person into someone like
that.

392
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,380
They lose jobs the same way.
Are there educational hopes failed the

393
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:53,910
same way?
Why?

394
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,290
Well,
the person thinks,

395
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,740
man,
the structure of the world is so unfair.

396
00:22:58,741 --> 00:23:01,080
Everyone else seems to be getting along
just fine,

397
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,420
but me,
I get hit in the head over and over

398
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,920
exactly the same way.

399
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,330
And then you think,
well,

400
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,050
what is the structure of the world?
Exactly.

401
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,700
And then you remember,
well,

402
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,150
you know,
there's the things you don't understand

403
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:19,050
and there's the things you do understand
and the things you do understand

404
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,250
structure you and protect you,
but you know sometimes the things you do

405
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,220
understand are the right things,
right?

406
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,280
You're valuing something.
You're carrying something that's an

407
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:34,050
impediment to your further progress and
it's frequently the case that it's the

408
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:37,440
kind of impediment that under no
conditions do you want to give up

409
00:23:37,441 --> 00:23:39,330
because there's something about you that
says,

410
00:23:39,331 --> 00:23:42,170
like john says about the ruby,
look,

411
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,170
it's a ruby.
Who the hell cares if it weighs 100

412
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:47,240
pounds and I have to stand by the road,
right?

413
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,410
I still got the ruby and all you'd ever
have to do is put the damn thing down

414
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:53,600
and wander off and everything would be
just fine,

415
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,100
but you won't do it.

416
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,770
Why?
Because you don't want to give up what

417
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,320
you know because you don't want to
sacrifice anything.

418
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,400
Well,
long before people had any psychological

419
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,230
acumen or any psychological knowledge,
they'd already figured out that if you

420
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:13,231
are going to take on a figure like this
and expect to get absolutely anywhere

421
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,210
with her right,
the horrors of the world,

422
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,110
you bloody well better be willing to
sacrifice whatever is necessary to keep

423
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:23,690
you going along your path right?
Unfortunately,

424
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,370
the things that you have to sacrifice
her,

425
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:26,990
often,
those things that you're most

426
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,200
particularly compelled by our grip,
by or value the things that you want to

427
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:37,130
give up least,
which is why in archaic societies where

428
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:40,190
all of this is dramatized,
people's sacrifice,

429
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,400
an animal that they value particularly
or earlier than that even a child that

430
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:53,811
they value particularly right?
Dramatically portraying the idea of

431
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,490
sacrifice.
You have to give something up if you

432
00:24:56,491 --> 00:25:00,270
Want to make an inroad on what she
represents,

433
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:05,220
and so then you say,
the purpose of sacrifice is to turn the

434
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:09,330
terrible aspect of the world into the
benevolent aspect of the world,

435
00:25:09,331 --> 00:25:14,331
and this is diana,
not a hindu goddess of a greek or roman

436
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,410
goddess.
Same

437
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,700
idea applies in the hindu case.
If you make the appropriate sacrifices,

438
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,290
then the terrible aspect of the world
turns into the benevolent aspect of the

439
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:33,270
world and it is the case that even
empirical studies of success indicate

440
00:25:33,271 --> 00:25:35,610
that intelligence is a handy thing to
have,

441
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,640
but hard work and dedication is a handy
thing to have to.

442
00:25:38,641 --> 00:25:42,390
And what that means is that you're
constantly willing to sacrifice the

443
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:46,980
impulsive pleasure of the president for
the hopes of payback in the future.

444
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,370
For example,
you sacrifice immediate gratification to

445
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:53,670
obtain an appropriate social role to
take your place in society.

446
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,860
It's definitely a sacrifice,
right?

447
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,070
Because you put off pleasures in the
moment to obtain longterm stability in

448
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,360
productivity
to turn the world into this

449
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,580
and so then you can say,

450
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,650
this is how the world falls apart.
As it's explored,

451
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:18,090
right,
so first of all,

452
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,890
there's the thing that you can't even
name that only fills you with dread,

453
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,790
but also with a sense of possibility,
and that manifests itself in your life

454
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,400
as something concrete that you don't
know,

455
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,000
promising and threat,
and that divides itself up into those

456
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:37,650
aspects of the world that you value in
and admire and that whole promise for

457
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:40,110
you and those aspects of the world that
don't.

458
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,730
And that's a differentiation,
a consequence of exploration.

459
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,420
It's not a differentiation of world into
objects though.

460
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,780
It's a differentiation of the world into
categories of emotion that was things

461
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:56,850
that are good for you.
Those things that are bad for you and

462
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,200
the source that they're derived from,
right?

463
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,600
That's the background of the world will
stop.

464
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,120
No.
