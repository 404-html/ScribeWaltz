1
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,790
So I'm going to read you something.
I get some,

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,030
I get a lot of mail and I don't know 
where I got this.

3
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:27,031
I have been a lot of different places in
the last week and this showed up at one 

4
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:30,970
of them and I'm going to read it to you.
I have no idea what to make of it.

5
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,160
It's written in a female hand.
So that's about all I can tell,

6
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:43,780
but there's no address or name on it.
This isn't a question,

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,580
but a comment or more accurately perhaps
a message.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
I spent this past weekend in an Iowaska 
ceremony,

9
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,710
which for those of you who don't know is
a South American visionary plant 

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,170
medicine.
Some of you may roll your eyes at this,

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,160
but IOWASCA brings you into direct 
contact with the archetypal realm of 

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,310
being.
Users of this medicine initiates,

13
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:17,311
I should say,
refer to Iowasca as she because the 

14
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:21,931
spirit of the plant is decidedly 
feminine and encounter with Iowasca is 

15
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:23,440
an encounter with the great mother of 
creation,

16
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,500
the goddess,
the void from which all things come.

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,150
The Feminine counterpart of Logos,
Dr Peterson,

18
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,650
you appeared in one of my Osca visions.

19
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,970
Thank you.

20
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,120
Might account for why have been rather 
fatigued late.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,590
Dr Peterson.
You appeared in one of my Iowasca 

22
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:56,840
visions and I asked,
I asked her,

23
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,410
who is Jordan Peterson?
What is he doing that which is something

24
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:05,411
I'd really like to know as well,
and she responded with Kristalina 

25
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:10,390
clarity quote here he is here to invoke 
and initiate the divine masculine 

26
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,740
principle on earth at this time.

27
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,020
Thank you.

28
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,050
So I'm up here to thank you deeply and 
profoundly on behalf of the great mother

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,460
herself,
the goddess,

30
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:36,461
the divine feminine principle who has 
been eagerly awaiting the awakening of 

31
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:40,130
the masculine principle into divinity 
and service.

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,760
So,
you know,

33
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,770
get a letter like that every day.
Actually I get a letter to like that 

34
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:53,321
every day.
So you know what went through my head 

35
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:59,090
when I read this and this is of course 
completely crazy,

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:04,860
but we know one of the things I learned 
to do as a psychotherapist was just to 

37
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,560
tell people who were talking to me,
what came into my head,

38
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,230
what I'm thinking.
Exactly.

39
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,850
Because that's not exactly the same 
thing,

40
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,360
you know what comes into your head is 
more like a dream.

41
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,940
It comes unbidden and it's like your 
imagination.

42
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,180
If you're thinking,
there seems to be like a voluntary 

43
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,180
element of that,
right?

44
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,840
I mean some of who God only knows how we
think,

45
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:26,310
but it.

46
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,390
It seems partly voluntary at least,
and you only thought about it,

47
00:03:31,941 --> 00:03:36,941
Carl young thought about it like a 
dialogue between the conscious mind and 

48
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,870
the unconscious mind.
There was a constant continual dialogue,

49
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:42,871
but when things just pop into your mind,
it's not much different than walking 

50
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:44,500
into a room.
Having something there,

51
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,440
which is an observation.
I also derived from young by the way,

52
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:52,441
because he pointed out quite rightly 
that people don't really think that 

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,600
thoughts appear to them.
Now you can think because you can take 

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,751
the thoughts that appear to you and then
you can subject them to criticism and 

55
00:04:00,751 --> 00:04:02,830
elaboration and so on instead of just 
assuming that they're true right off the

56
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:04,600
bat,
but people often don't do that.

57
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:09,601
They just.
Something just pops into their head and 

58
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:10,090
then they assume that it's true.
Anyways.

59
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:15,091
One of the things that I tend to do in 
psychotherapy is just to tell people 

60
00:04:15,091 --> 00:04:17,950
what pops into my head because,
well,

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,750
why?

62
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Because then the person that is talking 
to me gets one person's untrammeled 

63
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,800
opinion.
Not even that reaction,

64
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,840
not opinion.
It's not really an opinion.

65
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:34,780
I don't think an opinion maybe is what I
think later.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
And there's this personal flavor to it.
What popped into my head was this story 

67
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:42,520
about socrates,
you know,

68
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,080
he had this when he was being put on 
trial by the Athenians for corrupting 

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,821
the nation's youth.
Something I've been accused of by the 

70
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:57,151
way,
although it's not self evident to me 

71
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,210
that it's me doing the corrupting.
Um,

72
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,550
he said that somebody had asked him 
once,

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,990
had asked the delphic oracle once and 
the delphic oracle was this retreat that

74
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,620
you could go to if you were an ancient 
Greek citizen and you'd,

75
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,160
you'd,
you'd be there and you'd have a dream 

76
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,160
and then you'd go ask the delphic oracle
to interpret it.

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,590
And nobody really knows what was up with
the delphic oracle today,

78
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:25,591
how that worked exactly.
But she would interpret your dream in 

79
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:28,891
any case.
And somebody wants to ask her who the 

80
00:05:28,891 --> 00:05:33,391
wisest man in Greece was and the delphic
oracle said it was socrates because he 

81
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:36,970
knew he didn't know anything.
That's essentially the story that popped

82
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,490
into my mind.
It's a crazy comparison.

83
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:44,491
But you know,
I have a crazy wine so I guess that's 

84
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,671
how it works out.
So now one of the things I'm going to do

85
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:52,861
today,
which I haven't done before because I'm 

86
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:56,401
going to read you a little bit of.
I told you I finished my book last week 

87
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:57,610
and I haven't read it,
read to anyone.

88
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,190
I have given it to a couple of friends 
to review a one person in particular,

89
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,000
a screenwriter named Gregg Hurwitz has 
been unbelievably helpful.

90
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:13,001
He's so fast and so sharp at this sort 
of thing and I can send him like a 20 

91
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:18,461
page dense 20 page manuscript and he'll 
rip it to shreds and send it back to me 

92
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,410
and like 90 minutes.
It's just unbelievable.

93
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,090
He's so good at that.
He's been very helpful,

94
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:28,091
but I haven't.
No one else has seen it depart from my 

95
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:28,130
editor and I haven't read it to anyone.
So.

96
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,390
But some of it seemed particularly 
appropriate for tonight's lecture,

97
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,730
so I thought I would start the lecture 
tonight by reading a little bit of it,

98
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,800
and it's.
It's from a chapter.

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,940
It's on the issue of sacrifice as such.
This is Abraham and Isaac.

100
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,280
This is a very strange old testament 
story,

101
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:46,490
right?

102
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,490
This is one of the stories that's 
contained in the old testament that 

103
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,631
makes modern people think that maybe we 
should just not have that much to do 

104
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,510
with the old testament per say it at 
all,

105
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,511
and especially with regards and maybe 
shouldn't have anything to do with the 

106
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:02,210
god of the Old Testament either.
Because I mean,

107
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:07,211
as far as Abraham is concerned,
God tells him to sacrifice his own son.

108
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,650
Now it turns out that God was just 
kidding,

109
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,930
so to speak.
You know,

110
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,670
I'm obviously being flippant,
but it does raise the question,

111
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:19,370
what do you make of a divine being?
Who would,

112
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,580
who would require such thing,
such a thing?

113
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:27,581
Or conversely,
what do you make of Abraham who would 

114
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:27,590
have such delusions?
Either way,

115
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,860
it's a little hard on the what would you
call modern believability and moral 

116
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:36,140
integrity of the Old Testament,
but these are very,

117
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:39,860
very strange storks and they're not what
they seem to be or they are,

118
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,050
but they're more so.

119
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,700
We're going to talk a lot about 
sacrifice tonight and here's some of the

120
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,680
things that I've been thinking about 
sacrifice.

121
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,480
So this is from.
This book is called 12 rules for life,

122
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,050
an antidote for chaos and it's coming 
out in January,

123
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,280
which I think I mentioned and this is 
from rule seven,

124
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,940
which is do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.

125
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,870
And so here's,
here's some of the writing I've been 

126
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:15,590
doing over the last three years on the,
on the Motif of sacrifice.

127
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,520
I'll start with just a brief intro 
before I read this.

128
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,810
It took me a long time to understand 
what was meant in the Old Testament by 

129
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,190
sacrifice and which is strange because 
once I figured it out,

130
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,930
it seemed bloody obvious.
It seemed like,

131
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:31,580
oh y'all.
Obviously that's what it means,

132
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,840
but lots of times if you figure 
something out correctly,

133
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,750
it seems self evident as soon as you 
figured it out correctly.

134
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,130
Well,
we'll see how that goes,

135
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,710
but it seemed to work for me anyways.

136
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,660
I knew that of course,
at least implicitly I knew of the modern

137
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:55,661
usage of the idea of sacrifice.
Everyone understands that Motif is that 

138
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,560
if you want to make things better in the
future,

139
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,650
then you make sacrifices in the present 
and maybe you even do that 

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,580
multi-generationally.
In fact,

141
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,770
you most definitely do if you're a good 
parent.

142
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:12,870
I mean,
and that's I would say that's really 

143
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,610
particularly typical of of of immigrants
because immigrants often come from 

144
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,700
terrible places and have to undergo 
terrible things to come to a new 

145
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,451
community where they get a rough 
reception and have a hard time getting 

146
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:30,111
their life going and a big part of the 
reason that they do it is to make their 

147
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,450
lives of their children better and 
luckily when they come to Canada,

148
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,480
usually given where they came from,
that actually works because where they 

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,060
came from is worse and here is better.

150
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,740
Even though you know immigrants often 
have to struggle to to get on their feet

151
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,741
again,
they have to learn a new language and 

152
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,151
becoming culturated and face the fact 
that they're not part of the mainstream 

153
00:09:50,151 --> 00:09:50,250
culture and well,
you know,

154
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,430
many of you know the whole story,
so the idea that you make sacrifices for

155
00:09:55,861 --> 00:10:00,861
the future and you make sacrifices for 
your children and that's everyone 

156
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:05,031
understands that and it's part of being 
responsible and mature and shouldering 

157
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,030
the burden of being properly,
and you do that for yourself too.

158
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,680
If you're disciplined in,
in fact,

159
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:15,681
that's almost what discipline means.
That discipline means that you're 

160
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,250
capable of making sacrifices because 
you're not disciplined.

161
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:22,251
If you just do something you want more 
rather than something that you're doing 

162
00:10:22,251 --> 00:10:24,270
that's not disciplined,
that's maybe that works then great.

163
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,280
If your life is working out that way,
great man,

164
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:27,210
but that isn't.

165
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,300
That isn't disciplined.
This is plan is when you want to do 

166
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,400
something right now and instead you 
think,

167
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:35,400
no,
I'm going to forestall my gratification.

168
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,670
Maybe forever,
but certainly for a very long period of 

169
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,920
tar medium to long period of time and 
you concentrate on something that you 

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,270
think will bear fruit in the medium to 
long run,

171
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:50,271
and so you'll look into the future and 
you decide that by making today a little

172
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:56,301
less impulsively pleasurable,
shall we say you'll make tomorrow a 

173
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:59,160
little bit more secure and productive 
and then you actually do it too.

174
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,270
And that's difficult.
You know,

175
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:06,271
and we discussed last week,
Adam and Eve's discovery of the future 

176
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,520
and the revelation of the possibility of
the future,

177
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:16,090
including the possibility of tragedy and
suffering in the future.

178
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:21,150
And it's our knowledge of the 
possibility of tragedy and suffering in 

179
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,801
the future that motivates us to 
sacrifice in the present so that we can 

180
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:29,760
reduce the unnecessary anxiety and 
uncertainty and pain that awaits us.

181
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,500
Now.
That's a negative way of putting it.

182
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,940
We're also doing it so that we can have 
some joy and we can make life better and

183
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:36,690
all of that.
And,

184
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,140
and that's not trivial,
but the fundamental issue,

185
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:45,141
especially once you have small children,
this fundamental issue is to stave the 

186
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:47,070
suffering the hell off,
right?

187
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,980
That's what you want to do.
That's your primary moral obligation.

188
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:54,100
If you're a person who has any,
if your eyes are open at all,

189
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:59,101
that's your primary obligation and so 
you make the sacrifices that are 

190
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:02,350
necessary and you set up the future and 
well,

191
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,090
the the Motif of sacrifice is there in 
the Old Testament,

192
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,870
but it's more,
it's so concrete that it's difficult to 

193
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,480
draw a parallel between the two.
At least for me,

194
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:18,481
they didn't align self evidently and I 
don't remember in my rather limited 

195
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:24,390
religious education as a child in the 
United Church because I went to the 

196
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,430
United Church till I was about 13.

197
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,470
I don't ever remember anybody pointing 
out that the sacrifices that can enable,

198
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:37,341
we're making or the sacrifice that 
Abraham was supposed to make or the 

199
00:12:37,341 --> 00:12:38,710
sacrifices that people were making to 
God.

200
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,310
We're the call were the precursors,
let's say the dramatic precursors to the

201
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:50,941
psychological idea of sacrifice that we 
all hold as civilized people in the 

202
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:55,630
modern world.
So although it seems obvious,

203
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,220
as I said,
once you lay it out,

204
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,620
I don't remember that ever being 
explained to me,

205
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,390
but,
and then,

206
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,660
well,
and then let me read this.

207
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:04,960
So now that I sort of introduced it,
here's what happened.

208
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,800
As humanity developed,
first we're the endless tens or hundreds

209
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,871
of thousands of years prior to the 
emergence of written history and drama,

210
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,960
the twin practices of delay and exchange
began to emerge slowly and painfully.

211
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,720
So here's a cool psychological study.
So it's called the marshmallow test and 

212
00:13:28,661 --> 00:13:30,670
maybe it's even a reliable study.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,190
Even though it was done by social 
psychologists,

214
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,080
it's probably replicable and it's a nice
study.

215
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,560
So you take small children and you bring
them into a room and you put something 

216
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,230
that they would like in front of them,
a marshmallow and you then you torture 

217
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:54,331
them.
Basically you say see that marshmallow 

218
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:57,511
and the things I see that marshmallow.
It's like you can have that marshmallow 

219
00:13:58,031 --> 00:14:03,031
right now or if you wait,
I think the experiment is 10 minutes.

220
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,030
Then you can have two marshmallows.
And so that puts the child in quite a 

221
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:12,580
conundrum because they're being asked to
trade in actual concrete,

222
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,610
tangible marshmallow for two 
hypothetical future marshmallows and 

223
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:22,720
it's not that easy to conjure up a 
hypothetical future reality that has the

224
00:14:22,721 --> 00:14:27,721
same tangible significance as something 
real right in front of you.

225
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,460
And so it's amazing thing that people 
can do that.

226
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
And so then the experimenter leaves and 
some children's grabbed the marshmallow 

227
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,570
and just chomp that thing down right 
now.

228
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Other kids,
they videotaped kids while they're 

229
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,320
waiting and they do all sorts of things.
They whistled,

230
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:46,570
they look at the ceiling,
they sit on their hands,

231
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,310
you know,
they try to distract themselves.

232
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:52,490
Course they're eyeing that marshmallow,
like a squirrel lying and not and,

233
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,420
and trying to restrain themselves.
And you know,

234
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,460
what I see in that is that the child's 
prefrontal Cortex,

235
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:06,461
the higher cortical systems are warring 
with the underlying motivational 

236
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:10,871
systems,
more primordial motivational systems 

237
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:10,970
that govern such things as hunger.
The hunger system,

238
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:14,960
hypothalamic system says there is 
something sweet and fat,

239
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:15,860
right?
Sitting there,

240
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,500
right bloody.
Now grab that thing and stuff it down.

241
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,350
Now,
and I'm sure many of you have a constant

242
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:26,351
battle with your hypothalamus with 
regards to sweet and fat things and 

243
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:29,960
often lose so you can feel some sympathy
for the child,

244
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,230
but the hypothalamus has these 
tremendously powerful tendrils upward 

245
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:41,081
into the brain,
into the parts that we would associate 

246
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,051
more with voluntary control and the 
voluntary control centers have these 

247
00:15:44,051 --> 00:15:47,891
little weak ribbons going down to 
control the hypothalamus since it's 

248
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:50,780
pretty obvious if you know something 
about neuroanatomy,

249
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,540
what part is actually in charge when the
chips are down,

250
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,840
and it's not easy for children to learn 
to regulate those underlying primordial 

251
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,150
impulses.

252
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,210
The ones that are wired in,
the ones that we share with animals,

253
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,220
but they do it and,
and,

254
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,150
and the cool thing is,
this is what Walter Michelle found.

255
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:13,151
He's the guy who did the study,
was that the longterm outcome for the 

256
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:17,951
children who can delay gratification in 
the marshmallow test is much more 

257
00:16:17,951 --> 00:16:21,191
positive than it is for the children 
that are impulsive and eat the 

258
00:16:21,191 --> 00:16:23,960
marshmallow instantly.
It's delay of gratification.

259
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,980
Now it's likely that that's associated 
with trait conscientiousness,

260
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:32,981
although that specifically has that 
specific connection has not yet been 

261
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:35,150
established,
but they seem conceptually very,

262
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,020
very similar.
Um,

263
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,500
so,
so anyways,

264
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,770
this emerges in children probably 
between the ages of two and four,

265
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:50,771
something like that.
They should have it in place by four 

266
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:53,390
because it's very difficult for them to 
really interact well with other children

267
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:56,840
without having that delay of 
gratification in place because you can't

268
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:57,650
delay gratification.

269
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,010
Other kids don't like you because 
you're,

270
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,880
you want everything your way and you 
want it now and you're,

271
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,180
you're liable to temper tantrums and 
that sort of thing.

272
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:08,330
You haven't got to kind of self control 
necessary to make you fun to play with.

273
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,810
So you can see that emerging in children
and it's pretty.

274
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:14,240
It's pretty interesting.
And not only that,

275
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,500
if it emerges,
it predicts positive longterm outcomes,

276
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,690
just like trait conscientiousness does,
by the way,

277
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:25,691
because trait conscientiousness is the 
second best predictor of longterm 

278
00:17:25,691 --> 00:17:27,410
success over the lifespan.
In Western cultures,

279
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,370
it's second after intelligence.
And so in our societies,

280
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,910
the people who do best across time are 
the people who have high iqs and who 

281
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:38,300
work hard,
and I would say that's a pretty decent,

282
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,430
what would you call it?
It's a validation in some sense that our

283
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,160
cultures are working properly because 
what you would want,

284
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,130
I would say if the system is working 
meritocratic

285
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,130
Lee like it should,
and if you're trying to extract 

286
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,520
resources from those who can contribute 
at a higher rate than what you would 

287
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,240
want to have happen is that the 
hardworking,

288
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,060
smart people do better.
Hopefully.

289
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,910
If that's the case,
then everyone does better hopefully

290
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,680
anyways,
so you can see this developing in 

291
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,320
children first worthy,
endless tens or hundreds of thousands of

292
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:18,321
years.
Prior to the emergence of written 

293
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:18,780
history and drama,
the twin practices of delay and exchange

294
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,230
began to emerge slowly and painfully.
They hadn't.

295
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:27,231
They became represented in metaphorical 
abstraction as rituals and tales of 

296
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:29,490
sacrifice.
It says,

297
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:33,510
if there's a powerful figure in the sky 
who's judging you,

298
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,510
you better keep them happy or look the 
hell out.

299
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,710
We've been watching ourselves deal with 
him for a long time.

300
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,650
He seems to like it when you give up 
something you value,

301
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,530
so practice sharing and sacrificing 
until you get good at it.

302
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,720
No one actually said any of this so long
ago,

303
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,750
although they said something very 
similar,

304
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,880
but it was implicit in the practice and 
then in the stories action comes first.

305
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,690
Implicit comes first.
People watched the successful succeed 

306
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,280
and the unsuccessful fail for thousands 
and thousands of years and we thought it

307
00:19:14,281 --> 00:19:19,281
over and we drew a conclusion.
The successful among us sacrifice,

308
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:23,280
the successful among us,
delay gratification,

309
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,470
the successful among us bargain with the
future,

310
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:34,170
and then a great idea begins to emerge 
in evermore articulated form.

311
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,040
That idea is the point of a long and 
profound story.

312
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,490
It's the moral of this story and I'm 
going to engage in some foreshadowing 

313
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:52,281
here.
What's the difference between the 

314
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:55,281
successful and the unsuccessful?
The successful sacrifice and things get 

315
00:19:56,911 --> 00:20:00,900
better as the successful practice.
There are sacrifices.

316
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,950
The question becomes increasingly 
precise and simultaneously broader.

317
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,680
What is the greatest possible sacrifice 
for the greatest possible?

318
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,800
Good.
No.

319
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,510
If you.
If you push a question in section,

320
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,840
perhaps there comes a time when you 
can't formulate it any more precisely 

321
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,110
and broadly and and,
and that,

322
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,780
that,
that,

323
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,950
that's the point at which the question 
in some sense,

324
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,290
and perhaps even the answer,
the question becomes archetipal,

325
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,070
it becomes archetipal because it,
it can't be bested and,

326
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,640
and this is like an ultimate question in
some sense.

327
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:41,910
How are you going to ask a more broad 
based question than that?

328
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,420
What is given the initial 
presuppositions that you have to make 

329
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,301
sacrifices?
Then the logical end point to that is 

330
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:50,301
something like,
okay,

331
00:20:50,301 --> 00:20:53,731
if you have to make a sacrifice,
was the greatest possible sacrifice and 

332
00:20:53,731 --> 00:20:55,450
for the greatest possible good.
Now that's a good question.

333
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,930
The answer becomes increasingly 
profound.

334
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:05,030
The God of Western tradition,
like so many gods requires sacrifice.

335
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,230
We've already examined why,
but sometimes he goes even further and 

336
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,300
requires the sacrifice of what is love 
best.

337
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,530
This is why,
and this is another one of mankind's 

338
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,730
fundamental discoveries.
Sometimes things do not go well,

339
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,960
that,
that self evident,

340
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,110
but here's the rub.
Sometimes when things are not going 

341
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,951
well,
it's precisely that which is most 

342
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,890
valued.
That is the cause,

343
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,720
why?
It's because the world is revealed 

344
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,780
through the template of your values.
If the world you are seeing is not the 

345
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,531
world you want,
therefore it's time to examine your 

346
00:21:51,531 --> 00:21:55,371
values.
It's time to rid yourself of your 

347
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:58,640
current presuppositions.
There's a famous experiment that I've 

348
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,570
alluded to a couple of times I believe 
in this lecture series,

349
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,520
the invisible gorilla experiment,
and in the invisible gorilla experiment,

350
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:09,990
there's two teams of players,
each with three members,

351
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:12,120
one dressed in black and the other 
dressed in white,

352
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:17,121
and each team is passing the basketball 
back and forth to the team members and 

353
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:21,030
milling about.
You see a video of them doing so.

354
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:26,031
They've basically filled the video 
screen and the white team is passing a 

355
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:29,961
basketball to the white team.
Members in the block team is passing a 

356
00:22:29,961 --> 00:22:32,520
basketball to the black team members.
And your job as,

357
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,790
as far as the experimenter is concerned,
is for you to count the number of times 

358
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,540
that the black black team,
yes,

359
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:42,300
black team passes the basketball back 
and forth.

360
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,300
So that's what you do,
so now you have an ambition and a name 

361
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,050
and a value and they ambition and the 
aim and the value,

362
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:52,080
they're all the same thing and that is 
to perform well at the task.

363
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,110
Now the thing that's so cool about this,
and this is really so cool,

364
00:22:55,111 --> 00:23:00,111
it's just unbelievably.
It's just unbelievable that this is the 

365
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,430
case.
It's like a complete validation of,

366
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,530
of a certain element of the Buddhist 
worldview.

367
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,180
So they pass the ball for a couple of 
minutes and then the experimenter says 

368
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:11,370
to you,
how many?

369
00:23:11,371 --> 00:23:16,371
And you say 15 and [inaudible] you're 
happy and you're happy with yourself 

370
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:16,371
because you've been paying attention.
And,

371
00:23:16,371 --> 00:23:17,610
and the experimenter says,
yeah,

372
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:18,810
that's right.
Or maybe not.

373
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:21,480
Maybe you missed one.
And then the experimenter says,

374
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,360
did you see the gorilla?
And half of you say,

375
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,740
what?
What,

376
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,590
what gorilla?
Like really?

377
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,980
And he and the experimenter says yes.
And then he rewinds it and plays the 

378
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,551
video.
And like a minute and a half into the 

379
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:37,551
three minute video.
Sure enough,

380
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,650
in walks this guy in a gorilla suit,
six foot three or so stands in the 

381
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,950
middle of the game,
right in the middle of the game,

382
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,490
the same size as the players,
perfectly obviously evident beats his 

383
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:57,461
chest for like a second and a half and 
then sorta saunders off and half the 

384
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:01,400
people who watched the video don't see 
the gorilla,

385
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,850
which is absolutely shocking,
and what that means is that your 

386
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,540
ambitions blind you to the nature of 
reality.

387
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:14,770
Now they eliminate some reality,
but they blind you to most of it and 

388
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,840
that's fine because you're not.
There's not a lot of you.

389
00:24:17,841 --> 00:24:22,841
In some ways,
you're very pinpoint thing like a laser 

390
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:23,780
beam and so you just can't be attending 
to everything all the time.

391
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,530
But one of the things that you might ask
yourself once you know that is that if 

392
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,951
you're suffering dreadfully than one 
possibility is that you're so fixed on 

393
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,900
the point.
You're so fixed on a point.

394
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:42,130
The fact that you're so fixed on the 
point that you're fixed on might be 

395
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,590
integrally related to why things are 
going so catastrophic it wrong.

396
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,490
Now perhaps not because you know there's
a lot of arbitrary ness about life and 

397
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,720
perhaps you suffer even when you don't 
deserve to.

398
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:56,090
That seems to happen in the book of Job 
for example,

399
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,240
because job is a good guy and God has a 
bet with Satan,

400
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:04,241
which seems like another relatively 
nasty thing to do to let's say just 

401
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,721
torture him and he does quite nicely to 
see if he'll turn against God and it 

402
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,910
seems like a rather playground sort of 
thing for God to engage in.

403
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:18,500
But the point is is that even in a 
document like the Old Testament,

404
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:23,501
there's ample suggestion that sometimes 
people just get wiped out and hurt even 

405
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:28,790
if they're living good moral lives,
aiming properly and all that.

406
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:33,110
There's an arbitrary this in life that's
not radical,

407
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:38,111
but it's possible that it's what you're 
clinging to that's hurting you and it's 

408
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:41,030
even possible.

409
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,790
That's the thing that you're clinging to
the hardest that's hurting you the most.

410
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,820
That could easily be someone you love.
Like lots of times I see people in 

411
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,331
therapy and they're miserable for one 
reason or another and sometimes it's 

412
00:25:52,331 --> 00:25:56,081
because they have a very close 
relationship with a family member and 

413
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:56,960
that just isn't working.
You know,

414
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:01,961
the family member for the sake of 
simplicity we'll say is not really 

415
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:05,120
oriented towards helping them have a 
good life.

416
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,540
The family member is instead oriented 
towards making them as bloody miserable 

417
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,780
as you can possibly make anyone and and 
what would you say?

418
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,930
Exploiting the bond between family 
members in order to enable that and then

419
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,830
sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary
is either merely distancing yourself 

420
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:33,821
from that person,
sometimes substantively and sometimes 

421
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:38,290
seriously distancing yourself from like 
we don't talk anymore ever and so that's

422
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,110
pretty damn rough and it hurts and all 
of that,

423
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:43,890
but,
but

424
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,940
it's a good example of the fact that 
sometimes in order to extract yourself 

425
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:54,690
from the miserable bit of chaos that you
happen to be in meshed in.

426
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,300
You have to let go of what you love 
best.

427
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,470
If the world you are seeing is not the 
world you want,

428
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:04,110
therefore it's time to examine your 
values.

429
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,170
That's really worth.
It's really worth thinking about,

430
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:12,171
you know,
because the alternative is to curse 

431
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:12,171
fate,
right?

432
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:13,200
Because if it isn't you and there's 
nothing you can do to change,

433
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,910
there isn't something you're doing 
that's wrong.

434
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,910
Then it's fate itself.
It's the world itself.

435
00:27:17,911 --> 00:27:20,570
It's other people let's say because 
they're a huge part of the world or it's

436
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,580
the nature of the world itself or,
or it's God himself in whatever form you

437
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,070
either believe in or don't believe in 
because it's fundamentally all the same 

438
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,800
in this situation that I'm describing.

439
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,460
So.
And one of the things that's really 

440
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,291
interesting and I mentioned this before 
about the Israelites in the Old 

441
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,050
Testament,
is that they got this right.

442
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:45,051
It's really something because what 
happens to the Israelites over and over 

443
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:49,041
in the Old Testament is that they get 
all puffed up about how wonderful they 

444
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:53,391
are and then they make moral errors 
because they're arrogant and then God 

445
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:57,381
comes along and just cuts them into 
pieces for like generation after 

446
00:27:57,381 --> 00:28:00,981
generation and they wobble back to their
feet and they always maintain the same 

447
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:03,780
attitude,
which is we did something wrong.

448
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,070
We did something wrong.
It's like it's like,

449
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,010
it's like an axiom rather than 
observation is that if we're not,

450
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,940
if things are not laying themselves out 
for us as they should be,

451
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,150
then we cannot curse God.
We have to look to ourselves while and 

452
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:20,970
you think,
well,

453
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,720
why not curse?

454
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,600
God knows.
Maybe it's his fault.

455
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,280
That's a really good question and one of
the things that I've tried to figure out

456
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,250
over the last 30 years is,
well,

457
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:37,251
why not just curse God?
Because there is this arbitrary element 

458
00:28:37,251 --> 00:28:40,581
to existence and we are vulnerable and 
there is plenty of suffering and things 

459
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:41,760
are unfair,
like there's problems,

460
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,740
right?
There's injustice and unfairness and all

461
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:45,750
of these things and an endless 
suffering,

462
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:50,520
so why not just laid at the feet of God 
and the whether God exists or not.

463
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,990
In some sense,
by the way,

464
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,950
with regards to the metaphysics of this 
particular discussion is not relevant.

465
00:28:55,951 --> 00:29:00,951
It's the point remains the same either 
way and the answer is as far as I can 

466
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:05,811
tell that if you refuse to take on the 
responsibility yourself and you 

467
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:11,391
attempted to lay it at the feet of 
either society or being itself,

468
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,680
then you instantly start to act in a way
that makes everything much worse,

469
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,980
not only for you but for everyone else 
and maybe even for being itself and so 

470
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,080
it's not helpful.
Now,

471
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,510
if you're.
If you decide that it's you,

472
00:29:27,511 --> 00:29:29,910
you've got the problem,
maybe that's not even true,

473
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:34,911
like maybe you are someone who's being 
tortured by the bet between God and 

474
00:29:34,911 --> 00:29:37,050
Satan and like too bad for you if that 
happens to be the case,

475
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,470
but it still seems to be the appropriate
thing

476
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
for a human being who's standing on his 
or her own two feet in a proper manner 

477
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,150
to take the responsibility on for 
themselves regardless of the counter 

478
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,920
arguments that might be made against it.
That's really something.

479
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,690
It's time to rid yourself of your 
current presuppositions.

480
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:03,700
I also think of that it's a deadwood 
issue.

481
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:08,701
You know,
one of the things you see with motifs 

482
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:11,431
like the pair of the Phoenix,
remember when Harry Potter goes off to 

483
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:13,480
fight,
he's like St George.

484
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:16,240
He goes off to fight the hell.
Is that thing,

485
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,400
the bast list that turns you to stone?
When you look at it,

486
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,290
it's a dragon.
For all intents and purposes,

487
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,740
it's guarding.
Avert a virgin for.

488
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,040
What's her name?
For just not Virginia.

489
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,520
It's close to that though.
Ginny.

490
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,970
Ginny Ginevra,
right?

491
00:30:27,971 --> 00:30:30,280
Which is a variant of virgin and very 
introvert,

492
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,780
Virginia.
Well,

493
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:36,640
when he gets bitten by the,
by the dragon and poisoned,

494
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,890
that's the dragon of chaos,
right?

495
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,170
The thing that turns you to stone,
when you look at it,

496
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:45,340
when he gets bitten by it,
then he's going to die and yeah,

497
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:50,341
well,
if you get bitten by the thing that 

498
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:50,341
turns you to stone when you look at it,
if it bites you,

499
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:50,920
man,
if you're not dead,

500
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,600
you're going to wish you are.
It's one of the two,

501
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,100
and then the phoenix flies in and cries 
tears into the wound and that heals 

502
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,350
them.
And the Phoenix is the thing that allows

503
00:30:59,351 --> 00:31:04,300
the dead wood to burn off occasionally,
let's say.

504
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:04,600
Well,
it's,

505
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:09,601
I think it's once every hundred years 
with the Phoenix and of course it's 

506
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:12,331
pretty dramatic.
The whole damn bird has to go up in 

507
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:12,331
flames and then there's nothing left but
an egg.

508
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:14,110
But there's a very serious message there
too,

509
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:19,111
which is that you can compare yourself 
in some sense to a forest fire,

510
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,520
to a forest,
you know,

511
00:31:20,521 --> 00:31:21,910
in a forest has to burn now.

512
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,910
And then for the deadwood to clear so 
that the forest can actually maintain 

513
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,841
its continued existence.
And if you stop the forest from burning 

514
00:31:30,841 --> 00:31:32,680
for a prolonged period of time,
which happened in the United States when

515
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,960
they were trying to manage the forest 
fires too tightly,

516
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,230
then all that happens is the dead would 
accumulate and accumulate and 

517
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,411
accumulates and accumulates and 
accumulates until the whole damn forest 

518
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:45,310
is dead wood.
And then lightning hits it and it burned

519
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:49,450
so hot that it burns the topsoil off.
And then there's nothing left.

520
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,300
Nothing grows.
And so that's a good moral lesson,

521
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,270
which is don't wait too long to let the 
dam did,

522
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:56,600
would burn off,
you know,

523
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,770
maybe a little self immolation on a 
daily basis might be preferable to 

524
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:03,880
burning yourself all the way down to the
bedrock,

525
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,830
you know,
once every 20 years or so.

526
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:10,831
Because maybe there won't be anything 
left of you when you do that and you 

527
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:11,130
know that happens to people all the 
time.

528
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,390
I've seen that happen to people many,
many times.

529
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,180
The deadwood accumulates the mess around
them,

530
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,940
gathers the chaos that they haven't 
dealt with accumulates.

531
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,150
And then one day the spark comes and 
they burned so far and so fast that 

532
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,990
there's not enough left of them to 
recover.

533
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:28,480
And then they're the people who've been 
eaten by the beast.

534
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:30,860
They are the people who've been eaten by
the Dragon.

535
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:34,210
And now we're inside its belly.
Another very common architectural motif.

536
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,540
And while maybe a hero will come along 
and rescue them or maybe they'll just 

537
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,490
stay in there forever.
And that's a precursor

538
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
to the idea of hell.
And it's not something I would 

539
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,011
recommend.
So a little medicine on a regular basis 

540
00:32:48,011 --> 00:32:49,580
is a lot better too.
Then total emulation.

541
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,960
I'm on terms other than your own 
sporadically.

542
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,540
It's time to rid yourself of your 
current presuppositions.

543
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,510
There's another thing that

544
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,570
see in the Soviet Union went 
solzhenitsyn,

545
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,790
wrote about the Soviet Union and its 
pathologies.

546
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:12,490
It,
it sort of peaked in terms of it's 

547
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,831
pathological authoritarianism when it 
became illegal to complain that your 

548
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:18,850
life wasn't going well and you just 
think about how horrible that Esa.

549
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,850
Because because you know lots of times 
you're isn't going well,

550
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,520
and I don't mean this in some casual 
way.

551
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:26,720
I mean maybe,
I don't know,

552
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:31,721
maybe you have diabetes in your own.
Maybe you're gonna lose your feet or 

553
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:35,891
something like it's really not.
It's nothing trivial that's going on 

554
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:36,170
here.
Something is not good.

555
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,200
Or maybe it's economic or maybe you're 
unemployed or,

556
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,440
and.
But you see the idea of the Soviet Union

557
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:43,820
was,
well,

558
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,720
we already have all the answers.
Everything's perfect already.

559
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,390
That's what totalitarians think.
Well,

560
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,770
if everything's perfect and you're 
suffering,

561
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,490
then well maybe there's something wrong 
with you because everything is perfect 

562
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:00,770
after all.

563
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,930
And if you're a suffering then and what 
are you gonna come out and say,

564
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:03,680
well,
I'm suffering.

565
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:08,681
It's like,
well then your evidence that things 

566
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:08,681
aren't perfect,
right?

567
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:10,850
You're a widow or an orphan in an old 
testament story,

568
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:13,160
you know when the Kings got too high and
mighty,

569
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,920
then they wouldn't pay enough attention 
to the widows and the orphans,

570
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,390
and then the profit would come along and
say,

571
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,990
you know what?
Those widows and orphans a lot more 

572
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,991
important than you think they are,
and if you don't pay attention to them 

573
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,301
properly,
then things are going to fall apart 

574
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:30,881
around you in a way that you just can't 
even imagine and so well then you're 

575
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:31,480
sort of like your own widow in your own 
orphaned,

576
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,690
but you don't get to say,
hey look,

577
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:37,691
you know things aren't perfect yet 
because I'm actually having still quite 

578
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:40,841
a rough time here.
You don't get to admit to your own 

579
00:34:40,841 --> 00:34:44,171
suffering.
If you can't admit to your own 

580
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:46,130
suffering,
then you certainly see the suffering,

581
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,850
especially the additional suffering.
The excess suffering should be treated 

582
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,990
as evidence that you're not doing 
something quite right yet.

583
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,170
It should be treated as evidence that 
you're wrong.

584
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,500
There's something important that you're 
doing that's wrong.

585
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,680
I understand how harsh that is,
and I'm not saying that everyone who is 

586
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,091
suffering is suffering because they're 
doing something in some simple way 

587
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:13,200
that's wrong.
I was in an elevator once in a hospital.

588
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,610
It was a very terrifying thing and this 
person got on who was just in an 

589
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,070
absolute state of shock,
you know,

590
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:24,130
I mean,
it was really not good and I don't 

591
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,880
remember how this happened,
but I engaged the person in conversation

592
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:31,881
and they just said that they had just 
been diagnosed with what looked to be 

593
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,380
terminal cancer.
And uh,

594
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,650
what was horrifying about it was that 
what they were doing was going over life

595
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,680
in the elevator trying to figure out 
what they had done in order to deserve 

596
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:42,680
such a fate.
You know,

597
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,910
they immediately taken it on themselves 
as a moral failing.

598
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,910
And that's not what I'm saying.
You can't come up to someone who has 

599
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:49,910
cancer and say,
well,

600
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,990
if you weren't such a bloody idiot 
throughout your whole life,

601
00:35:51,991 --> 00:35:53,280
you wouldn't have cancer.
And believe me,

602
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:58,281
that happens a lot more than you think.
And people who have diseases like that 

603
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:58,680
get blamed for it.
That's not what I'm saying.

604
00:35:58,681 --> 00:35:59,820
It's not like that.
It's,

605
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,670
it's,
it's,

606
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,800
it's a more generalized attitude.
That is that if life isn't yet what it 

607
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,870
should be,
then you have a response.

608
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,270
You have a primary responsibility to do 
something about it,

609
00:36:09,271 --> 00:36:14,271
and the place to start looking is to 
your own errors and to fix them.

610
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,130
And that's.
And that's,

611
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,100
that's,
that's a safe bet man,

612
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:25,101
because you're probably doing some 
things that you wouldn't have to be 

613
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:25,410
doing that if you fixed would make 
things better.

614
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,070
So it's time to let go and to sacrifice 
who you are for who you could become.

615
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:49,990
There's an old story about how to catch 
a monkey in case any of you are 

616
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:54,760
interested in how to catch a monkey.
Now you're now you're going to know how 

617
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,670
to do it.
First you have to take a large,

618
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,910
narrow neck jar just large enough in 
diameter at the top for a monkey to put 

619
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:06,371
his hand inside.
Then you have to fill it partway with 

620
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:08,951
rocks.
So it's too heavy for the monkey to 

621
00:37:08,951 --> 00:37:10,721
carry,
then you scatter some treats near the 

622
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,680
jar to attract them and you put some 
inside inside the narrow neck jar.

623
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,170
A monkey will come along if you're lucky
and grabbed the goodies,

624
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,290
but he'll want the ones inside the jar 
too.

625
00:37:21,291 --> 00:37:24,590
So then put his hand in there and grab 
what's in there.

626
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,020
And if you've set up your monkey trap 
properly,

627
00:37:27,021 --> 00:37:31,820
then he won't be able to get his hand 
out because he's got the goodies.

628
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:38,910
Not Without unclenching his hand,
not without relinquishing what he 

629
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:42,661
already has.
The monkey coucher can just walk over 

630
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:45,691
and just pick up the monkey because the 
monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice 

631
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:48,700
thing because he's just a monkey,
you know?

632
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,780
And so you can catch him as a 
consequence of his own.

633
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,990
An regulated hypothalamic desires to be.
What would you say,

634
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:03,880
charitable to the Monkey if you put out 
candy or something like that.

635
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,500
So like how often does a monkey get 
candy?

636
00:38:05,501 --> 00:38:08,440
He's probably a little more motivated 
than you are to not let go.

637
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:12,910
But you can get the point.
The monkey catcher can just walk over to

638
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:17,911
the jar and pick up the monkey.
The animal will not sacrifice the part 

639
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:18,730
for the whole.
That's actually a pretty good phrase.

640
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:23,731
Hey,
it's the animal that will not sacrifice 

641
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:26,371
the part for the whole.
Perhaps this story is apocryphal,

642
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,620
but as an eccentric psychology professor
once told me,

643
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,960
fiction lies to you in the most truth,
in the most truthful possible manner,

644
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,580
something valuable given up ensures 
future prosperity,

645
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,590
something valuable,
sacrificed,

646
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,100
pleases the Lord.
Those are equivalent statements.

647
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,620
One's more articulated,
I would say.

648
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,621
That's the first statement,
and the second one is more dramatic and 

649
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:52,930
more embedded in a collective religious 
dream.

650
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:57,931
You might say,
what's most valuable and best 

651
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:57,931
sacrificed?
Well,

652
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:59,410
obviously that depends on the culture 
and the time.

653
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,260
What is it least emblematic of that?
A choice cut of meat.

654
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,370
Well,
if you're a herdsman,

655
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,110
for example,
that that's a big deal.

656
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,130
If,
I mean,

657
00:39:08,131 --> 00:39:09,900
generally speaking,
throughout human history,

658
00:39:09,901 --> 00:39:12,480
meat has been a very valuable commodity 
as it is.

659
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,770
By the way,
among chimpanzees.

660
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,800
Chimpanzees hunt,
they like to hunt colobus monkeys and 

661
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,641
you know they'll,
they'll basically start eating the damn 

662
00:39:22,641 --> 00:39:25,041
monkey lie.
They weigh about 40 pounds despite the 

663
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:28,371
fact that the thing is screaming away 
and that's pretty interesting because 

664
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:30,960
one of the things that indicates is that
male monkeys that mail chimp's,

665
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:35,961
they're the ones that do the hunting,
aren't really inhibited that much when 

666
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:41,150
they're in your mode by what you might 
describe as empathy and there's certain 

667
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:43,830
elements of human behavior that are 
reminiscent of that.

668
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:48,831
You see that sort of thing have merged 
now and then in human battlefields when 

669
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,930
groups of men seem to abandoned all 
internal regulation whatsoever to a 

670
00:39:55,831 --> 00:40:00,210
degree that makes you wonder if internal
regulation even exists.

671
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,750
Nice cut of meat,
well meets valuable.

672
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,780
You know,
and here's a good document by Richard 

673
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,650
Wrangham.
I think while back a book about the 

674
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:17,130
human invention of fire.
I think I told you a little bit about 

675
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,751
this random claim that we invented,
fire or discovered fire mastered it 

676
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:24,130
maybe two or 3 million years ago.
That's a long time longer than people 

677
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,221
had thought and that that's what 
actually transformed us physiologically 

678
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:30,431
from our chimp,
like ancestors into the sort of spelt 

679
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,450
creatures we are now because it's a lot 
easier to digest cooked meat and meat is

680
00:40:32,451 --> 00:40:35,400
a terminal,
the source of of nutrition,

681
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,740
energy,
raw materials,

682
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,300
all of that,
especially if it's cooked.

683
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,890
So me,
it's a big deal.

684
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,330
Cooked meat is a big deal and maybe it's
a choice cut of meat.

685
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:45,580
The

686
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,080
kindy might offer to a guest if you're 
not A.

687
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,340
I always say this wrong.
Is it Vegan,

688
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,960
Vegan or Vegan?
I was Vegan,

689
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:56,550
but that's wrong.
That's a star.

690
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,690
Vegas a start,
right?

691
00:40:57,691 --> 00:41:01,990
They're not like star creatures.
They're there anyway,

692
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,530
so you know,
you might offer that,

693
00:41:04,531 --> 00:41:08,730
especially,
especially if a guest came to your abode

694
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:11,850
and you were heard,
man,

695
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,880
you might sacrifice a high end animal 
and offer your guests a nice choice cut 

696
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:22,911
of meat and that would actually matter.
It would mean something from the best 

697
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,810
animal in a flock.
What's above even that?

698
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:30,470
Well,
in terms of the thing you could 

699
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,140
sacrifice while your best animal.
That's good.

700
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,550
Well,
how about you?

701
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,120
How about your child,
how about you?

702
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,210
Well,
that would be next on the hierarchy.

703
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:39,860
It's kind of hard to get past that.
Right,

704
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:44,861
and I think it's a.
it's a toss up whether the sacrifice is 

705
00:41:45,511 --> 00:41:47,340
greater.
If it's you or if it's your child.

706
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,120
I would say being a parent that is 
greater if it's your child,

707
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,120
because I think most people who have 
established

708
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,180
a

709
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,070
I hate,
I hesitate to say proper,

710
00:41:59,071 --> 00:42:04,071
but I'm going to anyway.
He's a proper relationship with their 

711
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:04,071
children.
It's if push came to shove,

712
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,720
they'd take the bullet and let their kid
go live.

713
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,660
The sacrifice of the mother is 
exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's

714
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,000
great sculpture.
The Ada.

715
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,130
Mary is Contemplating Her son crucified 
in ruins,

716
00:42:21,131 --> 00:42:23,050
so that's his body after he's being 
crucified,

717
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,180
it's her fault.
It was through her.

718
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:28,540
He entered the great drama of being.
So what's the meaning of this sculpture?

719
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:33,541
It's a great sculpture.
It's just an absolutely unbelievable 

720
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:36,691
sculpture.
You just can't believe that someone 

721
00:42:36,691 --> 00:42:39,780
could exist who could make something up.
Of course it wasn't the only thing 

722
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:39,780
Michael Angelo made,
right?

723
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,200
It was like,
that's it.

724
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:46,201
It was something he just tossed off and 
a couple of months while he was doing 

725
00:42:46,201 --> 00:42:47,320
other unbelievable things,
but you know,

726
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,600
it's,
it's an,

727
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,640
it's an object of contemplation,
which is why it's integrate cathedral,

728
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,650
integrate city.
It's an object of contemplation and the 

729
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,570
ideas.
Something like what,

730
00:42:58,571 --> 00:43:03,571
what,
what's the role of a mother if she's 

731
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:06,811
awake.
I had a client come to see me a while 

732
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:06,811
back,
not very long ago,

733
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,230
woman in about who's about 30 and trying
to make decisions about her life.

734
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,390
She was pretty career oriented and so I 
asked her about,

735
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,210
although maybe having a bit of trouble 
with their career.

736
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,520
I've seen this many,
many times,

737
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,700
so this is an amalgam.
This is a story that's an amalgam and I 

738
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,780
talked to her about the other elements 
of your life.

739
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:29,830
It's,

740
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,480
Oh,
you know,

741
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,140
there's only five things you do in life,
so you've got your career down,

742
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,590
know what do you do outside of your 
career that's meaningful and engaging.

743
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:43,400
How are things going with your family?
Could be your family of origin,

744
00:43:43,401 --> 00:43:44,480
your siblings,
whatever.

745
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,630
Do you have an intimate relationship and
like what's your plan for your own 

746
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,760
family?
And apart from those five things there's

747
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:56,250
sort of something like get some exercise
now and then don't eat too badly and try

748
00:43:56,251 --> 00:43:57,860
to stay away from the drugs,
you know,

749
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,580
that,
that,

750
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:03,610
that kind of had an,
a crime that kind of lays out life and 

751
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800
if you miss any of those five things or 
if you do any of those other things 

752
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,301
wrong,
then you're in trouble and you can get 

753
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:13,301
away with missing a couple of them,
but not all of them,

754
00:44:13,301 --> 00:44:17,170
you know?
And she said something along the lines 

755
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,170
of,
well,

756
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,170
I'm not sure I should bring a child into
this world.

757
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,590
And I thought,
Oh god Christ,

758
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,150
you got to come up with something better
than that.

759
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:22,340
Such a bloody cliche,
which is what I told her.

760
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:22,820
I said,
you know,

761
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,220
you must have thought that up when you 
were 16.

762
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:26,210
It's like,
really?

763
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:28,220
That's your,
you can't do any better.

764
00:44:28,221 --> 00:44:29,810
This was a very,
very smart woman.

765
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:30,430
It's like,
really?

766
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:31,980
You can't do any better than that.

767
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,480
It's like,
yes,

768
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,880
obviously this is a veil of tears and a,
you know,

769
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:40,881
a well of suffering and all of that.
If you asked 30 people who are wondering

770
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,800
about having children,
why they're wondering,

771
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,150
20 of them will say that and so that 
that tells you how original it is.

772
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,430
It's not original at all.
It's not a thought.

773
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:51,840
It's like this little.
It's like a.

774
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:53,580
it's like a.
it's a meme.

775
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:58,600
It's something that lives in your mind.
It's not a thought and it's certainly 

776
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:02,781
not something.
It's certainly not something that you 

777
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:02,781
should just take it face value and say,
oh,

778
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:03,810
well I'm not having a family.
Then it's like,

779
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,250
no,
no.

780
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,170
You kind of look at that and you 
criticize it a little bit.

781
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,060
It's like,
well,

782
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,900
the pop.
The other one,

783
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:14,901
that's the other one that's very common.
There's too many people on the planet 

784
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:14,901
already.

785
00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:18,900
It's like,
I really don't like that statement.

786
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,500
It's like,
just who are you going to ask to leave?

787
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,540
Just how are you going to get them to 
leave?

788
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,960
You know?
It's a serious question and who says 

789
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,051
there's too many people?
What the Hell's wrong with people 

790
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:34,350
anyways when we're running around 
ruining the planet?

791
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:39,530
Yeah,
so like I think it was the club of Rome 

792
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:42,590
who,
who prophesied by the way that there 

793
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:42,590
would be so many people on the planet by
the year 2000,

794
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:46,760
that there would be widespread 
starvation and they were completely and 

795
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,380
utterly wrong about that and I think it 
was the club of Rome who either compared

796
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:52,200
us to a virus or a cancer on the face of
the planet.

797
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:53,130
It's like,
oh,

798
00:45:53,131 --> 00:45:54,910
really?
That's what you think about people a,

799
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,140
aren't you something?
Isn't that something to think about?

800
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:00,360
Human beings,
viruses and cancer.

801
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:04,410
What do you do with viruses and cancer?
Invite them in and make them at home.

802
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:05,130
It's like,
no,

803
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,220
you tried to eradicate them.
If you've got a bloody well watch your 

804
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,161
metaphors folks,
because it isn't clear that you come up 

805
00:46:13,161 --> 00:46:14,190
with them or that they run you,
so you better watch him.

806
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,960
Thank you.

807
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,890
So anyways,
Mary and Mary's the great mother,

808
00:46:21,891 --> 00:46:23,240
right?
That she's the mother.

809
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:28,300
That's what Mary is.
Whether she existed or not is not the 

810
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,720
point.
She exists at least as a hyper reality.

811
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:33,350
She exists as the mother will.
What's the sacrifice of the mother?

812
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:38,620
Well,
that's easy if you're a mother and if 

813
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,640
you're a mother who's worth her salt,
you offer your son to be destroyed by 

814
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:42,860
the world.
That's what you do.

815
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,720
I mean,
that's what's going to happen,

816
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:50,110
right?
He's gonna be born and he's going to 

817
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:50,420
suffer.
He's gonna have his trouble in life.

818
00:46:50,421 --> 00:46:55,421
He's going to have his illnesses.
He's going to face his failures and 

819
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:59,060
catastrophes and he's going to die.
That's what's going to happen,

820
00:46:59,061 --> 00:47:00,740
and if you're awake,
you know that,

821
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,180
and then you say,
well,

822
00:47:02,181 --> 00:47:07,181
perhaps he will live in a way that will 
justify that and then you try to have 

823
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:10,130
that happen and that's what makes you 
worthy of a statue like that,

824
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:17,490
but still the sacrifice of the mother.
Is it right to bring a baby into this 

825
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:21,000
terrible world?

826
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,590
Well,
every woman asked yourself that question

827
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,990
and some say no,
and they have the reasons Mary answers.

828
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:28,980
Yes.
Voluntarily.

829
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,140
Mary is the archetype of the woman who 
answers yes to life voluntarily.

830
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,480
That's what that image means and not 
because she's blind,

831
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,270
she knows what's going to happen and so 
she's the archetypical representation of

832
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,090
the woman who says yes to life knowing 
full well what,

833
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,120
what life is not naive,
not someone who got pregnant in the 

834
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,000
backseat of the 1957 Chevy,
you know,

835
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,940
in one in a one night of,
of,

836
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,140
of,
of half drunk idiocy.

837
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,180
Not that,
but consciously,

838
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:07,110
consciously knowing what's to come and 
then also allows it to happen because 

839
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:09,940
that's another thing that's a testament 
to the courage of mothers.

840
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,270
My mother was good at this.
My mother's a very agreeable person too.

841
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:18,271
Agreeable for her own good,
but that's what happens if you're 

842
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,000
agreeable because you're too agreeable 
if for your own good.

843
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,620
That's the definition of agreeable and 
so she's a nice person and still is.

844
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:28,621
Luckily she's still alive and we've had 
a very good relationship and I have 

845
00:48:28,621 --> 00:48:30,730
always been able to make her laugh,
which is,

846
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,180
which is a good thing and but she was 
tough cookie.

847
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:35,110
That woman,
you know,

848
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,940
if,
if I remember once she came across,

849
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,440
I was out playing in this baseball 
diamond,

850
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:49,000
little diamond and empty lot really in 
this little town I grew up in.

851
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,960
I was about 10 and she walked by.
I was there with a bunch of my friends 

852
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,880
and I was about to have a fistfight with
his little tough kid that I hung around 

853
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,061
with and there were half girls on the 
team and the fistfight had some 

854
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:05,640
relationship to status maneuvering,
you know,

855
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:07,270
in relationship to that.
Anyways,

856
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,460
we going to have a fight and my mum 
walked by,

857
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,610
she took a look and I could see from her
demeanor that she knew exactly what was 

858
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:20,581
about to happen and she looked for a 
second and then she walked by and I 

859
00:49:20,581 --> 00:49:21,850
thought,
Whoa,

860
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:24,220
good work mom.
No kidding.

861
00:49:24,221 --> 00:49:29,221
Hey.
It's like last bloody thing I needed at 

862
00:49:29,221 --> 00:49:29,500
that moment was for her to come charge 
it up and say,

863
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,350
you boys aren't planning to have a 
fight,

864
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,530
are you?
It's like,

865
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:33,720
well yeah,
mom,

866
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,730
where we're actually planning to have a 
fight and now that you came and 

867
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:42,061
intervened,
I actually lost before the God damn 

868
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:42,061
thing even started.

869
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,340
So two thumbs up for mom.
She was also the person that said 

870
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,730
because I had some trouble with my dad 
when I was a key adolescent.

871
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,110
He had some trouble with me.
So you know,

872
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,940
it was 50 slash 50.
That's for now,

873
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:03,170
it's probably 70 slash 30 with me on the
70 end of the being the trouble.

874
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:08,610
And anyways,
I left home when I was about 17 and she 

875
00:50:09,261 --> 00:50:11,270
said something really interesting when I
left home.

876
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:14,300
She said it was too good at home.
You'd never leave.

877
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:15,800
I thought,
hey mom,

878
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:16,880
that's pretty good.
You know,

879
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,620
for,
for an agreeable person,

880
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,400
you've got a real spine man.
So that was pretty good.

881
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,840
So.
So you know,

882
00:50:26,841 --> 00:50:28,070
a that says this.
The

883
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,910
mother is the person who also says,
get out there,

884
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:36,380
take your God damn lumps because you're 
tough enough so that you can handle it.

885
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,070
She doesn't say you just stayed down 
there in your bedroom bruiting away 

886
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:47,590
because the world is unfair and treating
you badly and your suffering is too 

887
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,500
much.
He says,

888
00:50:48,501 --> 00:50:50,060
yeah,
there's a lot of suffering out there,

889
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:53,210
but you're a hell of a lot tougher than 
you think you are.

890
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:54,690
So

891
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,750
in turn,
Mary's son Christ offers himself to God 

892
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:07,140
so completely that is faith and trust in
the world is not broken by betrayal,

893
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:08,340
torture,
or death.

894
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:17,960
That's the model for the honorable man.
So when you have an interesting dynamic,

895
00:51:18,061 --> 00:51:21,450
there you have the woman who's willing 
to make the sacrifice,

896
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,920
lays the groundwork for the son who is 
willing to make the sacrifice that works

897
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:32,520
out pretty nicely,
and it's a good thing to know and Christ

898
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,390
case.
However,

899
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:36,480
as he sacrifices himself,
God,

900
00:51:36,481 --> 00:51:39,660
his father is simultaneously sacrificing
his son,

901
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:44,661
right?
That's one of the oddities of the 

902
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:44,970
trinitarian model is that God sacrifices
himself to himself.

903
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,310
Same thing happens in norse mythology,
right?

904
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,740
Um,

905
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,760
is it norse Zeus,
Germanic mythology.

906
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,690
Zoo sacrifices himself to himself.
He actually hangs on a tree.

907
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,110
It's actually wounded in his side.
It's very interesting parallel,

908
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:02,990
but I think part of the idea is,
well,

909
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,560
the humanity,
the human race is trying to work out 

910
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:08,560
well.
What's the ultimate sacrifice?

911
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,310
It's something like that ultimate 
sacrifice,

912
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:11,480
a value.
Well,

913
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,570
the,
the,

914
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:14,570
the,
the passion story,

915
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:19,100
and I told you I was foreshadowing.
I'm bringing this into consideration.

916
00:52:19,101 --> 00:52:20,820
Things we won't talk about for a long 
time.

917
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:25,870
Maybe not at all in this lecture series.
I don't know because I don't know how 

918
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:25,870
far I'll get is that,
well,

919
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:29,960
there's a supreme sacrifice demanded on 
the part of the mother and there's a 

920
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,071
supreme sacrifice demanded on the part 
of the sun and there's a supreme 

921
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:36,221
sacrifice demanded on the part of the 
father all at the same time and then 

922
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:38,090
that makes the supreme sacrifice 
possible.

923
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:40,370
And hypothetically,
that's the one that renews.

924
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:42,860
That's the sacrifice that renews and 
redeems.

925
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,720
It's a hell of an idea,
man.

926
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,370
And the thing about it is that I don't 
know if it's true,

927
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,890
but I know that its opposite is false

928
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:57,570
and generally the opposite of something 
that's false is true.

929
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,650
It's the opposite is false is because if
the mother doesn't make the sacrifice,

930
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:06,651
then you get the horrible eatable 
situation or something like that in the 

931
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,621
household,
which is just its own absolute 

932
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:12,081
catastrophic hell,
and if you want a really good insight 

933
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:12,750
into that,
I would say watch the documentary Crumb,

934
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:14,070
c,
r u,

935
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:19,071
m b,
a man that's been rated by some critics 

936
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:19,590
has the best documentary ever made and 
it is some piece of work,

937
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:20,030
man.
He does.

938
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,040
The only thing I've ever seen that 
actually lays out the eatable 

939
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:25,990
catastrophe in its full nightmare.
You

940
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,360
know,
so you could,

941
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:32,390
you could look at that.
So if the maternal sacrifice isn't 

942
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,390
there,
then that doesn't work.

943
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:37,191
If the paternal sacrifice isn't there,
if the father isn't willing to put his 

944
00:53:37,191 --> 00:53:38,760
son out into the world,
let's say,

945
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:41,100
to be broken and betrayed and all of 
those things,

946
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:44,340
then that's a nonstarter because the kid
doesn't grow up.

947
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:46,170
And then if the sun isn't willing to do 
that,

948
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,540
well then who the hell is going to 
shoulder the responsibility?

949
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,730
So if those three things don't happen,
then it's cataclysmic.

950
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,290
It's chaotic,
it's hell.

951
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,350
If they do happen,
is it the opposite of that?

952
00:53:58,351 --> 00:53:59,280
While you could say,
well,

953
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:03,630
maybe it depends on the degree to which 
they happen and and it's a continuum.

954
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:06,790
How thoroughly can they happen?
What we don't know?

955
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:12,030
Because you might say,
how good a job do you do have 

956
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:15,090
encouraging your children to live in 
truth?

957
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,740
Let's say,
well,

958
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:20,040
that's part of the answer to this 
question and the answer likely is,

959
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:25,190
well not you don't do as good a job of 
it as you could so it works out quite 

960
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:30,861
well,
but you don't know how well it could 

961
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:32,130
work if you did it really well are 
spectacularly well or ultimately well or

962
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:37,131
something like that.
You don't know and you know people have 

963
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:38,820
an intimation of this because one of the
things that's really cool about having a

964
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:43,821
young baby,
this is something you don't know until 

965
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:43,821
you have.
There's two things you don't know.

966
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,680
There's a lot more than two.
There's three things you don't know 

967
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:56,390
until you have a baby.
The one is that you didn't grow up yet 

968
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,990
because you actually don't grow up until
someone else is more important than you.

969
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,140
You can't,
so people think they grow up if they 

970
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:03,140
don't have children,
but they don't.

971
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,070
They just think they do.
Now there are some people who make 

972
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,771
sacrifices of other sorts,
but this is a whole different ball of 

973
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:11,910
wax as far as I'm concerned.
It's not a very elegant metaphor,

974
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:16,911
but you learn that it's kind of relief 
relief not to be the center of 

975
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:23,661
attention.
That's cool that you can sit back 

976
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:26,850
because of course your child in your 
family and in society is immediately the

977
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:31,851
center of attention and so unless you're
a narcissistic than you allow that to 

978
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:36,801
happen and then you learn all sorts of 
really good things about other people 

979
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:37,710
because other people really like babies.

980
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:42,710
It's so cool.
I lived in Montreal when we had our 

981
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,841
first child and I lived in a pretty 
rough neighborhood by Montreal 

982
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:44,841
standards.
Right.

983
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,760
It's like,
you know,

984
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:47,760
Montreal has such a great city like 
Toronto.

985
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:52,761
It's like even the rough neighborhoods 
are there more like charming with a 

986
00:55:52,761 --> 00:55:54,780
little dark under belly,
something like that,

987
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,140
but there were some rough characters in 
our neighborhood and it was pretty poor 

988
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:01,830
and we'd.
We'd push her around in her stroller and

989
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:07,070
these like grizzled rectal guys would 
come by and they'd look at her and they 

990
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,270
just light up and they'd come over and 
like smile at her and you know,

991
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,920
he just saw there the positive element 
of their humanity just.

992
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,030
Well,
fourth,

993
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:20,210
you have to be something seriously wrong
with you if you don't respond that way 

994
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:20,210
to a baby,
you know,

995
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,330
I mean,
that's,

996
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,950
that's not good.
That's not good.

997
00:56:22,951 --> 00:56:24,160
But it was so cool to see these

998
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,410
people.
You kind of give them generally you sort

999
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,450
of walk four feet around them on the 
street,

1000
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:33,451
you know,
and yet they were all of a sudden all 

1001
00:56:33,451 --> 00:56:35,821
that,
the layers that were on them would just 

1002
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:39,811
fall off and they'd be so.
And the babies are sort of like public 

1003
00:56:39,811 --> 00:56:40,870
property weirdly enough to sort of like 
pregnant women,

1004
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:45,871
you know,
because people often treat pregnant 

1005
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:45,871
women sort of like their public property
too.

1006
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:46,580
I mean in a positive way.
Oh well Laura,

1007
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,350
you're going to have a baby a.
well,

1008
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,510
they do all sorts of cute things.
So.

1009
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,160
So you know,
the reason I'm telling you that is 

1010
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,871
because there's a strong impulse in 
people to note that there's something 

1011
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:06,330
miraculous about the existence of a new 
human being and the miraculous element 

1012
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,820
is all the potential that's there,
right?

1013
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,840
That's all there is.
There is potential.

1014
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:16,410
And with every birth there is the 
potential for something remarkable to be

1015
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:22,890
introduced in the world.
And one of the things I've thought too 

1016
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,461
is the other thing you don't know is 
that babies are generic until you have 

1017
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:31,570
one and then you're a baby isn't a 
generic baby at all.

1018
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:36,750
It's like instantly it's a person with 
whom you have a relationship that's 

1019
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:41,131
closer perhaps than any relationship 
that you've ever had and that you can 

1020
00:57:41,131 --> 00:57:42,250
keep perfect,
right?

1021
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:47,251
Because most of the relationships you've
had already or with people who are 

1022
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:47,560
screwed up and 50 different ways and so 
are you.

1023
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,120
But here you've got this baby and like 
hair,

1024
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:56,130
but it's not ruined yet.
And so you have this possibility of 

1025
00:57:56,251 --> 00:58:00,930
maintaining this relationship that 
starts out that baby really likes you.

1026
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,730
And generally that continues for quite a
long time.

1027
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:05,880
Is there are two years old and you come 
home,

1028
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:07,800
they're really happy to see.
It's kind of like having a puppy,

1029
00:58:07,801 --> 00:58:09,690
you know?
It's like they're thrilled when you come

1030
00:58:09,691 --> 00:58:14,691
home.
It's like how many people are thrilled 

1031
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:14,691
when you come home?
You know,

1032
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:14,700
so I'll see you again.
It's like,

1033
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:15,780
no,
not a little kid.

1034
00:58:15,781 --> 00:58:18,840
A little kid is thrilled when you come 
home and you can keep that going.

1035
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:24,320
And so there's this pristine element to 
the potential relationship between 

1036
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:29,070
parents and children that's terribly 
devalued in our society terribly.

1037
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:35,670
It's almost as if were willfully blind 
to it and I think it's an absolute 

1038
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:38,911
catastrophe because there's nothing.
There's very little in life that can 

1039
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:43,420
compare to establishing a proper 
relationship with the child.

1040
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:49,740
They make great company if you,
if you keep your relationship with them 

1041
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,840
pristine and so you know it's 
worthwhile.

1042
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:53,430
You think,
well,

1043
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,500
so.
So the reason I'm telling you this is 

1044
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,151
because people look at infants and they 
think they think this could be the 

1045
00:59:00,151 --> 00:59:02,170
potential savior of mankind.
That is what they think.

1046
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,610
That's how they act.
So that's what they think.

1047
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,010
And the thing is,
it's also true now how true it is,

1048
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:17,011
I don't know,
but that's I think probably because I 

1049
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:23,211
think it's probably because people don't
dare to find out how it's how it looks 

1050
00:59:23,211 --> 00:59:28,001
to me in Christ case.
However,

1051
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,520
as he sacrifices himself,
God,

1052
00:59:30,521 --> 00:59:33,010
his father is simultaneously sacrificing
his son.

1053
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,220
It is for this reason that the Christian
sacrificial drama of Sun and self is 

1054
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,120
archetipal.
Nothing greater can be imagined.

1055
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:44,440
That's why it's an architect.
You can't push past it.

1056
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,160
So

1057
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,100
that's the very definition of 
archetypal.

1058
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,210
That's the core of what constitutes 
religious.

1059
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,340
The greatest of all possible sacrifices,
his self and child of that,

1060
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:03,341
there can be no doubt,
pain and suffering define the world of 

1061
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:03,341
that.
Equally.

1062
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:06,020
There can be no doubt the person who 
wants to alleviate suffering,

1063
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,110
who wants to bring about the best of all
possible futures,

1064
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:14,380
who wants to create heaven on earth,
will therefore sacrificed everything he 

1065
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:18,551
has to God to live in the truth.
So that's a page and half from the book 

1066
01:00:22,841 --> 01:00:24,190
I'm going to release in January.

1067
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:30,210
Thank you.

1068
01:00:32,270 --> 01:00:37,270
So back to genesis of we're all.
We already up to genesis four and Adam 

1069
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:39,470
knew eve,
his wife,

1070
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,170
and she conceived

1071
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,810
and Bare Cain and said,
I have gotten a man from the Lord.

1072
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:52,400
Now this is after Adam and eve had been 
chased out of the garden of Eden.

1073
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:54,440
Right?
So what's really cool about this?

1074
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:57,380
I really think that the atoms that can 
enable stories,

1075
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:01,730
the most profound story I've ever read,
especially given that it's.

1076
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:06,790
You can tell it in 15 seconds,
I won't because I tend not to tell 

1077
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,120
stories in 15 seconds as you may have 
noticed,

1078
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:13,310
but,
but you can read the whole thing that 

1079
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:15,020
quickly and it's so densely packed that 
I just can't.

1080
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:16,220
It's,
it's A.

1081
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,970
It's actually unbelievable to me that it
can be that densely packed.

1082
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,090
Okay?
So the first thing is,

1083
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:26,091
is that Adam and eve are not the first 
two human beings can enable or the first

1084
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:31,751
two human beings,
because Adam and eve were made by God 

1085
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:31,751
and they were born in paradise.

1086
01:01:31,751 --> 01:01:33,170
It's like what kind of cumin beings are 
those?

1087
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:34,580
You don't know any human beings like 
that.

1088
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:38,540
Human beings aren't born in paradise and
made by God.

1089
01:01:38,541 --> 01:01:42,080
Human beings are born of other human 
beings,

1090
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:43,530
right,
and so,

1091
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:46,040
so that's the first thing,
and it's post-fall.

1092
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,410
We're out in the world world in history 
now.

1093
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:52,880
We're not in some archetipal beyond,
although we are still to some degree,

1094
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:56,600
not to the degree that was the case with
the story of Adam and eve.

1095
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,250
We we've already been thrown out of the 
garden,

1096
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:01,040
were already self conscious.
We're already awake,

1097
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,430
we're already covered.
We're already working.

1098
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:09,970
We're full fledged human beings,
and so you have the first two human 

1099
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,890
beings can enable prototypical human 
beings.

1100
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:18,370
So what's cool is that humanity enters 
history at the end of the story of Adam 

1101
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,160
and eve,
and then the architectural

1102
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,210
patterns for human behavior are 
instantaneously presented.

1103
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:25,850
It's,
it's,

1104
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,570
it's absolutely mind boggling and it's 
not a great.

1105
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:31,380
It's not a very nice story,
right?

1106
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:34,140
So they're your brothers,
they're hostile brothers,

1107
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,120
they've got their hands around each 
other's throats,

1108
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:43,121
so to speak,
or at least that's the case in one 

1109
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:43,121
direction.
So it's a,

1110
01:02:43,121 --> 01:02:47,240
it's a story.
The first two human beings engage in a 

1111
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:51,051
fratricidal struggle that ends in the 
death of the best.

1112
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:56,481
One of them.
That's the story of human beings in 

1113
01:02:56,481 --> 01:03:00,550
history and that man,
if that doesn't give you nightmares,

1114
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,940
you didn't understand the damn story.
Now in in these hostile brothers stories

1115
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:11,600
which are very,
very common,

1116
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:17,510
often the older brother Cain is used and
this is very true in the Bible,

1117
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,780
but it's true in all sorts of folk tales
and all sorts of stories

1118
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,160
of all sorts for that matter.
See,

1119
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:29,170
the older brother has some advantages.
He's the older brother and in a 

1120
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:33,310
agricultural community,
the older brother generally inherited 

1121
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,090
the land,
not the younger brothers,

1122
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:36,500
and the reason for that was is that,
well,

1123
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:40,220
let's say you have like eight sons and 
you have enough land to support a bit of

1124
01:03:40,221 --> 01:03:43,760
a family and you divided among your 
eight sons than they have eight sons and

1125
01:03:43,761 --> 01:03:48,761
they divided among the eight sounds.
It's like soon everyone has a little 

1126
01:03:48,761 --> 01:03:52,600
postage stamp that they can stand on and
starve to death on and so that just 

1127
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,350
doesn't work.
So you,

1128
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,290
you,
you,

1129
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,930
you,
you hand the land down in a piece to the

1130
01:03:56,931 --> 01:04:00,290
eldest son and that's just how it is.
It's tough luck for the rest of them,

1131
01:04:00,291 --> 01:04:03,590
but at least they know they're going to 
have to go and make their own way.

1132
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:07,130
It's not fair,
but there's no way of making it fair.

1133
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,920
Well,
so the oldest son has some,

1134
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:15,910
you might say he has an additional stake
in the stability and the stability of 

1135
01:04:18,111 --> 01:04:23,111
the current hierarchy.
He has more of a stake in the status 

1136
01:04:23,111 --> 01:04:23,510
quo,
so that makes them more of an emblematic

1137
01:04:23,511 --> 01:04:28,511
representative,
representative of the status quo and 

1138
01:04:28,511 --> 01:04:29,600
perhaps more likely to be blind in it's 
favor.

1139
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:34,601
It's something like that,
so that motif creeps up very frequently 

1140
01:04:34,601 --> 01:04:36,530
in the hostel.
Brothers archetipal struggle.

1141
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:42,070
So Kane fits this.
The story of Cain and Abel fits this 

1142
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:44,060
pattern because Cain is the one who 
won't budge who won't move.

1143
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:49,300
He's stubborn.
Whereas the younger son who is able is 

1144
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:50,750
often the one who's more,
not so much of a revolutionary,

1145
01:04:50,751 --> 01:04:55,751
but perhaps more of a balance between 
the revolutionary and the 

1146
01:04:55,751 --> 01:04:55,751
traditionalist,
something like that.

1147
01:04:55,751 --> 01:05:00,400
Whereas the older son tends to be more 
traditionalist authoritarian,

1148
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,820
at least in these metaphorical 
representations.

1149
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:06,430
And Adam knew eve,
his wife,

1150
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,290
and she conceived and Bare Cain and 
said,

1151
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:12,970
I have gotten a man from the Lord.
So there's the first human being cane.

1152
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,840
It's like I told you that the 
Mesopotamians thought that mankind

1153
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,320
was made out of the blood of the worst 
demon.

1154
01:05:20,321 --> 01:05:22,840
That the great goddess of chaos could 
imagine.

1155
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:28,620
Well,
the first human being is a murderer and 

1156
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:28,620
not only a murderer,
murder of his own brother.

1157
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:29,560
And so,
you know,

1158
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:34,810
Old Testament,
that's a hell of a harsh book and you 

1159
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,921
might think,
well maybe that's a little bit too much 

1160
01:05:37,921 --> 01:05:38,050
to bear and then you might think,
yeah,

1161
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:42,400
and maybe it's true too.
So that's something to think about.

1162
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,390
I mean,
I,

1163
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,690
human beings,
you know,

1164
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,720
like they're amazing creatures and to 
think about us as a plague on the planet

1165
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:57,811
is its own kind of bloody catastrophe,
malevolent,

1166
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:03,540
low genocidal metaphor.
But that doesn't mean that we're not 

1167
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:11,791
without our problems.
And the fact that this book that sets 

1168
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:15,031
sits at the cornerstone of our culture 
would present the first man that was a 

1169
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:21,971
murder of his brother is something that 
should really set you back on your 

1170
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:21,971
heels.

1171
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:26,180
And again,
she bare his brother Abel and Abel was a

1172
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:28,610
keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

1173
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:34,690
There you see a very old representation 
there is able there and he's got his 

1174
01:06:36,171 --> 01:06:39,620
sheep up on the altar and Cain is 
bringing a Sheaf of wheat.

1175
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:44,621
And I don't know exactly what's 
happening here with the blood but or 

1176
01:06:45,441 --> 01:06:47,480
it's a re perhaps it's something like 
that.

1177
01:06:47,481 --> 01:06:52,481
But the overall impression of the images
that something transcendent is 

1178
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:56,210
communicating with this sacrifice.
And you see that.

1179
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:57,080
So you think,
oh,

1180
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:58,370
how primitive,
you know,

1181
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:01,940
how primitive these people were 
sacrificing to their god.

1182
01:07:01,941 --> 01:07:03,260
It's like,
you know,

1183
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,490
those people weren't stupid and this is 
not primitive.

1184
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:10,530
Whatever it is,
it's not primitive.

1185
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,680
It's sophisticated beyond belief.
Because the idea,

1186
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,590
as I already pointed out,
is that you could sacrifice something of

1187
01:07:16,591 --> 01:07:18,960
value in that that would have 
transcendent utility.

1188
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,900
And that is by no means an 
unsophisticated idea.

1189
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:24,410
In fact,
it might be the greatest I did the human

1190
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:25,580
beings ever came up with.

1191
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,920
It's an answer to the problem that's put
forward in the story of Adam and Eve,

1192
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:37,921
right?
Because we became self conscious and 

1193
01:07:37,921 --> 01:07:38,200
then we discovered the future and then 
we knew we were going to die and then we

1194
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:43,201
knew we were vulnerable and then we 
became ashamed and then we develop the 

1195
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:44,740
knowledge of good and evil.
And then we got thrown out of paradise.

1196
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:46,240
It's like,
that's a big problem.

1197
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,220
So what the hell are you going to do 
about it?

1198
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,880
While I will sacrifice,
that's the hypothesis.

1199
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,010
Well,
that's a hell of a hypothesis,

1200
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:55,150
man.
That's what we're doing.

1201
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,360
You've made plenty of sacrifices even to
sit in this theater and many people may 

1202
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,890
plenty of sacrifices.
To have a theater like this exist in 

1203
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:08,671
many people made sacrifices so that we 
can actually freely engage in the 

1204
01:08:08,671 --> 01:08:11,320
dialogue that we're engaging in in a 
theater like this.

1205
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:15,280
And so it's like all of this is built on
sacrifice and sacrifice.

1206
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:20,290
Bloody well better work because we do 
not have a better idea sacrifice,

1207
01:08:21,091 --> 01:08:24,330
what's the counter position?
Murder and theft.

1208
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:29,490
So let's go with sacrifice shall we,
and perhaps we won't consider it so damn

1209
01:08:29,491 --> 01:08:30,940
primitive,
you know,

1210
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,230
because it's not so primitive.
And again she bare.

1211
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:39,260
His brother Abel enabled was a keeper of
sheep and Cain was a tiller of the 

1212
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:39,260
ground.

1213
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,080
Now some people have read into this 
eternal battle between herdsmen and 

1214
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:52,320
agriculturalists,
which raged in the American West for 

1215
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:55,381
example,
because the herdsmen like to have their 

1216
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:55,381
herds,
sheep,

1217
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,160
cattle go wherever they were going to 
go.

1218
01:08:57,161 --> 01:09:02,161
And of course the agriculture,
the farmers like to have things fenced 

1219
01:09:02,161 --> 01:09:04,030
off and so.
And the agriculturalists actually won in

1220
01:09:04,031 --> 01:09:07,510
the final analysis.
But anyways,

1221
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:12,660
Abel is a keeper of sheep.
And that's interesting because that 

1222
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,571
makes them a shepherd.
And I think that's part of the critical 

1223
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:20,791
issue here because a shepherd.
I talked a little bit about shepherds 

1224
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:20,791
before.
You know,

1225
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,510
if you look at Michelangelo Statue of 
David,

1226
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:27,550
of David,
which is another staggering work mean 

1227
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:32,361
that David,
he's no trivial figure and of course 

1228
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,510
steven do slight slays Goliath and 
Goliath is like

1229
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:43,410
the giant of the patriarchal enemy.
It's something like that and you know,

1230
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:48,500
Middle Eastern shepherds,
they had to kick take care of sheep and 

1231
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,281
they're edible and the lambs are very 
vulnerable and there were lots of wild 

1232
01:09:52,281 --> 01:09:56,751
animals around.
It wasn't like England in the 16th 

1233
01:09:56,751 --> 01:09:56,990
century.
It was like the reliance,

1234
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:02,300
you know,
and you had a slingshot or a stick or 

1235
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,241
some damn thing.
And so your job was to keep the sheep 

1236
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,420
organized and not let them beat by the 
lions alone.

1237
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,720
And so you had to have a clue and be 
tough and self reliant and all of those 

1238
01:10:11,851 --> 01:10:13,980
things.
You have to be tough and self reliance.

1239
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:16,890
You have to be able to take care of a 
lot of vulnerable things,

1240
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:22,410
able to do it on your own.
And so that's how are built into the 

1241
01:10:22,410 --> 01:10:22,900
shepherd metaphor.
And it's,

1242
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,280
you know,
it's a tough thing for.

1243
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:29,340
It's not a great metaphor for modern 
people because we tend to think of the 

1244
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,070
shepherd is someone like little Lord 
Fauntleroy,

1245
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:31,510
you know,
like some little,

1246
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:37,530
certainly not a lion killing 
hypermasculine lion killing monster 

1247
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:40,690
that's not a shepherd.
A shepherd sort of dances around and you

1248
01:10:40,691 --> 01:10:41,680
know,
it's not.

1249
01:10:41,681 --> 01:10:43,660
That's not the metaphor here.
That's,

1250
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,600
that's,
that's not the metaphor here.

1251
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:51,750
So Abel was a keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground and 

1252
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:55,921
in the process of time it came to pass 
that cain brought of the fruit of the 

1253
01:10:55,921 --> 01:10:56,590
ground,
an offering unto the Lord.

1254
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:02,460
Okay,
so he's participating in this 

1255
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:02,460
sacrificial ritual,
unable.

1256
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,650
He brought of the firstlings of his 
flock and of the fat thereof.

1257
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,100
And the Lord had respect unto Abel and 
to his offering.

1258
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,010
Now you don't know why that is.
And this is a built in ambiguity.

1259
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,210
I think now I think there's textual 
hints,

1260
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,110
but I'm not sure.

1261
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:20,000
Okay.

1262
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:24,230
Abel brought the firstlings of his flock
and of the fat thereof.

1263
01:11:24,231 --> 01:11:24,800
Okay,
so,

1264
01:11:24,801 --> 01:11:26,000
so what does that mean?
Well,

1265
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,590
he brought high quite so high quality 
sacrifice you don't know.

1266
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:33,050
That enables sacrifices,
low quality.

1267
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,090
Because it doesn't say,
you know,

1268
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:38,690
Abel brought God some wilted lettuce and
then Burton,

1269
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,720
he doesn't say that but,
but there isn't a sentence there that 

1270
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,531
talks about how high quality cane 
sacrifices,

1271
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:52,520
but in any case the Lord had respect 
unto Abel and his offering.

1272
01:11:53,330 --> 01:11:58,330
So there's a hint that ables putting a 
little bit more into the whole 

1273
01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:03,071
sacrificial thing then then cane,
but there's also a hint that maybe God 

1274
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,660
is just like liking you a little better 
than these likened him.

1275
01:12:05,661 --> 01:12:10,661
And that's I think useful from a 
literary perspective because there is 

1276
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:12,350
that arbitrary ness about life,
you know,

1277
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,030
with my own children,
for example,

1278
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,090
one of them has had,
I would say

1279
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:18,910
he

1280
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,950
things come easy to him.
He's lucky,

1281
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:25,740
fortunate,
however you want to put it.

1282
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:28,950
He seems to be that sort of person.
Whereas my other child is like,

1283
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,340
it's just like one horrible job,
like catastrophe after another.

1284
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:38,580
And it's so strange to see that because 
as far as I can tell,

1285
01:12:38,581 --> 01:12:43,581
there's the character.
Logical differences are certainly not 

1286
01:12:43,581 --> 01:12:45,000
accounting for the,
for the,

1287
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,370
for the difference in destiny.
You know,

1288
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,070
my one,
the one child who's had so much trouble,

1289
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:54,930
I mean as a child was just a wonderful 
child,

1290
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,960
so amazingly happy and easy to get along
with and fun and they have a terrible 

1291
01:13:12,201 --> 01:13:17,201
time of it,
so who knows what God's up to,

1292
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:22,240
but distributing fate equally certainly 
isn't one of them,

1293
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,580
and the Lord had respect unto Abel and 
his offering,

1294
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:32,610
but unto Cain and his offering he had 
not respect and Cain was very wroth 

1295
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:40,310
angry.
Roth is a tough word and and these are 

1296
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:44,241
translated many times.
It's hard to get the full flavor of the 

1297
01:13:44,241 --> 01:13:45,890
words,
but wroth and his countenance fell well.

1298
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,260
To have your countenance fell at.
This is sort of up to fall,

1299
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:51,720
is to,
to have it be heavy.

1300
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:56,310
Depressed for sure.
Angry for sure.

1301
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:59,670
Resentful.
Probably Roth.

1302
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:04,700
That's anger.
So Kane is not happy clam that his hard 

1303
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:10,320
work is being rejected by God.
Now that's worth thinking about really,

1304
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:12,040
because you think about how

1305
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,570
human that story is.
You know,

1306
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:17,140
you're out there.
Well,

1307
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:20,830
we can say you might be useless 
character and you know,

1308
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,610
you're whining about how catastrophic 
your life isn't.

1309
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:27,760
It's pretty much obvious to everyone 
around you and you that it's your fault.

1310
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:30,670
You just don't try.
You don't wake up in the morning,

1311
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,790
you don't get a job,
you don't engage in things.

1312
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:38,940
You're cynical and you're bitter and 
you're angry and you don't try to help 

1313
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:42,931
the people near you and you don't try to
fix up your own life and you don't take 

1314
01:14:42,931 --> 01:14:47,191
care of yourself and you know,
and then things go wrong and it's like 

1315
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,270
hell freely.
What do you expect?

1316
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:50,830
But then,
but that's,

1317
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:56,190
I mean,
that doesn't mean someone in that 

1318
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:56,190
situation.
We'll just say,

1319
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:56,190
well,
that's okay.

1320
01:14:56,190 --> 01:14:56,500
I deserve it.
Then there'll be happy about it.

1321
01:14:56,501 --> 01:15:01,501
They won't,
they'll be absolutely bitter about it 

1322
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:01,501
and angry.
But,

1323
01:15:01,501 --> 01:15:01,990
you know,
put that aside for a moment.

1324
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:05,830
There are people who seem to struggle 
very forthrightly,

1325
01:15:05,831 --> 01:15:10,831
let's say,
and still have one catastrophe after 

1326
01:15:10,831 --> 01:15:11,790
another happen to them.
And so it's,

1327
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:15,550
there's no easy answer in this,
in this story.

1328
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,880
It's like you can fall,
fall afoul of God because your sacrifice

1329
01:15:22,701 --> 01:15:25,450
is our second rate.
Or you can just fall,

1330
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:27,610
uh,
fall of God and you don't know why.

1331
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,680
Well,
tough luck for you,

1332
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:33,190
and then what happens in either case is 
exactly this.

1333
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:34,390
Almost inevitably

1334
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:38,440
cain was wrong in his countenance fell 
well.

1335
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:39,640
You know,
you meet an I.

1336
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,080
people like this,
right?

1337
01:15:41,081 --> 01:15:42,640
To me all the time,
I've seen many,

1338
01:15:42,641 --> 01:15:44,330
many of them as clients,
you know,

1339
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,320
they say they're 20,
not so often.

1340
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:49,480
30 more commonly,
sometimes 40.

1341
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:51,430
Their lives haven't gone well,
you know,

1342
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:56,431
they're in a pit of despair of one form 
or another and not only are they in a 

1343
01:15:56,431 --> 01:16:00,871
pit of despair,
but they're extraordinarily angry about 

1344
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:03,181
it and god only knows what they would do
with that anger if they had the 

1345
01:16:03,181 --> 01:16:05,020
opportunity to give it full voice.
Right?

1346
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:10,021
You know,
one of the things I've always thought 

1347
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:10,021
about Hitler is that,
you know,

1348
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:13,120
people,
you have to admire Hitler.

1349
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:16,930
That's the thing,
because he was an organizational genius.

1350
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:21,400
You know the thing that doesn't stop 
people from being Hitler.

1351
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:26,140
The thing people don't.
People don't

1352
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:32,990
refused the ambition to become Hitler 
because they don't have the genocidal 

1353
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:37,911
motivation.
They don't follow that pathway because 

1354
01:16:37,911 --> 01:16:39,360
they don't have the organizational 
genius.

1355
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:42,960
They've got the damn motivation.
And you know,

1356
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:47,990
if you take 100 people randomly and you 
talk to them and you really talked to 

1357
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:52,911
them,
you'll find that five percent of them 

1358
01:16:52,911 --> 01:16:56,600
would take their vengeful thoughts 
pretty damn far if they were just given 

1359
01:16:56,611 --> 01:17:01,611
the opportunity and in fact they do 
because they make life miserable for 

1360
01:17:01,611 --> 01:17:05,211
themselves and often for their family 
and sometimes for anybody they can come 

1361
01:17:05,211 --> 01:17:08,751
near and then maybe another 20 percent 
of people have that bubble up in them on

1362
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,310
a pretty damn

1363
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:14,930
regular basis.
So you can have some

1364
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,620
the thief for cane.
If you don't have any sympathy for cane,

1365
01:17:17,621 --> 01:17:21,510
then you're not.
See Cain and Abel also,

1366
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:24,180
they don't just represent to our 
architectural types of being.

1367
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,050
They represent

1368
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:31,530
so it's not like you're a cane and 
you're able to near cane and you're 

1369
01:17:31,530 --> 01:17:34,261
able.
It's like you're half and half and your 

1370
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:34,261
half and half and your half and half at 
something like this.

1371
01:17:34,261 --> 01:17:38,581
This is two different potential patterns
of destiny and you don't manifest one 

1372
01:17:38,581 --> 01:17:40,670
purely in the other zero.
It's like you're.

1373
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,650
It's like the line between good and evil
that runs down the human heart.

1374
01:17:44,651 --> 01:17:49,651
It's exactly the same idea and maybe 
you're more like canes or maybe you're 

1375
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:50,980
more like Abel,
but there's still a little cane in you,

1376
01:17:50,981 --> 01:17:55,981
no matter how able you are and maybe 
more than a little and probably more 

1377
01:17:56,021 --> 01:17:59,080
than literally little,
and if you watch your fantasies,

1378
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:02,860
which I would very much recommend you 
will find that they

1379
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,020
show you dark things about you that will
shock you if you allow yourself to be 

1380
01:18:10,531 --> 01:18:15,531
conscious of what you're thinking.
So it's a good time when you're having 

1381
01:18:16,381 --> 01:18:18,810
an argument with someone,
especially someone that you love,

1382
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:22,230
to just watch the pictures that flash in
the back of your mind.

1383
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:27,231
That's part of let's say coming into 
contact with what Carl Jung called the 

1384
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:29,790
shadow and the shadow is the 
manifestation of cane.

1385
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:33,630
That's a perfect way of thinking about 
it and one of the things that young said

1386
01:18:33,631 --> 01:18:38,631
about the shadow [inaudible] young was 
not someone you mess around with 

1387
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:38,631
lightly.
He said,

1388
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:42,930
human shadow has roots that reach all 
the way to hell and young meant that 

1389
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:47,450
that's no metaphor for him.
Now he might not have meant it in the 

1390
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,511
same way that a fundamentalist Christian
from from the southern us might mean it,

1391
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:56,690
but I would say that young men to in a 
way that's far more terrifying and also 

1392
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,831
far more true so and Cain was very wroth
and his countenance fell,

1393
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:12,370
so there's able burning is offering away
there at least in this sort of 

1394
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:20,100
relationship with,
let's call them the archetypical figure 

1395
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:25,510
of culture,
the archetypical father,

1396
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,200
and it's something he respects.
That's the thing.

1397
01:19:29,201 --> 01:19:32,650
It's an indication that the postures and
the indication of respect

1398
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:39,690
and then there's cane in the background 
and you see his face is in shadow and 

1399
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:43,141
he's.
He's jealous of what's happening here 

1400
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:48,930
and he's going through the motions 
perhaps and maybe God just doesn't like 

1401
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:48,930
them.
We don't know,

1402
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:53,340
but he's going through the motions and 
he's not very happy about it and you 

1403
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,710
know that that's actually a phrase that 
you could.

1404
01:19:56,130 --> 01:20:00,450
You could carve into many people's 
tombstones as an epitaph for their life,

1405
01:20:00,990 --> 01:20:04,440
which would be went through the motions 
but wasn't very happy about it.

1406
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:13,240
This is really an interesting one.
I think.

1407
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:18,241
I mean,
so I don't know what God's doing here 

1408
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:21,691
exactly,
but he's helping ignite the sacrificial 

1409
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:26,131
flame and that's kind of an interesting 
idea I think because you know,

1410
01:20:27,071 --> 01:20:29,800
let's say that you have an impulse to 
make a sacrifice.

1411
01:20:29,801 --> 01:20:31,540
You think,
well,

1412
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:33,310
I should change this about my life.
What?

1413
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,600
What's like?
Where does that come from?

1414
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:39,601
That impulse is just,
well just manifests itself out of 

1415
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:40,810
nothing.
So what word you came up with it?

1416
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:45,840
Well,
you might want to stop thinking about 

1417
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:46,870
that thinking so surely that you come up
with your own thoughts.

1418
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:49,330
You don't come up with your damn dreams,
do you?

1419
01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:53,230
They just happen and God only knows 
where they come from.

1420
01:20:53,231 --> 01:20:55,120
They come from your brain.
Oh boy,

1421
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:58,540
that's a sophisticated answer.
They come from your unconscious.

1422
01:20:58,660 --> 01:20:59,830
Well,
that's not much better.

1423
01:20:59,831 --> 01:21:02,470
At least it's somewhat better,
but there are those matt,

1424
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:06,640
amazing dramas take place in the theater
of your imagination at night.

1425
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,960
You don't even understand what they are 
and yet they occur night after night and

1426
01:21:10,961 --> 01:21:11,950
those things,
dreams.

1427
01:21:11,951 --> 01:21:15,220
They can contain wisdom that it just,
well,

1428
01:21:15,221 --> 01:21:17,800
it just staggers the person who has the 
dream.

1429
01:21:17,801 --> 01:21:20,170
Once they get the key to the dream,
once they remembered,

1430
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:21,190
it's like,
oh look,

1431
01:21:21,191 --> 01:21:24,690
you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to 
yourself that you didn't know what.

1432
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:26,860
Where'd that come from?
Well,

1433
01:21:26,861 --> 01:21:29,350
you don't know.
How in the world can you dream up things

1434
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:32,110
that you don't know.
That's a tough one.

1435
01:21:32,590 --> 01:21:37,590
Maybe we'll talk about that at some 
point in this lecture series because 

1436
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:39,130
there are some reasonable things that 
can be said about that,

1437
01:21:39,131 --> 01:21:40,600
but you know the idea of that

1438
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:45,330
there's something that's not you.
You would call it the self.

1439
01:21:45,331 --> 01:21:50,331
Carl Jung would call it the self,
which he thought of it as the totality 

1440
01:21:50,331 --> 01:21:53,721
of your being across time and space.
It's something like that and that you 

1441
01:21:53,721 --> 01:21:55,800
know,
each second that you exist is a slice of

1442
01:21:55,801 --> 01:22:00,801
the self manifesting itself across time 
and space and he thought of the self is 

1443
01:22:00,801 --> 01:22:05,600
partly the voice of conscience.
Whatever that is that helps guide you 

1444
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,460
when you have to make a difficult 
decision and a difficult decision might 

1445
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:10,460
be,
well,

1446
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,220
what do I need to sacrifice?
What is,

1447
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,210
how do I need to discipline myself?
Right?

1448
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,200
What do I need to for go,
well,

1449
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,380
how do you figure those things out?
Well,

1450
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:23,390
you know,
we'll just picture is trying to put 

1451
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:25,341
forth the idea that perhaps if you would
establish the proper relationship with 

1452
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:26,970
God the father and we've talked about 
what that might mean,

1453
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:32,210
then he would help figure out how to get
this sacrificial fires burning so that 

1454
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:36,810
you could stay in a proper relationship 
with him across time.

1455
01:22:37,050 --> 01:22:42,050
Well,
if that's such an unreasonable 

1456
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:42,050
proposition,
what's the alternative proposition?

1457
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:44,460
Well,
this isn't working out very well,

1458
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,050
that's for sure.
You know,

1459
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:49,020
Kate seems to be doing it.
I don't know what it is.

1460
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:54,021
It's like he says,
if he thinks he can only do it himself 

1461
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:55,020
or maybe he wants only to take credit 
for it or something like that,

1462
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,340
he's not in this

1463
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:01,030
grateful,
let's say,

1464
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:06,040
and inquiring grateful and inquiring 
posture because

1465
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:07,690
that's what a prayer for posture should 
be.

1466
01:23:07,691 --> 01:23:09,970
It should be grateful and inquiring and 
grateful is,

1467
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,630
thank God things aren't worse for me 
than they are,

1468
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:18,840
and you shouldn't be grateful about that
because they could be a lot worse than 

1469
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,991
they are mad.
They can be so bad and inquiring would 

1470
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:21,991
be,
well,

1471
01:23:21,991 --> 01:23:24,100
I don't really know how I could make it 
better,

1472
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:26,380
but I'm.
I'm open to suggestions,

1473
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,240
man,
if I can figure out how to do it all,

1474
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,680
try it.
That's the.

1475
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:34,450
That's the humility and the inquiry.
That's a humble inquiry.

1476
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:37,930
How could I make things better?
It's something like that and that's what

1477
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:40,720
sacrifices do I need to make in order to
make things better.

1478
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:46,230
That's a good question to ask yourself.
You could ask yourself that every 

1479
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:48,820
morning,
what sacrifice do I have to make to make

1480
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:52,330
things better?
You can decide what constitutes better.

1481
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:57,390
How about that?
Then it's not even as if it's being 

1482
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:58,270
imposed on you come up with your own 
notion of what constitutes better.

1483
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,030
You know,
we try to make it sophisticated.

1484
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:03,610
Should just be better for you because 
that isn't going to work very well.

1485
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:04,360
Right?
You're,

1486
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:09,840
you're just gonna fall down stairs.
If you do that because you have to live 

1487
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:10,000
with other people and besides stupid 
anyways,

1488
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:15,001
what are you going to do like can't even
just nothing you could even say about 

1489
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:17,350
that.
It's so that that's the.

1490
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:22,410
That's the attitude of a very badly 
behaved hyper aggressive two year old 

1491
01:24:22,410 --> 01:24:25,540
and I mean that technically and so you 
could.

1492
01:24:26,410 --> 01:24:27,850
You could ask yourself,
well,

1493
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,690
how I have this day that lays itself out
in front of me?

1494
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:37,080
What thing could I let go of that's 
impeding my progress that if I let go of

1495
01:24:37,661 --> 01:24:40,690
would make my life better,
my family's life better,

1496
01:24:40,691 --> 01:24:44,230
my culture is life better,
my being better,

1497
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,020
and then that would give you something 
to do for the day,

1498
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:52,021
wouldn't it into justify your miserable 
life because you need that.

1499
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,630
That's the whole point of the first 
story of Adam and eve.

1500
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,150
What do you have?
A miserable life?

1501
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:02,320
Okay,
what am I going to do about that?

1502
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,690
Well,
if you just have a miserable life,

1503
01:25:04,691 --> 01:25:07,510
you're just going to suffer stupidly and
get bitter about it.

1504
01:25:07,511 --> 01:25:09,130
That's what happens to cane.
It's like,

1505
01:25:09,131 --> 01:25:10,300
well,
how about not doing that?

1506
01:25:10,301 --> 01:25:13,720
Because that seems to just take a bad 
deal and make it worse.

1507
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:18,990
How about making a sacrifice and seeing 
if you can please God and put being on 

1508
01:25:20,081 --> 01:25:21,880
track?
God,

1509
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:25,450
that'd be something to do.
What could be better than that?

1510
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,110
What could possibly be better than that?
Well,

1511
01:25:29,111 --> 01:25:31,750
that's why it's archetipal ban because 
nothing's better than that.

1512
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,190
That's where it tops out.
So when you can do that,

1513
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:41,191
you could do that every day.
You'd have to do it in a little way 

1514
01:25:41,191 --> 01:25:44,011
because like what good are you?
You know you're not going to go and 

1515
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:47,560
bring this socialist utopia and to being
in one fell swoop.

1516
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:02,170
You might also think that one of the 
things came mind figure out here.

1517
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,730
There's a couple of things that just 
aren't going right for him,

1518
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:09,830
downwind of the fire,
not the right place to blow from,

1519
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:16,570
and the fact that he's in hen galloped 
in Hayes and smoke and breathing it in 

1520
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:20,981
and the fire isn't burning,
might be an indication that he's doing 

1521
01:26:20,981 --> 01:26:23,510
something wrong or he could be wiping 
his eyes and say,

1522
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,840
Jesus,
what kind of stupid bloody universe 

1523
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:28,840
would produce smoke like this?
It's like,

1524
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,710
yes,
well that's the more likely outcome,

1525
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:38,350
and the Lord said unto Cain,
why Art Thou wroth and why is they 

1526
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:43,331
countenance fallen if they'll do as well
shalt thou not be accepted.

1527
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:49,790
Now that's an interesting line because,
and I've looked at a variety of 

1528
01:26:49,790 --> 01:26:53,580
different translations of.
This is seventh verse here,

1529
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,090
like a bunch of them because the 
translation for that,

1530
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,120
that's a critical line and the 
translation really matters and so I'll 

1531
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,720
tell you what I think the story is what 
I've been able to figure out,

1532
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:06,420
and I'm sure I haven't got it completely
right,

1533
01:27:06,421 --> 01:27:06,870
but it's

1534
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:11,830
so he asks,
God says to him,

1535
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:14,020
if you do well,
won't you be accepted?

1536
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:15,670
There's a hint there,
right?

1537
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:16,960
It's something like,
well,

1538
01:27:16,961 --> 01:27:21,961
things aren't going so well for you,
so the first thing you might think is 

1539
01:27:22,090 --> 01:27:24,730
you're not doing well.
What does that mean?

1540
01:27:24,731 --> 01:27:29,731
You're not doing good?
Does that not mean you're not acting 

1541
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:32,521
properly means it's the hint because the
is suggesting that if you are doing 

1542
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:35,290
properly,
you would be

1543
01:27:36,050 --> 01:27:41,050
successful.
I had a friend at one point who was a 

1544
01:27:41,050 --> 01:27:45,431
very bitter person and he had a bunch of
problems and some of them were self 

1545
01:27:45,651 --> 01:27:48,200
inflicted and some of them were fate I 
suppose,

1546
01:27:48,201 --> 01:27:50,120
and he had.
He was,

1547
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,100
he had become very,
very destructive,

1548
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,480
murderously,
destructive,

1549
01:27:53,481 --> 01:27:55,370
genocidally destructive.
I would say.

1550
01:27:55,371 --> 01:28:00,371
You could see it in his dreams and,
and he lived with me for awhile and I 

1551
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:07,331
knew him very well.
He was a friend of mine from the time I 

1552
01:28:07,331 --> 01:28:09,521
was 12 until the time he committed 
suicide when he was about 40 and when he

1553
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:12,930
lived with me I was trying to help him 
get on his feet,

1554
01:28:12,931 --> 01:28:16,470
which was why he had come to live with 
me because he thought maybe I could help

1555
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:17,670
him get up on his feet

1556
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,770
and he could only take relatively low 
level jobs.

1557
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:23,920
You know,
like he had some mechanical ability,

1558
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:25,040
didn't,
he didn't get educated.

1559
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,510
Although he's a very,
very smart person.

1560
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:29,240
He probably had an Iq of about 135 or 
something like that.

1561
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:33,110
He's very smart and so he was bitter too
because he hadn't educated themselves to

1562
01:28:33,111 --> 01:28:34,440
the level that is,
as you know,

1563
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:35,650
it's intellectual,
abandoned.

1564
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:39,240
So we had to take jobs that were beneath
him intellectually and he had a real.

1565
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:41,390
He had that real intellectual arrogance,
you know,

1566
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:46,670
because he was smart and really smart 
people often come to believe that only 

1567
01:28:46,911 --> 01:28:51,911
smart matters and if they're smart and 
all that and all that matters is smart 

1568
01:28:51,911 --> 01:28:56,891
and then the world isn't sort of laying 
itself at their feet and they've been 

1569
01:28:56,891 --> 01:29:00,551
terribly betrayed and,
and then they cling to their 

1570
01:29:00,551 --> 01:29:01,740
intelligence,
which is more like a talent or a gift.

1571
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:04,260
Like it's like it's an idol,
you know,

1572
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:09,261
a false idol,
which is exactly what it is in a very 

1573
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,631
dangerous one.
And get cynical about the stupidity of 

1574
01:29:11,631 --> 01:29:15,651
the world and the fact that there are 
talents weren't properly recognized and 

1575
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:15,790
that's just not that helpful,
you know,

1576
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:18,150
because smart is a good thing.
But I'll tell you,

1577
01:29:18,151 --> 01:29:23,151
if you don't use it properly,
it will devour you just like all 

1578
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:23,730
arbitrarily assigned.
Tell it right.

1579
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:26,160
So you might have a talent,
but it's your friend.

1580
01:29:26,161 --> 01:29:31,161
If you use it properly and do misuse it,
it will be your enemy and maybe that's 

1581
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:33,870
how God keeps the cosmic scales 
adjusted.

1582
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,570
But anyhow,
my friend was a very smart person,

1583
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:41,460
although not as smart as he thought he 
was unfortunately and but he hadn't done

1584
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:46,461
what would have been necessary with that
intelligence to make it manifest itself 

1585
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:50,160
properly in the world and that also 
embittered him because he also knew that

1586
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:55,730
there was more that he could have done 
if he would have done it and perhaps 

1587
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:58,971
more that he could still do what I was 
suggesting to him while he was living 

1588
01:29:58,971 --> 01:30:03,410
with us because he was two levels from 
homeless by that point was that he 

1589
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:08,460
should find a job that he could find 
working in a garage,

1590
01:30:08,461 --> 01:30:13,461
working in a shop,
something like that because he had some 

1591
01:30:13,461 --> 01:30:13,461
mechanical ability and that he should 
do.

1592
01:30:14,820 --> 01:30:19,820
He should separate himself from the 
arrogance that made him presume that 

1593
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:24,081
such a job would be beneath him.
Because at that point no job was beneath

1594
01:30:24,661 --> 01:30:24,960
him.
And,

1595
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:29,961
but more importantly,
it's not so obvious that jobs are 

1596
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:30,540
beneath people.
You know,

1597
01:30:30,541 --> 01:30:35,541
because even if you're a,
even if imagine you have a job as a 

1598
01:30:35,541 --> 01:30:39,300
checkout person in a,
in a grocery store,

1599
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:41,100
you know,
as a fairly unskilled job,

1600
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,680
you can be some miserable,
resentful,

1601
01:30:43,681 --> 01:30:45,960
horrid bastard doing that job.
Boy,

1602
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:51,230
you know,
you can come in there and just exuding 

1603
01:30:51,230 --> 01:30:53,151
resentment and bitterness and making 
mistakes and making sure that every 

1604
01:30:53,151 --> 01:30:57,741
customer that passes by you has a 
slightly worse day than they need to 

1605
01:30:57,741 --> 01:30:58,710
write and,
and you know,

1606
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:03,890
pilfering time and perhaps pilfering 
goods and being resentful about the 

1607
01:31:03,890 --> 01:31:08,571
people who,
who gave you the position because they 

1608
01:31:08,571 --> 01:31:09,570
are above you in the dominance hierarchy
and talking,

1609
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:10,950
you know,
bad things.

1610
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,530
Gossiping behind the back of your 
coworkers is like,

1611
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:18,710
you can take your menial position self 
described and turn that into a very nice

1612
01:31:19,651 --> 01:31:21,870
little slice of hell.
That's for sure.

1613
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:23,700
And you know,
you go into places like that.

1614
01:31:23,701 --> 01:31:25,920
I always think of the archetypical diner
in that way.

1615
01:31:25,921 --> 01:31:27,810
You know,
you guys have been in this diner.

1616
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:33,110
There's a really good opposite diner and
there's a great video on youtube.

1617
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:37,630
It's Tom waits reading,
reading a poem by Makowsky.

1618
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:43,100
And I think it's called Nirvana and it's
about a good diner that he happened to 

1619
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,930
visit because he happened to visit when 
he was on a bus when he was,

1620
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:49,320
when he was a kid,
a diner where everything was going well.

1621
01:31:49,321 --> 01:31:50,910
And you could listen to that.
It's great.

1622
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:55,911
I think it's great.
But this is the opposite diner I'm 

1623
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:55,911
thinking about.
So you'll go into a diner,

1624
01:31:55,911 --> 01:31:55,911
right?

1625
01:31:55,911 --> 01:32:00,650
It's 7:00
in the morning and you order some bacon 

1626
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:03,990
and eggs and some toast and then you 
look around in the diner and you think 

1627
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:09,330
it was 1975 when the windows were last 
washed and there's this kind of thick 

1628
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:13,150
coating of who gives a damn grease on 
the walls,

1629
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:13,430
you know,
and,

1630
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:18,750
and the floor to has got that sort of 
stickiness that you really have to work 

1631
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:19,620
out to develop over years,
you know,

1632
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:24,630
and the waitress is,
she's not happy to be there and the guy 

1633
01:32:24,630 --> 01:32:27,781
behind the counter isn't happy that,
that happens to be the waitress that 

1634
01:32:27,781 --> 01:32:27,781
he's working with.
And then,

1635
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:33,060
you know,
you walk down the stairs maybe to the 

1636
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:35,071
washroom and now it's its own little 
trip and so you come back and you order 

1637
01:32:35,261 --> 01:32:38,800
your damn eggs and your order,
your toast in the order your bacon,

1638
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:43,801
and then it comes in like the eggs are 
too cooked on the bottom.

1639
01:32:44,290 --> 01:32:49,290
So they're kind of brown and then 
they're kind of raw on top and they're 

1640
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:49,750
called in the middle,
which is,

1641
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,240
you really have to work their cooking an
egg like that man.

1642
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:55,600
But you can master that with like 10 
years of bitterness.

1643
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:58,960
You teach how to cook an egg like that.
And then the toast,

1644
01:32:58,961 --> 01:33:00,490
here's what you do at the toast,
right?

1645
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:02,260
You put,
you take,

1646
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:07,790
you take the white bread,
you know the priestly based stuff that 

1647
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:08,950
no one should ever eat.
And then you put that in the toaster and

1648
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:13,330
you overcook it and then you wait and 
then you pop it out of the toaster.

1649
01:33:13,480 --> 01:33:18,480
And then because it's overcooked,
you scrape it off and you knock off the 

1650
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:22,591
crumbs so it doesn't look too bird.
And then you wait until it's cold and 

1651
01:33:22,591 --> 01:33:24,460
then you put cold margin on it because 
if you put cold,

1652
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:25,870
first of all,
not butter,

1653
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:31,140
but if you put cold margin or you can 
also kind of tear holes in it so that 

1654
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:34,871
then it has lumps of margarine in it and
it's really dry except where it's too 

1655
01:33:34,871 --> 01:33:39,781
greasy.
So that's like it's own little work of 

1656
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:42,031
art man.
And then you put that on the side with 

1657
01:33:42,031 --> 01:33:42,031
the,
with the,

1658
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:47,670
with the eggs and then you have the 
potatoes and this is how you cook the 

1659
01:33:47,670 --> 01:33:47,670
potatoes properly.

1660
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:54,960
So their leftover potatoes and you keep 
dumping new leftover potatoes into the 

1661
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,060
old leftover potatoes over weeks.
And so some of the potatoes,

1662
01:33:58,100 --> 01:34:00,170
if they're no longer potatoes,
right?

1663
01:34:00,930 --> 01:34:05,930
They've have returned to mother earth.
Then you flop them on the grill and you 

1664
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:12,190
sort of know,
you burden them a bit I guess.

1665
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:15,370
And then you slap them on the plate and 
Jesus,

1666
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:18,820
you don't want to throw those man,
that's for sure.

1667
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:23,821
And that's the point.
And then you have the bake and then you 

1668
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:26,380
want to make sure you buy the lowest 
possible quality bacon.

1669
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:31,430
Not that that's how you start and then 
you throw it on the grill and you don't.

1670
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:34,210
Your grill has to be overheated to do 
this,

1671
01:34:34,211 --> 01:34:38,860
you have to cook the Bacon so that it's 
raw in places and burned in other places

1672
01:34:39,070 --> 01:34:42,070
and it has that delightful.
Like older.

1673
01:34:42,071 --> 01:34:47,071
They'd only really cheap,
badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe 

1674
01:34:47,071 --> 01:34:51,391
you use those little breakfast sausages 
that no one in their bloody right mind 

1675
01:34:51,391 --> 01:34:52,840
would let within 15 feet of anything 
living,

1676
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:58,080
you know,
and then you serve that right and you 

1677
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:58,250
serve it with the kind of orange juice

1678
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:03,250
that is only orange in color and with 
coffee,

1679
01:35:05,721 --> 01:35:10,721
that's.
What would you say it was started too 

1680
01:35:10,721 --> 01:35:12,530
early in the morning.
That's the first thing.

1681
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,130
Bad quality coffee started too early in 
the morning.

1682
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:22,130
God called once or twice.
It has been reheated and then you serve 

1683
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:26,100
that with whitener.
It's like,

1684
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,730
here's your breakfast.
It's like,

1685
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:31,220
no man,
that's not breakfast.

1686
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:32,300
That's Hell

1687
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:39,130
No.

1688
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,040
And you created it and then what you do 
if you have a diner like that is because

1689
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:48,620
you have a miserable life.
If you have a diner like that and you've

1690
01:35:48,621 --> 01:35:53,621
really worked on achieving that is every
night you go home and you curse your 

1691
01:35:53,621 --> 01:35:57,670
wife and you curse your kids and you 
fucking well curse God to for producing 

1692
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:02,921
a universe where a diner like yours is 
allowed to exist and that's your bloody 

1693
01:36:02,921 --> 01:36:07,811
life so well,
so that's what God's trying to point out

1694
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:13,091
here is if thou shalt thou not be 
accepted,

1695
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,880
and if they'll do a snort,
well then sin lies at your door.

1696
01:36:28,210 --> 01:36:28,930
Well,
so what?

1697
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:34,110
I looked at lots of translations for 
this and actually the next line is an 

1698
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:36,280
unto these unto thee shall be his 
desire.

1699
01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:40,190
Yes.
What God actually says.

1700
01:36:40,191 --> 01:36:41,330
It's something like this is like,

1701
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,540
you know things aren't going so well for
you,

1702
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:46,190
but if you were behaving properly they 
would,

1703
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:47,510
but instead,
this is what you've done.

1704
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:52,520
Sin came to your door and send means to 
pull your Arrow back into miss the 

1705
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:52,670
target.
Sin came to your door,

1706
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:58,060
but he uses a metaphor and the metaphor 
is something like sin came to your door 

1707
01:36:58,060 --> 01:37:01,901
like this sexually aroused Cap Predator 
thing and you invited to Dan first and 

1708
01:37:06,291 --> 01:37:11,291
then you let it have its way with you.
It's like you entered into a creative.

1709
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:17,170
He uses a sexual metaphor.
You entered into a creative exchange 

1710
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:21,251
with it and gave birth to something as a
consequence in that what you gave birth 

1711
01:37:21,251 --> 01:37:25,751
to you,
that that's your life and and you knew 

1712
01:37:25,751 --> 01:37:26,450
it.
Your self conscious.

1713
01:37:26,451 --> 01:37:29,750
After all,
you knew you were doing this and you

1714
01:37:32,210 --> 01:37:37,210
conspired with this thing to produce the
situation that you're in.

1715
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:43,430
You said something about this,
similar about the Ed Mother's situation.

1716
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:47,120
It was very politically incorrect.
What he said,

1717
01:37:47,550 --> 01:37:52,550
of course,
every single thing that you wrote was 

1718
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:54,131
politically incorrect,
so just how you could tell he was a 

1719
01:37:54,131 --> 01:37:57,671
thinker by the way.
He talked about the unholy alliance 

1720
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:03,690
between hyper dependent children and 
their mothers and he said,

1721
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:04,940
well,
it's actually because you.

1722
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,350
Freud thought about it as a,
as a maternal thing.

1723
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:12,560
I'm not putting fried down.
Freud mapped out the whole situation 

1724
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:13,470
brilliantly.
I'm not putting four down,

1725
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:16,840
but you know,
young was taking the ideas and expanding

1726
01:38:16,841 --> 01:38:18,300
them outward.
You know,

1727
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:23,330
he said that there was an actually an 
unholy alliance between a hyper 

1728
01:38:23,330 --> 01:38:27,170
dependent child and uh,
and they need to pull over dependent 

1729
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:30,141
mother.
And the alliance was the mother would 

1730
01:38:30,141 --> 01:38:32,691
always offer.
So maybe the kid is supposed to go off 

1731
01:38:32,691 --> 01:38:33,570
and do something that would require a 
little bit of courage and effort

1732
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:40,000
and the mother says,

1733
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:46,160
well,
are you sure you're feeling well enough 

1734
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:46,160
to do it?

1735
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:47,750
And then the child could say yes

1736
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:50,770
or the child could say no and then

1737
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:52,820
he put in bed and

1738
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,580
baby did all of that.
And.

1739
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:58,260
But the thing is the child made the damn
decision to.

1740
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,240
And you might think,
well that's pretty harsh,

1741
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:05,241
but just because children are little 
doesn't mean they're stupid and you 

1742
01:39:05,241 --> 01:39:10,071
don't know children if you don't know 
how children know how to manipulate 

1743
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:14,480
because they are staggeringly good at 
that because they're studying you 

1744
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:16,980
nonstop trying to figure out a what 
you're up to and B,

1745
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:19,830
how they can get what they want in the 
way that they wanted.

1746
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:22,620
And so they can play a manipulative 
game,

1747
01:39:22,621 --> 01:39:27,621
no problem,
especially if they're well schooled in 

1748
01:39:27,621 --> 01:39:27,621
it.
And so it's sort of like that.

1749
01:39:27,621 --> 01:39:27,720
It's like maybe the mother is a little 
too,

1750
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:32,750
a little timid and a little inclined to 
overprotect and maybe the child is 

1751
01:39:32,750 --> 01:39:36,330
little manipulative and a little willing
to not take that courageous step out in 

1752
01:39:37,351 --> 01:39:42,090
the world and to regress into infantiles
dependency instead.

1753
01:39:42,091 --> 01:39:47,091
And then you get a terrible dynamic 
building across time that is like a 

1754
01:39:47,091 --> 01:39:47,320
vicious circle,
you know,

1755
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:52,330
or like a positive feedback loop.
It just expands and expands and expands 

1756
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:55,491
because sometimes in families you see a 
hyper dependent child and a perfectly 

1757
01:39:55,491 --> 01:40:00,471
independent child in st mother.
So obviously same author I mother is 

1758
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:05,720
very complex and mother for child a and 
mother for child b are not the same 

1759
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:06,630
mother.
Even if they happen to be the same human

1760
01:40:06,631 --> 01:40:08,400
being.
That literature's quite clear on that,

1761
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:11,020
but you get my point,
but God's idea was

1762
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,050
not only are you not doing well because

1763
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:19,690
you're not doing well,
but you're not doing well because you've

1764
01:40:19,691 --> 01:40:23,530
actually really spent a lot of work 
figuring out how to not do well.

1765
01:40:23,531 --> 01:40:28,531
This is like creative effort on your 
part and if you read about truly 

1766
01:40:28,931 --> 01:40:33,931
malevolent people and you could start 
with the columbine killers because they 

1767
01:40:33,931 --> 01:40:34,450
left some very interesting diaries 
behind,

1768
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:36,760
so I would recommend them.
If you.

1769
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:41,850
There's plenty of serial killers you 
could read about in the people who've 

1770
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,640
really gone out and done dark things and
I've read more than my fair share of 

1771
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:45,400
that sort of thing and understand it 
quite well.

1772
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:53,100
If you really want to have your 
countenance fall and be wroth 10 years 

1773
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:58,621
of brooding on your own catastrophe sort
of alone and letting your fantasies take

1774
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:05,701
shape and and,
and egging them on and and allowing them

1775
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:10,030
to flourish and let's say take 
possession of you because that's exactly

1776
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:15,031
the right way to think about it.
That'll get you somewhere like this and 

1777
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:20,791
there are more people who are like that.
Then you think and your more like that 

1778
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:25,261
than you think.
Well,

1779
01:41:25,731 --> 01:41:28,490
so Kane,
he's obviously not very happy about this

1780
01:41:28,491 --> 01:41:31,640
whole answer obviously,
because the last thing you want to hear,

1781
01:41:31,641 --> 01:41:35,960
if your life is turned into a 
catastrophe and you take God to task for

1782
01:41:35,961 --> 01:41:40,961
creating a universe where that sort of 
thing was allowed is that it's your own 

1783
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:43,010
damn fault and you should straighten up 
and fly,

1784
01:41:43,011 --> 01:41:44,120
right,
so to speak,

1785
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:47,390
and you shouldn't be complaining about 
the nature of being,

1786
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:51,800
but that is the answer he gets.
And so then what happens?

1787
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:57,550
Well,
we have to infer that if cain was angry 

1788
01:41:57,550 --> 01:41:58,880
before that,
he's a lot more angry now,

1789
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:03,620
and of course that's exactly what the 
story reveals,

1790
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:05,390
and Cain talked with Abel,
his brother,

1791
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:12,490
and it came to pass when they were in 
the field that Cain rose up against 

1792
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:12,490
Abel,
his brother,

1793
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:12,490
and slew him.

1794
01:42:16,430 --> 01:42:18,080
I'm going to read you something else 
now.

1795
01:42:19,190 --> 01:42:24,190
This is foreshadowing again,
this is from the same chapter by the 

1796
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:24,890
way,
do what is meaningful,

1797
01:42:24,891 --> 01:42:29,891
not what is expedient.
Jesus was led into the wilderness 

1798
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:29,891
according to the story to be tempted by 
the devil.

1799
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:32,840
Matthew four,
one prior to his crucifixion,

1800
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:36,470
this is the story of Cain restated 
abstractly,

1801
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:40,580
cane as far from happy as we have seen.
He's working hard or so,

1802
01:42:40,581 --> 01:42:42,290
he thinks,
but God is not pleased.

1803
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:45,290
Meanwhile,
able is dancing away in the daisies.

1804
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:47,270
His crops flourish.
Women love him.

1805
01:42:47,630 --> 01:42:49,670
First of all,
he's a pretty good guy.

1806
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:52,640
Everyone knows it.
He deserves his good fortune.

1807
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:57,010
All the more reason to hate him.
I used to joke when I.

1808
01:42:57,010 --> 01:43:02,010
I used to teach at Harvard now and then 
my wife would have some of the 

1809
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:04,901
undergraduates over.
We used to joke afterwards because some 

1810
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:04,901
of them were very.

1811
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:06,230
Many of them were very remarkable kids,
you know,

1812
01:43:06,231 --> 01:43:08,810
like they,
they were super smart.

1813
01:43:08,811 --> 01:43:13,811
They were athletic or they had some 
dramatic ability or they were musicians 

1814
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:17,801
or they done some spectacular charitable
work because he basically to get 

1815
01:43:17,801 --> 01:43:21,731
accepted into Harvard,
you had to be top of your damn school 

1816
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:23,600
and then you had to have at least two 
other outstanding things going for you,

1817
01:43:23,601 --> 01:43:28,601
you know,
and what was so annoying about most of 

1818
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:28,601
these kids,
this was our joke,

1819
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:30,410
was you really both liked them and 
respected them.

1820
01:43:30,411 --> 01:43:31,390
It's like,
wow.

1821
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:36,700
My joke was you'd think they would have 
had the good graces to be like 

1822
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:38,030
dislikable sons of bitches,
at least with all the,

1823
01:43:38,031 --> 01:43:40,970
all those other great things going for 
them.

1824
01:43:40,971 --> 01:43:44,780
They had to add like respectability and 
likability to it as well.

1825
01:43:44,781 --> 01:43:45,740
So you thought,
well,

1826
01:43:45,741 --> 01:43:50,741
you know,
it really couldn't happen to a better 

1827
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:50,741
person.
It's like,

1828
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:50,741
good God.
Well that's,

1829
01:43:50,741 --> 01:43:52,100
that's,
that's able to situation,

1830
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,820
you know,
it's like,

1831
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:58,150
and you know,
the funny thing too is that that's an 

1832
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:58,150
ideal.
That's the ideal,

1833
01:43:58,150 --> 01:43:58,580
right?
Because an ideal person,

1834
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:03,640
let's say,
would be someone who you would want to 

1835
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:07,481
be like and someone who is operating in 
the world like you would want to 

1836
01:44:07,481 --> 01:44:12,221
operate.
And someone who fortune was smiling on 

1837
01:44:12,221 --> 01:44:12,440
and someone who was making the right 
sacrifices.

1838
01:44:12,441 --> 01:44:17,441
It's really what you would want to be.
And so cain kills that,

1839
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:22,080
right?
So it's a psychological story too,

1840
01:44:22,170 --> 01:44:27,170
and you see this in the cynicism that 
people have about people who have done 

1841
01:44:27,691 --> 01:44:32,691
well in the world.
They're always looking for some reason 

1842
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:33,450
why they've done while they must be 
crooked or they must be.

1843
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:36,990
It must be conniving,
or they must be arrogant or they must be

1844
01:44:36,991 --> 01:44:40,410
psychopathic or and,
and of course all of those things exist,

1845
01:44:40,411 --> 01:44:43,860
but it's very bad trick to play on 
yourself,

1846
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:49,070
to make the proposition that the person 
in the world who represents your own 

1847
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:53,070
ideal is that ideal because of 
despicable reasons,

1848
01:44:53,071 --> 01:44:58,071
because what you do is train yourself 
that the ideal that you should pursue 

1849
01:44:58,071 --> 01:44:59,970
can only exist if it's motivated by 
despicable reasons.

1850
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,970
And then what?
Not only is Abel your brother,

1851
01:45:02,971 --> 01:45:05,970
dad as your brother in the field,
in reality,

1852
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:09,210
but you've also slaughtered your own 
ideal.

1853
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:11,730
Well then what the hell are you going to
work for?

1854
01:45:11,731 --> 01:45:13,260
Well,
how are you going to live then?

1855
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:15,960
Well,
bitterly and miserably.

1856
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:17,550
That's for sure,
bitterly,

1857
01:45:17,551 --> 01:45:21,840
miserably and hopelessly.
That's how you're going to live and it's

1858
01:45:21,841 --> 01:45:26,841
so rare that I see,
especially publicly that people honestly

1859
01:45:28,351 --> 01:45:30,570
admit with sports figures,
they'll do it.

1860
01:45:30,571 --> 01:45:32,970
That's the one place where that seems to
happen,

1861
01:45:32,971 --> 01:45:37,971
but it's so uncommon for expressions of 
admiration and gratitude to manifest 

1862
01:45:41,071 --> 01:45:44,930
themselves in any public communication 
of any sort.

1863
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:46,260
Newspapers,
TV,

1864
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,660
youtube,
twitter.

1865
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:50,160
It's almost always

1866
01:45:51,480 --> 01:45:56,480
undermining and backbiting and criticism
and very often directed to people who 

1867
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:05,220
who have often done little else,
but bringing good things into the world 

1868
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:09,720
for other people,
and that's part of why this is such a 

1869
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:13,240
profound story.
He's a pretty good guy.

1870
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,370
Everyone knows that.
He deserves his good fortune.

1871
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:18,430
All the more reason to hate him,
that's for sure.

1872
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:22,330
Cane bruise on his misfortune like a 
vulture on an egg.

1873
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:25,420
He enters the desert wilderness of his 
own mind.

1874
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,930
He obsesses over his ill fortune and 
betrayal.

1875
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:34,080
He nourishes his resentment.
Indulges in evermore elaborate fantasies

1876
01:46:37,021 --> 01:46:42,021
of revenge.
His arrogance grows to Luciferian 

1877
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:42,021
proportions.
I'm ill,

1878
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:47,001
used and oppressed.
He thinks this is a stupid bloody 

1879
01:46:47,001 --> 01:46:48,090
planet.
It can go to hell.

1880
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,430
And with that,
he encountered

1881
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:54,270
Satan in the Wilderness and falls prey 
to his temptations,

1882
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:59,730
and he does what he can.
And John Milton's unforgettable words to

1883
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:04,731
confound the race of mankind in the 
first route and mingle and involve earth

1884
01:47:05,431 --> 01:47:10,431
with hell done all to spite the great 
creator.

1885
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:16,540
He turns to evil,
to obtain what good forbade him.

1886
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:21,040
And he does it voluntarily,
self consciously and with malice.

1887
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:27,950
Let Him who has ears here.
So that's the first two human beings.

1888
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:35,130
They're resentful,
bitter failure,

1889
01:47:36,180 --> 01:47:41,180
taking an ax to the admirable success.
And the Lord said Unto Cain,

1890
01:47:47,501 --> 01:47:49,300
where is Abel die brother?
And he said,

1891
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,220
I know not am I my brother's keeper.

1892
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:53,910
And

1893
01:47:55,230 --> 01:47:56,850
he said,
what has he done?

1894
01:47:56,851 --> 01:48:00,720
The Voice of your brother's blood crieth
unto me from the ground.

1895
01:48:01,240 --> 01:48:02,180
Okay,

1896
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:09,060
now are they'll curse from the earth,
which has opened her mouth to receive 

1897
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:12,460
your brother's blood from your hand.
You know,

1898
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,880
if you want to understand that,
which I would recommend,

1899
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:18,100
he could read Dostoyevsky's

1900
01:48:20,050 --> 01:48:23,200
crime and punishment.
How it's a great,

1901
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:29,040
it's a great novel.
I think it might be the greatest novel 

1902
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:29,040
ever written because I haven't read 
every novel,

1903
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:33,310
but in my experience it's the greatest 
novel and it is exactly this.

1904
01:48:33,311 --> 01:48:34,000
It,
it,

1905
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:39,240
it,
it says what happens psychologically if 

1906
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,390
you commit the ultimate crime,
it's amazing.

1907
01:48:40,391 --> 01:48:41,730
It's absolutely amazing.
It's,

1908
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:42,760
it's,
it's,

1909
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:48,870
there's,
there's no psychologist like Dostoevsky 

1910
01:48:49,300 --> 01:48:54,300
when now tell us the ground.
It shall not hence forth yield unto the 

1911
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:54,470
her strength of fugitive in a vagabond 
shell.

1912
01:48:54,530 --> 01:48:57,310
There'll be in the earth and Cain said 
unto the Lord,

1913
01:48:58,090 --> 01:48:59,860
my punishment is greater than I can 
bear.

1914
01:49:00,250 --> 01:49:05,250
Now,
one of the things that's interesting 

1915
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:05,250
about this is that,
you know what?

1916
01:49:05,250 --> 01:49:08,620
I think the punishment that God lays on 
cane is.

1917
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,890
It's like the inevitable consequences of
keynes action.

1918
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:13,180
It's something like that.
It's like,

1919
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:14,980
well,
he killed his brother.

1920
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:19,960
There's no going back from that man.
Like good luck.

1921
01:49:19,961 --> 01:49:24,190
Forgiving yourself for that.
Especially if he was an ideal,

1922
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:27,640
especially if he was your ideal because 
you haven't just killed your brother and

1923
01:49:27,641 --> 01:49:31,570
of course tortured your parents and the 
rest of your family.

1924
01:49:31,810 --> 01:49:36,790
You've deprived the community of someone
who is upstanding and you did it for the

1925
01:49:36,791 --> 01:49:39,250
worst possible motivations.
It's like

1926
01:49:41,210 --> 01:49:44,390
there's no up from there,
right?

1927
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:48,220
That's,
that's as close hell as you could manage

1928
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,270
on earth,
I would say,

1929
01:49:49,390 --> 01:49:54,390
and Cain said unto the Lord,
my punishment is greater than I can 

1930
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:54,390
bear.
Behold,

1931
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:59,041
thou has driven me out this day from the
face of the earth and from thy face 

1932
01:49:59,041 --> 01:49:59,560
shall I be hid.
That too.

1933
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:03,160
It's like there's also no turning back 
to God,

1934
01:50:03,161 --> 01:50:06,700
let's say after an error like that 
because well,

1935
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:12,460
you've done everything you possibly 
could to spite God,

1936
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:17,640
assuming he exists and the probability 
that you're going to be able to mend 

1937
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:20,110
that relationship in your now broken 
state.

1938
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:24,700
When you couldn't mend it to begin with 
before you did something so terrible,

1939
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:30,580
starts to move towards zero and it shall
come to pass that everyone that find it 

1940
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:35,141
to me shall slay me,
and the Lord said unto him there for 

1941
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:35,650
whosoever Slayeth,
Kelly Cain,

1942
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:40,830
vengeance shall be taken on him.
Seven fold and the Lord said to mark 

1943
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:40,830
opponent cane list.

1944
01:50:40,830 --> 01:50:43,840
Any finding him should kill him.
That's an interesting thing.

1945
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:46,510
I wondered about that for a long time 
because you might think,

1946
01:50:46,511 --> 01:50:49,150
well why would god take cane under his 
wing so to speak,

1947
01:50:49,151 --> 01:50:54,151
given what's already happened and I 
think it has something to do with the 

1948
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:58,140
emergence of the idea that it was 
necessary to prevent tit for tat revenge

1949
01:50:58,241 --> 01:51:00,220
slayings.
It's something like that,

1950
01:51:00,221 --> 01:51:05,221
you know,
and there's hints of that later in the 

1951
01:51:05,221 --> 01:51:05,221
text because you know,
it's like,

1952
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:10,440
well I kill your brother and then you 
killed two of my brothers and then I 

1953
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,000
kill your whole family and then you kill
my whole town and then I kill your whole

1954
01:51:13,001 --> 01:51:14,680
country.
And then we blow up the world.

1955
01:51:14,681 --> 01:51:19,681
It's like,
that's probably not a very intelligent 

1956
01:51:19,681 --> 01:51:22,240
solution to the initial problem.
Even though the initial problem,

1957
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:25,030
which might be a murder is not an easy 
thing to solve.

1958
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:30,300
But I think it's something like that.
And then the last part of the story is 

1959
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:35,850
that's William Blake.
So Adam and eve have discovered their 

1960
01:51:37,471 --> 01:51:42,471
dead son and Kane has become cognizant,
I would say,

1961
01:51:44,791 --> 01:51:48,210
of what he did and what he is.
Right?

1962
01:51:48,211 --> 01:51:50,880
So it's another entrance into a form of 
self consciousness.

1963
01:51:50,881 --> 01:51:52,140
It's,
it's,

1964
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:55,170
you know,
the self consciousness that Adam and eve

1965
01:51:55,171 --> 01:52:00,171
developed was painful enough.
They become aware of their own 

1966
01:52:00,171 --> 01:52:01,680
vulnerability and their nakedness and 
perhaps even their capacity for evil,

1967
01:52:02,010 --> 01:52:04,260
but cain becomes aware of his

1968
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:12,240
voluntary engagement with evil itself 
and sees that as a crucial human 

1969
01:52:14,921 --> 01:52:18,550
capability.
And that's something modern people,

1970
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:23,551
you know,
it's no wonder we don't take it 

1971
01:52:23,551 --> 01:52:25,351
seriously like I know in the academy,
in and among intellectual circles for 

1972
01:52:25,351 --> 01:52:28,090
decades,
the idea of evil has been like,

1973
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:31,810
what are you medieval or something,
you know,

1974
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:33,460
the whole idea of evil.
You don't.

1975
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:37,990
That's a nonstarter as an intellectual 
starting place as a,

1976
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,260
as a topic.
And that's something that I've just been

1977
01:52:41,261 --> 01:52:46,261
unable to understand because I cannot 
understand how you could possibly have 

1978
01:52:46,701 --> 01:52:50,510
more than a cursory knowledge of the 
history of the 20th century.

1979
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:56,870
Much,
much less a deep knowledge of the 

1980
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,751
history of the 20th century and to walk 
away with any other conclusion then well

1981
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:03,130
good might not exist but evil.
Hey,

1982
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:10,000
the evidence for that is so overwhelming
that that only willful blindness could 

1983
01:53:14,291 --> 01:53:18,490
possibly explain denying its existence,

1984
01:53:22,570 --> 01:53:27,570
and that was actually a useful little 
discovery for me because I also 

1985
01:53:27,570 --> 01:53:32,430
concluded perhaps that if it was true,
evil existed,

1986
01:53:32,741 --> 01:53:37,741
then it was true by inference that it's 
opposite existed because the opposite of

1987
01:53:39,101 --> 01:53:44,101
evil.
Let's say the evil of the concentration 

1988
01:53:44,101 --> 01:53:44,101
camp,
let's say,

1989
01:53:44,101 --> 01:53:45,310
or we could get more specific about it.
We could say there's this one thing that

1990
01:53:45,311 --> 01:53:50,311
used to happen in Auschwitz where they 
would take people off the incoming 

1991
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:56,491
trains.
Those who lived that weren't stacked 

1992
01:53:56,491 --> 01:53:59,371
around the outside of the train train 
cars and froze to death because it was 

1993
01:54:02,711 --> 01:54:07,711
too cold.
You know those who only had to be stuck 

1994
01:54:07,711 --> 01:54:09,961
in the middle where it was warm enough 
so that maybe the old people died 

1995
01:54:09,961 --> 01:54:13,501
because they suffocated,
but at least some of them were alive 

1996
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:14,710
when they made it to Auschwitz and then 
they took those poor people out.

1997
01:54:14,740 --> 01:54:18,200
One of the tricks that the guards used 
to play on them was to have the,

1998
01:54:19,180 --> 01:54:24,180
the newly arrived prisoners hoist like 
100 pound sacks of wet salt and carry 

1999
01:54:25,301 --> 01:54:29,020
them from one side of the compound and 
these compounds were big.

2000
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:31,450
This was a city.
It wasn't like a gymnasium.

2001
01:54:31,451 --> 01:54:36,451
It was like a city.
There were tens of thousands of people 

2002
01:54:36,451 --> 01:54:38,761
there.
They'd have them carry the sack of salt 

2003
01:54:38,761 --> 01:54:40,090
from one side of the compound to the 
other and then back.

2004
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:46,290
Right,
and that was to make a mockery out of 

2005
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:47,620
the notion that work would set you free.
It's like,

2006
01:54:47,621 --> 01:54:48,040
no,
no,

2007
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:51,040
you work here,
but there's nothing productive about it.

2008
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:54,550
The whole point,
it's exactly the opposite of sacrifice.

2009
01:54:54,551 --> 01:54:59,551
In some sense.
It's so we're going to make you act out 

2010
01:54:59,551 --> 01:55:02,491
working,
but all it will do is speed your demise 

2011
01:55:02,491 --> 01:55:05,670
and maybe we can decorate it up a little
bit because not only will it speed up 

2012
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:08,941
your demise,
it will do it in a very painful way 

2013
01:55:08,941 --> 01:55:11,280
while simultaneously increasing the 
probability that other people's demises 

2014
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:13,630
will be painful and sped up.
It's a work of art,

2015
01:55:13,660 --> 01:55:18,660
that's for sure.
And to to to know about that sort of 

2016
01:55:18,791 --> 01:55:23,791
thing and not to not regard it as evil 
means while you can figure out what it 

2017
01:55:23,791 --> 01:55:27,811
means for yourself and Kane wind out 
from the presence of the Lord and dwelt 

2018
01:55:28,331 --> 01:55:30,100
in the land of nod on the east of Eden

2019
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,410
and Cain knew his wife and she 
conceived,

2020
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:39,640
you know,
in one of the critics that criticism is 

2021
01:55:39,640 --> 01:55:41,160
a fairly common criticism of these 
biblical stories as well.

2022
01:55:41,161 --> 01:55:46,110
If cain and Abel were the only two 
people and from Adam and eve,

2023
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:51,111
it's like,
where did all these other people come 

2024
01:55:51,111 --> 01:55:52,641
from?
And doesn't that make the story like 

2025
01:55:52,641 --> 01:55:52,641
simple minded?
It's like,

2026
01:55:52,641 --> 01:55:54,530
no,
that makes the reader simple minded.

2027
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:58,140
I mean really that's the best criticism 
of this.

2028
01:55:58,141 --> 01:56:01,710
You're going to come up with being.
You might say,

2029
01:56:01,950 --> 01:56:06,950
Oh,
you missed the point that that would be 

2030
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:06,950
the right response.
You missed the point.

2031
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:09,710
And cain knew his wife and she conceived
and Bare Enoch and he built it,

2032
01:56:09,711 --> 01:56:14,711
the city.
And so it's cane that builds the cities 

2033
01:56:14,711 --> 01:56:15,630
and starts the civilization and called.
That's pretty rough too,

2034
01:56:15,631 --> 01:56:20,631
right?
So it's the first fratricidal murderer 

2035
01:56:20,631 --> 01:56:20,850
who builds the cities after the name of 
his son,

2036
01:56:20,851 --> 01:56:23,370
Enoch,
and onto enoch was born Erad,

2037
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,480
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

2038
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,700
going through the generations.

2039
01:56:26,700 --> 01:56:30,810
And lamach took unto him two wives.
The name of the one was done in the name

2040
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:32,220
of the other Zilla.
So this is,

2041
01:56:32,221 --> 01:56:37,221
uh,
an attempt to flesh out the genealogy 

2042
01:56:37,221 --> 01:56:40,191
and to describe how culture started in 
some sense and these tribal communities 

2043
01:56:40,191 --> 01:56:45,050
and Ada rebel,
and he was the father of such as dwell 

2044
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:47,781
in tents and have such as have cattle.
And his brother's name was Jubal and he 

2045
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:51,190
was the father of all is such handle the
heart bend,

2046
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,410
Oregon,
and Zillah.

2047
01:56:52,411 --> 01:56:55,200
She also bear Tubal,
an instructor of error.

2048
01:56:55,201 --> 01:57:00,201
Every artificer and brass and iron and 
Tubal cane traditionally is the first 

2049
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:06,351
person who makes weapons of war.
And lamech back to Mac.

2050
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:14,330
Descendant of Cain said unto his wives,
Ada and Zillah hear my voice.

2051
01:57:14,851 --> 01:57:19,851
See Wives of Lamech Hearken unto my 
speech for I have slain a man to my 

2052
01:57:19,851 --> 01:57:21,960
wounding and a young man to my hurt.
If cane be avenged,

2053
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:25,220
sevenfold truly lamach 77.

2054
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:33,420
Well,
what I see in that is this proclivity of

2055
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:38,990
this murderous capacity of cane as it 
manifests itself as society develops to 

2056
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:47,690
to a murderous intent that transcends 
the mere killing of a brother.

2057
01:57:48,450 --> 01:57:50,010
You hurt me,
I hurt you back.

2058
01:57:50,011 --> 01:57:51,690
It's no you heard me,
I,

2059
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:56,100
I kill you,
and six other people and that thing that

2060
01:57:56,101 --> 01:57:58,860
happens after that is to not make it 
seven people,

2061
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:03,861
but to make it 70 people.
And so there's this idea that once that 

2062
01:58:03,861 --> 01:58:08,480
that first murderous seed is sown,
it has this proclivity to manifest 

2063
01:58:11,431 --> 01:58:16,431
itself exponentially and that's a 
warning and that's also why I think 

2064
01:58:16,431 --> 01:58:21,220
Tubal Kane who was one of keynes 
descendants was the first person who 

2065
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:25,791
made weapons of war and that's pretty 
much the story of Cain and Abel and it's

2066
01:58:32,951 --> 01:58:37,951
a hell of a story as far as I can tell,
and I think it's worth thinking about 

2067
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:39,990
pretty much forever because

2068
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:44,470
there are so many.
It's so many.

2069
01:58:44,471 --> 01:58:46,480
It has so many facets,
you know,

2070
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,900
and I think the most usefully revealing 
of those facets is the potential for 

2071
01:58:58,061 --> 01:58:59,620
this story.
Once understood,

2072
01:58:59,621 --> 01:59:04,621
to shed light on not your own failure.
Not even on your rejection by being,

2073
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:13,351
let's say,
but by the but on the proclivity to 

2074
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:20,280
murder the best and the best in you for 
revenge upon that violation,

2075
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:31,980
because what that means and we know that
knowledge of good and evil into the 

2076
01:59:31,980 --> 01:59:32,770
world,
so to speak,

2077
01:59:33,010 --> 01:59:38,010
with Adam and Eve's transgression,
is that now not only does humanity have 

2078
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:42,451
to contend with tragedy and suffering 
and even the unharvested fruits of 

2079
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:52,081
proper sacrifice,
but with the introduction of real 

2080
01:59:52,081 --> 01:59:55,591
malevolence into the world,
so there's the fall into history and 

2081
02:00:00,641 --> 02:00:05,641
then there's the discovery of sacrifice 
as a medication for the fall and then 

2082
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:10,801
there's a counter position which is the 
emergence of malevolence as the enemy of

2083
02:00:11,201 --> 02:00:16,201
proper sacrifice and that's where we're 
left at the end of Cain and Abel and 

2084
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:21,490
that's the end of that lecture.
Thank you.

2085
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,600
All right.

2086
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:33,350
Okay.
So you've said that one of your moral 

2087
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:35,541
axioms is that pain is bad and so we 
should work to eliminate unnecessary 

2088
02:00:35,941 --> 02:00:40,941
suffering.
Isn't this the basis for a secular 

2089
02:00:40,941 --> 02:00:45,081
morality like utilitarianism and can we 
therefore be moral without religion?

2090
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,660
Well,
I don't think that it's.

2091
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:58,630
First of all,
probably two,

2092
02:00:58,650 --> 02:01:03,650
the first question,
but that's also that derivation is 

2093
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:10,870
predicated on the idea that that's the 
only idea you know,

2094
02:01:10,890 --> 02:01:13,980
that I'm putting forward as our ethical 
idea and it's not.

2095
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:19,640
If that was the only idea,
well then you could derive from that if 

2096
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:20,550
fairly straightforward brand of utility 
utilitarianism,

2097
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:26,060
but then also I think to push the 
argument in that direction also 

2098
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:35,510
necessitates that reduction of what 
might constitute pain to something to 

2099
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:42,730
unidimensional because I think suffering
is a better term than pain.

2100
02:01:42,731 --> 02:01:45,560
All the pain in some senses at the core 
of suffering,

2101
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:51,760
suffering is a multidimensional 
phenomena and I don't think that you can

2102
02:01:52,311 --> 02:01:57,311
draw a simple utilitarian argument from 
that.

2103
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:05,920
Either the existence of suffering or the
observation that it's the reduction of 

2104
02:02:06,531 --> 02:02:09,140
unnecessary suffering might be a good 
thing.

2105
02:02:10,580 --> 02:02:15,580
So I'm also leery of those c,
it's not reasonable in some sense to 

2106
02:02:20,571 --> 02:02:25,571
reduce a complex set of ideas to a 
single proposition and then say the 

2107
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:32,351
ideas that I've been putting forward and
then to reduce another complex 

2108
02:02:32,351 --> 02:02:35,141
philosophical set of ideas to a single 
proposition and then say aren't those 

2109
02:02:35,141 --> 02:02:39,431
two things the same?
And they are to reduce them to the two 

2110
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:42,320
simple axioms,
or you could argue that they're the same

2111
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:43,900
but.
But you.

2112
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:49,180
But I would say there's a tremendous 
amount left out in the telling and that 

2113
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:50,930
what's left out is relevant.
It kind of reminds me of those.

2114
02:02:51,610 --> 02:02:54,530
It was philosophical games that 
psychologists often play.

2115
02:02:54,531 --> 02:02:55,880
It's like,
well,

2116
02:02:55,881 --> 02:02:58,160
if there was,
I think one of.

2117
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:03,200
What's the one,
I don't know if I can recall this 

2118
02:03:03,200 --> 02:03:03,200
properly.

2119
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:06,890
It's the trolley cart problem.
Something like,

2120
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:12,910
you know,
if there was a train that was out of 

2121
02:03:12,910 --> 02:03:15,491
control and it was going towards six 
people on one track,

2122
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:21,940
would you flip a switch?
So it's switched tracks and only killed 

2123
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:22,070
one person.
Would you do that?

2124
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:26,540
And I read a question like that and I 
think that's a stupid question.

2125
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:32,230
And the reason I think that is because 
you can't take a situation like that and

2126
02:03:33,351 --> 02:03:37,730
render it properly by reducing it to 
that question.

2127
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:43,180
And then you also can't assume that the 
person who answers that question would 

2128
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:46,520
in fact act in the way they answered.
You can't presume any of that.

2129
02:03:46,521 --> 02:03:51,521
It's like because in a situation like 
that in a high stress situation like 

2130
02:03:51,521 --> 02:03:55,961
that,
the devil is in the details and I've 

2131
02:03:55,961 --> 02:03:59,980
dealt with situations like that a number
of times and know perfectly well that 

2132
02:03:59,980 --> 02:04:01,130
the devil's in the details,
so I think that there's a.

2133
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:06,800
there's an intellectual reduction to 
make a philosophical point that doesn't 

2134
02:04:06,951 --> 02:04:11,951
give the complexity of the topic justice
and then there was a second part to that

2135
02:04:13,070 --> 02:04:18,070
which was and therefore can't we be 
moral without religion?

2136
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:23,500
Well,
I would say that question also suffers 

2137
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:26,120
in some sense from the same problem of 
formulation.

2138
02:04:26,380 --> 02:04:31,380
I I'm very hesitant ever to answer a 
question of the form is a merely a 

2139
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:39,731
manifestation of be when and b are very 
complex things because the answer to 

2140
02:04:40,051 --> 02:04:45,051
that is it depends on what you mean by 
moral and what you mean by religious.

2141
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:51,590
Because see there's an underlying 
intellectual maneuver in a question like

2142
02:04:54,871 --> 02:04:59,871
that and the underlying maneuver is the 
a priori assumption that something as 

2143
02:05:00,511 --> 02:05:05,511
complex as religion or as complex as 
morality can be reduced to an object 

2144
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:11,541
with a name and then two objects reduced
to their name can be assessed 

2145
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:15,630
simultaneously.
And I don't think that that's the case.

2146
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:20,810
I think you can say something like,
is a triangle a square?

2147
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:26,990
I think you can say that,
but I don't think you can say is it 

2148
02:05:28,031 --> 02:05:29,950
possible to have morality without 
religion?

2149
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:33,910
I don't think you can have that question
because it has to be expanded out.

2150
02:05:33,911 --> 02:05:36,010
So it's like,
what do you mean by morality exactly.

2151
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:38,830
And what do you mean by religion?
Because maybe and maybe not.

2152
02:05:39,160 --> 02:05:39,880
And so

2153
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:45,030
and so the answer to that question is 
decomposed the question.

2154
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:03,000
Yeah.

2155
02:06:07,420 --> 02:06:10,780
I don't want my young children 
indoctrinated with dangerous ideas.

2156
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:13,390
Um,
and as time marches on,

2157
02:06:13,391 --> 02:06:18,391
I trust public education less and less.
I know that you have strong thoughts on 

2158
02:06:18,391 --> 02:06:22,771
the danger of the devouring oedipal 
mother who harms your child by 

2159
02:06:22,771 --> 02:06:22,771
protecting them.
Um,

2160
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:25,330
and that's certainly not what I aspire 
to.

2161
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:31,650
I wonder if in spite of your idea that 
kids need to become tough and learn to 

2162
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:35,641
slay dragons,
if you have anything good to say about 

2163
02:06:35,641 --> 02:06:35,641
the idea of homeschooling.

2164
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:40,740
Well,
I don't have anything bad to say about 

2165
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:43,131
it.
I do know that the government has 

2166
02:06:43,131 --> 02:06:46,250
recently taken moves to make it much 
more difficult for people to homeschool 

2167
02:06:46,250 --> 02:06:47,850
their children and it's not like five 
years.

2168
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:52,910
I mean,
15 years ago I would have presumed that 

2169
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:57,531
the vast majority of people who are home
schooling their children were to be 

2170
02:06:57,961 --> 02:06:59,910
viewed with skepticism.
Initially.

2171
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:03,480
I'm not so sure about that anymore.
Um,

2172
02:07:06,820 --> 02:07:07,750
you know,
for example,

2173
02:07:07,751 --> 02:07:12,751
I was sent a poster today.
Someone sent me this link that they 

2174
02:07:12,751 --> 02:07:16,621
found in the local junior high school 
and one of the media pieces that were 

2175
02:07:17,671 --> 02:07:22,671
recommended on this poster was a movie 
called Hedwig and the angry inch now 

2176
02:07:24,230 --> 02:07:29,230
already thought that was a terrible 
movie even though I'm perfectly capable 

2177
02:07:29,230 --> 02:07:30,090
of enjoying bizarre movies,
but.

2178
02:07:30,091 --> 02:07:32,040
So it's a bizarre movie,
that's for sure.

2179
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:35,410
But I also thought it was a terrible 
bitter movie.

2180
02:07:35,770 --> 02:07:36,280
Terrible

2181
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,810
and bitter.
Those are separate.

2182
02:07:37,960 --> 02:07:39,790
A movie can be bitter and be quite 
great,

2183
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:42,040
but it was a terrible movie and it was a
bitter movie,

2184
02:07:42,190 --> 02:07:44,350
but I can tell you one bloody thing 
about that movie.

2185
02:07:45,010 --> 02:07:47,500
It's not required viewing for 12 year 
old kids,

2186
02:07:47,830 --> 02:07:52,300
that's for sure.
So I think you have increasing reason to

2187
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:54,400
be skeptical of the public education 
system.

2188
02:07:54,401 --> 02:07:59,401
I also looked at the Elementary Teachers
Federation of Ontario's guidelines for 

2189
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:05,590
education from kindergarten to grade 
eight and what that is in essence,

2190
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:08,650
and I think I will do a video about it 
in the relatively near future,

2191
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:13,890
is a blueprint for transforming children
into social justice warriors had 

2192
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:17,901
basically says that it's like you don't 
have to be a conspiracy theory to read 

2193
02:08:17,901 --> 02:08:22,261
that.
I mean we have social justice tribunals 

2194
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:22,480
in Ontario and so the idea is,
well,

2195
02:08:22,481 --> 02:08:25,570
if you're going to get your children,
if you're going to get people to,

2196
02:08:26,830 --> 02:08:31,830
what would you say favor,
equity properly will then you better 

2197
02:08:31,830 --> 02:08:33,010
start teaching them while they're young.

2198
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:38,310
It's like maybe not.
So now you.

2199
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:42,310
You asked that question properly because
you say,

2200
02:08:42,311 --> 02:08:46,900
well to terrible education system,
the wonderful mother homeschooling,

2201
02:08:46,930 --> 02:08:48,010
right?
That's the danger.

2202
02:08:48,011 --> 02:08:51,490
It's like,
no because it might not be the wonderful

2203
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:56,491
mother homeschooling,
it might be the pathological mother 

2204
02:08:56,491 --> 02:08:59,281
using the pathology of the education 
system as an excuse to get her talons 

2205
02:08:59,281 --> 02:09:00,340
into her children.
Right?

2206
02:09:00,341 --> 02:09:04,750
Because that certainly equally possible 
or perhaps even more possible because at

2207
02:09:04,751 --> 02:09:09,700
least in the public education system,
there's some necessity for consensus.

2208
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:15,180
So that's something that you have to be 
very aware of and work to prevent.

2209
02:09:16,390 --> 02:09:18,220
Right.
And so I would say if you're going to do

2210
02:09:18,221 --> 02:09:23,221
that,
probably best not to do it on your own 

2211
02:09:23,221 --> 02:09:27,330
and you need.
It's like you need a board of advisors 

2212
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:27,730
or something like that and so maybe it 
can't just be you and you have to figure

2213
02:09:27,731 --> 02:09:28,300
out,
well what,

2214
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:33,390
what is they aim and how are you going 
to manage that and what makes you think 

2215
02:09:33,390 --> 02:09:35,860
you can do it even if it's being done 
badly publicly,

2216
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:37,960
what makes you think you could do it 
better?

2217
02:09:38,200 --> 02:09:39,810
I mean,
my general advice is,

2218
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:41,350
and people have asked me this,
in fact,

2219
02:09:41,351 --> 02:09:46,351
I had a conversation with the guy who 
was tiling my backyard this morning 

2220
02:09:46,351 --> 02:09:49,930
about something his son had said to him 
that he was taught at school recently,

2221
02:09:50,200 --> 02:09:54,790
which really made the tyler who had come
from a rather authoritarian country,

2222
02:09:55,210 --> 02:10:00,210
step back on his heels and think,
I'm not so sure I should be sending my 

2223
02:10:00,210 --> 02:10:03,631
kid to public school anymore and maybe I
shouldn't be living in Toronto even you 

2224
02:10:03,631 --> 02:10:08,071
know,
but my general advice is keep an eye on 

2225
02:10:08,071 --> 02:10:12,091
your kids and discuss with them what 
they're learning and and help equip them

2226
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:18,181
with the tools to not only to articulate
their own viewpoint in response to what 

2227
02:10:21,881 --> 02:10:26,881
they're being taught.
Now the problem is you might not have 

2228
02:10:26,881 --> 02:10:29,581
the time nor the ability to do that.
That's no simple thing and increasingly 

2229
02:10:29,581 --> 02:10:33,751
if you're unwilling to have your 
children participate in what is 

2230
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:37,100
increasingly indoctrination and not 
education,

2231
02:10:37,101 --> 02:10:42,101
thanks to in no small part to the 
Ontario Institute of the studies on 

2232
02:10:42,101 --> 02:10:46,151
Education,
which is an institution that I 

2233
02:10:46,151 --> 02:10:48,941
particularly despise.
Because I think that all it does is 

2234
02:10:48,941 --> 02:10:51,440
almost all it does now is produce 
indoctrinate of children.

2235
02:10:52,700 --> 02:10:57,700
It's not an easy,
it's not an easily easy problem to 

2236
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:00,911
solve,
so more more power to you wanting to

2237
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:08,380
put your children in a situation where 
they're not being indoctrinated,

2238
02:11:08,740 --> 02:11:12,910
but the alternative is very,
very complicated and difficult.

2239
02:11:13,390 --> 02:11:18,390
So yeah.
Thank you.

2240
02:11:25,870 --> 02:11:30,870
I was wondering,
is likely,

2241
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:38,090
you know,
I would say generally speaking,

2242
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:43,660
there's a shamonic basis,
two to almost old the religious 

2243
02:11:43,660 --> 02:11:47,981
traditions because that's the mill you 
out of which the religious traditions 

2244
02:11:47,981 --> 02:11:52,960
emerged.
Now I can't say much more than that 

2245
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,150
because I don't know and no one does 
that.

2246
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,590
The particularities.
I mean you might say,

2247
02:11:57,591 --> 02:12:01,220
well,
is there an illusion to the ingestion of

2248
02:12:01,221 --> 02:12:04,160
psychoactive chemicals in the Adam and 
Eve story?

2249
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:07,970
And people have made that case and 
there's been powerful cases made.

2250
02:12:07,971 --> 02:12:09,110
So there's a book,
for example,

2251
02:12:09,111 --> 02:12:12,110
I think it's called Soma by a guy named 
Gordon West Saul,

2252
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:17,440
who was the first person,
an amateur psychologist who was the 

2253
02:12:17,440 --> 02:12:20,801
first person to propose that the Soma of
the Hindus was we're at emoney to 

2254
02:12:21,591 --> 02:12:23,780
miscarry mushrooms,
which is actually a.

2255
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:29,170
those are the red mushrooms with the 
white dots that you always see on fairy 

2256
02:12:29,170 --> 02:12:29,170
tales.
You know the cute ones,

2257
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:33,230
toadstools flies like to eat them.

2258
02:12:33,230 --> 02:12:37,460
They're called fly a garrick.
Also lie seem to like getting stoned.

2259
02:12:37,700 --> 02:12:40,460
I know that's weird.
I know that's weird thing to say,

2260
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:45,700
but there's a good book on animal use of
psychedelics and more animals use them 

2261
02:12:45,700 --> 02:12:46,880
then you might think.
But anyways,

2262
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:51,240
there is some evidence that you know of 
use of,

2263
02:12:52,010 --> 02:12:57,010
of the ingest node,
let's say metaphorically speaking as an 

2264
02:12:57,010 --> 02:13:00,050
aid to the transformation of 
consciousness that goes back so far that

2265
02:13:00,530 --> 02:13:03,800
well forever as far as human beings are 
concerned.

2266
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:08,090
But to specifically tie that to the Adam
and Eve story,

2267
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:13,080
I haven't been able to see any evidence 
that would definitively linkedin.

2268
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:14,220
You know,
there's,

2269
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:16,610
there's been a lot of interesting books 
written about that.

2270
02:13:16,611 --> 02:13:20,930
There's one that was quite a kind of a 
weird hit and I think in the early,

2271
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,970
late sixties might've been early 
seventies.

2272
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:25,430
It sort of got brushed off as a hippie 
book,

2273
02:13:25,431 --> 02:13:30,431
but it really wasn't.
It's called the sacred mushroom and the 

2274
02:13:30,431 --> 02:13:30,431
cross.
That's really,

2275
02:13:30,431 --> 02:13:31,290
that's the sort of book you read and you
think,

2276
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:32,100
Huh?

2277
02:13:33,650 --> 02:13:35,850
I don't know.
I don't know what to do about that.

2278
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:37,970
I have no idea what to do about that 
look.

2279
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:41,040
So that's all I can say about that.

2280
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,200
Yup.

2281
02:13:49,570 --> 02:13:52,030
My is about martyrdom.
So,

2282
02:13:52,360 --> 02:13:57,360
um,
what do you think murdered him or the 

2283
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:57,610
willingness to suffer and die for what 
you believe,

2284
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:02,850
if anything says of the convictions and 
what do you think is the benefit for the

2285
02:14:03,101 --> 02:14:07,120
murder which is at least traditionally 
in immaterial and transcendent?

2286
02:14:07,121 --> 02:14:12,121
Good compared to the regular sacrifice 
or practical sacrifice which is ordered 

2287
02:14:13,571 --> 02:14:16,930
to the future material,
psychological or economic good

2288
02:14:18,890 --> 02:14:21,140
man.
You guys really come up with some wicked

2289
02:14:21,141 --> 02:14:26,141
question.
I think it depends to some degree on how

2290
02:14:29,041 --> 02:14:32,130
you define martyrdom.
You know,

2291
02:14:33,220 --> 02:14:36,030
cause you could,
you could define a dose.

2292
02:14:36,600 --> 02:14:37,190
Okay.

2293
02:14:38,110 --> 02:14:42,640
The tendency to pathologically self 
aggrandize yourself on public display,

2294
02:14:43,390 --> 02:14:47,830
or you could say it's the decision to be
immovable about a set of principles.

2295
02:14:47,860 --> 02:14:49,210
Right.
So let's go with that one.

2296
02:14:49,630 --> 02:14:52,570
Forget about the first one.
Well,

2297
02:14:52,571 --> 02:14:55,150
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
Right.

2298
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:56,500
Get in some sense.
It's,

2299
02:14:57,550 --> 02:15:02,550
it's.
Hmm.

2300
02:15:03,380 --> 02:15:04,490
That's a really tough one.

2301
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,320
People asked me.
I'll make it personal.

2302
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:15,321
I suppose people asked me when I first 
got involved in all this political 

2303
02:15:15,321 --> 02:15:16,830
controversy back in September,
October.

2304
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,210
Well,
they asked me a couple of things.

2305
02:15:18,211 --> 02:15:23,211
They,
they asked me if this was the hill that 

2306
02:15:23,211 --> 02:15:25,071
I really would choose to die on,
like pronouns and the transgender issue.

2307
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:28,460
Yeah.
Well it's not what I want.

2308
02:15:28,520 --> 02:15:31,680
I would have picked and.
But I mean it was about language,

2309
02:15:31,681 --> 02:15:32,610
you know,
and that,

2310
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:37,700
that makes it nontrivial.
And Bill [inaudible] was passed this 

2311
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:37,700
week as you know,
when.

2312
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:39,060
One of the things that was quite 
interesting about that,

2313
02:15:39,061 --> 02:15:41,790
and I will answer your question,
was that Brenda Cossman,

2314
02:15:41,791 --> 02:15:45,060
who was the woman that I debated,
I think it's

2315
02:15:46,570 --> 02:15:51,570
one of the persons that I debate.
It didn't like to be referred to as a 

2316
02:15:51,570 --> 02:15:51,610
woman,
but I didn't think it was Brenda.

2317
02:15:52,330 --> 02:15:57,330
Anyways,
she wrote an ipad and I believe it was 

2318
02:15:57,330 --> 02:16:00,061
in the globe and Mail,
but it might've been the national post 

2319
02:16:00,061 --> 02:16:02,400
saying as I knew,
she would say that bill [inaudible] was 

2320
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:06,211
just the beginning.
We have plenty of work left to do and 

2321
02:16:06,211 --> 02:16:08,200
yes you can bloody well be sure that we 
have plenty of work left to do.

2322
02:16:08,530 --> 02:16:13,530
Anyways.
I was asked during that period of time 

2323
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:13,530
whether or not I was being a martyr,
you know,

2324
02:16:13,530 --> 02:16:18,480
and I thought,
well it's not really one of my 

2325
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:18,480
ambitions.
You know,

2326
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:21,601
it's like that sort of torn to the lions
thing doesn't sound like exactly 

2327
02:16:21,601 --> 02:16:26,251
something you might aim for.
But I think,

2328
02:16:30,190 --> 02:16:35,190
well sometimes you find out in your life
may be that there's something you won't 

2329
02:16:35,190 --> 02:16:39,841
do and one thing and then maybe you just
don't do it no matter what the 

2330
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:44,020
consequences.
Maybe how I don't know because you know,

2331
02:16:44,110 --> 02:16:47,080
I haven't been pushed to that point,
but there have been people who have been

2332
02:16:47,081 --> 02:16:49,960
pushed to that point in history and they
basically said,

2333
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,510
I don't care why you do to me,
I'm not doing that,

2334
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:58,230
and you know,
maybe some of them were suicidal and 

2335
02:16:58,230 --> 02:17:01,111
some of them are psychotic and some of 
them had whatever other problems that 

2336
02:17:01,111 --> 02:17:01,111
people might have,
but yeah,

2337
02:17:01,111 --> 02:17:05,730
I do have this suspicion now and then 
some of them were just kind of serious 

2338
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:08,941
about saying no and there's some utility
in being serious about saying no and 

2339
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:13,060
that sort of revealed itself to me,
I suppose to some degree,

2340
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:18,420
back in September when I read a piece of
legislation that said I would have to 

2341
02:17:18,420 --> 02:17:21,310
use some words that were legislated by 
the government and I thought,

2342
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:26,400
there's no god damn way.
I'm going to do that under any 

2343
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:28,180
conditions that I can imagine.
Now.

2344
02:17:28,181 --> 02:17:33,181
There are conditions and I have a pretty
good imagination for unimaginable 

2345
02:17:33,181 --> 02:17:34,960
conditions.
I couldn't see it because I thought that

2346
02:17:34,961 --> 02:17:39,961
if I did that I would break through 
whatever would be left of me after 

2347
02:17:39,961 --> 02:17:42,820
having done that would no longer be me 
and

2348
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:48,050
I'm not interested in that.
I know what that would be like.

2349
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:51,500
I actually do know what that would be 
like and I'm not interested in that.

2350
02:17:51,680 --> 02:17:56,680
I would rather have whatever else 
happens happens and people have said to 

2351
02:17:57,081 --> 02:17:57,920
me,
well,

2352
02:17:57,921 --> 02:18:00,080
you're so courageous for taking this 
stand.

2353
02:18:00,081 --> 02:18:00,650
It's like,
yeah,

2354
02:18:00,651 --> 02:18:03,050
well I'm not going to claim any sort of 
other world courage.

2355
02:18:03,051 --> 02:18:04,310
I can tell you that,
but I can see,

2356
02:18:04,520 --> 02:18:08,450
but one thing I do know the difference 
between these different forms of hell,

2357
02:18:08,630 --> 02:18:13,630
let's put it that way and there's the 
hell that maybe I might be dragged 

2358
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:14,000
through if I don't

2359
02:18:15,480 --> 02:18:20,480
agree,
don't act in accordance with this law 

2360
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:24,070
and there's the hell that I would be 
dragged through if I did act in 

2361
02:18:24,070 --> 02:18:27,131
accordance with the law and I would 
vastly prefer the first hell to the 

2362
02:18:27,131 --> 02:18:30,911
second,
and the isn't clear to me that that 

2363
02:18:30,911 --> 02:18:31,790
actually constitutes courage.
Is it useful?

2364
02:18:31,791 --> 02:18:33,650
Because that's also the question about 
martyrdom.

2365
02:18:33,651 --> 02:18:38,651
I think it's very useful for people to 
see that someone will say there's no 

2366
02:18:38,990 --> 02:18:43,990
way,
there's no conceivable way that you can 

2367
02:18:43,990 --> 02:18:45,630
get me to do that,
and,

2368
02:18:45,990 --> 02:18:49,490
and I've thought long and hard about 
such things too because I've taught very

2369
02:18:49,491 --> 02:18:54,491
many people to negotiate and one of the 
things I always teach them is you don't 

2370
02:18:54,491 --> 02:18:58,781
know,
you negotiate from a position of 

2371
02:18:58,781 --> 02:19:00,551
weakness because you lose.
And so if I say no to something and I 

2372
02:19:02,361 --> 02:19:05,210
mean no,
I mean no,

2373
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:07,010
I bloody well won't do it.

2374
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:12,250
And I think that if there are people who
also agreed that such things aren't 

2375
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:17,051
appropriate to have the example of 
someone who says no and means it 

2376
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:21,050
actually turns out to be useful and so 
then I would say,

2377
02:19:21,230 --> 02:19:26,230
well that's an inclination in the 
potential direction of martyrdom and but

2378
02:19:27,561 --> 02:19:31,340
I don't see how to distinguish that from
actually just having the courage of your

2379
02:19:31,341 --> 02:19:33,560
convictions.
And so sometimes you might say,

2380
02:19:33,561 --> 02:19:38,561
well,
a person who has sufficient courage in 

2381
02:19:38,561 --> 02:19:38,630
their convictions will sometimes be put 
to death.

2382
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:41,030
Well,
if that's the definition of a martyr,

2383
02:19:41,031 --> 02:19:43,550
then sometimes,
but not all,

2384
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:48,730
always.
That's a really good thing and one of 

2385
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:48,730
the things I really liked about Social 
Nixon's book,

2386
02:19:48,730 --> 02:19:51,470
the Gulag Archipelago,
which is an I refer to it often,

2387
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:56,710
is an absolutely staggering book,
is that he put in many,

2388
02:19:57,081 --> 02:20:02,081
many stories of people who were in the 
Gulag and they were often religious 

2389
02:20:02,081 --> 02:20:06,581
believers,
which was a shock to him because he was 

2390
02:20:06,581 --> 02:20:06,581
an atheistic communist.

2391
02:20:06,581 --> 02:20:09,850
When when he first entered the camps,
they were often religious believers and 

2392
02:20:09,850 --> 02:20:13,820
they were people who said no.
There were things they would not do.

2393
02:20:13,850 --> 02:20:18,850
They would not participate in what the 
regime was asking them to do and he.

2394
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:22,190
You have to read it because the devil's 
in the stories,

2395
02:20:22,191 --> 02:20:23,510
right?
The details in the stories,

2396
02:20:23,511 --> 02:20:28,511
but soldier Nixon in the camps grew to 
have tremendous admiration for such 

2397
02:20:30,021 --> 02:20:35,021
people and actually viewed them as 
exemplars of the mode of being that was 

2398
02:20:37,011 --> 02:20:42,011
necessary for him to escape both the 
communist propaganda that had shaped him

2399
02:20:42,051 --> 02:20:47,051
as an individual and also the terrible 
bitterness and sorrow and anger that he 

2400
02:20:47,051 --> 02:20:51,611
experienced as a consequence of being 
flung into the terrible concentration 

2401
02:20:51,611 --> 02:20:53,120
camp conditions of the Gulag 
archipelago.

2402
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:54,230
So

2403
02:20:56,820 --> 02:20:57,060
Yep.

2404
02:21:04,750 --> 02:21:07,990
Hey Doc.
Thanks for staying alive and potentially

2405
02:21:07,991 --> 02:21:10,950
saving humanity.
So yeah,

2406
02:21:10,951 --> 02:21:12,350
that's good stuff.
Uh,

2407
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:14,350
wondering about a couple of things.
Firstly,

2408
02:21:14,351 --> 02:21:16,620
who won that childhood fight?
Yukata.

2409
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:19,420
Let that,
let that just slide.

2410
02:21:19,450 --> 02:21:20,920
So I'm thinking it's a big l.

2411
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
well,
I can tell you because he was a tough 

2412
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:26,070
little kid.
See,

2413
02:21:26,071 --> 02:21:27,810
I don't remember what happened,
but my,

2414
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:30,060
my remembrance of him was that he could 
eat,

2415
02:21:30,061 --> 02:21:32,730
pound me out pretty pretty effectively.
So,

2416
02:21:32,731 --> 02:21:33,900
uh,
yeah,

2417
02:21:34,140 --> 02:21:36,550
yeah.
His name was vernon switching enoch.

2418
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:42,770
Yeah.
He was a really good friend of mine and 

2419
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:45,760
I think,
I think Vernon's still lives in 

2420
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:45,760
fairview.
So if,

2421
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:45,760
if,
uh,

2422
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:49,970
if,
if he hears of this then maybe he'll 

2423
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:49,970
remember that too.
And,

2424
02:21:49,970 --> 02:21:49,970
and uh,
uh,

2425
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:53,310
you know,
so probably he would have won.

2426
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:56,070
I didn't win that many physical fights 
when I was a kid.

2427
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:56,490
So.

2428
02:21:56,930 --> 02:22:00,160
Okay.
That's not the only questions anyway.

2429
02:22:00,161 --> 02:22:00,930
Cool.
Uh,

2430
02:22:00,940 --> 02:22:05,940
I'm not sure if you've,
if you've actually been asked this 

2431
02:22:05,940 --> 02:22:06,640
before,
I've missed the last two lectures,

2432
02:22:06,641 --> 02:22:09,130
but I'm wondering what your thoughts are
on,

2433
02:22:09,300 --> 02:22:12,340
on token jr token and uh,
his work,

2434
02:22:12,341 --> 02:22:14,380
not just lord of the rings,
but the silmarillion,

2435
02:22:14,381 --> 02:22:19,381
which is basically like I'm,
I'm seeing all this and I'm thinking 

2436
02:22:19,381 --> 02:22:23,371
it's like the modern Bible in a way.
It's got the weird names like to ball 

2437
02:22:23,371 --> 02:22:26,791
cane and all that stuff.
And then specifically when were talking 

2438
02:22:26,791 --> 02:22:30,591
about Caine just now and how he was 
things just moving and when he was 

2439
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:31,840
talking about,
uh,

2440
02:22:31,890 --> 02:22:36,890
how he felt like betrayed by God and he 
spent his whole life working a,

2441
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:41,680
it's a spite him essentially.
And he kind of set the path for,

2442
02:22:41,681 --> 02:22:46,681
for the darkness in humanity that's 
almost exactly melcor which was in the 

2443
02:22:47,931 --> 02:22:52,931
similar really.
And basically what's would spawn 

2444
02:22:52,931 --> 02:22:53,070
everything evil in middle earth and more
door and whatnot.

2445
02:22:53,071 --> 02:22:55,840
And I don't even know as much as go on 
talking.

2446
02:22:55,950 --> 02:22:59,210
Was it a student of mythology and you 
know,

2447
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:00,170
the,
the,

2448
02:23:00,171 --> 02:23:01,100
um,
the,

2449
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:02,440
the,
uh,

2450
02:23:02,930 --> 02:23:07,610
the story of the Hobbit is a retelling 
of Beowulf in large part.

2451
02:23:07,611 --> 02:23:11,900
And that's a dragon slaying myth.
And and so the,

2452
02:23:12,050 --> 02:23:17,050
the reason that Tolkien and rolling for 
that matter are so popular is because 

2453
02:23:17,571 --> 02:23:22,571
they've done a very good job of making 
the old myths new and,

2454
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:28,480
and well,
look what's happened with the marvel 

2455
02:23:28,480 --> 02:23:30,490
series.
It's the same thing with star wars and 

2456
02:23:30,490 --> 02:23:31,970
all of that is that you can't not 
respond to these stories.

2457
02:23:32,510 --> 02:23:37,510
Now you're gonna find them in one form 
or another in sometimes well with the 

2458
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:38,150
biblical stories.
For example,

2459
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:43,480
the mythological,
the meaning of the mythological content 

2460
02:23:43,480 --> 02:23:46,871
has become invisible.
That's partly the death of God that 

2461
02:23:46,871 --> 02:23:49,541
Nisha was referring to,
but that doesn't mean that the stories 

2462
02:23:49,541 --> 02:23:51,080
themselves vanished because people have 
an eternal hunger for them.

2463
02:23:51,740 --> 02:23:56,740
Now,
the problem with them emerging in let's 

2464
02:23:56,740 --> 02:23:59,081
say,
more literary or less sophisticated 

2465
02:23:59,081 --> 02:24:02,411
form,
let's take the marvel movies as an 

2466
02:24:02,411 --> 02:24:04,601
example,
is that they're not surrounded by an 

2467
02:24:04,601 --> 02:24:05,720
articulated culture the same way the 
biblical stories are.

2468
02:24:06,050 --> 02:24:09,320
So for example,
they're not surrounded by something like

2469
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:11,500
paradise lost by John Milton,
which or,

2470
02:24:11,501 --> 02:24:12,170
or Dante,
oh,

2471
02:24:12,171 --> 02:24:15,170
inferno,
which are works of ill,

2472
02:24:15,470 --> 02:24:20,470
unlimited depth.
And so you throw away something of great

2473
02:24:20,601 --> 02:24:25,601
value and reacquire it in a different 
place with less value perhaps,

2474
02:24:26,331 --> 02:24:27,960
but more comprehensive ability.
It's not a,

2475
02:24:28,010 --> 02:24:33,010
it's not a great trait that is not a 
critique of talking and it's not a 

2476
02:24:33,010 --> 02:24:36,161
critique of anybody who's drawing on 
mythological stories for their 

2477
02:24:36,161 --> 02:24:39,520
narratives.
You have to do that to be a good 

2478
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,111
storyteller.
But it's nice to go as close to the 

2479
02:24:41,111 --> 02:24:42,620
source as you can as well.
So.

2480
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:48,490
Yep.
And the overlaps that you described 

2481
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:48,490
while.
Yeah,

2482
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:50,831
it's exactly what you'd expect because 
if you deal with great mythological 

2483
02:24:50,831 --> 02:24:55,090
themes,
you start to get the archetypes are at 

2484
02:24:55,090 --> 02:24:56,330
the bottom of stories.
And so if,

2485
02:24:56,480 --> 02:25:00,170
if the story goes down far enough,
it runs into the archetypes.

2486
02:25:00,190 --> 02:25:04,130
And that was the youngest claim.
And I think he got that exactly right.

2487
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:04,610
So,

2488
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:07,760
okay,

2489
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:15,410
last one,
uh,

2490
02:25:16,340 --> 02:25:21,340
there's a passage in paradise lost were 
the demons are building pandemonium 

2491
02:25:22,400 --> 02:25:27,400
under mammon's sort of guidance and they
crack open the what's not really earth 

2492
02:25:28,301 --> 02:25:33,301
but hell.
And they take out the gold and they 

2493
02:25:33,301 --> 02:25:35,731
build pandemonium,
which is the most sophisticated 

2494
02:25:35,731 --> 02:25:37,930
architectural wonder of all time in,
in Milton's language,

2495
02:25:38,440 --> 02:25:39,610
and,
and this,

2496
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:43,380
this conception of taking material and 
turning it into a,

2497
02:25:43,390 --> 02:25:45,840
a temple to oneself,
um,

2498
02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:51,660
was interpreted by Humphrey Jennings,
who was the founder of the mass 

2499
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:54,871
observation movement.
And if anyone saw the opening to the 

2500
02:25:54,871 --> 02:25:58,230
Britains 2012 games,
the history of the industrial 

2501
02:25:58,421 --> 02:25:59,830
revolution,
he said,

2502
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:04,860
was encapsulated by this passage in 
Milton where you have demons building a 

2503
02:26:05,801 --> 02:26:10,801
temple for themselves out of matter and 
that mankind in Milton's language was,

2504
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:16,020
was taught to do this or that they 
learned it first by this example.

2505
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:22,180
And he says,
let not envy the devils have riches and 

2506
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:22,180
hell.

2507
02:26:22,180 --> 02:26:23,500
Um,
and I see things in this one,

2508
02:26:23,501 --> 02:26:28,501
the,
the gnostic idea that somehow the world 

2509
02:26:28,501 --> 02:26:31,171
itself that we inhabit as hell.
And then that matter is not our true 

2510
02:26:32,110 --> 02:26:33,730
place of,
of existence,

2511
02:26:33,731 --> 02:26:38,731
but somewhere sort of platonic and also 
the festie and sort of bargain that 

2512
02:26:39,701 --> 02:26:44,701
people made around 16,
66 two to get a world of stuff and 

2513
02:26:44,701 --> 02:26:49,621
things and possessions by losing the 
soul or what existed before that.

2514
02:26:51,731 --> 02:26:53,170
And I,
I wonder if that,

2515
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:58,380
I play with that a lot in my own thought
and I wonder if that's something that 

2516
02:26:58,380 --> 02:27:01,111
you found in Milton and,
and what you think of that passage in 

2517
02:27:01,111 --> 02:27:01,111
particular.

2518
02:27:01,111 --> 02:27:02,200
Well,
Milton was definitely a prophetic voice,

2519
02:27:02,920 --> 02:27:03,390
right?
And I.

2520
02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:08,400
and I think that that's,
that's a perfectly reasonable retelling 

2521
02:27:08,400 --> 02:27:12,571
of that section.
It's also very much a kin to the story 

2522
02:27:12,571 --> 02:27:14,350
of the Tower of Babel.
We'll talk about next week.

2523
02:27:14,790 --> 02:27:15,140
Um,

2524
02:27:19,950 --> 02:27:20,220
no.

2525
02:27:22,500 --> 02:27:25,530
See the problem with the problem.
God,

2526
02:27:25,531 --> 02:27:30,531
it's so complicated.
See what one of the things that young 

2527
02:27:30,531 --> 02:27:32,840
said about the transformation of the 
first millennium of Christianity into 

2528
02:27:33,091 --> 02:27:35,060
let's say,
the second millennium of Christianity,

2529
02:27:35,090 --> 02:27:38,820
is that Christianity had promised 
something like redemption,

2530
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:42,860
universal redemption from suffering 
maybe in the afterlife.

2531
02:27:42,870 --> 02:27:45,360
But that was kind of a cop out,
let's say,

2532
02:27:45,361 --> 02:27:48,180
because it didn't really solve the 
problem of suffering here and now,

2533
02:27:48,450 --> 02:27:53,450
and you believe that as people had.
Although although it did,

2534
02:27:54,061 --> 02:27:56,670
many did many positive things,
let's not,

2535
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:02,000
let's not forget that it's civilized 
people in a way that they hadn't been 

2536
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,320
before or you could make that case,
but then there was this underground.

2537
02:28:05,950 --> 02:28:10,950
At the same time,
there's this denial of the utility of 

2538
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:14,100
material reality that went along with 
the spiritualization of mankind in that 

2539
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:15,130
in that first in the Christian 
millennium,

2540
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:21,180
there was value left in material because
it had been ignored and so young 

2541
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:23,550
believer that the,
the,

2542
02:28:23,620 --> 02:28:26,300
the collective unconscious,
broadly speaking,

2543
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:31,990
began to be attracted to the,
to what had been rejected by the hyper 

2544
02:28:31,990 --> 02:28:35,480
spiritualization and started to question
whether or not additional value could be

2545
02:28:35,481 --> 02:28:40,481
extracted from the material.
Maybe as a adjunct to the spiritual 

2546
02:28:40,481 --> 02:28:45,280
because maybe true redemption was 
something like a proper meeting of the 

2547
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,120
spiritual and the material,
which wasn't something that seemed to be

2548
02:28:47,150 --> 02:28:49,520
part and parcel of Christian Christian 
doctrine.

2549
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:54,820
Up to that point.
Now maybe what Milton was warning 

2550
02:28:54,861 --> 02:28:57,140
against was a swing too far,
right,

2551
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:02,500
and I think Milton's point is well taken
because one of the things that's worth 

2552
02:29:02,500 --> 02:29:06,350
noting is that you can be perfectly 
miserable in a house of gold,

2553
02:29:07,040 --> 02:29:07,400
right?

2554
02:29:07,520 --> 02:29:09,590
I mean,
I've known very many wealthy people,

2555
02:29:09,591 --> 02:29:10,880
very,
very wealthy people,

2556
02:29:10,881 --> 02:29:13,790
and the problem.
See,

2557
02:29:13,791 --> 02:29:18,791
the thing is is that money just doesn't 
solve that many problems that people 

2558
02:29:18,791 --> 02:29:19,550
have.
People wish it would.

2559
02:29:20,300 --> 02:29:25,300
People who want to be rich think it will
and the people who want to redistribute 

2560
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:25,300
money,
you think it will,

2561
02:29:25,300 --> 02:29:28,160
and I know that there's nothing to be 
said for abject poverty,

2562
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:33,460
but the problem is that there are many 
serious problems that human beings have 

2563
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:39,070
that matter.
Material Comfort alone does nothing to 

2564
02:29:40,341 --> 02:29:44,420
address or almost nothing.
You can be perfectly.

2565
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:47,790
You can have a perfectly miserable 
family life and $20,

2566
02:29:47,791 --> 02:29:51,740
million dollars and the buffer that the 
$20,000,000

2567
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:56,090
puts between you and the misery is 
sometimes it's not even a buffer.

2568
02:29:56,091 --> 02:30:01,091
It's a magnifier.
So Milton would warn against the 

2569
02:30:03,561 --> 02:30:07,880
creation of even the idea of a material 
utopia.

2570
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:12,910
Even in principle,
something Dostoevsky also recognized is 

2571
02:30:12,910 --> 02:30:16,810
an error,
you cannot solve the problem in that 

2572
02:30:16,810 --> 02:30:20,801
manner and maybe the demonic idea is 
that is propaganda that you could now 

2573
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:29,951
maybe,
maybe there is a balance of some sort 

2574
02:30:29,951 --> 02:30:31,220
because I don't understand if we were 
going to build the city of God,

2575
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:36,280
let's say,
well a huge part of the endeavor would 

2576
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:39,110
have to be spiritual and to me that a 
huge part of that would be,

2577
02:30:39,470 --> 02:30:42,920
it would have to be something predicated
if not on truth,

2578
02:30:42,921 --> 02:30:47,921
at least not at least on the willingness
of people not to lie to one another.

2579
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:54,040
Without that,
all the material wellbeing in the world 

2580
02:30:54,040 --> 02:30:55,460
is,
it's a facade.

2581
02:30:55,940 --> 02:30:58,490
It's like gilding a corpse.
Right.

2582
02:30:58,550 --> 02:31:03,550
And,
and I think that's partly what Melton 

2583
02:31:03,550 --> 02:31:05,450
was warning against.
I mean Milton was doing many more things

2584
02:31:05,451 --> 02:31:10,451
than he knew of course,
because he was a poetic genius of 

2585
02:31:10,451 --> 02:31:14,030
incalculable genius.
Right,

2586
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:14,840
right,
right,

2587
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:15,680
right.
So,

2588
02:31:15,860 --> 02:31:18,680
well you've obviously thought about such
things very much.

2589
02:31:18,681 --> 02:31:20,990
So that was a very good question.
So.

2590
02:31:21,290 --> 02:31:22,250
All right everyone.
Good.

2591
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:27,500
Thanks.
