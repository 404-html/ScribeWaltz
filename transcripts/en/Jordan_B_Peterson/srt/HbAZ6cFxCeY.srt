1
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:13,921
Now,
you know,

2
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:14,754
I use this picture
to represent my class and you might not 

3
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,533
know anything about this picture.
It's a picture of Jonah being thrown up 

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,930
out of a whale's belly after spending 
three days inside it.

5
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:33,150
It's an old biblical story.
It's a myth.

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,520
It's a fairy tale.
That's a,

7
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:36,354
that's one way of looking at it and,
and I don't mean that drug in a 

8
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:42,420
derogative manner.
We know for example,

9
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:47,100
that some of the grims brothers' 
fairytales are perhaps 15,000 years old.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,500
It'd be traced way back.
They're really,

11
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,334
really old and old stories are strange.
They're strange because while they're 

12
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,450
being told generation after generation 
after generation,

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,690
so you could imagine that something 
retold over such an expansive,

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,660
expansive time has been reduced to its 
just many,

15
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:11,130
many times and nothing that's in the 
story anymore is superfluous.

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,980
It's all meaningful in some sense.
It's sort of like a med,

17
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:18,720
a story.
That's one way of thinking about,

18
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:22,200
imagine that you took a hundred books,
hundred adventure books,

19
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:27,000
and you had to extract out the central 
features of an adventure book.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,433
Now it's hard to do that.
It's like you're averaging across them 

21
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,850
or something like that,
distilling them in some manner.

22
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,520
Okay.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,353
Then you'd get a,
a Meta adventure and it would be like a 

24
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,670
myth upon which all adventures are 
based.

25
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,430
And this story is actually one of those 
stories.

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,330
And I'm going to tell you what I think 
the story means.

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,790
And I'm not saying that this is all it 
means,

28
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:54,680
because most stories of this sort are in
some sense inexhaustible,

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,790
just like great works of art are 
inexhaustible there.

30
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,180
There's more information in them than 
you can possibly articulate.

31
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,510
That's what makes them
profound.

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,763
That's why you go look at them.
Cause otherwise someone could just tell 

33
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,330
you about the painting and that would be
the end of that.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,560
But that doesn't work.
So,

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,320
so Jonah is being spit up by this whale.
And of course on the face of it,

36
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,490
that's an impossibility because,

37
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,523
well,

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,250
you can't live inside a whale.
That's why it's impossible.

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,640
Now,
you may remember and likely do that.

40
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,120
You all know a story about someone who 
is inside a whale.

41
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,170
That's Pinocchio,
right?

42
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,783
And,
uh,

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,460
you know,
you go to that movie,

44
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,270
maybe even as an adult,
you watch that movie and Japan goes down

45
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,970
there in the whale and his little boat,
you know,

46
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,360
it's big cavernous inside.
You don't really care that that's,

47
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,100
there's a bunch of things you don't care
about.

48
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,970
You don't care that those are drawings 
and not real people.

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,103
You don't care about that.
And you don't care that the inside of a 

50
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,284
whale isn't a cavern and you don't care 
that Pinocchio's a puppet for that 

51
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:07,960
matter.
None of that matters to you at all.

52
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:12,010
And that's because you're really strange
creatures and you don't even notice when

53
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,140
you're doing something absolutely 
absurd.

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,360
And that's one of those times when you 
are in,

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,460
but if someone taps you on the shoulder 
and says,

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,913
you know,
you're just watching drawings of a 

57
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:23,884
puppet,
puppets can't really move autonomously 

58
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,214
and now he's at the bottom of the ocean,
you have no idea why he's going to 

59
00:03:30,191 --> 00:03:31,024
rescue his father and you're just 
sitting there and all and you're okay 

60
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,770
with that.
And you'll say,

61
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,710
shut up because I want to finish 
watching the movie.

62
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,770
And so that's interesting.
You See,

63
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,890
that tells you something about your 
unconscious.

64
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,383
If you're a psychoanalytically minded 
because you're doing something that you 

65
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,300
cannot account for.
Now you might say,

66
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:52,870
well,
it's,

67
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,600
it's enjoyable.
Well that's deep man.

68
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,880
You really,
really going a long ways with that.

69
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,070
The question is,
hey,

70
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,220
why is it comprehensible?
B,

71
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,650
Why is it enjoyable?
See,

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,873
just exactly what are you doing there?
And you think that whatever you are 

73
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:14,920
doing there is so valuable that you'll 
actually pay to do it.

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,010
Weird.
Very,

75
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:19,690
very weird.
And you know,

76
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:20,524
when you read about
let's say the archaic rituals of tribal 

77
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:29,890
people and you ask yourself just what 
are they up to?

78
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,080
You might think,
well,

79
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,900
they're up to the same thing that you're
up to when you go see a movie.

80
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,233
So,
and then you might also notice that the 

81
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,274
most expensive artifacts or among the 
most expensive artifacts that human 

82
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,684
beings create our movies,
it's been hundreds of millions of 

83
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,033
dollars on them.

84
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,810
And we consider that a good deal.
And you know,

85
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,763
it drives our technology too because the
high tech movies like the marvel movies 

86
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,264
that require so much computer animation,
they actually drive the demand for high 

87
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:02,524
end graphics chips.
So our technological advance forward is 

88
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,474
actually motivated in part by our desire
to represent things fictionally in 

89
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,791
evermore spectacular manner.
So Jonah,

90
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,680
well,
let me tell you the story of Jonah

91
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,863
and I'll tell you why.
I'm going to tell you what this is from 

92
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:29,270
Camille Paglia,
who is a critic of the modern university

93
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:32,840
and very brilliant woman,
I would say very controversial,

94
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,500
um,
credibly rapid speaker and she can think

95
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,150
so fast.
It's just unbelievable.

96
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,060
She's really fun to watch,
if you like that sort of thing.

97
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,193
Vicious adversary in an argument.
She says the number one problem in 

98
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:51,620
academia today is not ignorant students,
but ignorant professors

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,673
who have substituted narrow expertise in
theoretical of preposterous term for 

100
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,010
breadth and depth of learning in the 
world,

101
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:06,011
history of art and thought art is a vast
interconnected web work,

102
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,933
a fabricated tradition and 
overconcentration on any one point is a 

103
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,921
distortion.
Here's,

104
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:23,910
here's the problem.
I had to,

105
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,763
I wrestled with this when I was trying 
to understand some of the things that 

106
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,424
I'm going to teach you about.
There's some things that you kind of 

107
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:35,140
have to grasp as a whole.
You know,

108
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:35,974
sometimes you have a flash of insight 
and a bunch of things that you didn't 

109
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:38,914
know were related fall together that 
that's supposed to happen in 

110
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:42,304
psychotherapy when you link different 
disparate patterns of behavior together 

111
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,713
because you've linked them say with a 
single cause and you get this like 

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,040
excited feeling of illumination and 
possibility

113
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,260
and there are forms of communication 
that require the simile.

114
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,094
Tanium Lee,
the simultaneous realization of a 

115
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,400
multitude of disparate.

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,210
So now I'm gonna like a movie can be 
like that.

117
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,044
You know,
you,

118
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,280
you,
you listen to a movie,

119
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,114
you watch a movie and then you don't 
know what the hell is going on and then 

120
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,203
something happens near the end and bang,
everything clicks together and it's 

121
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:29,570
because you've sort of seen the thing as
a whole.

122
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,943
And a lot of the things that we,
a lot of the ways that we interact with 

123
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:39,011
the world that are mysterious
are like that there.

124
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,740
And this is what Peggy is referring to 
is that,

125
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,500
and this is a psychoanalytic 
proposition,

126
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,480
I would say,
or a romantic proposition.

127
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,863
MMM.

128
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,110
Then the idea roughly is that

129
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,523
way out in the periphery of reality or 
all those things that not only do you 

130
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,060
not know,
but you don't even know,

131
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:00,894
you don't know right there.
You're completely blind to their 

132
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:06,270
existence.
And then there's unknown things that you

133
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:10,470
have some suspicions about.
And then there's unknown things that you

134
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:15,240
can start to imagine and,
and act out and dramatize.

135
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,080
And so all of that is on the periphery 
of our knowledge,

136
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,340
not to psycho Hadley analytic dictum.
Where do thoughts come from?

137
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,340
Well,
partly they're nested in dreams.

138
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,310
Dreams are the birthplace of thoughts.
Fantasy.

139
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,330
It's not that surprising.
Fantasy is the birthplace of ideas.

140
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,164
You know,
if you're thinking about what you're 

141
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:38,220
gonna do in the future,
you enter into a reverie,

142
00:08:38,221 --> 00:08:39,054
a dream state,
and you contemplate multiple 

143
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:44,910
possibilities and then you start 
thinking them through.

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,893
Use your imagination to search beyond 
where you are and the collective human 

145
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:57,741
attempt to do that is are mysterious 
humanistic,

146
00:08:58,651 --> 00:08:59,484
artistic tradition,
which is very difficult to justify from 

147
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,730
a formal articulate point of view.

148
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,660
What good is dance?
Like?

149
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:11,520
What is it that you're doing when you're
dancing?

150
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,343
Well,
you don't care because he liked to 

151
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,270
dance.
Why?

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,970
Well,
you don't know like you do.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
It's built into music.
Music's a human.

154
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:25,800
Universal culture is used music to 
organize themselves,

155
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:26,634
right?
They use music to catalyze their 

156
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:28,524
identities.
They use music to unite around no in 

157
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,413
more archaic societies,
less differentiated society's let's say 

158
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,590
no.
Uh,

159
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,513
a mask that represents part of the 
family tradition will have a particular 

160
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,614
design and there'll be a particular song
written for it and there'll be a 

161
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:47,544
particular dance about it and the song 
and the dance or something like the 

162
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,560
symbolic representation of a mode of 
being in the world.

163
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,394
Like maybe the mask is a wolf mask.
And so you act out the wolf and there's 

164
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,500
music that goes along with that and you 
think,

165
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,334
well,
what are you doing when you're acting 

166
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,570
out the wolf?

167
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,650
And part of that is what you're trying,
you're trying to understand wolves,

168
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,190
you know,
it's an image,

169
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,050
it's imitation in part.
And you know,

170
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:13,650
if you live in the natural world and if 
you haunt and if you're preyed upon,

171
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,723
then understanding the things that 
you're hunting and preying upon is 

172
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,880
useful.
And there's also pull out perhaps useful

173
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:21,714
things to learn from them.
And so we played this strange symbolic 

174
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:27,324
game with the world,
like children pretending that's another 

175
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,744
way of thinking about it.
And we do that to act out and to begin 

176
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:38,430
to understand things we don't understand
like how to act.

177
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,223
That's now for me,
the most important question in life is 

178
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:49,050
not
what the world is made of.

179
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,153
And in fact,
I would say that's a relatively new 

180
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:58,150
preoccupation of,
of humankind.

181
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,180
You know,
we didn't really formalize,

182
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,550
you could say that the ancient Greeks
originated,

183
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,510
laid the groundwork for the emergence of
an empirical science.

184
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,050
And then it emerged more formally with 
Bacon and Descartes and,

185
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,563
uh,
Newton

186
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,550
five,
600 years ago.

187
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,930
Not very long,
like a blink,

188
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,650
blink of the eye in human terms.
Before that,

189
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,650
people were engineers.
They could build things and so forth,

190
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:35,410
but they didn't know how to,
they weren't scientists.

191
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,550
They didn't really conceptualize the 
world as an objective place.

192
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,170
We do that automatically because science
has seeped so far into our

193
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,020
set of presuppositions that doesn't make
us good scientists by the way.

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,153
But it does make us that the fundamental
reality of the world is an objective 

195
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:56,584
reality.
And I'm not going to dispute that 

196
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,303
particularly,
but leaves one set of questions on 

197
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:05,850
answered,
um,

198
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,480
probably by its nature because it wasn't
designed to answer the question.

199
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,481
And that question is how should one 
conduct oneself in the world?

200
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,310
And that's an important thing since 
you're alive and hypothetically,

201
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:24,250
you'd rather stay alive and well,
you're alive.

202
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,084
You probably don't want to suffer 
anymore than you have to and no more 

203
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:31,930
stupidly than you have to.
And it might also be good if some of the

204
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,000
things that you wanted actually 
happened.

205
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,770
And so you know,
you're motivated to know how to act and,

206
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,530
and people are always telling each other
how to act.

207
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,500
We're sending each other information all
the time about how to act.

208
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,840
We do that with are the expressions on 
our face.

209
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:47,674
And of course when we talk to people,
we always look at their face and that's 

210
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:53,110
because their face tells you what 
they're up to.

211
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,673
You know,
if they're smiling and paying attention 

212
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:56,854
to you,
well then you can assume that you're 

213
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:03,700
doing something right and if they're 
looking annoyed or disgusted,

214
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,563
that's a particularly bad one.
Then you might think he might take him 

215
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,130
from that,
especially if you know,

216
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,710
three or four people are doing it at the
same time.

217
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,873
And so we're reflecting,
we're reflecting some ideal to one 

218
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:20,800
another constantly.
And the more attentive you are,

219
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,230
the more likely you are to act in 
accordance with that ideal.

220
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,380
And the more like you likely you are to 
move towards it,

221
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,510
you may not even know what the ideal is 
in an articulated sentence.

222
00:13:33,511 --> 00:13:34,570
In fact,
you probably don't.

223
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,610
You know,
you could come up with a,

224
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,173
well,
you know,

225
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,500
a good person is nice and friendly and 
cooperative and yeah,

226
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,071
yeah.
You know,

227
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,490
that's all just cliche,
but you don't,

228
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,800
you know,
your conception might be very hollow.

229
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,634
It's very likely that it's very hollow.
Even though you may be to act in a very 

230
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,230
sophisticated manner.
All right,

231
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:55,870
so anyways,
this is a story I'd say.

232
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:58,330
What's a metes story?
It's,

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,673
it's what would happen if you collected 
a bunch of stories and then you extract 

234
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:02,894
it out a story from them and it's sort 
of a story about destiny and it's 

235
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,560
couched in a religious language.
Um,

236
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,220
but that's okay because most of these 
distilled stories are formed.

237
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:17,454
The foundation of religious texts and 
religious texts and myth and myths and 

238
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,990
stories are,
as I said,

239
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:26,860
part of the outer perimeter of our 
society.

240
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,820
They have a,
they have a coherent nature and it's all

241
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,693
it and the form of a foundation and it's
on that foundation that everything that 

242
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:40,720
you take for granted rests even if you 
don't understand the foundation.

243
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,093
So I can give you an example.
There's a metaphysical idea that 

244
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:45,904
underlies western civilization and that 
metaphysical idea is that the has 

245
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:54,180
transcendent worth.
That's,

246
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,860
that's the idea from which the notion of
natural rights is derived.

247
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,053
And of course,
our legal system is predicated on the 

248
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,290
idea that you have certain natural 
rights.

249
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,790
They're enshrined in the bill of rights,
for example.

250
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,190
And in the states when the bills bill of
rights was being formulated,

251
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,703
when the legislation,
original legislation that founded the 

252
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,940
state was being formulated,
the formulators said,

253
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,800
we hold these truths to be self evident.
What does that mean?

254
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,013
They're axioms of faith.
They're propositions and there's no 

255
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:32,834
proof for them.
They're there or mode of operation in 

256
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,600
the world.
And so the hypothesis is something like,

257
00:15:38,601 --> 00:15:39,434
well,
if I treat you like there's something 

258
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:46,160
about you that has transcendent value,
implicit intrinsic value,

259
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,173
whatever that might be.
And there are stories about that and 

260
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,740
we'll talk about that and you do the 
same to me.

261
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,533
And then we set up a body of laws that 
recognizes the sovereignty of the 

262
00:15:57,141 --> 00:15:57,974
individual so that the law itself has to
act with respect towards every 

263
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,214
individual.
Even if that individual has done 

264
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,790
something reprehensible,
which is very weird.

265
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,110
If you think about it,
then our society will work better

266
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,760
and well,

267
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,910
perhaps that's true,
but for better or worse,

268
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,540
that is what this society is predicated 
on.

269
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,800
And that's a very,
very,

270
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:25,401
very,
very,

271
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,050
very,
very old idea.

272
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,293
And it's an idea that people came to 
with great difficulty because it was 

273
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:34,874
over thousands of years that people 
learned how to take their little tribal 

274
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:38,744
groups,
which are always squabbling with one 

275
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,031
another,
right?

276
00:16:41,031 --> 00:16:41,864
Cause there's human beings,
they're very violent and tribal groups 

277
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:47,390
are by no means civilized.
It's,

278
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,330
there's no noble savage like the 
Europeans thought.

279
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,880
If you study tribal groups in the world 
today,

280
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,893
the murder,
the death rate by violence is 

281
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:57,860
unbelievably high.
So

282
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,080
something unites a tribe within a tribe,
it's often kinship.

283
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,943
But then tribes come together to form 
larger civilizations and they have to 

284
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,543
determine some sort of med,
have principle that guides them so that 

285
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,670
they can cooperate and come together 
without destroying one another.

286
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,773
And they have to extract out of 
principle by which the society might 

287
00:17:17,631 --> 00:17:19,940
function.
And that has to work.

288
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,030
And then as societies get bigger and 
bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger,

289
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:23,864
they have to bring more and more of 
these diverse traditions together and 

290
00:17:26,961 --> 00:17:31,961
extract out something from them that has
power and functional utility.

291
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,840
And that allows people to unite.
And so

292
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,420
this is one of the stories that talks 
about that it's a story about individual

293
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:48,410
responsibility and what happens when 
it's not heated.

294
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,363
So you know,
cause we could say you are a social 

295
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:54,504
creature right to the core and most of 
your environment is other people and 

296
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:04,350
those other people want something from 
you and you want something from them.

297
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:07,620
So you're going to play games with them.
You're either going to be good at it,

298
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:08,454
you're going to be bad at it,
but you're going to play games with 

299
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:14,370
them.
And so the game might have rules,

300
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,653
really sophisticated rules in fact.
And you'd expect that because as your 

301
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:22,080
behavior more and more approximates an 
ideal,

302
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,510
assuming such a thing exists,
then you're more and more sophisticated.

303
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,344
And the nature of the ideal is perhaps 
more and more complex and difficult to 

304
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:34,800
understand.
You get a hint of this though.

305
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,743
You can get a hint of this because you 
will see if you pay attention to your 

306
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:43,950
own soul,
your psyche,

307
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,243
your unconscious,
you'll see that there are people that 

308
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,940
you admire and that there are people 
that you have contempt for.

309
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,283
And that's,
and it isn't necessarily that you're a 

310
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,830
hundred percent accurate in your 
judgment,

311
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,953
you know,
it's not such a bad idea to criticize 

312
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,850
your first
impressions,

313
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,463
but those states exist.
And so there's a reason you admire 

314
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:11,880
someone and there's a reason you have 
contempt for someone.

315
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:12,923
There may be multiple reasons and that's
a hint to your intrinsic value 

316
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:16,434
structure.
It's a hint about your intrinsic value 

317
00:19:17,851 --> 00:19:18,684
structure,
right?

318
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,430
You wouldn't admire someone unless there
was something about them that you valued

319
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:25,800
and perhaps that you would also like to 
be able to do.

320
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,053
And you wouldn't despise someone or have
contempt for them if you didn't feel 

321
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:34,740
that something they were doing was wrong
and that it would be wrong if you did it

322
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:35,574
too.
And so you're bringing to bear on the 

323
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,124
situation and implicit morality.
And you have to do that because as I 

324
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,594
said,

325
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,473
yeah,

326
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,680
it can't act without a morality.
Because if you're going to act,

327
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:54,681
you're going to try to make things 
better that otherwise why bother?

328
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,283
And if you're acting to make things 
better than some things have to be 

329
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:01,050
better and some things have to be worse.
And that's a value structure.

330
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,460
So you have one.
All right,

331
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:06,294
so Jonah,
he gets a call from God and God tells 

332
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:18,171
him that there's a city Nineveh that's 
falling into moral disarray.

333
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:22,140
Now what does that mean?
Well,

334
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,963
it's a universal story.
It's like all cultures are always 

335
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:30,570
falling into disarray.
It's their nature.

336
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,240
Just entropy does that,
right?

337
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,240
Things change.
The world changes the environment,

338
00:20:36,241 --> 00:20:38,670
changes in the culture,
doesn't keep up very well.

339
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:43,320
And then of course it has corrupt 
elements and so it's an enduring eternal

340
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,154
story.
The individual is always placed in 

341
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,810
relationship to a culture that somewhat 
corrupt.

342
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,060
And then the question is,
well,

343
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,470
what do you do about it?
And if the answer is nothing,

344
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,730
well then it'll just get more corrupt.
And if the answer is b corrupt too,

345
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,713
then it will just get more corrupt.
So the answer has to be to oppose the 

346
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:11,290
corruption because that's the only way 
it's going to stop.

347
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,443
Now,
God threatens to destroy this city 

348
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,983
because of its corruption.
And I don't think you need to presume 

349
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,720
anything particularly metaphysical about
that to understand it.

350
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,603
It's very straight forward that the more
corrupt the culture is and the less 

351
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,500
trust is possible between individuals,
the less productive the culture is going

352
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,660
to be.
Because why do anything,

353
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,940
if some corrupt person is just going to 
come and take it,

354
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,493
you know,
it might even be that the culture is so 

355
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:43,624
corrupted.
If you are good for something and you 

356
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,583
produce resources,
you're actually more likely to get 

357
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:51,490
killed because you have something of 
value.

358
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,593
So like there's just,
you're just not going anywhere with 

359
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,114
that.
And why would you work if you didn't 

360
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:58,680
have any sense that,
you know,

361
00:21:58,690 --> 00:21:59,523
you could store up the value of your 
work for some reasonable time in the 

362
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:02,974
future.
So if the society is corrupt and there 

363
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,133
no trust,
it's degenerating and you know it might 

364
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:10,810
live for a while but isn't going to last
very long.

365
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,420
And so that's the idea.
Corrupt societies collapse

366
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,640
that leaves open what corruption means.
Anyways,

367
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
Jonah,
thanks.

368
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,030
No,
I would no bloody way.

369
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,493
I'm not going to that city.
They can go to hell as far as I'm 

370
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,250
concerned.
And that's really what he thinks.

371
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,640
And why in the world should I do 
anything about it anyways?

372
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,190
And these are good objections.
It's like,

373
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,490
why would you do that?
And you'll face this,

374
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:41,000
believe me in your life,
you will face this.

375
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,650
In fact,
you already do always,

376
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,010
constantly,
continually in small ways.

377
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:46,844
Perhaps when you're interacting with 
people who aren't treating you properly 

378
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,550
and when you're acting.
And those might be your parents,

379
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,010
they might be your friends,
they might be people at your workplace,

380
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,480
they might be professors,

381
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
they're playing a crooked game and you 
don't like it and you know it's crooked.

382
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,490
And so then the question is,
well,

383
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:08,230
what should you do about it?
Well,

384
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,340
if you know your crib,
no,

385
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:12,070
it's crooked.
It's not so good to play along with it.

386
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,450
I mean,
we'll say that you know,

387
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:15,370
it's crooked by your own standard of 
values.

388
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,230
It d degrades you to play along with it.
You're going to stand up and oppose it.

389
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,260
Well,
no,

390
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,783
probably not.
You're probably going to do what Jonah 

391
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,114
did.
Jump on a ship and get the hell out of 

392
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:31,330
there.
And you know,

393
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,660
that's a logical thing to do,
but it doesn't solve the problem.

394
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,393
And I think this has something to do 
with human ethical responsibility 

395
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:40,204
because there are other old stories,
and I'll tell you one likely where the 

396
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:49,460
son of the king,
the lion king,

397
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,733
the son of the king,
he goes off and he's some pathetic 

398
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,550
adolescent.

399
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,383
And then he shamed by the reappearance 
of his old girlfriend into turning into 

400
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,124
something vaguely useful.
And he opens his eyes and he goes back 

401
00:24:04,161 --> 00:24:07,820
and he fights scar and
no,

402
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,110
it's a scene of hell,
right?

403
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:11,780
Because there's fire everywhere and he 
fights scar,

404
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,340
finds out,
scar killed,

405
00:24:13,341 --> 00:24:17,000
his father casts him into the pit,
roughly speaking,

406
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:21,350
and then the rain comes and then you 
know,

407
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:26,351
the movie returns to its beginning.
Fundamentally it's an paradise,

408
00:24:26,601 --> 00:24:28,550
Paradise lost,
paradise regained.

409
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,520
That's the movie.
And,

410
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,220
and I mean that's the story of human 
beings.

411
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,054
You know,
you're in that place that's working out 

412
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:36,764
pretty well.
Something happens to knock you off your 

413
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:40,034
perch.
You're down in the chaos for a good 

414
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:43,820
amount of time.
And maybe you never get out,

415
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,070
but maybe you learn something down 
there.

416
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:51,590
Maybe a strength in your character and 
then you pop up to a new place and maybe

417
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,660
it's better,
better aim,

418
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,080
better.

419
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,913
You.
Now I'm not being overly optimistic 

420
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,034
about this.
I know perfectly well that people 

421
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,703
encounter
impediments during their life that they 

422
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:10,061
find almost impossible to recover from,
but it's the best shot you have.

423
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,570
So anyways,
Jonah runs away,

424
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,890
but God isn't very happy about that 
because it's actually joan is destiny.

425
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,310
It's necessary for Jonah to repair the 
city.

426
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,270
So God sends a storm and the waves are 
high and and,

427
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,563
and I think what that means is because 
the water is often a symbol for the 

428
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:32,864
unconscious and that's because things 
lurk down there in the water and that 

429
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:36,614
you could pull up that that are useful,
monstrous things that you can pull up 

430
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:40,910
their useful,
you can fish for them,

431
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:44,000
you can go fishing in your own being for
answers,

432
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,340
which is what you do when you try to 
think right.

433
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,010
You ask yourself a question and you 
wait,

434
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,280
maybe an answer appears.
It's like where did that come from?

435
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,160
You didn't know what the answer was 
before it appeared.

436
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,610
When it just pop into being out of 
nowhere.

437
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,640
Who knows?
So you fish.

438
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,203
So anyways,
the waves come and the boat's going to 

439
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,110
be knocked over it.
And that's what happens.

440
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,480
I think when you know,
when you know you should do something,

441
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,633
I mean everyone has the experience,
I believe perhaps you would be willing 

442
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:19,730
to put up your hands if this experience 
is foreign to you.

443
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,930
Okay.
There's party,

444
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:23,764
you're telling you you should do 
something and it's hard to do it 

445
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,230
effortful and maybe you're afraid of it.
And so you don't do it.

446
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,970
You just procrastinate.
Right.

447
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,940
And so how do you feel about that?
Good.

448
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,993
I mean,
so what do you feel that you're 

449
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:42,560
betraying yourself?
Your anxiety actually gets worse,

450
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,650
not better,
even though,

451
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,300
you know,
you can put it off moment to moment,

452
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,640
but that doesn't help because every time
you put it off,

453
00:26:47,641 --> 00:26:50,640
the anxiety just grows a little bit.
You're not proud of yourself.

454
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,623
You have a sense that
you're making things more chaotic than 

455
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:57,390
they should be.
You know?

456
00:26:57,391 --> 00:26:58,224
And if you do that long enough,
and I'm sure many of you have had that 

457
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:01,800
experience,
if you do that long enough,

458
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:02,634
if that becomes habitual,
things will get so stormy around you 

459
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:09,060
that you'll fall right into the,
into the chaos,

460
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,570
into the watery chaos and maybe you'll 
drown.

461
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,330
So it's not a very good idea to run from
your destiny,

462
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,660
let's say
whatever that might be.

463
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,213
And you need a destiny.
You need it a place to aim out because 

464
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:25,854
that's what gives your life meaning and 
you need meaning in your life because 

465
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:30,960
life is hard.
So you know,

466
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,750
you need something to buttress yourself 
against that.

467
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,584
So anyways,

468
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,320
they wake Jonah up and Jonah says,
hey,

469
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,290
it's probably my fault because like I'm 
running away from something I'm supposed

470
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,160
to do.
And you know,

471
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:42,994
God isn't very happy about that,
so why don't you just throw me over to 

472
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,543
overboard.
And the crew isn't very happy about 

473
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,334
that.
But the waves are really starting to 

474
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,540
come up and Joan is pretty insistent 
that he's the cause of the problem.

475
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,733
And so they draw,
they draw a lot and and Jonah is chosen 

476
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,144
and so they decided to toss them into 
the ocean and immediately everything's 

477
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,843
calm.
So he's a center of chaos because he's 

478
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:12,250
not doing what he's supposed to do.
Fine.

479
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:17,370
Well then a whale comes up and swallows 
him and then he's in the whale for three

480
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:20,330
days.
Now.

481
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,530
That's a weird thing.
The whale,

482
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,920
that's the way all that,
the Japan Petrosian,

483
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,653
that's a dragon.
It's not thing that you have to go out 

484
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:34,760
there and conquer to get something of 
value now,

485
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,083
okay.

486
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,310
When you've made an error,
when you've

487
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,460
fallen off the,
the pathway,

488
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,670
when you've deviated from what you know 
you should do,

489
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,380
it produces a state of internal chaos 
and worry and concern.

490
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,050
You're,
you're thrust into the unknown.

491
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,360
You're thrust into unknown territory and
chaos.

492
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,343
You don't know what to do.
And that's often symbolized by the 

493
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:02,970
encounter with a,
with a monster,

494
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,480
like a dragon or something that lives 
under the water.

495
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,373
That's it.
And I think the reason for that is as 

496
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:11,850
far as I've been able to tell,
is that human beings,

497
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:12,684
because we'd been prey animals for 
forever and our battle with carnivorous 

498
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,184
lizards for example,
and alligators and even dinosaurs 

499
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:23,250
because there were dinosaurs around at 
the time of our most distant ancestors.

500
00:29:23,251 --> 00:29:25,830
And there was even a cat at one point 
that was,

501
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,480
that was adapted with teeth to Paris 
human skulls.

502
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,063
So it had a head that was exactly shape 
to grab you here and put a two through 

503
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:38,190
the back of your skull.

504
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,440
So like we've come through some rough 
times,

505
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,580
man,
and we have,

506
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:44,740
uh,
a system in our mind,

507
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,993
it's a threat Predator detection system.
That's the thing that makes little kids 

508
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,180
think about monsters in the dark,
right?

509
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,700
Because while there is monsters in the 
dark,

510
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,900
parents always say,
well,

511
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:57,610
there's no monsters in the dark.
It's like,

512
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,640
that's not true.
The darkest full of monsters.

513
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,730
There might not be any in your room 
right at that moment.

514
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,340
But that doesn't mean there aren't 
monsters in the dark.

515
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,013
And crimes take place.
Like criminals don't get up at six in 

516
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:11,464
the morning.
And like,

517
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,320
you know,
have breakfast and go rob a bank,

518
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,690
they do it,
they do that sort of thing at night.

519
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:17,763
People do the things that are fit for 
the night in the night and lots of 

520
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:24,064
predators are nocturnal and you can't 
see very well in the dark and kids 

521
00:30:28,091 --> 00:30:29,230
aren't stupid.
You know,

522
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,213
they've evolved to stay pretty damn 
close to the fire because the kids that 

523
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,214
wandered away from the fire got picked 
off by hyenas and lions and crocodiles 

524
00:30:41,981 --> 00:30:46,810
and whatever else the hell was out there
to eat the unwary.

525
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:53,070
So
the circuit that we use to,

526
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,960
to defend ourselves against predators

527
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,210
as we've evolved cortically that circuit
has,

528
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,913
has come to represent what we don't know
in general because the predators of 

529
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:12,161
course in habit where we don't know.
And so evolution is a conservative force

530
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:17,120
and we use the circuits that we've 
evolved to represent new things.

531
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,223
And so the unknown,
the chaos is often represented by a 

532
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,290
monster that swallows you up and pulls 
you down.

533
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,350
And you know when you're feeling 
terrible,

534
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,480
you don't say,
well I'm feeling up.

535
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,660
You say I'm feeling down.
Well why is that?

536
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,593
Well

537
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,570
down is worse.
I guess.

538
00:31:36,571 --> 00:31:37,404
You're flat on the ground when you're 
down or you're in a hole or something 

539
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,280
like that.
You're hiding in a hole,

540
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,790
you know it's down and you're threatened
by something.

541
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,683
You know?
Maybe you're threatened by your own 

542
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:49,290
inadequacy.
That might be part of it.

543
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,124
Maybe that's partly what you imagine as 
a monstrous force because you know your 

544
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,593
proclivity towards prass procrastination
and your weakness of character is part 

545
00:31:58,561 --> 00:31:59,394
and parcel of why you happen to be in 
the underworld and that's the 

546
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:05,550
underworld,
the mythological underworld.

547
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:11,640
That's where you go when things fall 
apart and if you understand that,

548
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,900
if you know that that's what that means,
then you have one of the keys that opens

549
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:20,680
up ancient stories to you and you 
understand things you could,

550
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,640
your life can be an organized,
going very well,

551
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,710
and then something comes up and Poof,
everything changes.

552
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,290
Some axiom that you were up living by 
it,

553
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:34,200
it might be the existence of a partner 
might be a job.

554
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:36,870
That might be your health.
Any of those things

555
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,070
go on and

556
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,020
you go somewhere.
When that happens,

557
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,930
you go somewhere.
It's a state of being.

558
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,410
You're still in the same world,
but it's not the same at all anymore.

559
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,310
Everything about it is different.
It's all negative and dark and you don't

560
00:32:52,311 --> 00:32:53,570
know what to do.
You're confused.

561
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,153
And so what do you do down there in the 
underworld when things have fallen 

562
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:01,270
apart,
especially if hope,

563
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,713
if it's the worst possible case scenario
and you realize that you actually had 

564
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:08,810
something to do with your demise,
that's really annoying.

565
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,080
You know when something bad happens to 
you and then you know,

566
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:15,590
you grind yourself into bits trying to 
figure out what the hell happened.

567
00:33:15,591 --> 00:33:20,591
And then you realize that,
well you are playing a causal role now.

568
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:22,274
Sometimes you're so depressed,
you assume you're playing a causal role 

569
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,393
and you work.
It's not easy to figure out by any 

570
00:33:26,691 --> 00:33:27,920
stretch of the imagination.

571
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:32,180
And it isn't that everyone who does 
something terrible is at fault for it.

572
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,920
But sometimes you find that you are off 
the path somehow.

573
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,530
And maybe even that you knew it and they
didn't attend to it.

574
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,920
And that's why all of this hit the fan.
And so then down there in that chaos,

575
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,030
you decide that you're going to do what 
you're supposed to do instead.

576
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,250
And then maybe you get to rise up again,
renewed if you're lucky.

577
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,910
And then you can go fix the city.
And that's what this story's about.

578
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,140
And that's why I picked the image to 
represent the chorus.

579
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,230
Because really what happens,
you see with the psychoanalysts,

580
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,180
the road due to health,
if you're not doing well,

581
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,670
which means that as you act in the 
world,

582
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:20,090
you're not getting what you want.
There's something wrong with your,

583
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,720
the match between your presuppositions 
and your actions,

584
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,840
habitual and the way the world is 
responding to you.

585
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,130
And so it's not turning out for you.
And the question is,

586
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:32,540
well,
what can you do about that?

587
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,123
And one answer might be to examine 
yourself for presuppositions and action 

588
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:38,984
patterns that are not serving you well 
and to find out what they are and what 

589
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:43,514
to do about them.
And maybe some of that is maybe you're 

590
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,063
not moving forward because of fear.
And maybe that theory is grounded in 

591
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,544
terrible experiences that you had in the
past that you've never been able to 

592
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,514
understand and maybe one of the ways of 
gluing yourself back together and 

593
00:34:56,091 --> 00:34:56,924
expanding your personality so that you 
could in fact live properly in the 

594
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:01,394
world,
is to go back to those terrible events 

595
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,400
and untie them and straighten them out 
and understand them and drop them.

596
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,360
And that's what psychotherapy is about 
in large part,

597
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,640
psychoanalytic,
behavioral,

598
00:35:16,641 --> 00:35:19,700
doesn't matter.
What are you afraid of?

599
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,310
What are you avoiding?
What are you failing to develop?

600
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,830
Maybe from fear,
maybe from avoidance,

601
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,990
God only knows maybe from disgust.

602
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,583
How can you get over it?
How can you reclaim those parts of your 

603
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,613
self?

604
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,143
I sat in the first lecture that I was 
going to try to provide you with a 

605
00:35:51,411 --> 00:35:56,411
Schema
into which you could place the theorists

606
00:35:56,691 --> 00:36:01,691
that we're going to discuss and it 
requires going down deep to do that.

607
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,910
And there are presuppositions.
My presupposition,

608
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:06,800
and this is a psychoanalytic 
presupposition,

609
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:11,150
it's predicated
on a poetic tradition,

610
00:36:11,151 --> 00:36:16,070
I would say on an ancient tradition.
I learned most of it from reading young.

611
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,683
It was Carl Young that
helped me understand that we're nested 

612
00:36:22,071 --> 00:36:26,540
inside a dream that we have to be 
because we don't know everything.

613
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,423
We have to take things as givens and 
that the things that we take it as 

614
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:38,471
givens are nested inside stories and we 
accept the stories as valid.

615
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,560
And then outside the stories is the 
absolute unknown,

616
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,660
you know?
And that's partly,

617
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,913
the stories are tricky.
You know that one of the classic 

618
00:36:48,471 --> 00:36:49,304
stories,
it's a variant of the Jonah story I 

619
00:36:52,791 --> 00:36:53,624
would say is

620
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,513
Saint George and the Dragon,
that that story was represented in 

621
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,070
during the renaissance and during 
medieval times,

622
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,010
thousands and thousands of ways.
It's like the story of Saint Patrick who

623
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:14,470
chased the snakes out of Ireland.
Same idea.

624
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:20,490
And that the typical St George story is 
the Hobbit or Harry Potter.

625
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,023
So in the second volume of Harry Potter,
correct me if I have any of these 

626
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:29,320
details wrong,
you remember there's that snake,

627
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,680
the Bass lisc.
So this is magic castle,

628
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:34,840
right?
You guys have no problem with that magic

629
00:37:34,841 --> 00:37:35,950
castle.
No problem.

630
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,960
There's an RF,
he's an orphan.

631
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:41,740
He goes to the magic castle to learn how
to be more than normal,

632
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,850
right?
The muggles,

633
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,060
he has a muggle family were not too 
happy with the muggle family.

634
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,700
Like as representatives of normal 
people.

635
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,793
They,
they have some blacks now of course the 

636
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:53,134
reason for that is that,
well that's what teenagers often feel 

637
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:56,560
about their parents,
right?

638
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,900
They failed Jesus.
These couldn't really be my parents.

639
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:04,270
I must have some other parents who are 
like together and those are like magical

640
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:05,104
parents,
right?

641
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,430
Parents that live in the sky and of 
course Harry Potter has earthly parents.

642
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:12,970
That's the muggles and Dursley I think 
is the kid.

643
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,980
He's at what?
He's a wonderful piece of work and uh,

644
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,333
you know,
ill form day spoiled ill formed selfish 

645
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,500
very far from the ideal.
He's a foil for Harry and of course he's

646
00:38:26,501 --> 00:38:30,820
appreciated and doted on and Harry is 
actually punished for his virtues.

647
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,640
Lots of classic story,
right to,

648
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:36,100
to be punished for your virtues.
I mean if you look at the story,

649
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,233
the central story in Christianity,
the central story in Christianity is 

650
00:38:40,301 --> 00:38:43,540
about someone who is precisely punished 
in the worst possible way.

651
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,374
For the highest possible virtues.
And that's what it makes it an 

652
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:49,600
archetypal story because there isn't 
anything more unfair than that.

653
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,153
And so it's a limit in a sense.
It can't be worse than that being 

654
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,600
punished for being,
you know,

655
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:56,620
unworthy.
It's like,

656
00:38:56,621 --> 00:38:57,011
yeah,
yeah,

657
00:38:57,011 --> 00:39:01,300
I will at least make sense.
But to be punished because you have your

658
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:02,134
act together and you're a good person,
that's real punishment and that's what 

659
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:06,814
happens to Harry.
So luckily he finds out that he's 

660
00:39:09,551 --> 00:39:10,384
magical,
which is quite convenient and off he 

661
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:16,360
goes to wizarding school and you know,
that's actually like taking,

662
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,140
that's actually like going and studying 
the humanities.

663
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,430
I mean it was when they still were,
you know,

664
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,920
because if it's through the humanities
that you,

665
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,353
that you make contact with the magic of 
your culture and that makes you more 

666
00:39:35,681 --> 00:39:36,514
than merely the child of your parents 
because you are more than merely the 

667
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:40,864
child of your parents.
Here are the child of nature and you're 

668
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:43,714
the child of culture.
And until you understand what that 

669
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:48,424
means,
understand that you have two sets of 

670
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:52,480
parents.
Like the divine hero always has two sets

671
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,880
of parents.
You,

672
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,090
you can't construe yourself properly as 
an individual.

673
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,370
You're not situated properly in the 
world.

674
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:02,800
You don't know what your 
responsibilities are.

675
00:40:02,801 --> 00:40:06,670
You Count Orient your values property 
and you will suffer for that.

676
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,160
Because as far as I can tell,
because life is so difficult,

677
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,820
you have to do something that's truly 
worthwhile in order to justify it.

678
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,240
And so well that's what all these 
stories tell you.

679
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:24,860
That's what the story of Jonah is 
telling you.

680
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:29,570
It's like you have an ethical duty to 
straighten things up.

681
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:33,890
And if you don't do it,
you're going to be sorry.

682
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,870
And that story is echoed everywhere 
while now Saint George.

683
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,700
Well,
let's go to Harry Potter.

684
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,833
That's what we were talking about.
So he goes off to the magic castle and 

685
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,670
he's learning to be a wizard and he's 
kind of an interesting character because

686
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,090
he's not really good.
And we find out,

687
00:40:53,091 --> 00:40:57,080
I think that's because it doesn't have a
piece of voldemort in him.

688
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,900
He's not what happens.
Yeah.

689
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:04,550
And that's what that means is that
to be good,

690
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,910
truly good,
you can't just follow rules.

691
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,773
That's,
that's very clear in the Harry Potter 

692
00:41:09,861 --> 00:41:10,694
story.
And you also have to be able to 

693
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:12,734
understand malevolence and in order to 
understand malevolence so that you can 

694
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:17,084
withstand it,
you have to understand that part of you 

695
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:23,660
that's malevolent because if you don't,
you're naive and if you're naive,

696
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,830
you're easy pickings.
And so that's a union idea too.

697
00:41:27,831 --> 00:41:31,760
And the union idea is that part of 
personality development is to understand

698
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:36,761
your shadow and the shadow is those 
things about you that you do not want to

699
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:38,594
admit to.

700
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,503
And

701
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,700
you can learn about your shadow by 
reading history.

702
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,010
You know,
you can read about Auschwitz,

703
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,383
you can read about the concentration 
camps in Russia and you can imagine 

704
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:51,854
yourself as a guard
instead of as a heroic rescue or of 

705
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,490
unfortunate victims,
which would be very,

706
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:02,324
very unlikely.
And once you can imagine yourself as a 

707
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,240
guard,
which is a terrifying thing to do,

708
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,130
then you understand something about 
yourself.

709
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,193
And I actually think,
and I think this is also from students 

710
00:42:17,091 --> 00:42:17,924
studying young,
that you cannot have proper respect for 

711
00:42:20,751 --> 00:42:21,584
yourself until you know that you're a 
monster because you won't act carefully 

712
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:26,181
enough.
You know,

713
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:26,781
if you think,
well,

714
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:28,850
I'm a nice person,
I'd never do anyone any harm.

715
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:29,684
It's like you're no saint.
You can be sure of that and the harm 

716
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,330
that you do.
People can come in many,

717
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:36,164
many ways.
And so if you regard yourself as 

718
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:41,360
harmless inoffensive.

719
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,430
Nice.
Well,

720
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,280
Marty,
you have any reason to be careful.

721
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,860
You're like a teddy bear sitting on a 
shelf.

722
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,620
Even if you throw it at someone,
no one's going to get hurt.

723
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,813
But that isn't what you're like because 
you're a human being and human beings 

724
00:42:54,801 --> 00:42:55,634
are some vicious creatures and there's 
utility in knowing that because it's 

725
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:03,410
also the case.
You know,

726
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,253
when the Harry Potter series,
Harry could stand up against voldemort 

727
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:06,913
and understand them and speak his 
language because he was instructed by 

728
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,630
him to some degree.
Very,

729
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,550
very interesting idea.
Anyways,

730
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,230
in the second,
yeah,

731
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,840
the reason I'm telling you this,
and this is where thinking about,

732
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:21,170
it's like how long were each of those 
books?

733
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,910
Like 500 pages.
There are long Hais and there was,

734
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:29,870
how many of them?
Seven and how many were there more sold?

735
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,243
I mean,
how many of you read every Harry Potter 

736
00:43:32,241 --> 00:43:33,074
book,

737
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:38,690
right?
How many of you read at least one?

738
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,930
Okay.
How many of you saw the movies?

739
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,970
It's like you're all in a cult.
You are.

740
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm telling you.
Really,

741
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:50,510
that's the truth.
It's really the truth.

742
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,940
So in the second volume,
there's this snake that's zipping around

743
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,790
there,
the Basilisk,

744
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:57,620
right?
And it lives in the underground.

745
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,860
That's chaos.
That's chaos.

746
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,473
And that's because wherever you are,
you're on thin ice and underneath your 

747
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:05,714
thin ice is chaos.
And here we are in this unbelievably 

748
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:12,860
civilized environment and everyone's 
getting along so perfectly,

749
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,260
but you know,
we've got hot,

750
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,850
we've got lights,
we've got electricity,

751
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,880
sewage system is working.
No one's hungry.

752
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,103
It's like we can be peaceful,
but if any of that fell apart and it 

753
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:29,150
could easily fall apart because it's a 
bloody miracle it ever works at all,

754
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,673
then the chaos that's just underneath 
the surface is going to come up right 

755
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:35,723
now.
And it's useful to know that because it 

756
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:41,460
makes you properly grateful.
If you really understand it,

757
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,653
it makes you properly grateful for the 
bloody miracle it is that you can be 

758
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:49,320
here in peace.
So anyways,

759
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:51,950
there's this snake that's underneath the
surface and it's still,

760
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,100
no,
no joke.

761
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:55,680
That thing.
It's big and it's ancient.

762
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:58,650
It's always been there.
And what happens if you look at it,

763
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,240
it turns you to stone,
right?

764
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,680
It paralyzes you.
Well,

765
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:06,330
that's the,
that's the Gorgon,

766
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:09,930
that's Medusa.
The woman with the head of snakes.

767
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,910
And if you look at her,
it paralyzes you.

768
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:13,980
What does that mean?
Well,

769
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,340
you're walking through the jungle and 
big snake appears.

770
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,130
What are you,
do you freeze?

771
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:23,220
And no bloody wonder because you're a 
prey animal.

772
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,860
And that's what they do when they see 
things that are going to eat them.

773
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:30,570
And so the snake,
well,

774
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:32,880
lots of people still die from snake 
bite.

775
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,080
And
our ancestors were,

776
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,200
I don't mean our ancestors like you 
know,

777
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,193
tens of millions of years ago when they 
were living in trees and weren't very 

778
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:45,000
big,
they made a nice snack for a snake.

779
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:46,223
And there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,
who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's 

780
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:50,364
correlated the presence of carnivorous 
snakes with the acuity of primate 

781
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:56,154
vision.
And what she found was that the more 

782
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,600
snakes around the better the primates 
could see.

783
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,783
So,
and we're particularly good at picking 

784
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:08,910
up patterns like snake camouflage in the
lower half of our visual quadrant.

785
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,040
You know,
and people generally don't like snakes.

786
00:46:11,041 --> 00:46:11,874
You can learn to handle them,
but no snake fear appears to be a nate 

787
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,253
to nate and chimpanzees.
And it tends to increase as you age 

788
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:20,250
rather than decreasing.
You can overcome it,

789
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,750
but,
well,

790
00:46:21,751 --> 00:46:24,570
my daughter had snakes and one day her 
sneak bitter.

791
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:25,770
It was a fairly big snake

792
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,100
and she hadn't paid it.
Paid attention to it for a while.

793
00:46:30,101 --> 00:46:30,934
So it nailed her.
And from then on she has had very 

794
00:46:34,871 --> 00:46:38,470
difficult time grabbing the snake.
It was like bitten once,

795
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,770
you know,
shy permanently.

796
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,933
She also told me years later she had 
nightmares about snakes all the time 

797
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,520
when she had a snake in her room.
It's like,

798
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,650
you know,
and I think it was probably the smell.

799
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:56,190
So anyways,
so Harry Potter decides he's going to go

800
00:46:56,591 --> 00:46:57,670
after the battle.
It's great.

801
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:00,640
He's going to go out there and face the 
thing that he's most afraid of.

802
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:01,983
So he does that way down in the depths.
So it's like Jonah going down into the 

803
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:11,401
depths and he faces the bass lisc and it
bites him.

804
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,460
And you know that's uh,
that's right because if you go down into

805
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:18,220
the depths,
you can get bitten.

806
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,220
Like it's no joke,
and this is a hero story,

807
00:47:21,221 --> 00:47:23,770
but the thing about the hero stories,
it's actually real.

808
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:26,440
The thing that you're facing is actually
dangerous.

809
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:27,483
And even though facing it voluntarily be
your best bet and is likely your best 

810
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,004
bet,
cause that's the central story of 

811
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:34,594
humanity,
that doesn't mean you're going to 

812
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,110
succeed.
It's the real thing.

813
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:39,310
So anyways,
he gets bitten,

814
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,500
right?
And he's going to die.

815
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,310
Now he's rescuing ginny.
So that's the Saint George Story.

816
00:47:45,311 --> 00:47:50,210
If you go after like dragon dragons,
like to capture virgin,

817
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,430
God only knows why.
I think it's because

818
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:01,533
I think it's because one of the things 
that male humans have done from the 

819
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:08,230
beginning of time is chase the damn 
predators away.

820
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,113
And I suspect that the males from God 
only knows how long ago who were 

821
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:16,984
particularly good at that we're rewarded
with female attention and why the hell 

822
00:48:22,601 --> 00:48:23,434
not so it's deeply rooted inside of us,
that idea of facing the unknown and 

823
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:32,320
freeing the woman.
So the idea there is that if you,

824
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:37,330
it's a male idea in large part,
I can talk about the central female myth

825
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,253
and I will as we proceed.
The idea is that if you're the sort of 

826
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,780
person who can stand up against the 
unknown and the frightening,

827
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:50,560
then you're also likely,
if you develop into that sort of person,

828
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:51,394
then you're also likely to develop into 
the sort of person that other people 

829
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:58,030
will find attractive.
So you know,

830
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:01,660
and that's why young believed that the 
inside the shadow was the anima,

831
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,340
which is like a female figure.

832
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,550
And so his idea was something like,
you know,

833
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,700
if you look watch movies,
there's always this Beta male guy.

834
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,043
If they're romantic movies and he's a 
nice guy and he's the friend and you 

835
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,010
know,
the woman tells him everything,

836
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:15,844
but she doesn't like him a bit.
She likes the guy who's like got an 

837
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:19,950
edge.
And,

838
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,540
and who's capable of,
I would say may him,

839
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:23,553
but at least of aggression.
Now that doesn't mean she wants him to 

840
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,174
be aggressive,
but what it does mean is that she wants 

841
00:49:29,771 --> 00:49:32,590
him to be able to be aggressive.
That would be good.

842
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,723
And so he's the romantic target.
And so he's the person that's 

843
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:41,071
incorporated the shadow and he's someone
that is respectable and perhaps useful.

844
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,840
And so,
well,

845
00:49:43,841 --> 00:49:45,010
that's a very old story.

846
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,190
So let's,
let's think about this for a minute.

847
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:02,383
I've already offered you a proposition
and I think it's an important 

848
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,010
proposition.
And I,

849
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:08,263
I'm offering you this proposition so 
that you can make sense of art and 

850
00:50:12,591 --> 00:50:17,591
literature and mythology and religion 
and dance and all those strange,

851
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:22,160
ritualistic things that human beings do,
which seems central to us,

852
00:50:22,161 --> 00:50:22,994
including including not least,
the eradicable tendency of us to seek 

853
00:50:30,231 --> 00:50:35,231
out stories of heroes.
I should finish the,

854
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,753
the Harry Potter story.
So Harry Potter goes down there to 

855
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:41,470
rescue Virginia.
It,

856
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:42,110
no,
it's,

857
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:45,930
that's not her name.
What is it Jenny?

858
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:46,960
Yeah,
but there's a,

859
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:51,110
there's a formal name for that.
It's a variant of Virginia anyways,

860
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:52,670
which is very divergent.
So,

861
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,190
um,
and he gets bitten.

862
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,740
Yes.
Genever that's it.

863
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,900
He gets bitten and the bite is poison.
And so there is dying,

864
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,150
which doesn't seem to be so good.

865
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,370
And then what happens,
and again,

866
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:09,050
you guys swallowed this,
it's no problem.

867
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,070
So what's his name?
The dumbledore character.

868
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,750
He's got a Berg,
right?

869
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,470
So he's the wise old man.
He's the ruler of the castle.

870
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:21,860
He's the ruler of the magic castle.
He's the magic king.

871
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,140
You know,
he's like God,

872
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:24,974
the father,
as far as Harry Potter is concerned and 

873
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,940
he has a bird.
What kind of bird is it?

874
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,310
It's a phoenix.
Right?

875
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,353
And one of the things that's very 
strange about a phoenix is that while 

876
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:37,430
it's a mortal,
but in a strange way,

877
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,320
you know,
it lives and lives,

878
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:41,990
I think a hundred years and it gets 
older and older and then one day,

879
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:43,580
poof,
it bursts into flames.

880
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:47,330
And it turns into an egg and then you 
get a new phoenix.

881
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,580
So that's a symbol of transformation.
It's a symbol of transformation.

882
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,770
The bird is a spirit or psyche.

883
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,330
And so here's what it means in part,
you know,

884
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,430
you know how when you learn a lesson in 
your life that that's not very pleasant,

885
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,163
right?
It's not like when you learn something 

886
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:10,700
important,
it's the best day of your life.

887
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:15,970
It's often the importance of what you 
learn is often proportionate to just how

888
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,710
wretched it is to learn it in.
Oh,

889
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:19,544
you learn things the hard way.
You learn things by getting hit because 

890
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,550
obviously if what you're doing is 
working,

891
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:26,384
you get where you want.
There's no learning in that and that's 

892
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:32,210
happy.
It's when you're doing something and you

893
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:36,140
hit an obstacle and maybe a bloody well 
hit it hard and then you know you recoil

894
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:36,974
and then you down into the depths you go
and you have to sort yourself out and 

895
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,060
you realize that you're,
you know,

896
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:44,570
this particular kind of idiot and that 
you should probably fix that.

897
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,310
And that's really annoying and 
difficult.

898
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:47,210
And,
you know,

899
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,413
and maybe you're down in the dumps and 
anxious for quite a while and then you 

900
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:52,640
get it repaired more or less than,
you know,

901
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:57,641
you put yourself back together.
That's the Phoenix poof into flames,

902
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,430
Bang egg new you.
And so,

903
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,610
you know,
that's the ability to learn.

904
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,370
Now,
human beings are very strange creatures,

905
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:11,000
right?
Because we're very malleable compared to

906
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,320
most animals.
You know,

907
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:15,980
like grizzly bears now in Grizzly bears 
a thousand years ago,

908
00:53:15,981 --> 00:53:18,620
it's like whatever,
they're the same thing.

909
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,030
They do the same thing.
There's no transformation.

910
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,090
But human beings,
we have this massive brain and you know,

911
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:27,924
it's a pain because it means you have to
take care of human children until 

912
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:35,160
they're 40
and that's a big burden.

913
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,571
And so,
you know,

914
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:39,570
we pay a big price for it.
It also makes childbirth very difficult.

915
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:42,150
And uh,
and it's costly.

916
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:42,983
You have to eat a lot because you have a
big brain because it uses up a lot of 

917
00:53:44,941 --> 00:53:46,440
energy.
And so,

918
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:47,873
you know,
you,

919
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,760
you pay a price for it,
but the advantage is your plastic.

920
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,223
You can learn.
Now learning is a strange thing because 

921
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,670
you can think of it as just acquiring 
more information,

922
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:04,050
but you could also think of it,
and this is more accurate as

923
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,010
finding out something that you're doing 
wrong.

924
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,320
So that sort of built into like a 
character,

925
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:11,723
a character element of your character,
a presumption of your perception or a 

926
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,320
deep habit.
It's really built into you.

927
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,000
It's a neural structure,
right?

928
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,463
It's,
it's alive and you have to kill it 

929
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:22,823
because this is working properly and the
pain that you go through in part when 

930
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:28,470
you're suffering because you did 
something stupid.

931
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:33,120
Is it something like you're,
you're the neurology,

932
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,790
I can never get this quite right.

933
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,373
It's the pain of the death of that 
structure and that can be a huge chunk 

934
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:42,151
of view.
You know,

935
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:45,630
if you really have to go through a 
massive revision,

936
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:46,464
it's like the person that comes out the 
other end might hardly be the same at 

937
00:54:50,221 --> 00:54:51,660
all.
You know,

938
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:52,800
that happens.
For example,

939
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:53,634
if you're trying to combat alcoholism,
which is just a ratchet thing to do 

940
00:54:58,111 --> 00:55:01,650
because well,
all your friends are alcoholic.

941
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,033
All your family drinks too much.
The only thing you know how to do when 

942
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:08,190
you're socializing is to go to the bar 
and drink too much.

943
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,443
You know,
and you spend like 20 hours a week on 

944
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:12,420
it.
It's like,

945
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,930
it's not just that you're addicted to 
the substance.

946
00:55:15,931 --> 00:55:16,764
It's like that's how you live.
And so if you want to stop being an 

947
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:19,974
alcoholic,
not only do you have to stop drinking 

948
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,944
alcohol,
but you have to stop seeing all your 

949
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:26,040
drunk friends.

950
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:26,903
And then maybe you've had them for your 
whole life and you have to have 

951
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:31,200
continual battles with your drunk 
family.

952
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:34,080
And then you have to figure out 
something to do with that 20 hours.

953
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,770
It's now like hanging around your neck 
like an albatross.

954
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,173
And so you have to lift that whole part 
of your personality die and a new part 

955
00:55:43,771 --> 00:55:47,520
house to spring forth.
And that's what the Phoenix is.

956
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,690
And the Phoenix is the capacity of the 
person to transform.

957
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:57,030
And so when Harry gets bit by the snake 
that freezes him,

958
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,350
he gets seriously injured.
The Phoenix comes in Christ,

959
00:56:01,351 --> 00:56:05,340
some tears in his wound,
it prepares him,

960
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,980
Bang,
he's back to life.

961
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:14,150
And the strange thing is that that's 
okay with all of the viewers now.

962
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,213
Why would that be?
There's nothing about it that's 

963
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:21,750
rational.
Nothing,

964
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,560
right?
Magic castle that's not rational.

965
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,940
Giant snake underneath it.
That's a little more rational.

966
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,830
Turning you to stone going down there to
face it,

967
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,020
being rejuvenated by a phoenix.
It's like,

968
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:38,381
yeah,
yeah,

969
00:56:38,381 --> 00:56:39,214
that's okay.
We can,

970
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,920
we'll watch that glue.
We all swallow.

971
00:56:41,921 --> 00:56:42,754
It will be completely engaged in it.
And the reason for that is because it's 

972
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:47,860
a myth.
It's about how people,

973
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:49,240
yeah,

974
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,073
it's a Meta story about how to act,
about how to conduct yourself in the 

975
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:53,344
world to face the things that you're 
afraid of that would otherwise paralyze 

976
00:56:56,321 --> 00:57:01,321
you.
To let the death of what is insufficient

977
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:06,820
about you ochre and then to wait for the
rebirth.

978
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:12,413
Okay.
So science is about what the world is 

979
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,313
and

980
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,550
mythodrama and dream and the 
unconscious,

981
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,230
all of that,
let's say the aesthetic and artistic and

982
00:57:27,231 --> 00:57:32,180
fantastic side of humanity.
That's more about how things should be.

983
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,073
It's more about how to act.
They're there lessons in how to act and 

984
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:39,590
they're abstract glasses.
People are capable of abstraction.

985
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:40,850
Right?
So you say,

986
00:57:40,851 --> 00:57:41,684
well,
there's something good about you and 

987
00:57:43,131 --> 00:57:45,320
there's something good about you and 
there's something good about you and,

988
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,510
and there's some bad about you and you 
and you.

989
00:57:47,511 --> 00:57:50,660
And so we'll take all the good things 
and make one good thing out of that.

990
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:53,090
We'll take all the bad things and make 
one bad thing out of that.

991
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:54,103
And then we start to understand the 
difference between good and bad and we 

992
00:57:56,271 --> 00:57:57,104
get better and better and better and 
better at that over the centuries as we 

993
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:00,733
distill that.
And then we have a figure of ultimate 

994
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,104
good and a figure of ultimate evil.
And that helps us understand what those 

995
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:10,340
two things are.
It was the hostile brothers.

996
00:58:10,341 --> 00:58:12,380
That's a very common,
mythological motif.

997
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:13,461
And you could say,
well,

998
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,890
they're at war inside you.
And,

999
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,160
and I think that that's a universal 
truth.

1000
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,950
It's an existential truth.

1001
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:31,430
The domain of ethics and morality is how
are we in the world and what,

1002
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:33,020
how should we be?
What's the good?

1003
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,410
And the reason I'm telling you all this,
apart from the fact that you should know

1004
00:58:36,411 --> 00:58:37,910
it,
because this is what you should know.

1005
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,470
If you go through university is that it 
bears directly on issues of health.

1006
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,760
You're trying to accomplish something.
Say if you go see a psychotherapist,

1007
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,421
you know,
you could say,

1008
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:50,750
well I'm trying to get healthy,
but you know that's not really right.

1009
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:54,380
What you're trying to do when you go see
a therapist is get your life together.

1010
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,450
And that's not the same thing.
You know,

1011
00:58:56,451 --> 00:59:00,620
like mostly when I'm acting as a 
therapist,

1012
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:03,500
it's not like I'm directly treating 
mental disorder.

1013
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:07,070
Like mental disorders aren't.
They're just not neat little boxes.

1014
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:08,143
It's not like someone has a fully 
functioning life but they have an 

1015
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:13,100
anxiety disorder and then you bring them
in,

1016
00:59:13,101 --> 00:59:16,130
you treat the anxiety disorder and they 
go back to their fully functioning life.

1017
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,600
It's like,
it's not like that at all.

1018
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,390
The disorders tangled out into their 
life.

1019
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,810
You know,
if you're well usually your,

1020
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,650
your,
your workplace isn't going very well and

1021
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:27,680
your relationships with the people 
around you are damaged and you know,

1022
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,790
you're connected in the actual world 
with all of these things.

1023
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:32,624
And so when you come to see a therapist,
you have to work on putting your life 

1024
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:37,094
together in a sustainable manner.
And that's certainly not just removing 

1025
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,593
the mental illness is very rare now.
And then you see someone who's 

1026
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:45,104
depressed,
whose life is together and they're just 

1027
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,254
depressed.
Something's gone wrong probably 

1028
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:53,210
biochemically.
And so with someone like that,

1029
00:59:53,211 --> 00:59:55,310
you can often give them an SSRI.
Yes,

1030
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,100
I can't give them to them,
but I can recommend them,

1031
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,440
recommend they go see a doctor anyways.
And uh,

1032
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,510
that's sometimes just does the trick 
because you know,

1033
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,160
their life is actually pretty good.

1034
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,950
They just can't see it.
But that's bloody rare man.

1035
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,880
It's usually the case that someone comes
and sees you and things are in a serious

1036
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:17,030
state of chaos and all of that has to be
addressed.

1037
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,900
And some of it's psychological and a lot
of it's just practical.

1038
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:24,350
It's embedded out there in the world.
That's what the behavior,

1039
01:00:24,351 --> 01:00:27,290
psycho behavioral psychologists are 
particularly concerned about.

1040
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,480
So anyways,
psychology,

1041
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:30,314
especially the clinical end is 
predicated on it necessarily predicated 

1042
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:37,970
on the question,
how is it that we obtained the good,

1043
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,833
how do we aim at the good and what would
that be when my clients first come to 

1044
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:43,400
see me,
one of the things I often ask them is,

1045
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,530
okay,
well let's say you look a year ahead.

1046
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,630
What do you want?
What are we aiming at?

1047
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,973
What would,
what would your life isn't the way you 

1048
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:51,014
want it to be?
How would it look if it was the way you 

1049
01:00:53,181 --> 01:00:55,640
wanted it to be?
Or at least partly that way.

1050
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,820
And we aim at that,
right?

1051
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,120
And we look for impediments,
psychological impediments,

1052
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:04,310
fears,
avoidance strategies,

1053
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,173
that sort of thing.
And we develop strategies and we try to 

1054
01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:11,840
move towards that.
I would say ideal.

1055
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,010
All right,
to understand the categories

1056
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,793
of myth will say you have to understand 
something about the nature of 

1057
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:23,630
categorization.
Now,

1058
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:24,643
categorization is a tricky thing and 
we're going to run through some 

1059
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:30,650
complicated ideas relatively quickly.

1060
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,123
You know,
you think you put things in the same 

1061
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:41,471
category because they're similar.
But the problem is is that first of all,

1062
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:43,184
that's not an answer.
It's just a restatement of the initial 

1063
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:48,020
proposition.
And second of all,

1064
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,083
you can put things in the same category 
that are by no means identical and you 

1065
01:01:52,971 --> 01:01:55,430
often do that.
And third,

1066
01:01:55,431 --> 01:02:00,170
it's things are things that are similar 
are often also importantly different.

1067
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,640
And so picking which element of 
similarity,

1068
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,000
you know,
like let's say you,

1069
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,380
if you have a group of books while are 
they the same?

1070
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,070
Well obviously no because,
well,

1071
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,510
unless they're,
you know,

1072
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:14,563
all the same book,
but the category of books is a pretty 

1073
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:18,554
strange category because the content of 
the books differs completely well and 

1074
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:25,530
you could still make a group of books 
and you pick some arbitrary element that

1075
01:02:25,531 --> 01:02:29,430
unites them and consider that grounds to
make a category.

1076
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,433
There's other categories,
more scientific categories and 

1077
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,980
scientific categories tend to actually 
contain things that are very,

1078
01:02:37,981 --> 01:02:40,950
very similar in,
in Mo across multiple dimensions.

1079
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:43,680
Like protons are like that.
As far as I can tell,

1080
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:46,140
there's nothing that distinguishes one 
proton from another.

1081
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:48,900
And the same with electronics.
And you know,

1082
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:52,140
the set of triangles is like that 
because you can define it precisely,

1083
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,310
but most of the categories that human 
beings use aren't so neat.

1084
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,090
And the problem with that is that unless
the categories are neat,

1085
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,953
like scientific categories,
it's very difficult to investigate them 

1086
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:06,390
scientifically.
So for example,

1087
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:10,530
you might do research on a group of 
people with anxiety disorders,

1088
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:11,933
but the problem with that is that the 
anxiety disorder category is so 

1089
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,380
heterogeneous that it's almost 
impossible to identify the commonalities

1090
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:25,470
across all the people who are in that 
category.

1091
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:28,920
And that's partly because the category 
isn't actually a scientific category,

1092
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,400
it's a hybrid category.
It's a practical category.

1093
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:34,320
I can give you an example of that.

1094
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,113
Hmm.

1095
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,330
Nope,
I can't because I must not have saved it

1096
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,280
anyways.
Many of the dsm category,

1097
01:04:00,281 --> 01:04:03,360
so these are categories for 
psychopathology require.

1098
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:04,463
If you're part of that category,
imagine there's seven symptoms that you 

1099
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:08,454
could have,
or eight symptoms that you could have 

1100
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:12,390
that would put you in that category.
Like antisocial personality,

1101
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,820
eight symptoms.
You steal,

1102
01:04:14,821 --> 01:04:16,020
you kick,
you hit,

1103
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:18,300
you bite you,
you know you're abusive.

1104
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,360
I don't remember the category categories
precisely,

1105
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:22,493
but you can be in the category if you 
have symptoms two through five and you 

1106
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,110
can be in the category.
If you have symptoms six through eight,

1107
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:29,093
they aren't the same symptoms,
but you're in the same category and you 

1108
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:32,041
think,
well,

1109
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,840
how the hell can that be?
Well,

1110
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:34,674
that's a family resemblance category,
roughly speaking and lots of the things 

1111
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:40,020
that we use,
our family resemblance categories,

1112
01:04:40,021 --> 01:04:40,854
there's a prototype and then if you have
enough of the features of that 

1113
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:44,964
prototype,
imagine the prototype has 10 features 

1114
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,580
and if you haven't,
six of those pro features,

1115
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:51,533
you get to be in that category.
But it means that the category is 

1116
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,910
actually quite diverse and that's one of
the problems that plagues.

1117
01:04:58,780 --> 01:04:59,613
Okay.

1118
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:00,603
Psychology,
psychiatry as a science and clinical 

1119
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:05,470
psychology is a science.
It's a really big problem because if the

1120
01:05:05,471 --> 01:05:06,304
categories aren't homogenous,
then it's very difficult to draw 

1121
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:09,694
conclusions about the members of the 
category and the psychologists and the 

1122
01:05:13,391 --> 01:05:16,600
psychiatrists claim that those are 
scientific categories,

1123
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:18,610
but,
but they're not.

1124
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:22,810
And they can't be partly because they're
aimed at the classification of health or

1125
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:23,644
ideal versus no unhealth or no an ideal.
And partly because they play multiple 

1126
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:27,663
roles.
Say,

1127
01:05:27,910 --> 01:05:32,910
I mean the category isn't there just to 
provide neat demarcations for scientific

1128
01:05:33,911 --> 01:05:34,744
study.
The categories there to give people a 

1129
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:42,190
language to talk about certain sets of 
symptoms to diagnose.

1130
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:44,950
Because you know when you come in and 
you have a set of symptoms,

1131
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:48,190
you might want to know what,
what they are so that you also know what

1132
01:05:48,191 --> 01:05:49,024
they aren't.
It's really a relief often to find a 

1133
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:52,564
diagnosis.
And then of course the diagnosis has 

1134
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:58,420
certain implications for treatment and 
for billing and for all of that.

1135
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,580
So the category has to play all of those
rules.

1136
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:03,710
So there's multiple types of category.
Um,

1137
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,703
and the categories that we're talking 
about in relationship to mythology 

1138
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:10,263
aren't scientific categories.
Their categories about the world 

1139
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,880
construed as a place to act.

1140
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:18,843
So here's the way to think about it.
You're always looking at the world 

1141
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:24,304
through a framework of reference.
And you have to do that because there 

1142
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:31,180
isn't very much of you.
You can't see the whole world at once.

1143
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:34,570
And in fact the amount of the world you 
actually see is so small,

1144
01:06:34,571 --> 01:06:35,404
you can't believe it.
The central part of your vision is 

1145
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,074
zipping around,
producing a pretty high resolution 

1146
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,160
representation of exactly what you're 
looking at.

1147
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:46,330
But outside of that center,
like if I look at you,

1148
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:49,330
I can't see her eyes.
I can see her glasses,

1149
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:53,890
but barely,
I can't even tell whether you're male or

1150
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:57,490
female.
The person passed that.

1151
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:00,670
I can't see it all.
Now you don't notice that.

1152
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:01,653
You know,
you don't notice that you're that blind 

1153
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:04,084
because your,
your central vision is always popping 

1154
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:09,910
around illuminating that tiny space.
But you're Sudan blind.

1155
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:10,743
It's just mind boggling.
And I'm sure some of you have seen the 

1156
01:07:13,121 --> 01:07:15,610
invisible gorilla video,
you know,

1157
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:16,444
wear a gorilla,
comes into the video and you don't 

1158
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:20,554
notice,
which is somewhat shocking because you 

1159
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:24,010
would think that you had noticed a 
gorilla.

1160
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,053
But what happens is that you actually 
don't notice something unless it 

1161
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:32,020
interferes with what you're doing.
And because what are you going to do?

1162
01:07:32,021 --> 01:07:34,960
Notice everything.
You can't do that.

1163
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:35,794
You can hardly notice anything.
So what you do is you pick something to 

1164
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,344
focus on.
It's usually something that you value 

1165
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:40,564
because why else would you focus on it?
So that means that your value system 

1166
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:46,870
determines the direction of your 
perception.

1167
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,510
Bloody well,
think about that for a minute.

1168
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,520
That's a Buddhist idea,
right?

1169
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:53,463
People,
people live in a kind of illusion and 

1170
01:07:56,171 --> 01:07:59,200
sometimes that illusion causes suffering
and they can transform the way they look

1171
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,450
at the world and that can release them 
from their suffering.

1172
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:04,210
But the idea that you do live in an 
illusion,

1173
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:05,463
well,
I don't know if it's exactly an 

1174
01:08:06,101 --> 01:08:06,934
illusion,
but you certainly do live within a 

1175
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:13,210
framework of perception that's 
determined by your values.

1176
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:15,410
Now that is so weird,
you know,

1177
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:16,244
because we never think of the world is 
something that reveals itself through 

1178
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:19,844
our values,
but of course it of course it does 

1179
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:27,560
because you look at what you want,
you aim at what you want,

1180
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,190
and once you've aimed the world lays 
itself out for you and that,

1181
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:35,120
and that's exactly how perception works.
That's why represented at this way.

1182
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,470
You're always somewhere that's point a 
and that somewhere in some place in some

1183
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:40,304
time and you're always have some notion 
about what you want to have have 

1184
01:08:43,701 --> 01:08:44,534
happened next.
You know you're going to go to the next 

1185
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:48,770
class.
Maybe you've got a plan after this.

1186
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,660
In this class you have a plan.

1187
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:52,760
You're hoping to learn something,
I presume,

1188
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:57,170
and maybe you have a goal with regards 
to a grade and that's nested inside your

1189
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,490
desire to get a degree and that's nested
inside your desire to be educated and to

1190
01:09:01,491 --> 01:09:02,740
have a career and,
and,

1191
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,760
and,
and have a successful life.

1192
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,923
So attending to me at the moment,
the reason you're doing that is because 

1193
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:15,020
all of those values exist within you 
simultaneously focusing your attention.

1194
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:19,100
And so you're attending to me and not to
something else,

1195
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,360
assuming that all of you with your 
Computers Open Aren't surfing the web,

1196
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:24,403
which you might be,
but assuming that you're focusing w 

1197
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,490
whatever you're focusing on is directed 
by what you value.

1198
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,670
And some of that can be unconscious.
In fact,

1199
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:35,504
a lot of it is unconscious because you 
know it's very difficult for you to get 

1200
01:09:38,271 --> 01:09:39,800
control of what you pay attention to.

1201
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,320
You know what that's like.
You're trying to study.

1202
01:09:42,590 --> 01:09:46,040
It's kind of a boring paper.
Christ your attention.

1203
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,570
It's just like everywhere.
You know?

1204
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,630
Maybe you'll vacuum under the band 
instead of doing the paper,

1205
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:51,920
reading the paper,
you know,

1206
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,293
you can't get grip on that thing.
So your attention has an autonomy and 

1207
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:58,940
that's another psychoanalytic idea,
you know,

1208
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,170
because you kind of think,
well,

1209
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:01,004
you're in control.
It's like really ever try telling 

1210
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:05,840
yourself what to do.
Does the,

1211
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:09,110
how does that work for you?
I'm going to go to the gym three times a

1212
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:10,550
week,
right?

1213
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:11,413
Sure you are.
I'm going to quit eating sugar for a 

1214
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:18,010
month.
It's like how long does that last?

1215
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:18,844
It's like 50 minutes.
And you're eating like three chocolate 

1216
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:23,570
bars.
So you're,

1217
01:10:23,630 --> 01:10:25,670
this is,
and this is Freud central insight.

1218
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:30,671
I would say you're an autonomous group 
of spiritual agents,

1219
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:34,850
let's say personalities and they don't 
really get along very well.

1220
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,013
And you,
the ego will say is by no means 

1221
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:40,574
necessarily in charge.
And that's a very strange thing to 

1222
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:44,054
realize,
but you can really realize that by 

1223
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,530
noticing how little control you have 
over your attentional focus.

1224
01:10:49,310 --> 01:10:51,890
Okay,
so you've got your point a,

1225
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,770
you're going to point b,
you're always doing that.

1226
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,633
You inhabit a structure of value and it 
changes what the point is and what the 

1227
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,670
point B is.
But the structure itself doesn't change.

1228
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:05,180
And when you're looking at the world,
what you see is not objects.

1229
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:06,023
You see tools and they make you happy.
Those are the things that facilitate 

1230
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,350
your movement forward and you see 
obstacles and those are things that make

1231
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,030
you unhappy.
When you encounter an obstacle,

1232
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,493
one of the problems is as well,
you don't get to where you're going and 

1233
01:11:18,751 --> 01:11:19,584
that's a problem.
But the other problem is if you 

1234
01:11:21,091 --> 01:11:23,970
encounter an obstacle,
the frame might be wrong,

1235
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:24,720
right?

1236
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,553
Because you never know.
It might be just something that you 

1237
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:27,534
could detour around real easily,
might be a fatal flaw in your whole 

1238
01:11:30,061 --> 01:11:34,140
plan.
And so obstacles have this dual nature,

1239
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:34,974
they get in your way,
but they can also take your plan down 

1240
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:41,190
and so they can produce anxiety.
So my point is this,

1241
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,353
there's a book called a visual,
an ecological approach to visual 

1242
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:47,070
perceptions.
Great book,

1243
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:49,710
um,
by Gibson,

1244
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,960
Jj Gibson,
if I remember correctly,

1245
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:57,770
and this is,
although I thought of this a while back,

1246
01:11:57,931 --> 01:12:01,230
I realized eventually that it was a 
variant of his theory.

1247
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:03,900
And what he believed was that when 
people looked at the world,

1248
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:08,220
they saw a value first and inferred 
objects second.

1249
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,840
So for example,
for Gibson,

1250
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,050
if you're standing by a cliff,
you don't see a cliff.

1251
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:17,400
And then think about the fact that you 
might fall and then feel frightened.

1252
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,653
You see a falling off place.
And part of the seeing of that part of 

1253
01:12:21,931 --> 01:12:22,764
the act of seeing is being afraid of 
that because your eyes are connected 

1254
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:26,544
right to your emotional systems.
And part of what your eyes do is tell 

1255
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:30,534
you what the object is,
but your eyes do all sorts of other 

1256
01:12:32,671 --> 01:12:34,470
things.
Like they prepare you for action,

1257
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,920
they prepare you for gripping,
they prepare you for emotion.

1258
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:41,290
And,
and none of that actually requires the,

1259
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:46,020
the existence necessarily the existence 
of your perception of the object.

1260
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:49,320
So there aren't people who have blind 
sight and if you show them,

1261
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:52,860
so they think they can't see.
But if you flash them an angry face,

1262
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:54,900
they'll show a skin conductance 
response.

1263
01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:58,290
And that's because the visual pathways 
to the Amygdala,

1264
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,350
which does face Emoji,
facial emotional processing,

1265
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,333
can still be active.
These are people who have usually had a 

1266
01:13:03,721 --> 01:13:05,130
stroke,
so their eyes are okay,

1267
01:13:05,131 --> 01:13:07,110
but they've destroyed the visual cortex.

1268
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:10,920
So,
so anyways,

1269
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:13,920
it's perfectly plausible that at least 
at one level of analysis,

1270
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:17,250
when you look at something you see it's 
utility first.

1271
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,670
So you see a chair and you might say a 
chair is an object,

1272
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:21,504
but I wouldn't say that beanbags,
a chair and a stump is a chair and they 

1273
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:28,200
don't share much in common except that 
you can sit on them.

1274
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:29,363
And so you know the chairs,
the chairs basically conceptualized by 

1275
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:36,090
its functional utility.
And when you look at a chair,

1276
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:36,924
what you perceive it's is it's 
functional utility and the chair tells 

1277
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:41,040
you what to do.
It says,

1278
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,260
sit on me.
And so that,

1279
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,283
and there are people who have prefrontal
damage and they engage in something 

1280
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:47,064
called utilization behavior.
And if they're walking down a hallway 

1281
01:13:50,251 --> 01:13:52,140
and there's this door open,
they have to walk through it.

1282
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,350
They can't not do what the object tells 
them to do.

1283
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:59,910
That's called utilization behavior.
So that's how the world is laid out.

1284
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:05,640
And I would say inside that domain,
you're in the predictable world.

1285
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,470
You're in the world that you understand 
that,

1286
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:10,890
that you know and that if you hit an 
obstacle or if you're outside,

1287
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:13,780
that you're in the unknown.
You're in unknown territory.

1288
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:20,200
In the mythological world and the world 
for action,

1289
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,410
you could conceptualize the world as a 
stage for action.

1290
01:14:25,890 --> 01:14:30,150
And this is a shakespearian quote that 
that sort of sums it up quite nicely.

1291
01:14:30,990 --> 01:14:34,230
All the world is a stage and all the men
and women,

1292
01:14:34,231 --> 01:14:35,064
merely players,
they have their exits and their 

1293
01:14:37,591 --> 01:14:40,380
entrances and one man in his time plays 
many parts.

1294
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,440
And you might say,
well is that really true?

1295
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:45,480
And the answer to that is,
well,

1296
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,270
it depends on what you mean by true and,
and,

1297
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:49,193
and that really is the answer because 
there are different ways of defining 

1298
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:53,790
true.
So,

1299
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:58,783
and it isn't self evident that there's 
only one way of defining true that's 

1300
01:15:02,361 --> 01:15:03,650
appropriate.
You know,

1301
01:15:03,651 --> 01:15:06,530
the definition of truth might be more 
like a tool.

1302
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,150
And you know,
we,

1303
01:15:08,151 --> 01:15:08,984
our tool using creatures and really what
we're trying to do with our conceptions 

1304
01:15:11,451 --> 01:15:14,870
of truth is to work through the world 
successfully.

1305
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:20,590
So even science is subordinate should be
subordinate to our use of the world as a

1306
01:15:21,111 --> 01:15:23,390
tool.
Because if it isn't useful tool,

1307
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:25,940
like what are we doing with it?
You know,

1308
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,030
just generating technology that might 
destroy the world,

1309
01:15:29,210 --> 01:15:32,060
that seems like a bad idea.
So,

1310
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:34,873
so I think that,
that the world as tool is actually the 

1311
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:37,724
fundamental sort of truth.
And I think that that's a Darwinian 

1312
01:15:40,371 --> 01:15:41,330
idea,
right?

1313
01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:42,164
That our notions about the world have 
evolved through a Darwinian process and 

1314
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:51,491
that it's appropriate for us to regard 
as what is most real.

1315
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:54,283
Those things that reliably ensure are 
the continuation of our life and the 

1316
01:16:00,861 --> 01:16:05,030
probability of our propagation.
And if you're a true Darwinian,

1317
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:07,610
I don't think there's a way out of that 
argument.

1318
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:13,300
And it isn't self evident by any stretch
of the imagination that seeing the world

1319
01:16:14,271 --> 01:16:18,680
as our as objects is the way that our 
brain works.

1320
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:19,753
In fact,
I don't think it's the way it works at 

1321
01:16:20,661 --> 01:16:23,720
all.
And I think that that's why we're so

1322
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:29,930
wired for stories,
right?

1323
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,790
It's a mystery.
You know,

1324
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:35,780
like you won't line up for two hours to 
go see a lecturer,

1325
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:37,903
but you'll line up for two hours,
maybe you'll even camp overnight if 

1326
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:44,360
you're mythological imagination has been
seized for God only knows what reason by

1327
01:16:44,361 --> 01:16:45,194
star wars.
And you know that's a source of 

1328
01:16:48,261 --> 01:16:49,094
mythology.
It's the mythology of the modern person 

1329
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:55,340
and it fills a gap.
And that's why people do it.

1330
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,423
So that to me speaks of Ma,
the manner in which our psyches are 

1331
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:05,870
constructed.
And that's a union idea.

1332
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,000
That's the idea of the archetype,
essentially,

1333
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:13,030
that to be human is to participate in a 
certain pattern of being.

1334
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:18,070
And that that pattern of being is acted 
out socially.

1335
01:17:18,071 --> 01:17:21,820
It talked about individually,
but it's also part of your structure.

1336
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:22,953
Even your perceptual structure as a,
as a living organism of your particular 

1337
01:17:27,941 --> 01:17:28,774
type.
And it would be the case at least in 

1338
01:17:31,121 --> 01:17:31,954
part that the hero myth,
which is go out where no one has gone 

1339
01:17:35,111 --> 01:17:39,810
before,
face the terrors of the unknown,

1340
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:45,050
gather something of value and return is 
the central story of humankind.

1341
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,530
It's not the only central story,
but it's,

1342
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:50,843
it's up there in the top three and many 
of the dramas that you engage yourself 

1343
01:17:56,131 --> 01:17:56,964
in are variations of that story and you 
watch it over and over and over because 

1344
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:07,290
you're trying to learn how to do that 
because that's what you need to do live.

1345
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:15,350
Okay,
here's the,

1346
01:18:15,351 --> 01:18:16,184
here's an idea.

1347
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,980
What's common among people?
Well,

1348
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:24,013
we're self conscious so we know of our 
own existence and we knew of our own 

1349
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:28,634
limitations and so that means that we 
have a certain innate terror and 

1350
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:35,310
fragility.
Our,

1351
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,790
our,
our existence is a problem to us.

1352
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,103
And in some sense what we're trying to 
do when we search for meaning is to 

1353
01:18:41,451 --> 01:18:44,510
search for a solution to that problem.
And that can be security,

1354
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,420
but it can also be motive being,
you know,

1355
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:48,254
and so for example,
being engaged in something worthwhile 

1356
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:53,630
seems to be a good medicine for being 
fragile,

1357
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:54,831
you know,
because you think,

1358
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:56,570
well I'm doing this,
it seems worthwhile.

1359
01:18:56,571 --> 01:18:57,404
And the fact that there's a price to be 
paid for it and that things could be 

1360
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:00,974
following me that aren't good,
I'm willing to put up with that because 

1361
01:19:02,991 --> 01:19:03,824
what I'm engaged in seems to be of 
appropriate of sufficient significance 

1362
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:07,904
to justify all that.
We all become self conscious and we're 

1363
01:19:11,661 --> 01:19:14,660
all trying to do something about that,
figure out how to deal with it.

1364
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,833
So there's a landscape that we inhabit,
I would say within which that takes 

1365
01:19:22,951 --> 01:19:24,270
place.
So there's a human being,

1366
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:29,420
self conscious,
d doom to tragedy and doomed to be aware

1367
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:30,744
of that.
The human being has two elements and 

1368
01:19:32,821 --> 01:19:33,654
that's the element that seeks the good.
And there's the other element that 

1369
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:36,900
seeks,
I would say

1370
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:41,700
revenge and destruction.
And we have our reasons.

1371
01:19:41,701 --> 01:19:42,534
You know,
if something tragic happens to you and 

1372
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:46,800
it's tragic and unfair and it really 
brings you low,

1373
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:48,083
the probability that you're going to 
become resentful and want revenge is 

1374
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:53,640
extraordinarily high and no wonder,
and you know,

1375
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:56,940
the architectural representation of that
is evil itself.

1376
01:19:56,941 --> 01:20:01,200
And the architectural representation of 
the good that you could do is,

1377
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:05,310
is the hero.
And so those things inhabit us.

1378
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,190
They're permanent elements of the 
psyche.

1379
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,580
And then what else is universal to us?
Well,

1380
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:15,540
we live in a society you could say,
and that's deep.

1381
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,510
That's deep.
It's not just human society.

1382
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:21,300
Like we've lived in a society forever.
So you know,

1383
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,253
lobsters live and dominance hierarchies 
and they use their serotonin system at 

1384
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:30,090
least in part to keep track of their 
dominant position.

1385
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:34,320
And so you can use antidepressants on 
lobsters when they get defeated and they

1386
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:36,570
don't feel so bad from being defeated in
a fight.

1387
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:37,793
And so you just think about that because
the anti depressants do the same thing 

1388
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:45,111
to us.
We're so bloody social that the circuits

1389
01:20:45,391 --> 01:20:48,450
that evolved 300 million years ago when

1390
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:50,793
the lobsters in us had a shared ancestor
are still operating at the base of your 

1391
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:56,374
brain.
That's why status is so important to 

1392
01:20:57,761 --> 01:20:58,594
people and reputation.
I mean that serotonin system governs 

1393
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:02,494
your emotional regulation,
how people respond to you and what they 

1394
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:06,580
think of you.
Man that matters.

1395
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:09,900
That's why you're on facebook all the 
time and checking your texts and,

1396
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,083
and obsessing continually about your 
online presence as soon assuming that 

1397
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:18,190
you're doing that and you know,
contacting people frantically and seeing

1398
01:21:18,191 --> 01:21:20,560
what the updates are.
It's like where,

1399
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,633
where,
how are you held in the esteem of 

1400
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,190
others?
Very,

1401
01:21:24,191 --> 01:21:25,024
very important.
And that's because it determines your 

1402
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:29,200
emotional regulation.
It's really important.

1403
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:33,520
So we exist in a society always,
and the society has two elements.

1404
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:37,420
The tyrannical element of the society 
that would be the tyrannical king,

1405
01:21:37,421 --> 01:21:40,390
roughly speaking,
a very common mythological theme.

1406
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:42,310
You see that in the lion king too,
right?

1407
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,170
Cause that scar.
Um,

1408
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:48,700
and of course you see it in the real 
world with almost continually.

1409
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:49,743
And then the benevolent king who is the 
source of all the good things about 

1410
01:21:53,351 --> 01:21:54,610
culture,
you know,

1411
01:21:54,611 --> 01:21:56,590
and,
and you can see these things play out as

1412
01:21:56,591 --> 01:21:59,800
mythologies in,
in political terms.

1413
01:21:59,801 --> 01:22:00,634
So I would say for example,
the continual harping about the 

1414
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:07,720
oppressive nature of the Patriarchy is 
part of a myth.

1415
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:11,320
And the myth is that society is 
oppressive.

1416
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,041
It's like,
well,

1417
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:13,630
yeah,
obviously,

1418
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:14,673
you know,
because you have to be quite a bit like 

1419
01:22:16,481 --> 01:22:17,314
you and you have to be quite a bit like 
you even if you're not so that you can 

1420
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:21,280
get along.
Right?

1421
01:22:21,281 --> 01:22:25,960
Everybody sacrifices a tremendous amount
of their individuality to the common,

1422
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,920
to the common motive being that's,
there's a tyrannical element to that.

1423
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,210
But you know,
by the same token,

1424
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:38,590
it's the basis of cooperation and I'm 
the stability of society.

1425
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:39,783
And the,
the final element is how it's often 

1426
01:22:42,551 --> 01:22:43,320
represented,
matt,

1427
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,830
in a masculine manner,
by the way,

1428
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:45,783
society.
And I think that's because our primary 

1429
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:48,634
dorman structures,
given the creatures we are like 

1430
01:22:51,161 --> 01:22:51,994
chimpanzees,
the primary structures of dominance are 

1431
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:55,803
masculine.
And then outside of what's known is the 

1432
01:22:58,961 --> 01:22:59,794
unknown.

1433
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,083
And we always have to contend with that.
And it's wonderful in that it's the 

1434
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:09,484
source of all new things and it's 
terrible in that it's the place where 

1435
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,890
all the things that destabilize you come
from.

1436
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,270
And so this is a good representation or 
no,

1437
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:22,600
not the only one.
So that's the feminine

1438
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:25,003
nature.
That's the masculine order and that's 

1439
01:23:27,111 --> 01:23:32,000
the individual who's destined to suffer 
in the grasp of those two things.

1440
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,453
MMM.

1441
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:45,960
I'll finish this next time.
What have we got here?

1442
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,500
Yep.
All right,

1443
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,980
good enough.
We'll see you next time.

1444
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:59,310
So today to begin with,
we're going to finish

1445
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,040
the last lecture and then with any luck,
we're going to start the next one.

1446
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:07,860
They're thematically linked anyways.
Well you know what?

1447
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:11,700
All the lectures for the next,
well for the whole course,

1448
01:24:11,701 --> 01:24:14,250
hopefully we'll be thematically late to 
some degree.

1449
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,593
Uh,
given that normally they're about the 

1450
01:24:17,191 --> 01:24:18,024
same topic,
but some are more tightly linked than 

1451
01:24:19,801 --> 01:24:21,480
others.
So

1452
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:23,903
I started telling you
last week about this idea of the voyage 

1453
01:24:28,741 --> 01:24:29,574
to the underworld.
And I wanted to tell you a little bit 

1454
01:24:33,571 --> 01:24:34,404
more about that.

1455
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:37,653
You in particular conceptualize the 
voyage to the underworld as a journey 

1456
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:43,014
into the unconscious.
And the unconscious for the 

1457
01:24:46,351 --> 01:24:47,184
psychoanalyst is a place of fantasy and 
dream and implicit presupposition and 

1458
01:24:53,821 --> 01:24:55,410
habit.
And that's all correct.

1459
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:56,070
You know,
we,

1460
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,903
there is an unconscious and
it's perfectly reasonable to 

1461
01:25:00,961 --> 01:25:01,794
conceptualize it that way,
that the big difference I think between 

1462
01:25:03,631 --> 01:25:04,464
the psychoanalysts and the later more 
empirical scientists is that the 

1463
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:11,233
psychoanalysts sort of envisioned your 
psyche as a place of living partial 

1464
01:25:19,411 --> 01:25:24,411
personalities instead of cognitive 
computational systems.

1465
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,553
You know,
that they took into account the fact 

1466
01:25:28,681 --> 01:25:33,030
that you're alive and that the parts of 
you are alive.

1467
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:34,110
And you know,
there's,

1468
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:36,200
there's a neuroscientist named Zack 
[inaudible],

1469
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:40,200
nick,
I don't know how to say his name.

1470
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:42,720
Gaza Nigga.
That's wrong.

1471
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,550
Is that cause I had to go,
yeah,

1472
01:25:44,551 --> 01:25:46,230
I think that's it.
Anyways,

1473
01:25:46,590 --> 01:25:49,410
he did some of the earliest experiments 
on split brains.

1474
01:25:49,860 --> 01:25:52,410
And so sometimes if you have intractable
epilepsy,

1475
01:25:52,411 --> 01:25:54,850
which I wouldn't recommend by the way.
Um,

1476
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:56,813
one of the surgical procedures for 
mediating its negative effects is 

1477
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:01,854
something called a,
you cut the corpus callosum and it's 

1478
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,533
very large,
very large structure in the brain that 

1479
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,620
connects the two separate hemispheres.
And you know,

1480
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,880
it's not obvious why we have two 
separate hemispheres,

1481
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:16,610
although I'll tell you a little bit 
about why I think it is.

1482
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:19,940
But anyways,
they do communicate and Uhh,

1483
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,360
what Kazana Gha
demonstrated was that you could tell one

1484
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:29,630
hemisphere something without the other 
one knowing

1485
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:31,993
that both hemispheres we're conscious 
and that the consciousness was somewhat 

1486
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:37,730
independent.
It really strange.

1487
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:40,100
It's very interest.
Makes very interesting readings,

1488
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,570
reading,
you know,

1489
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:45,350
because it suggests that fragments of 
ourselves,

1490
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:46,184
you can think of,
you have fragments of yourself within 

1491
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:50,920
you that are like low resolution 
representations of you,

1492
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:51,980
you know,
and the,

1493
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:55,100
and the psychoanalysts would think of 
those more as they're kind of like,

1494
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:56,900
they're kind of like one I giants.

1495
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,733
That might be a way of thinking about it
if you were thinking about it in a 

1496
01:26:59,361 --> 01:27:00,194
fantastical way.
So there's the angry you and you know 

1497
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,550
you've all come in contact with the 
angry you.

1498
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:08,773
It's a rather rigid.
That's the first thing you might say 

1499
01:27:10,821 --> 01:27:13,340
about it.
It's impulsive and short term.

1500
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:14,413
It doesn't think much about the past 
unless it's bad things about whoever 

1501
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:19,094
you're angry at,
in which case it thinks about them a 

1502
01:27:20,871 --> 01:27:21,704
lot.
It's not too concerned with longterm 

1503
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,260
future consequences and mostly at wants 
to be right.

1504
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:29,563
And you know when angry you disappears 
and normal you assuming such a thing 

1505
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,340
exists,
reappears,

1506
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,750
you can be perfectly shocked about how 
angry you behaved.

1507
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,500
And in fact sometimes if angry you 
really gets out of hand like it might in

1508
01:27:48,231 --> 01:27:49,064
a battle and a war,
it might do things that you just can't 

1509
01:27:52,881 --> 01:27:54,200
imagine you would do.

1510
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,603
And under those circumstances you can 
reveal parts of yourself to yourself 

1511
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:01,543
that are so foreign and so horrifying 
that it will leave you with post 

1512
01:28:08,271 --> 01:28:11,960
traumatic stress disorder because it is 
the case that

1513
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,353
many,
but not all people who suffer from post 

1514
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:21,050
traumatic stress disorder,
especially if it's battlefield related,

1515
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:22,753
get it because of something they did 
rather than something they saw or 

1516
01:28:26,121 --> 01:28:29,870
something that happened to them.
And that's really worth thinking about.

1517
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:30,763
You know,
I mean there's a lot of weird potential 

1518
01:28:32,541 --> 01:28:33,374
nested inside people and you know,
you don't see it under normal 

1519
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:38,180
circumstances because the circumstances 
are normal.

1520
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:39,823
And part of the reason that we liked the
circumstances to be normal is precisely 

1521
01:28:45,651 --> 01:28:50,090
so that we don't see those parts of 
people we don't want to see.

1522
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:54,080
And that's really worth knowing.
It's really worth knowing because

1523
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:56,563
that's why people are so identified with
their culture and why they need a 

1524
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:00,950
culture.

1525
01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:01,783
You know,
like the terror management theorists 

1526
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:03,743
types,
they kind of think of culture as a 

1527
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,030
mechanism that inhibits anxiety and they
think about it psychologically.

1528
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:10,670
Like it's,
it's something inside your,

1529
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,730
your head,
let's say.

1530
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:15,390
Um,
and it gives meaning to events and stops

1531
01:29:15,391 --> 01:29:19,860
you from collapsing into chaos and 
protects you from death anxiety.

1532
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:22,710
But
that isn't,

1533
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,660
that's not right.
It's sort of right.

1534
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,633
But that isn't what your culture is.
Your culture is a set of value Laden 

1535
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:35,001
presuppositions that you orient yourself
in the world that match the set of Value

1536
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,600
Laden presuppositions that everyone in 
your culture has and acts out.

1537
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,733
And so what that means is that when you 
believe something and you're among your 

1538
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:50,700
own people,
you believe something implicitly.

1539
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:53,070
It's the way you look at the world.
It's the way you act things out.

1540
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:55,770
You Act about,
everyone expects you to act the belt.

1541
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,360
They're happy about it,
in fact.

1542
01:29:57,361 --> 01:30:00,180
So there's a match between what you're 
doing,

1543
01:30:00,181 --> 01:30:03,180
what you see and what you're doing and 
what other people expect.

1544
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:06,150
And it's that match that regulates your 
emotions.

1545
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:09,570
It's not the belief system,
it's the match.

1546
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:11,273
And so part of the reason that people 
are so tied to their cultural identity 

1547
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:20,660
is because their cultural identity 
regulates their emotions.

1548
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:24,390
And in a profound way,
like this is no joke.

1549
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,253
You know?
I mean,

1550
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:30,410
one of the things that stabilizes human 
nervous systems is imagine that you have

1551
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:34,620
a domain of competence.
There's many domains of competence.

1552
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:37,500
Of course in some of those domains 
you're completely incompetent,

1553
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:40,560
but they met me not matter because you 
don't go into that domain.

1554
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:41,394
So you have some area of specialization 
which you might think of as your 

1555
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:45,600
subtribe,
you know,

1556
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,523
your university students.
And so some of you are lower status by 

1557
01:30:49,651 --> 01:30:50,484
the rules of the university game and 
some of you are higher status by the 

1558
01:30:53,911 --> 01:30:56,130
rules of the university game by the 
tribe.

1559
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,740
And so the higher status people tend to 
be the ones who,

1560
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,770
um,
fit into the academic environment,

1561
01:31:01,771 --> 01:31:02,500
you know,
and,

1562
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:07,500
and find it conducive to their mode of 
being and all who also do well and their

1563
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:11,520
serotonin levels rise.
And you know,

1564
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:16,640
the neurochemicals that moderate mood 
particularly are serotonergic.

1565
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,460
It's Serotonin,
it's lots of other things.

1566
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:22,560
It's an over simplification.
But that'll do for now.

1567
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,460
As you become dominant in a hierarchy,
your serotonin levels rise.

1568
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,980
And what that means is that happy things
make you happier and sad things make you

1569
01:31:31,981 --> 01:31:34,380
less sad.
It tunes your nervous system.

1570
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,560
So if you're down at the bottom of the 
hierarchy and you're failing,

1571
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:38,394
it's like,
hey,

1572
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:42,870
hardly anything makes you happy and 
everything makes you nervous and it's no

1573
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:45,540
wonder because it's just not very good 
down there.

1574
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:49,240
So the,
the,

1575
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:50,233
the societal structure which,
which is an elaborated dominance 

1576
01:31:52,861 --> 01:31:53,694
hierarchy,
regulates your emotions because of the 

1577
01:31:57,181 --> 01:31:58,014
match between your expectations and 
behaviors of the people within that 

1578
01:32:00,611 --> 01:32:01,444
structure.

1579
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:05,890
And then your position within the 
hierarchy regulates the rate ratio.

1580
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:08,860
Let's say I'm the intensity between 
positive and negative emotion.

1581
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:14,100
So you mass with people's status at your
peril and you disrupt their culture.

1582
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:20,640
They don't like that and no wonder 
because when it's disrupted,

1583
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:23,830
they fall into chaos and chaos isn't 
just anxiety.

1584
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:25,263
My anxiety is bad enough,
but it's not just anxiety because when 

1585
01:32:28,661 --> 01:32:31,240
you fall into chaos,
when things fall apart for you,

1586
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,173
of course you're uncertain and anxious 
because you don't know what the hell is 

1587
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:40,090
going on and you don't know where you 
are and you don't know what to do.

1588
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,110
That's anxiety provoking and maybe you 
can't even understand your past properly

1589
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:44,710
anymore.
That,

1590
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:46,750
as I said,
that happens when people get betrayed,

1591
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:51,520
and so you fall into this state where 
nothing is certain.

1592
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:54,250
The way you construe the world isn't 
certain,

1593
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,503
and even the way the world is is no 
longer certain because you don't know 

1594
01:32:58,601 --> 01:33:01,420
how to act or your actions aren't 
working.

1595
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:04,870
And so the world is presenting itself as
something that's chaotic.

1596
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:05,763
It's not just psychological.
The chaos is a weird intermingling of 

1597
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:12,780
the chaotic world and the chaotic self.
I mean,

1598
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:14,530
that's what happens when you get 
unemployed.

1599
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:18,790
It's like it's devastating.
It's devastating to people.

1600
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:20,291
And if you could say,
well,

1601
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:21,550
that's psychological.
It's like,

1602
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:22,384
well,
yeah,

1603
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:23,613
but they're unemployed.
That makes the world far more 

1604
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:30,430
incomprehensible and uncertain.
It's not just psychological,

1605
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:31,533
it's psychological and that's bad,
but it's also real and that's even 

1606
01:33:34,661 --> 01:33:36,970
worse.
And then those two things can spiral,

1607
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:37,923
which they often do because you know,
if you don't set your expectations 

1608
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:42,994
properly for a job search and assume 
that you're going to get 49 rejections 

1609
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:51,460
for every interview,
which you really need to know because if

1610
01:33:51,461 --> 01:33:54,250
you get 49 rejections,
it's not because you're useless.

1611
01:33:54,251 --> 01:33:58,900
It's because of the baseline for 
rejection is 98% and that's okay because

1612
01:33:58,901 --> 01:34:03,901
the base rate for rejection for 
everything is 98% no matter what you do.

1613
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:05,493
But you need to know that so that you 
don't feel that it's like something 

1614
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:08,434
wrong with you.
And of course you only have to get it 

1615
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:14,230
right once that,
and you have a job that's a lottery,

1616
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:16,360
but you have to set yourself up.
You have to think,

1617
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:17,830
okay,
well I'm going to look for a job,

1618
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:22,120
I need to s how many resumes can I 
tolerate sending out a day?

1619
01:34:22,740 --> 01:34:23,573
You know,
it has to be enough so you don't feel 

1620
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:25,024
like a useless moron and it can't be so 
many that you're overwhelmed by the 

1621
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,730
burden.
So,

1622
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:33,490
and I help people do this sort of thing 
all the time.

1623
01:34:33,491 --> 01:34:34,324
So maybe you decide,
well you're going to send out 10 a day 

1624
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:40,150
and you're going to work two hours on it
and it's going to take six months.

1625
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,213
And then you know you've got your 
parameters set properly and you would 

1626
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:48,220
know what to expect in the world and 
your emotions are regulated.

1627
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:52,510
And so,
but the state of being unemployed,

1628
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:55,930
it doesn't just produce psychological 
consequences.

1629
01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:57,603
So the,
the distinction between the psyche in 

1630
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:02,060
the world in some sense is quite 
arbitrary.

1631
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,403
And the psychoanalyst,
I think it err too much on the side of 

1632
01:35:07,371 --> 01:35:08,204
the subject.
They tend to think that too much of you 

1633
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:13,070
is inside of you and too little of you 
is outside of you.

1634
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:18,071
And part of the reason I believe that is
because of my clinical experience.

1635
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:22,250
I love the psychoanalyst Matt.
They're brilliant,

1636
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:23,750
they're brilliant,
they're deep.

1637
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:28,790
They grapple with real problems.
Like with the problems.

1638
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,970
When people have real problems and I 
mean profound problems,

1639
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:33,013
they're really profound moral problems.
They're problems of good and evil 

1640
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:36,710
really.
You know,

1641
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:37,544
there are things going on in their 
family that are so terrible that well 

1642
01:35:41,150 --> 01:35:43,760
that there are,
there are some times fatal,

1643
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:45,230
you know,
lie upon,

1644
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:49,430
lie upon,
lie upon lie for decades and decades and

1645
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:50,900
decades.
It's awful.

1646
01:35:58,180 --> 01:35:59,980
And that's not exactly inside them.

1647
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,233
Okay.

1648
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:05,460
It's out there in the world and lots of 
the people that I see,

1649
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:11,300
very famous critic of psychology,
I can't remember his name,

1650
01:36:12,001 --> 01:36:12,834
but I probably will
criticize the practice of psychology 

1651
01:36:17,101 --> 01:36:22,101
quite effectively in the believe in the 
early sixties the myth of mental illness

1652
01:36:22,681 --> 01:36:25,890
by Thomas Sas as zed,
a s zed.

1653
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:27,143
It's classic.
You should read it if you're interested 

1654
01:36:28,981 --> 01:36:31,100
in psychology,
read it like it's,

1655
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:31,943
it's a classic.
And he basically said most people have 

1656
01:36:34,981 --> 01:36:37,590
problems in living.
They don't have psychological problems.

1657
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,080
And so I've experienced,
despite my love for the psychoanalysts,

1658
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:44,543
very frequently what I'm doing as a 
therapist is helping people have a life 

1659
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,820
that would work.
You know,

1660
01:36:50,821 --> 01:36:54,120
and you can parameterize that.
It's like,

1661
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,193
what do you need?
How about some friends that can feel 

1662
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,273
kind of like that?
How about an intimate relationship with 

1663
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:03,180
someone that you can trust that maybe 
has a future?

1664
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,313
That'd be good.
How about a career that puts you in a 

1665
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:06,993
dominance hierarchy somewhere?
So at least you've got some possibility 

1666
01:37:10,411 --> 01:37:13,170
of rising,
some possibility of stabilizing yourself

1667
01:37:13,380 --> 01:37:18,210
and our schedule and a routine because 
no one can live without a routine.

1668
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:21,120
You just forget that if you guys don't 
have a routine,

1669
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:22,643
I would recommend like you get one going
because you cannot be mentally healthy 

1670
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:27,474
without a routine.
You need to pick a time to get up 

1671
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:30,833
whatever time you want,
but pick one and stick to it because 

1672
01:37:33,211 --> 01:37:34,044
otherwise you disregulate your circadian
rhythms and they regulate your mood and 

1673
01:37:39,631 --> 01:37:41,070
eat something.
In the morning.

1674
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,520
I had lots of clients who've had anxiety
disorders.

1675
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:47,010
I had one client who was literally 
starving,

1676
01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:49,570
very smart girl,
cheat.

1677
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,413
There was very little that she liked.
She kind of tried to subsist on like 

1678
01:37:52,890 --> 01:37:54,960
half a cup of rice a day.
She came to me and said,

1679
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:56,910
I have no energy.
I come home.

1680
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:59,580
All I want to do is watch the same movie
over and over.

1681
01:37:59,581 --> 01:38:01,470
What?
Like is that weird?

1682
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,940
And I thought,
well,

1683
01:38:02,941 --> 01:38:04,350
it depends on how hard you work.
You know,

1684
01:38:04,351 --> 01:38:06,720
it's a little weird,
but whatever.

1685
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:09,450
It's familiar,
you're looking for comfort.

1686
01:38:09,660 --> 01:38:10,493
So I did an analysis of her diet.
It's like three quarters of a cup of 

1687
01:38:14,671 --> 01:38:16,650
rice.
It's like you're starving.

1688
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,110
Eat something,
you know,

1689
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:26,000
you'll feel better.
So she modified her diet and you're all,

1690
01:38:26,001 --> 01:38:28,340
our anxiety went away and she had some 
energy.

1691
01:38:28,341 --> 01:38:29,600
It's like,
yeah,

1692
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:35,480
you go out to eat.
So a schedule,

1693
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:38,210
that's a good thing man.
Your brain will thank you for it.

1694
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:41,840
It will stabilize your nervous system 
when it's a bit of a plan.

1695
01:38:41,841 --> 01:38:44,120
That's a good thing.
You need a career.

1696
01:38:44,121 --> 01:38:46,550
You need something productive to do with
your time.

1697
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:50,390
You need to regulate your use of drugs 
and alcohol.

1698
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:53,930
Most particularly alcohol.
Cause that does even a lot of people.

1699
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,333
Um,

1700
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:59,330
he knew your family,
like the family,

1701
01:38:59,331 --> 01:39:02,780
you have your parents and all that.
It'd be nice if you all got along,

1702
01:39:02,781 --> 01:39:04,700
you could work on that.
That's a good thing to work on.

1703
01:39:04,701 --> 01:39:07,160
And then you know,
you probably need children at some point

1704
01:39:07,161 --> 01:39:10,790
and that's life.
That's what life is.

1705
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,250
And if you're missing,
you know,

1706
01:39:13,251 --> 01:39:17,720
you may have a good reason to not be 
operating on one of those dimensions.

1707
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:19,723
It's not mandatory.
But I can tell you that if you're not 

1708
01:39:22,371 --> 01:39:26,000
operating reasonably well on four,
I think I mentioned six,

1709
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:29,120
if you're not operating reasonably well 
on at least three of them,

1710
01:39:30,200 --> 01:39:35,120
there's no way you're going to be 
psychologically thriving.

1711
01:39:35,930 --> 01:39:38,990
And that's more pragmatic in some sense 
than psychological,

1712
01:39:38,991 --> 01:39:41,090
right?
Human beings have a nature.

1713
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:44,210
There's things we need.
And if we have them,

1714
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,370
well that's good.
And if we don't have them,

1715
01:39:46,371 --> 01:39:47,780
well then we feel the lack.

1716
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,213
So behaviorists,
behavioral psychologists concentrate a 

1717
01:39:52,101 --> 01:39:54,440
lot more on that sort of thing.
You know,

1718
01:39:54,441 --> 01:39:57,170
it's practical.
It's like strategizing,

1719
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:59,980
make a career plan,
figure out how to negotiate,

1720
01:39:59,981 --> 01:40:02,570
cause that's bloody important.
Figuring out how to say what you need,

1721
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:04,910
figure out how to tell the truth to 
people,

1722
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:10,160
figure out how to listen to your partner
in particular.

1723
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:11,413
Because if you listen to them,
they will actually tell you what they 

1724
01:40:14,541 --> 01:40:15,374
want.
And sometimes you can give it to them 

1725
01:40:17,001 --> 01:40:17,834
and maybe they'll return the favor.
And if you practice that for like 15 

1726
01:40:20,751 --> 01:40:23,870
years,
well then maybe you're constantly giving

1727
01:40:23,871 --> 01:40:25,970
each other what you want.
Well Hooray.

1728
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:27,223
That would be good.
And then there's two of you under most 

1729
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:35,011
circumstances and it's better to have 
two brains than one because people think

1730
01:40:35,841 --> 01:40:37,850
differently because of their temperament
mostly.

1731
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,163
And so the negotiation is where the 
wisdom arises and it's part of the 

1732
01:40:43,971 --> 01:40:44,804
transformation,
the psychological transformation that's 

1733
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:51,200
attendant on an intimate relationship 
and one of the fundamental purposes of a

1734
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:55,240
longterm intimate relationship.
Anyways,

1735
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:57,400
when that falls apart,
chaos ensues.

1736
01:40:57,401 --> 01:41:02,401
And that's why chaos is represented.
So continually and myths and stories.

1737
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:06,340
And I'm going to walk you through a bit 
of that more today.

1738
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:09,280
Um,
I talked about the story of Jonah.

1739
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:12,190
Now here's something to think about.

1740
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:16,103
The internal representations of language
meaning evolve partly from our pre 

1741
01:41:20,881 --> 01:41:25,110
linguistic ancestor's knowledge of 
social relations like modern monkeys and

1742
01:41:25,111 --> 01:41:25,944
apes.
Our ancestors lived in groups with 

1743
01:41:27,601 --> 01:41:28,434
intricate networks of relationships that
were similar caneously competitive and 

1744
01:41:32,161 --> 01:41:32,994
cooperative.
The demands of social life created 

1745
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:37,440
selective pressures for just the kind of
complex,

1746
01:41:37,441 --> 01:41:38,274
abstract,
conceptual and computational abilities 

1747
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:41,063
that are likely to have proceeded.
The earliest forms of linguistic 

1748
01:41:43,741 --> 01:41:44,574
communication.
Although baboons have concepts and 

1749
01:41:46,981 --> 01:41:50,190
acquire propositional information from 
other animals,

1750
01:41:50,191 --> 01:41:53,070
vocalizations,
they cannot articulate this information.

1751
01:41:53,220 --> 01:41:55,020
They understand dominance,
relationships.

1752
01:41:55,021 --> 01:41:57,570
And matrilineal kinship,
but they have no words for them.

1753
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:02,490
This suggests that the internal 
representation of many concept relations

1754
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:06,240
and actual action sequences does not 
require language.

1755
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:07,223
And that language did not evolve because
it was uniquely suited to representing 

1756
01:42:09,811 --> 01:42:10,940
thought.
Well you,

1757
01:42:10,941 --> 01:42:13,530
you know,
you can think without language.

1758
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:14,753
Well,
take the case of someone who's deaf and 

1759
01:42:16,411 --> 01:42:19,200
mute,
they have no language,

1760
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,990
well,
they can operate in society,

1761
01:42:21,991 --> 01:42:25,470
they learn how to represent other people
and they do that with image.

1762
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:27,173
Now the postmodernists who I
despise would be a reasonable way of 

1763
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,313
putting it,
have this proposition that there's no 

1764
01:42:36,751 --> 01:42:40,020
meaning outside language.
And it's a powerful argument by the way,

1765
01:42:40,021 --> 01:42:41,730
but it's,
it's seriously wrong.

1766
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:43,423
MMM.

1767
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:45,473
There is a meaning network outside of 
language and it's what language is 

1768
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:53,001
grounded in.
And that's this pre verbal comprehension

1769
01:42:53,521 --> 01:42:54,354
of the world.
It's an embodied comprehension of the 

1770
01:42:55,501 --> 01:42:56,750
world.
Animals have it,

1771
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,390
lobsters have it.
You know,

1772
01:43:00,391 --> 01:43:02,940
this particular scientist,
seyfarth

1773
01:43:04,590 --> 01:43:07,170
talks about our shared history with,
you know,

1774
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:08,273
higher primates.
That probably goes back 20 million 

1775
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:12,300
years,
something like that.

1776
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:16,710
We split from the common ancestor with 
chimps about 7 million years ago.

1777
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,190
Um,
but you know,

1778
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,363
lobsters have dominance hierarchies,
they hardly have a nervous system at 

1779
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:25,504
all,
which is partly why they're studied 

1780
01:43:26,171 --> 01:43:27,004
quite extensively.
And so they have a social structure and 

1781
01:43:30,281 --> 01:43:34,690
they understand it.
Like if one lobster Theora lobster to be

1782
01:43:34,691 --> 01:43:35,524
quite a shock to you,
if it happened and you were fighting 

1783
01:43:38,561 --> 01:43:41,560
with another lobster and you lost,
you would remember that.

1784
01:43:41,561 --> 01:43:42,394
And the next time you saw that lobster,
you'd scuttle off somewhere else and 

1785
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,250
you'd know that.
And all the lobsters in an area,

1786
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:49,084
no who's top lobster and who isn't.
And Pop lobster gets the best bloody 

1787
01:43:54,081 --> 01:43:59,081
place to be and the best food.
So this dominance issue,

1788
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:02,330
this cultural issue,
you know,

1789
01:44:02,331 --> 01:44:03,164
the fact that we live in a social 
environment is far deeper than people 

1790
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:09,560
usually consider.
And it's also worth considering and that

1791
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:12,680
this is what you might think of from an 
evolutionary perspective.

1792
01:44:12,681 --> 01:44:13,514
You know,
you think of natural selection as 

1793
01:44:15,051 --> 01:44:17,120
producing evolution,
right?

1794
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:19,940
Well,
random mutation with natural selection.

1795
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:23,480
But here's something to think about.
And Darwin knew this,

1796
01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:25,243
but Darwin was really smart and the 
biologists who followed in his 

1797
01:44:27,801 --> 01:44:29,360
footsteps,
even up to now,

1798
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:33,770
I've only expanded out a fraction of 
what he had to say.

1799
01:44:34,540 --> 01:44:35,373
You know,
he was very interested in sexual 

1800
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:40,190
selection.
Now one of the things about human beings

1801
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:44,390
that's unique is that human females are 
picky maters.

1802
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:46,680
They're choosy.
Uh,

1803
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:47,893
they're also sneaky because you can't 
tell when they're ovulating and without 

1804
01:44:50,391 --> 01:44:52,250
many other female animals,
you know,

1805
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,833
so

1806
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,363
they have hidden ovulation and they're 
choosy and they tend to choose men who 

1807
01:45:00,121 --> 01:45:02,400
are more successful in the dominance 
hierarchy.

1808
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:04,040
Well,
there,

1809
01:45:04,050 --> 01:45:05,550
there is a shock.
I mean,

1810
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:07,890
if you have a choice,
why not?

1811
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:12,840
If you pick someone who's at the bottom 
of the competence hierarchy,

1812
01:45:13,170 --> 01:45:15,360
all that's probably not going to work 
out very well for you.

1813
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:18,570
And since women bear the burden of 
reproduction,

1814
01:45:19,640 --> 01:45:20,430
okay,

1815
01:45:20,430 --> 01:45:21,263
it's perfectly reasonable for them to 
search out someone who's going to be 

1816
01:45:23,641 --> 01:45:25,290
helpful.
So productive,

1817
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:27,540
fair,
generous.

1818
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:29,970
And you know,
when you think of a dominance hierarchy,

1819
01:45:29,971 --> 01:45:30,631
you might think,
well,

1820
01:45:30,631 --> 01:45:34,260
it's the powerful guy,
the aggressive guy say that rises to the

1821
01:45:34,261 --> 01:45:36,240
top of the dominance hierarchy.
And that's not true.

1822
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:40,020
It's not even true among chimps.
Like you can get a chimp tyrant.

1823
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:41,213
But then what happens is other chimps 
gang up on him and tear him to pieces 

1824
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:47,040
and they don't do it nicely.
They don't do it nicely.

1825
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:51,390
And the chimps that tend to maintain 
their dominance for long periods of time

1826
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,433
have a pretty wide network of friends,
roughly speaking with whom they engage 

1827
01:45:55,860 --> 01:45:58,290
in reciprocal interactions like 
grooming.

1828
01:45:58,470 --> 01:45:59,303
And they actually pay a lot of positive 
attention to the female chimps who have 

1829
01:46:01,741 --> 01:46:02,970
their own hierarchy,
by the way,

1830
01:46:03,180 --> 01:46:04,470
and to the their offspring.

1831
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:06,960
So they're like baby kissing 
politicians.

1832
01:46:07,470 --> 01:46:11,400
And so the idea that it's raw power that
produces dominance is a,

1833
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:14,220
it's just wrong.
It's,

1834
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:15,180
it's wrong.
Now,

1835
01:46:15,181 --> 01:46:16,290
you know,
tyrants,

1836
01:46:16,291 --> 01:46:17,124
you know,
it's pretty damn up unstable business 

1837
01:46:18,841 --> 01:46:19,674
being a tyrant.
There's lots of people who want to kill 

1838
01:46:21,031 --> 01:46:21,930
you.
Plus,

1839
01:46:21,931 --> 01:46:22,764
you know,
you tend to rule over something 

1840
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:27,410
approximating hell.
So maybe that's the worst.

1841
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:30,660
Better than being a subject in hell.
But it's not much better.

1842
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:35,250
So anyways,
so this social social now,

1843
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,590
so what this means,
think about this for a minute.

1844
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:40,410
So imagine,
you know,

1845
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,363
imagine what I'm telling you.
Bear some vague resemblance to the 

1846
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:44,124
truth.
I think there's quite a lot of evidence 

1847
01:46:45,331 --> 01:46:47,730
for it from a,
from a biological perspective.

1848
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:49,303
Um,
I mean this choosy mating thing occurs 

1849
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,520
with lots of species.
You know,

1850
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:57,120
there's this bird called the bower bird.
You've got to look up bowerbirds man,

1851
01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:00,720
those things are,
you just can't even believe they exist.

1852
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,793
And so the male bowerbird,
he makes this really complicated nest 

1853
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:06,660
that's close to the ground.
He weaves it.

1854
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:09,240
It's really quite nice.
You couldn't make one.

1855
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:10,703
So,
and then he sweeps the US the yard in 

1856
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:14,874
front of the nest and then he runs 
around the forest or flies because he 

1857
01:47:18,151 --> 01:47:23,151
has a bird finding pretty things.
So maybe he'll find a nice collection of

1858
01:47:23,581 --> 01:47:24,414
red leaves.
And so then he'll take the red leaves 

1859
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:29,460
one by one and fly back to his front 
yard and make a little square.

1860
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,540
You know,
he's a bird,

1861
01:47:30,541 --> 01:47:33,700
so it's not a great square,
but it makes a little patch of red.

1862
01:47:33,701 --> 01:47:36,780
And he takes a look at that and then he 
goes off and find something blue.

1863
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:38,370
And,
and he decorates,

1864
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:39,204
it makes a little piece of abstract art 
and the front of his nest and a lot of 

1865
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:45,090
male bowerbirds do this all at the same 
time.

1866
01:47:45,630 --> 01:47:46,463
And so then the females come along,
they hop on something nearby and they 

1867
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:51,630
kind of look at it like this,
checking it out.

1868
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:55,140
And if they're happy with it,
well then things proceed.

1869
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:55,974
But if they're not,
they'd fly off to someone else's piece 

1870
01:47:57,601 --> 01:47:58,434
of abstract art.
And if a of mail piece of art is 

1871
01:48:01,951 --> 01:48:05,600
rejected by like three females in a row,
he gets irritated,

1872
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:09,210
brushes it all off with his wing,
and then he makes another one.

1873
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:11,850
It's like God,
well,

1874
01:48:11,851 --> 01:48:15,090
they obviously have a sentence of very 
well developed sense of beauty.

1875
01:48:15,570 --> 01:48:16,830
It's so cool.
You know?

1876
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:20,970
And I guess the idea is that who knows 
what the hell,

1877
01:48:20,971 --> 01:48:24,940
the idea is the female birds,
like artistic males,

1878
01:48:24,941 --> 01:48:25,774
something like that.
But if you're thinking about it 

1879
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:27,864
biologically,
maybe it's an indication of 

1880
01:48:29,161 --> 01:48:30,630
intelligence,
right?

1881
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:32,610
It's a marker of intelligence,
you know?

1882
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:37,611
And it's certainly the case that female 
humans prefer creative meant so.

1883
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,583
And the wonder,
of course we wouldn't be creative if 

1884
01:48:43,321 --> 01:48:45,990
that wasn't the case.
So then imagine that there's two primary

1885
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:46,824
forces of evolutionary selection 
operating on us and they're not really 

1886
01:48:50,281 --> 01:48:52,650
the natural world,
which is what people always think,

1887
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:53,484
like the environment,
you know that the animals and the trees 

1888
01:48:55,891 --> 01:48:59,010
and nature,
but it isn't nature that selected us.

1889
01:48:59,490 --> 01:49:00,630
It's two other things.
Well,

1890
01:49:00,631 --> 01:49:04,680
partly it's to other things.
So one is the dominance hierarchy,

1891
01:49:04,681 --> 01:49:09,681
the male dominance hierarchy is one is 
the primary mechanisms of selection.

1892
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:13,350
So it's like,
well women are faced with a hard choice,

1893
01:49:13,351 --> 01:49:14,670
which guy to go after,
right?

1894
01:49:14,671 --> 01:49:16,260
That's a hard choice.
Well,

1895
01:49:16,261 --> 01:49:20,010
so they do the same thing that people do
with the stock market.

1896
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,113
They outsource the cognitive problem,
the computational problem to the male 

1897
01:49:24,781 --> 01:49:25,614
dominance hierarchy.
Then they just let the mail cirque 

1898
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:30,930
themselves out however they're going to,
and then they peel from the top.

1899
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,153
And so what that means is the dominant 
male dominance hierarchy itself is a 

1900
01:49:35,351 --> 01:49:38,100
selection mechanism because if you fail 
at it,

1901
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:43,520
then you don't leave any offspring.
And so what that means is,

1902
01:49:43,601 --> 01:49:48,310
at least in part,
is that we have adapted to be and better

1903
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:53,380
at attaining status in dominance.
Hierarchies over God only knows how long

1904
01:49:53,381 --> 01:49:55,870
a period of time.
And that doesn't mean just power,

1905
01:49:57,010 --> 01:49:57,843
you know,
it might mean cognitive flexibility 

1906
01:49:58,991 --> 01:50:03,310
because you could imagine dorman is 
hierarchy a dominance hierarchy,

1907
01:50:03,311 --> 01:50:05,290
b dominance hierarchy.
See,

1908
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:07,240
okay,
so if like if you're really successful,

1909
01:50:07,241 --> 01:50:09,970
you climb up dominance hierarchy a 
right?

1910
01:50:09,971 --> 01:50:10,804
But you'd be in,
see now if you have land in though is 

1911
01:50:13,391 --> 01:50:14,224
you just be a failure.
So then you could say the ideal human 

1912
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:19,114
being is someone who can climb to the 
top of a dominance hierarchy no matter 

1913
01:50:21,311 --> 01:50:24,130
what the dominance hierarchy is.
Right?

1914
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:26,950
So we've evolved too.

1915
01:50:29,110 --> 01:50:29,943
We've evolved such that success across 
the set of possible dominance 

1916
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:35,434
hierarchies is the target.
And I think that's why we have general 

1917
01:50:38,711 --> 01:50:39,544
intelligence because general 
intelligence is a general problem 

1918
01:50:42,131 --> 01:50:45,880
solving mechanism and it's a single 
factor.

1919
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:48,730
Even like there is intelligence is a 
single factor.

1920
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:53,200
It's not divisible despite what people 
like

1921
01:50:54,790 --> 01:50:59,790
Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner 
falsely claim.

1922
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:04,420
So,
and then from the female perspective,

1923
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:07,143
females are the next gatekeeper.
And that's why they're often mother 

1924
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:10,684
nature.
It took me a long time to figure this 

1925
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:12,424
out.
Why the hell is a nature feminine in 

1926
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:16,510
mythological representations?
He's a very,

1927
01:51:16,511 --> 01:51:17,344
very,
it's extraordinarily common mother 

1928
01:51:19,421 --> 01:51:21,370
nature.
You don't think of father nature,

1929
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:23,560
you think of Mother Nature.
It's like why?

1930
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:25,930
Well,
nature brings forth new forms.

1931
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:27,370
So that's feminine

1932
01:51:30,680 --> 01:51:31,513
and nature selects in fact,
that's the definition of nature from a 

1933
01:51:34,911 --> 01:51:35,744
Darwinian perspective.
Nature is that which selects women 

1934
01:51:39,891 --> 01:51:40,724
select their nature.
And that's partly why far more men than 

1935
01:51:45,741 --> 01:51:49,820
you might think like far more are 
terrified of women.

1936
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:51,583
Because to be rejected as a romantic 
partner by a woman is to be classified 

1937
01:51:59,541 --> 01:52:04,541
as vaguely acceptable.
Lifeform Huh?

1938
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:09,890
No value in propagating it though.
Right?

1939
01:52:09,891 --> 01:52:12,560
So it's a major,
major rejection.

1940
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:16,850
And you know,
I've had dozens of clients and many,

1941
01:52:16,851 --> 01:52:17,684
many people write to me whose primary 
problem is that they're so terrified of 

1942
01:52:21,471 --> 01:52:22,760
women,
they can't even approach them.

1943
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:24,081
Very,
very,

1944
01:52:24,081 --> 01:52:26,120
very common.
So,

1945
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:26,983
all right,
I want to show you this little triangle 

1946
01:52:29,811 --> 01:52:32,120
thing.
This is kind of cool.

1947
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:12,650
10

1948
01:53:40,010 --> 01:53:42,430
okay.
So no,

1949
01:53:42,431 --> 01:53:43,760
no nonverbal.
Right.

1950
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,640
Nonverbal.
So what happened?

1951
01:53:47,290 --> 01:53:48,123
Well,
there's mother triangle I would guess 

1952
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:55,530
and mother triangle has circle as a 
child and triangle

1953
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,980
is maybe a friend but not one that's 
very welcome according to mother and uh,

1954
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:10,403
child circle goes out to try to play 
with triangle child and mother doesn't 

1955
01:54:15,781 --> 01:54:17,730
like that.
So she goes out there and pecks the hell

1956
01:54:17,731 --> 01:54:18,810
out of it.
Out of him,

1957
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:20,363
chase him away,
pushes child circle back into the home 

1958
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:26,723
and goes into the home.
And then child circle isn't very happy 

1959
01:54:29,371 --> 01:54:30,204
about that.
It's running around causing trouble and 

1960
01:54:32,411 --> 01:54:33,244
he manages to escape and then bad child 
triangle shows up and they played 

1961
01:54:37,641 --> 01:54:38,474
together and run around and run around 
and run around and run around with 

1962
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:42,880
mother chasing them.
And then they will,

1963
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,670
maybe they elope,
who knows?

1964
01:54:45,390 --> 01:54:48,300
And then mother triangle has a fit and 
blows down the house.

1965
01:54:48,390 --> 01:54:49,950
Right.
So obvious,

1966
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:53,003
reasonable.
Would you consider that a reasonable 

1967
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:59,900
story about what happened?
Perhaps you had other interpretations,

1968
01:55:00,601 --> 01:55:03,720
but I suspect they were vaguely along 
that line.

1969
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:05,340
Well,
but the point here,

1970
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,720
and this is the point of this 
experiment,

1971
01:55:06,721 --> 01:55:10,860
is how much information do you need from
which to derive a narrative?

1972
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:14,130
And the answer is like none.
It just,

1973
01:55:14,131 --> 01:55:14,964
it's just immediate.
You can watch some triangles moving 

1974
01:55:17,521 --> 01:55:21,420
around a box and instantly you 
personalize it.

1975
01:55:22,440 --> 01:55:25,680
And that's because that's what you're 
like.

1976
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:31,110
And the reason you're like that is 
because you're environment isn't nature.

1977
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:35,940
Your environment is culture,
your environment is other people,

1978
01:55:36,450 --> 01:55:37,283
other people.
And that was even more true for 

1979
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:41,273
chimpanzees and so forth.
And especially animals had a limited 

1980
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,960
diet like,
like gorillas,

1981
01:55:45,961 --> 01:55:49,160
they pretty much only eat like leaves.
You know what?

1982
01:55:49,161 --> 01:55:51,930
Chimps spends like 12 hours a day 
chewing.

1983
01:55:52,980 --> 01:55:55,050
And that's why they have a gut like 
this.

1984
01:55:55,110 --> 01:55:57,780
It's like you can't eat leaves,
you know,

1985
01:55:57,810 --> 01:55:59,880
have you tried?
They have no nutrition.

1986
01:55:59,881 --> 01:56:00,714
So if you're going to eat leaves,
you have to eat a lot of them and then 

1987
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:06,480
it takes like three months to digest 
them.

1988
01:56:06,630 --> 01:56:09,840
And so what we've done,
and this is pretty cool cause it's we're

1989
01:56:09,841 --> 01:56:12,900
so smart,
is that we've traded gut for brain.

1990
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:14,453
And that's why we're so spelled.
And the way we managed that it appears 

1991
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:20,070
is that we learned how to use fire to 
cook things.

1992
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:23,790
And that meant that we had high quality 
nutrition,

1993
01:56:23,791 --> 01:56:25,260
much higher.
It's easier to digest,

1994
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:27,150
cooked things,
especially meat.

1995
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,583
And so because we invented fire,
we didn't have to have so much in test 

1996
01:56:31,901 --> 01:56:35,130
done and we could spend a little more 
time on the brain.

1997
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,173
So human beings really are fire users.
We invented fire or discovered it or 

1998
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:41,094
whatever.
Man Mastered it at least a couple of 

1999
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:45,390
million years ago,
a long time.

2000
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,830
So that's all pretty cool as far as I'm 
concerned.

2001
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:53,770
So that's partly how you think

2002
01:56:56,300 --> 01:56:59,220
and that's naturally how you think.
You think a certain way.

2003
01:56:59,221 --> 01:57:02,970
And so we'll say that your fundamental 
architecture is social cognitive.

2004
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:05,880
You tend to view the world as if it's 
personified.

2005
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:07,643
And the reason for that is that the 
world in which you emerged as a being 

2006
01:57:11,100 --> 01:57:11,933
was primarily social.
And what you needed to know was who's 

2007
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:17,020
the big primate and who's the little 
primate and who's related to who.

2008
01:57:17,021 --> 01:57:18,360
And you know,
among chimps,

2009
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,450
if a big chimp is threatened by a small 
chimp,

2010
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,603
well you know what,
the big chimp can just tear the small 

2011
01:57:24,691 --> 01:57:25,524
champ apart,
but the big chimp will back off if it 

2012
01:57:29,221 --> 01:57:34,110
knows that the little chimp is 
associated with some really big chimps.

2013
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:35,633
And so the little chimp can bully the 
big chimp because it's part of a 

2014
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:41,820
dominant family.
And that's because the nervous system of

2015
01:57:41,821 --> 01:57:45,630
the big chimp doesn't respond to the 
little chimp like a little chimp.

2016
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:50,340
It responds to the little chimp,
like it's a little champ with four great

2017
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:53,070
monsters attached to it because it's 
true.

2018
01:57:53,790 --> 01:57:54,623
So it's nervous system is actually 
responding to the network around the 

2019
01:57:58,501 --> 01:58:00,870
chimp.
And so that's exactly what you,

2020
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:01,733
well,
it's not exactly what you're like 

2021
01:58:02,161 --> 01:58:04,350
because you're not chimps,
but you know,

2022
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:05,993
it's that kind of platform that 
constitutes the evolutionary 

2023
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:12,300
underpinnings of your psyche.
So what does that mean?

2024
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:14,803
Well,
it means this is like perfectly fine to 

2025
01:58:16,701 --> 01:58:17,534
us,
right?

2026
01:58:17,960 --> 01:58:20,480
Can I automate things?
We can have rabbits are people,

2027
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,820
no problem.
We'll go along with that.

2028
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:28,290
You remember Roger Rabbit?
I presume most of you've watched that.

2029
01:58:28,440 --> 01:58:30,840
So this is the detective who's name I 
don't remember.

2030
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:35,450
He has to go to toontown cause there's 
cartoons and there's people and you know

2031
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:38,640
they share the same world and you can go
to toontown.

2032
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:41,890
Although it's kind of annoying because 
cartoon figures are kind of annoying.

2033
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,610
Like there's slapstick types and so he's
a very happy to be there.

2034
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:47,080
And this is what it looks like.

2035
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:48,880
Okay.

2036
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:50,510
Right.
Everything's animated,

2037
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,380
meaning alive.
Anima means soul by the way.

2038
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:59,540
So everything has a personality and you 
know when you're reading books to kids,

2039
01:59:00,170 --> 01:59:03,170
the sun has a personality,
train has a personality,

2040
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:05,690
jet has a personality.
It doesn't matter what it is.

2041
01:59:05,691 --> 01:59:08,570
It has a personality.
And that's because the child is learning

2042
01:59:08,571 --> 01:59:11,300
to understand the world using the 
architecture,

2043
01:59:11,301 --> 01:59:12,770
social,
cognitive architecture.

2044
01:59:12,800 --> 01:59:13,633
And so,
and the thing that's really interesting 

2045
01:59:14,841 --> 01:59:16,640
about that,
that's just blows me away.

2046
01:59:17,210 --> 01:59:18,043
You know,
evolution is conservative and so once 

2047
01:59:19,161 --> 01:59:21,590
it's produced something,
it has to build on it.

2048
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:25,220
It's like dos,
the operating system.

2049
01:59:25,221 --> 01:59:28,130
It's like really?
It's still there.

2050
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,053
If I remember correctly,
under windows 10 you can't get rid of 

2051
01:59:31,461 --> 01:59:32,294
the damn thing because it's part,
it's part of the structure now and it's 

2052
01:59:36,261 --> 01:59:37,094
like the keyboards we use,
which were actually designed to slow 

2053
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:42,710
typers down because with mechanical type
writers,

2054
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:44,570
if you type too fast,
the keys would jam.

2055
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:45,613
So they divine device,
the keyboard to slow you down and we 

2056
01:59:48,411 --> 01:59:50,300
still use it,
which is stupid.

2057
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:55,900
You know you want the high frequency 
letters close to your middle fingers.

2058
01:59:56,660 --> 01:59:57,493
That isn't what it's like at all.
But we can't change it because everyone 

2059
01:59:59,331 --> 02:00:01,760
uses it.
So your body plan,

2060
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,160
that thing has been around a long time 
man.

2061
02:00:04,550 --> 02:00:08,000
If you look at mammals particularly,
but even lizards,

2062
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:12,860
there's so much like us in their,
in their skeletal structure that is just

2063
02:00:12,861 --> 02:00:14,030
mind boggling.
You know?

2064
02:00:14,031 --> 02:00:15,710
And we're all variants of the same

2065
02:00:17,610 --> 02:00:22,610
symmetrical four legged mouth here,
structure.

2066
02:00:24,570 --> 02:00:26,550
And so you have to build to what you 
have.

2067
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:28,980
And if you have a social cognitive 
architecture,

2068
02:00:28,981 --> 02:00:29,814
then you have to first understand the 
world through the social cognitive 

2069
02:00:32,731 --> 02:00:35,550
categories.
And what so bloody strange about that is

2070
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:36,384
it actually seems to work.
We actually seem to develop a coherent 

2071
02:00:39,841 --> 02:00:44,190
representation of being,
I would say of being that's not the same

2072
02:00:44,191 --> 02:00:46,890
as nature.
It's not the same as the world.

2073
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:49,920
Because when we think of the world,
we think of the objective world.

2074
02:00:50,370 --> 02:00:52,260
And I'm not talking about the objective 
world,

2075
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:54,480
I'm talking about the world of human 
experience.

2076
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:55,673
And we see that through social cognitive
filter and it makes perfect sense to us 

2077
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:01,440
and it works.
That's so strange.

2078
02:01:01,740 --> 02:01:02,573
So anyways,
everything's got this animated nature 

2079
02:01:05,611 --> 02:01:08,040
and we don't have a problem with that.
In fact,

2080
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:09,630
we actually find it quite fun.

2081
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:12,043
You know,
people go visit the Disney toontown and 

2082
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:19,200
participate in it 10 and have fun with 
it.

2083
02:01:19,201 --> 02:01:23,640
And so that shows you as well how,
how natural it is for us to,

2084
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,530
to view things this way.
You know,

2085
02:01:25,531 --> 02:01:27,960
cars have faces,
right?

2086
02:01:28,950 --> 02:01:29,783
Designers know that.
They know that people don't want a car 

2087
02:01:32,461 --> 02:01:33,294
with three headlights because like who 
wants to be associated with a three odd 

2088
02:01:37,221 --> 02:01:38,490
monster?
No one.

2089
02:01:38,850 --> 02:01:39,683
It's like two eyes.
That's something you could be 

2090
02:01:41,121 --> 02:01:46,121
comfortable with.
And so cars have faces and like a bmw is

2091
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,780
the new one.
So they really look Cadillac,

2092
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:50,810
you know,
and they have sexy curves.

2093
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,550
They do,
they do.

2094
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:54,470
There's been MRI studies of that.
So,

2095
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:55,783
um,
if you showed men photographs of 

2096
02:01:58,730 --> 02:02:00,440
attractive women looking directly at 
them,

2097
02:02:00,441 --> 02:02:02,960
there's a little part of their brain 
called the nucleus accumbens that lights

2098
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:05,660
up because to have someone look directly
at you,

2099
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:07,910
especially if they have like a smile,
is,

2100
02:02:08,010 --> 02:02:10,400
is interpreted as an invitation to 
approach.

2101
02:02:10,940 --> 02:02:11,773
And women,
they have the same damn problem because 

2102
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,820
with women,
because if you go into drugstores say,

2103
02:02:15,821 --> 02:02:18,410
and you look at women's magazines,
they're all the same.

2104
02:02:18,890 --> 02:02:21,020
They've all evolved to the same 
endpoint.

2105
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:23,120
They all have an attractive woman on 
them,

2106
02:02:23,210 --> 02:02:25,460
all of them.
And they're looking right out.

2107
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:26,443
And so when women see that,
they actually see it as something to 

2108
02:02:28,431 --> 02:02:30,470
with approach,
it's an ideal.

2109
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,541
And now,
you know,

2110
02:02:31,541 --> 02:02:32,374
when people say that those beauty ideals
are oppressive to women and all ideals 

2111
02:02:36,441 --> 02:02:38,690
are oppressive,
but the empirical research,

2112
02:02:38,691 --> 02:02:42,650
some of it done here suggests that 
interacting with those images

2113
02:02:44,190 --> 02:02:45,023
helps the performance,
the psychological function of helping 

2114
02:02:48,151 --> 02:02:52,220
the woman equate herself with the ideal.
And in most cases that actually produces

2115
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:54,480
a po and elevation in mood.
And you know,

2116
02:02:54,481 --> 02:02:55,314
think about it,
you're really going to go to the 

2117
02:02:56,191 --> 02:02:57,024
magazine store when you're just looking 
for something to do and you're going to 

2118
02:02:59,371 --> 02:03:02,910
buy something that makes you feel 
depressed and oppressed.

2119
02:03:03,210 --> 02:03:03,691
It's like,
no,

2120
02:03:03,691 --> 02:03:06,240
you're not going to do that.
Magazines that do that to you,

2121
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:09,240
they will die because no one will buy 
them.

2122
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:12,030
And there's a reason they all turned out
the same way.

2123
02:03:12,031 --> 02:03:14,490
It's like they're just responding to 
demand.

2124
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:15,893
So

2125
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:19,433
yeah,

2126
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,950
faces,
Oh yes.

2127
02:03:21,951 --> 02:03:23,990
With regards to the sexy curves.
So

2128
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:28,190
woman who looks upon picture looking 
right out,

2129
02:03:28,430 --> 02:03:31,700
a man will produce this activation in 
the primary reward system.

2130
02:03:31,820 --> 02:03:34,600
Cocaine produces the same response and 
Sodas,

2131
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:38,780
sports cars,
especially curvy red sports cars.

2132
02:03:39,050 --> 02:03:39,883
And so that's why you often see an 
attractive woman sitting on a curvy red 

2133
02:03:42,321 --> 02:03:45,500
sports car in an ad because it's,
you know,

2134
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:48,770
if there's an ad for beer on the side,
it's like,

2135
02:03:48,890 --> 02:03:50,060
hey,
everything's perfect.

2136
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:51,800
So,
and you know,

2137
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:54,740
those are all primary reward reward 
representations.

2138
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:58,700
And they produce attraction because part
of positive emotion,

2139
02:03:58,701 --> 02:03:59,534
the dopamine dopaminergic Lee mediated 
element and positive emotion is an 

2140
02:04:02,871 --> 02:04:03,704
approach emotion.
It's not a satiation satisfaction 

2141
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:07,790
emotion.
It's all good.

2142
02:04:07,791 --> 02:04:09,650
There's something good here.
I can move towards it.

2143
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:11,930
And that,
that is what happiness is.

2144
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:13,363
That's directly what happiness is.
It's not attaining something because 

2145
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:19,130
that just puts you in a whole new 
problem.

2146
02:04:19,410 --> 02:04:20,930
You've got to figure out what to do 
next.

2147
02:04:22,590 --> 02:04:24,480
All right,
so I suggested to you

2148
02:04:28,830 --> 02:04:29,663
that one of the problems that we have,
the problem I would say is not what the 

2149
02:04:34,861 --> 02:04:37,020
world's made out of,
but how we should be in the,

2150
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:39,960
because we're alive and how we should 
be.

2151
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:40,551
Well,
it's,

2152
02:04:40,551 --> 02:04:41,940
it's,
it's fairly straight forward.

2153
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:46,140
Not so much pain would be good.
That'd be good.

2154
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:47,790
Not Too much anxiety.
Hey,

2155
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:50,170
we're on board for that.
Um,

2156
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,890
little pleasure down then.
Some stability,

2157
02:04:53,480 --> 02:04:55,320
uh,
not dying.

2158
02:04:55,380 --> 02:04:57,360
That's a big one.
That's a big one.

2159
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:00,600
And then let's say from the Darwinian 
perspective,

2160
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:04,050
propagating.
And so that's what we're aimed at.

2161
02:05:04,051 --> 02:05:06,300
And the reason we're aimed at that is 
you just think about this.

2162
02:05:06,301 --> 02:05:11,130
It's so amazing.
So every single one of your,

2163
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:13,980
of the relatives you have in your 
ancestry,

2164
02:05:14,130 --> 02:05:15,420
every single one of them

2165
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:17,833
successfully produced a child who 
successively successfully produced a 

2166
02:05:23,061 --> 02:05:26,840
child all the way back to 3 billion 
years ago.

2167
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:29,113
It's bloody unbelievable.
Like the probability that you exist 

2168
02:05:31,521 --> 02:05:32,354
while it's 100% because there you are,
but the probability of predicting that 

2169
02:05:36,051 --> 02:05:37,520
you would exist,
you know,

2170
02:05:37,521 --> 02:05:38,354
if you tried to predict it,
it's like the chance that the chances 

2171
02:05:41,631 --> 02:05:42,464
that you're here are so infinite 
testable that it's just absolutely mind 

2172
02:05:46,041 --> 02:05:46,874
boggling.
Think about that unbroken sequence of 

2173
02:05:49,401 --> 02:05:52,940
success over literally over billions of 
years.

2174
02:05:53,450 --> 02:05:54,830
God,
it's amazing.

2175
02:05:55,430 --> 02:06:00,230
And so you have to,
obviously you have to think that there's

2176
02:06:00,231 --> 02:06:03,320
a pretty strong proclivity for that to 
happen.

2177
02:06:03,321 --> 02:06:04,154
I mean,
some of them are obviously was 

2178
02:06:04,551 --> 02:06:07,340
necessity,
but not only that,

2179
02:06:07,370 --> 02:06:12,370
I mean it's necessary that impregnated 
females have an infant.

2180
02:06:12,920 --> 02:06:15,230
It isn't necessary that they keep it 
alive.

2181
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:20,800
So you can't account for that continuity
merely from necessity.

2182
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:26,320
You have to interject a least,
a small amount of consideration that the

2183
02:06:26,931 --> 02:06:27,764
care that's associated,
especially with taking care of infants 

2184
02:06:29,931 --> 02:06:30,764
because they're,
you know,

2185
02:06:31,600 --> 02:06:35,060
there are a lot of work that's there to 
tennis.

2186
02:06:35,060 --> 02:06:35,893
It's actually,
I think it's manifested in the 

2187
02:06:37,071 --> 02:06:37,904
personality trait.
Agreeableness cause it looks to me like 

2188
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:41,203
agreeableness is one of the dimensions 
where men and women very most 

2189
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:47,330
substantially agreeableness.
It looks to me like the manifestation of

2190
02:06:47,331 --> 02:06:48,164
the maternal instinct.
Now men can be agreeable to because of 

2191
02:06:50,241 --> 02:06:52,130
course male human beings take care of 
children.

2192
02:06:52,790 --> 02:06:53,623
You know if you're a grizzly bear female
you just chase the damn mail away cause 

2193
02:06:57,441 --> 02:06:59,540
he'll kill your cubs.
That's not so helpful.

2194
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:03,170
But they're not maternal at all.
Quite the contrary.

2195
02:07:03,650 --> 02:07:06,170
But you know human manner are pretty 
damned maternal.

2196
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:08,660
They're not as a maternal is women on 
average,

2197
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:09,703
although some women are less maternal 
than some men because you know the 

2198
02:07:13,641 --> 02:07:16,880
curves overlap but,
but on balance,

2199
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:21,770
how are we in the world where all we're 
already aware of our own vulnerability.

2200
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:25,880
We're aware of our own shortcomings 
let's say.

2201
02:07:26,060 --> 02:07:26,893
And that's,
I think that's partly from being a 

2202
02:07:27,771 --> 02:07:28,604
social being cause people are always 
signaling your shortcomings to you to 

2203
02:07:31,941 --> 02:07:32,774
such a degree that you even signal your 
shortcomings to yourself because while 

2204
02:07:35,621 --> 02:07:37,960
you might as well fix them before 
someone else points them out,

2205
02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:39,003
that's guilt and shame.
You know when Freud called that the 

2206
02:07:41,981 --> 02:07:42,814
Superego,
the superego is kind of like the 

2207
02:07:43,811 --> 02:07:48,250
internalized representation of the 
judgmental father and culture I think is

2208
02:07:48,251 --> 02:07:49,084
represented as a father figure.
God the father let's say because it's 

2209
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:54,004
actually,
oh it's actually quite a bit like there 

2210
02:07:55,181 --> 02:07:57,550
is an all seeing eye that's always 
watching you.

2211
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:58,713
It's a really,
really intelligent way of 

2212
02:07:59,711 --> 02:08:00,544
conceptualizing it because the group 
which is more or less eternal is 

2213
02:08:05,741 --> 02:08:06,574
watching you all the time,
all the time and it's judging you all 

2214
02:08:10,511 --> 02:08:11,344
the time.
And we know that if you put people in a 

2215
02:08:13,961 --> 02:08:16,110
room and you put a big eye on the wall,
you know,

2216
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:19,600
and then you give them an opportunity to
cheat on some little cheeky thing.

2217
02:08:19,601 --> 02:08:20,680
You know,
nothing too important.

2218
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:22,593
If they're in the room with the big eye,
they're less likely to cheat if they're 

2219
02:08:24,581 --> 02:08:27,190
in the room with no way at all.
So,

2220
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:28,480
you know,
and what do you do?

2221
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:29,314
You keep an eye on your kids and the 
reason you do that is so they don't 

2222
02:08:31,361 --> 02:08:33,730
misbehave and we keep an eye on each 
other.

2223
02:08:34,480 --> 02:08:38,170
And so we have a representation of that.
And as far as I can tell,

2224
02:08:38,171 --> 02:08:41,830
we represented as a transcendent figure 
of judgment.

2225
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:43,310
And it's like,
yeah,

2226
02:08:43,311 --> 02:08:45,190
that's,
hey,

2227
02:08:45,850 --> 02:08:47,200
that's a pretty good metaphor.

2228
02:08:49,030 --> 02:08:49,863
So

2229
02:08:53,460 --> 02:08:54,293
one of the,

2230
02:08:57,990 --> 02:08:58,823
this is a major intellectual battle,
the major intellectual battle and it's 

2231
02:09:04,441 --> 02:09:05,274
raging in universities.
It's basically a battle between 

2232
02:09:08,371 --> 02:09:13,371
postmodernism and traditional and 
tradition.

2233
02:09:14,850 --> 02:09:16,440
I think that's the right way of thinking
about it.

2234
02:09:17,070 --> 02:09:19,500
For the postmodernists,
human beings have no nature.

2235
02:09:20,580 --> 02:09:24,210
We're blank slates.
Everything that we are is enculturated,

2236
02:09:24,240 --> 02:09:27,780
so we're completely malleable and all 
elements of our identity are malleable.

2237
02:09:28,590 --> 02:09:31,320
On the other side are the 
traditionalists who are,

2238
02:09:31,350 --> 02:09:35,640
I would say grounded more in
biology on the one hand,

2239
02:09:35,641 --> 02:09:37,100
but also in,
in,

2240
02:09:37,101 --> 02:09:37,934
in,
in the historical humanities tradition 

2241
02:09:41,551 --> 02:09:43,140
that suggests that people have in 
nature.

2242
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,260
Um,
I explained some of that nature.

2243
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,900
Most people want to have friends as part
of your nature.

2244
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:50,293
You know,
most people want to find love part of 

2245
02:09:52,471 --> 02:09:54,900
your nature and,
and you suffer without it.

2246
02:09:54,901 --> 02:09:56,010
So,
and you know,

2247
02:09:56,011 --> 02:09:57,750
you could say those are all social 
constructs,

2248
02:09:57,751 --> 02:10:00,270
but
you can say,

2249
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,170
you can say anything.

2250
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:06,530
So you know,
and no to ever trust someone who has one

2251
02:10:07,291 --> 02:10:10,470
explanation for everything,
you know,

2252
02:10:10,471 --> 02:10:14,250
how much intelligence does that take?
You got one explanation,

2253
02:10:14,251 --> 02:10:16,290
you can just trot it out for every 
phenomena.

2254
02:10:18,030 --> 02:10:19,320
This is an alternative.
Now,

2255
02:10:19,321 --> 02:10:20,154
here's what happened in park
nature back in the late 18 hundreds was 

2256
02:10:26,281 --> 02:10:30,330
very interested in the dissolution of 
traditional faith in,

2257
02:10:30,331 --> 02:10:31,164
in,
in the west.

2258
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:34,100
We fell out of our myth.
That's a way of thinking about it.

2259
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,790
We stopped believing in its fundamental 
axioms.

2260
02:10:37,070 --> 02:10:40,790
You start believing that there was such 
a thing as a transcendent deity.

2261
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:41,624
For example,
it didn't mesh well with the emerging 

2262
02:10:44,271 --> 02:10:48,050
scientific viewpoint.
And so in the late 18 hundreds,

2263
02:10:48,070 --> 02:10:49,640
Nietzsche announced the death of God.

2264
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:51,413
MMM.

2265
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:56,090
Which sounds fairly presumptuous,
but it wasn't something,

2266
02:10:56,091 --> 02:11:00,260
he was celebrating the full quote and I 
haven't gotten it exactly right is God's

2267
02:11:00,261 --> 02:11:01,094
dead.
We've killed him and we'll never find 

2268
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:05,120
enough water to wash away the rivers of 
blood.

2269
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:06,583
So like that's a lot different than what
you see scrawled on bathroom walls and 

2270
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:12,153
Nietzsche hypothesized that in the 20th 
century millions of people would die in 

2271
02:11:17,151 --> 02:11:21,950
the conflicts over what values we're 
going to reign as an alternative to that

2272
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:25,280
tradition.
And he particularly brilliantly

2273
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:30,020
pointed to communism.
He said that's where it's going to be in

2274
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:32,570
Dostoyevsky did the same thing.
And so,

2275
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:37,690
and since then there's this been this 
battle.

2276
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:38,553
He and the battle is kind of like this,
the battle is on the one hand between 

2277
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:42,303
social construction,
social constructionist utopians who 

2278
02:11:45,521 --> 02:11:46,354
believe that human nature is infinitely 
malleable and that with the proper 

2279
02:11:49,241 --> 02:11:50,074
transformations in society,
you can bring apart about the perfect 

2280
02:11:52,271 --> 02:11:55,060
state and the perfect human being.
And,

2281
02:11:56,920 --> 02:12:01,920
and traditionalist
and young I think is the classic example

2282
02:12:03,161 --> 02:12:03,994
of this who believed that there is a 
human nature and it's deeply embedded 

2283
02:12:08,081 --> 02:12:08,914
within us and that the cultures we set 
up have to manifest themselves in 

2284
02:12:13,421 --> 02:12:15,850
accordance with that nature.
Or they will fail.

2285
02:12:18,310 --> 02:12:19,143
Oh,
young believed in the existence of a 

2286
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:22,210
Meta narrative,
the hero myth,

2287
02:12:22,240 --> 02:12:23,073
roughly speaking.
And he explained it's connections to 

2288
02:12:25,361 --> 02:12:29,650
various religious traditions in a 
staggeringly brilliant manner.

2289
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:32,110
Camille Paglia,
who I would recommend,

2290
02:12:32,111 --> 02:12:34,270
and I think I already told you that,
you know,

2291
02:12:34,271 --> 02:12:35,104
she,
she's already concluded after going 

2292
02:12:36,791 --> 02:12:39,850
through a radical feminist period early 
in her life,

2293
02:12:39,880 --> 02:12:40,713
that the proper way for society orient 
itself is within a mythological 

2294
02:12:44,591 --> 02:12:45,424
structure.
And that that's part of what the 

2295
02:12:46,421 --> 02:12:48,670
humanities provides.
Um,

2296
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,130
and the alternative is

2297
02:12:54,190 --> 02:12:56,920
rational arguments over what values are 
going to dominate.

2298
02:12:57,580 --> 02:13:00,580
And it isn't obvious that rationality 
can solve that problem.

2299
02:13:01,090 --> 02:13:03,670
I don't think it can.
That's hume's point.

2300
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:06,130
David Hume said,
you can't derive an ought from an is,

2301
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:08,013
right?
You cannot use science as a guide to 

2302
02:13:09,611 --> 02:13:12,220
behavior.
So what do you use?

2303
02:13:14,440 --> 02:13:19,440
Instinct instinct manifested in 
imagination and the evolution,

2304
02:13:20,770 --> 02:13:23,710
the evolved structure of your organic 
cultures,

2305
02:13:24,190 --> 02:13:26,110
something like that.
Do they have a structure?

2306
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:28,120
That's the question.
Okay,

2307
02:13:28,121 --> 02:13:28,954
so you ask yourself this question,
what is it that every being shares 

2308
02:13:32,341 --> 02:13:33,174
regardless of place and time.
So any universally comprehensive 

2309
02:13:36,721 --> 02:13:40,260
language that would be a Meta narrative,
a myth,

2310
02:13:40,290 --> 02:13:41,123
a hero myth.
Let's say a myth about what a human 

2311
02:13:43,111 --> 02:13:45,420
being,
not only his life but should be like,

2312
02:13:46,710 --> 02:13:49,950
has to speak to us about those aspects 
of experience that we all share.

2313
02:13:49,951 --> 02:13:51,960
Because otherwise we wouldn't understand
the damn story.

2314
02:13:52,110 --> 02:13:55,980
Now we go to how we go to stories that 
we understand all the time,

2315
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:56,933
like star wars,
and it really doesn't matter what 

2316
02:13:58,471 --> 02:13:59,340
country,
you know,

2317
02:13:59,341 --> 02:14:03,840
everybody gets it more or less.
So obviously there's stories that we can

2318
02:14:03,841 --> 02:14:05,700
understand and mutually,
you know,

2319
02:14:05,701 --> 02:14:08,640
we understand love stories,
we understand stories of conflict,

2320
02:14:08,641 --> 02:14:11,370
we understand stories of betrayal,
we understand stories of anger.

2321
02:14:11,580 --> 02:14:14,070
And that's because we can feel jealousy.
We can feel love,

2322
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:15,620
we can feel anger.
It's,

2323
02:14:15,850 --> 02:14:17,910
it's part of you.
It's right there.

2324
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:20,670
We even know where the circuits are,
you know?

2325
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:23,370
And then you're like other animals,
they feel it too.

2326
02:14:23,430 --> 02:14:26,400
So very similar emotions as far as we 
can tell.

2327
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:32,120
So
here's,

2328
02:14:32,690 --> 02:14:36,530
here's this is drive in large part from 
young but not only,

2329
02:14:37,370 --> 02:14:39,620
um,
here's what we share.

2330
02:14:41,240 --> 02:14:42,073
Natural world,
social world and the fact of our 

2331
02:14:45,801 --> 02:14:49,460
existence as an individual.
And that can be represented in different

2332
02:14:49,461 --> 02:14:51,830
ways.
It can be represented as you,

2333
02:14:51,980 --> 02:14:52,813
the known,
the and the unknown or it could be you 

2334
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:56,623
culture and nature,
all the same representations and the 

2335
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:04,070
cultural representation tends to be 
male.

2336
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:06,950
That's God the father let's say.
And they

2337
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:12,110
representation,
the Feminine Representation tends to be

2338
02:15:13,730 --> 02:15:14,563
female.
This is the known culture apollonian 

2339
02:15:20,301 --> 02:15:23,180
control that's associated with the son 
consciousness,

2340
02:15:23,181 --> 02:15:24,230
the king,
the patriarch,

2341
02:15:24,231 --> 02:15:25,064
the plow because it pushes up the earth.
The Phallus obviously order and 

2342
02:15:29,770 --> 02:15:31,640
authority and the crushing weight of 
tradition,

2343
02:15:31,641 --> 02:15:35,960
the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,
the day sky,

2344
02:15:36,410 --> 02:15:37,520
the country mountain,
the island,

2345
02:15:37,521 --> 02:15:39,260
the heights,
the ancestral spirits,

2346
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:40,730
the activity of the dead

2347
02:15:44,850 --> 02:15:46,200
captain hook,
he's a tyrant.

2348
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:49,020
And that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to
grow up to become him.

2349
02:15:49,230 --> 02:15:50,063
And that's why Peter Pan doesn't want to
grow up well because he thinks that 

2350
02:15:52,200 --> 02:15:54,900
adults are all tyrants.
Why is captain hook a tyrant?

2351
02:15:55,620 --> 02:15:59,400
Because a crocodile ate his hand and the
crocodile has a clock in its stomach.

2352
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:03,630
And the reason for that is that the 
crocodile is time and time's already got

2353
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:07,110
a piece of Captain Hook and he's not 
very happy about it.

2354
02:16:07,111 --> 02:16:09,300
He's bitter and resentful and 
tyrannical.

2355
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,540
And when Peter Pan looks at adulthood,
that's what he sees.

2356
02:16:12,690 --> 02:16:13,523
And he thinks,
why should I sacrifice the potential of 

2357
02:16:15,091 --> 02:16:18,120
childhood for the singularity of tight 
tyranny?

2358
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:20,910
And so we stay as immature his entire 
life.

2359
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:23,670
And he's king of the lost boys.
Jesus.

2360
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:29,070
Great.
There's a porn star named Jeremy Christ.

2361
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:31,330
Can't remember his name.
It's really an ugly guy.

2362
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:33,240
He is.
He is.

2363
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:36,490
He is not ugly guy.
He admits it and he,

2364
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:37,383
he said something funny,
I was watching a documentary about him 

2365
02:16:40,380 --> 02:16:42,180
and he said the funniest thing,
he said,

2366
02:16:43,440 --> 02:16:48,000
I'm the hero to people who think people 
like me are heroes.

2367
02:16:48,630 --> 02:16:50,490
What a drag.
I mean,

2368
02:16:50,610 --> 02:16:54,420
he's just in this horrible situation.
He doesn't admire the people that admire

2369
02:16:54,421 --> 02:16:55,254
him.
But he gets admired by them all the 

2370
02:16:56,401 --> 02:16:57,370
time.
Well,

2371
02:16:57,390 --> 02:16:58,860
it's sort of like Peter Pan.
It's like,

2372
02:16:58,861 --> 02:17:01,470
well he's king of the lost boys.
He doesn't get windy either.

2373
02:17:02,990 --> 02:17:04,310
Right?
She grows up,

2374
02:17:04,760 --> 02:17:05,593
she has a family.
He asked to contend himself with 

2375
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:11,030
Tinkerbell and you know what?
Tinkerbell doesn't exist.

2376
02:17:12,230 --> 02:17:13,970
Well that's what happens when you don't 
grow up.

2377
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:17,510
That's a representation of culture.
That's a nasty one.

2378
02:17:17,520 --> 02:17:20,200
A
nasty one.

2379
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:22,910
Hell,
we'll kiss,

2380
02:17:23,390 --> 02:17:24,223
kiss a statue of Stella.
Who cares that he murdered 30 million 

2381
02:17:28,041 --> 02:17:31,040
people culture.
Well,

2382
02:17:31,041 --> 02:17:31,874
you know in the university you hear a 
lot about the patriarchy and how 

2383
02:17:34,491 --> 02:17:35,510
oppressive it is.
It's like,

2384
02:17:35,511 --> 02:17:35,991
yeah,
yeah,

2385
02:17:35,991 --> 02:17:37,070
right.
Definitely.

2386
02:17:37,250 --> 02:17:38,690
No kidding.
But you know,

2387
02:17:38,691 --> 02:17:41,990
it's kind of useful as well since it 
provides the light and the heat,

2388
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:44,480
the food and all of that,
which you know,

2389
02:17:44,720 --> 02:17:47,120
kind of counterbalances it to some 
degree.

2390
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:50,630
Culture has a positive element and a 
negative element.

2391
02:17:50,631 --> 02:17:53,060
The individual has a positive element 
and a negative element.

2392
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:55,820
Nature has a positive element and a 
negative element.

2393
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:58,550
And if people tell you a one sided 
story,

2394
02:17:58,640 --> 02:18:01,340
which is the ideological story,
they leave out bat,

2395
02:18:01,730 --> 02:18:02,563
they say all culture is terrible.
The human being is a despoiled and 

2396
02:18:05,631 --> 02:18:09,680
nature is perfect.
It's like no nature kills you.

2397
02:18:10,910 --> 02:18:11,743
Culture keeps you alive,
and there's things about you that are 

2398
02:18:14,721 --> 02:18:17,300
honorable and good,
as well as things about you that aren't.

2399
02:18:18,170 --> 02:18:19,003
And you need to know both of those.
And that's what the great stories tell 

2400
02:18:21,381 --> 02:18:22,214
us.

2401
02:18:23,220 --> 02:18:24,053
All right.
