1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,320
Well,
Dr Jordan Peterson,

2
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,130
welcome to Sydney on your Australian 
tour.

3
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,640
You're talking to a packed out houses 
and the interest is extraordinary and 

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,610
we've had the opportunity to talk 
personally and I can understand why I 

5
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,701
want to begin with something that 
Churchill wrote in the 19 thirties and 

6
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:54,090
he said this,
one of the signs of a great society,

7
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:58,710
use the diligence with which it passes 
culture from one generation to the next,

8
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,470
when one generation no longer passages 
on the things that are dear to it,

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,140
its heroes and their stories,
and it's religious faith,

10
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,080
it's in effect saying that past is null 
and void.

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,650
It's of no value.
He goes onto say,

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,860
that leaves young people feeling a lack 
of direction than a lack of purpose and 

13
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:28,730
opens them to the dictum of Karl Marx 
that are people derived of the history,

14
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,720
uh,
easily persuaded.

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Have we stripped down the young people 
have purpose and meaning and left them 

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,600
open to being bullied around whether 
there's two things about that that,

17
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,060
that I think are really worth,
worth laying out.

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,300
The for the first is an analysis of the 
purpose of memory.

19
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,760
Now,
because people think that the purpose of

20
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,600
memory is to remember the past and 
that's not the purpose of memory.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,080
The purpose of memory is to extract out 
from the past lessons to structure the 

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,910
future and that that's the purpose of 
personal memory.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,240
And so you're done with a memory when 
you've extracted out the information 

24
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,700
that you can use to guide yourself 
properly in the future.

25
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,650
So if you have a traumatic memory,
for example,

26
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:12,651
that's really obsessing you.
If you analyze that memory to the point 

27
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:17,331
where you figured out how you put 
yourself at risk and you can determine 

28
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:21,411
how you might avoid that in the future,
then the emotion associated with that 

29
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:21,770
goes away.
So memories are,

30
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,920
has a very pragmatic function and 
cultural memories.

31
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,930
The same thing is that we need to 
extract out stories from our past that 

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,950
structure our future,
and we need that because,

33
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,540
uh,
first of all,

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
if you don't have a purpose,
let's say,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,450
it isn't,
that your life becomes neutral in a,

36
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,110
in a meaningless sense.

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,410
It's that your life becomes 
characterized by unbearable suffering 

38
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,120
because the baseline condition of life 
is something like unbearable suffering.

39
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,340
And what you have to set against that is
a noble and worthwhile purpose,

40
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,550
and hopefully,
hopefully your determination of that 

41
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,761
purpose is buttress to some degree by 
the wisdom the past because you can't 

42
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:02,140
conjure something like that up on your 
own.

43
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,650
And if you provide people with nobility 
of purpose,

44
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:10,651
then they can tolerate the suffering of 
existence without becoming entirely 

45
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:12,250
corrupted by it.
And cultures that don't do that,

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:16,360
it isn't even so much that they die.
It's the cultures that don't do that are

47
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:18,070
dead.
They're done.

48
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,360
They don't have a story anymore and they
don't have a call to adventure and then,

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,510
well then everyone suffers stupidly.
As a consequence.

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,600
It's a very bad thing.
So Churchill made the same observation 

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,441
that many of the great psychologists and
philosophers made in the early part of 

52
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:34,441
the 20th century.
It's like,

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,110
bring this story forward and propagate 
it and make it the most noble possible 

54
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,630
story.
And then you motivate people to do,

55
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,150
to transcend themselves,
which they need to do.

56
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,870
So yes,
he's exactly right in his diagnosis,

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,840
just to stay with him for a moment.
He's painted as the great defender of 

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,300
freedom.
It's possible that your country,

59
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:57,980
Canada,
and certainly my country,

60
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:02,981
Australia,
would have not continued as free 

61
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:06,791
societies had it not been for that man 
courageously standing at a time when so 

62
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,750
few did.
He wasn't the inventor of freedom.

63
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,830
Freedom is we understand it and I want 
to unpack that a bit.

64
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,010
Something very,
very few people in very few cultures 

65
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,000
down through the ages and even today 
have ever really experienced.

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,990
Oh,
well,

67
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,170
yes,
and partly because we're afraid of it.

68
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,730
I would say.
I mean,

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,680
people think of freedom as the ability 
to implement your whim and freedom opens

70
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,800
up that as a possibility,
but sustainable freedom,

71
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,080
that isn't what it's about at all.
It's about.

72
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:41,530
It's primarily about responsibility.
It's about determining which load you're

73
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,531
going to pick up and carry.
That's the proper definition of 

74
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:48,030
appropriate freedom.
It's not grout DM,

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,100
gratification of instantaneous impulse.
It's self evident that that doesn't 

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,331
work.
Two year olds do that and that's why 

77
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,401
they can't live in the world.
They can't organize themselves across 

78
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,551
time.
They can't sacrifice the moment for the 

79
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:03,040
future and the more sophisticated you 
get,

80
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:08,041
I suppose in some sense the more you're 
able to do that and then your freedom 

81
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,020
becomes the freedom to choose the proper
responsibility and that's not.

82
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:16,021
That's also not something that we've 
been good at communicating to young 

83
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,021
people.

84
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:19,050
If we talk to them about responsibility,
we don't generally do it in a finger 

85
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:19,050
wagging sort of way and it's like,
well,

86
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,710
you're breaking the rules.
You're a bad person,

87
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,100
and and and well,
that may be true because people break 

88
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,860
the rules and there's no shortage of 
badness in people,

89
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,250
but the proper message for young people 
is to say,

90
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:30,580
well,
no,

91
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:34,240
you don't understand you.
You want to take on responsibility.

92
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,120
You want to take on the heaviest load 
that you can conceive of,

93
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:40,210
that you might be able to move because 
it gives your life,

94
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:43,240
nobility and purpose and that offsets 
the tragedy.

95
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,370
And and,
and not only psychologically.

96
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:50,371
Not only does it offset it 
psychologically because you have a 

97
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,250
purpose and something to wake up for.
Right?

98
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:56,251
And to face the difficulties of the day,
but also because if you face the 

99
00:05:56,251 --> 00:06:00,181
difficulties of the day properly,
you actually ameliorate suffering not 

100
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:03,851
only in the psychological sense,
but because you make the world at least 

101
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,800
a less terrible place.
And that's something right?

102
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,560
To move things away from hell is 
something even if you're not,

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,950
you know,
self evidently moving forthrightly to 

104
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,321
heaven to,
to move things away from the worst they 

105
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,290
can be as well.
That's a noble goal in and of itself.

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,830
So and,
and young people are starving for that 

107
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
idea.
It's very interesting to watch.

108
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,300
As I look at it,

109
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,380
it seems to me that that actin headed 
right freedom,

110
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:31,440
properly understood,
needs to be seen as a negative.

111
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,660
And as a positive.
The negative is,

112
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,740
is,
is this sort of concept of freedom from 

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,740
fear,
addiction,

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,200
persecution,
Karen,

115
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,770
tyranny in a personal sense.
And then,

116
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:48,771
um,
freedom to be used to reach your 

117
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:51,741
potential.
But it seems to me that what's missing 

118
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,711
is an understanding that freedom 
exercise within a framework of 

119
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,830
responsibility are you doing what you 
ought.

120
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,870
We'll guarantee you ongoing freedom for 
yourself and for your neighbors.

121
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Freedom exercised in a way that confuses
it with license tends to destroy 

122
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:08,070
freedom.
In fact,

123
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:13,071
you could even go so far as to say that 
misunderstood freedom turns out to be 

124
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,680
its own worst enemy.

125
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,020
Well,
that's.

126
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,480
That's the.
That's the difficult distinction between

127
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,780
freedom of the moment and and freedom of
have the freedom with everything taken 

128
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,461
into account,
and I'm a real admirer of the work of 

129
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:30,071
John Piaget.
Piaget is a developmental psychologist 

130
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:33,011
and few people know the world's most 
well known developmental psychologists 

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,020
and few people know that he was actually
motivated in his intellectual pursuits 

132
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,800
by the desire to reconcile science with 
religion.

133
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,950
That was his driving force from the time
that he was a young man.

134
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:48,220
You wouldn't know that even necessarily 
by reading his writings because it's 

135
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,660
implicit rather than explicit in them,
but he,

136
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,380
he,
he has a different model of what 

137
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:55,380
constitutes morality than,
than Freud.

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,190
Freud's model is combative.
It's sort of the super ego as tyrant.

139
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:01,730
So the superego would be the strictures 
of society,

140
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,500
the in the biological impulses,
and the eagle crushed between those.

141
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Right?
So the ego is this thing that's crushed 

142
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:11,500
between nature and culture and so it's a
really.

143
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,080
It's a tense and combat of model of the 
human psyche and there's something about

144
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:20,081
it that's that's,
that's accurate because some of the 

145
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,910
restrictions that are put on your 
impulse gratification are imposed on you

146
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,880
in a,
in a sense to radically.

147
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,190
But Piaget's perspective was much more 
optimistic and I think much more 

148
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:35,201
accurate.
He noticed that as children organize 

149
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:35,480
themselves spontaneously as they 
developed,

150
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:38,510
especially within the confines of their 
own spontaneous play,

151
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,290
they didn't so much subsume art or 
inhibit their dark and aggressive 

152
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:50,381
impulses as make them sophisticated and 
transform them into universally 

153
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,870
acceptable games.
So for Piaget,

154
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,420
a game that a group of children were 
playing,

155
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,810
that all of them were playing 
voluntarily and that was going well and 

156
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,240
that they all wanted to continue playing
was a microcosm of society and literally

157
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,410
a microcosm of society.

158
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,620
The reason that children were playing 
those games was to practice being 

159
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,400
productive members of society and he 
felt that the appropriate game tended 

160
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
towards what he described as an 
equivalent braided state.

161
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,780
So when a criminal braided state would 
be a game that you'll play because 

162
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,021
you've decided it's a good game,
but that you can play with others 

163
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:27,720
because they've also decided that it's a
good game.

164
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,050
And so that can work at the individual 
level and at the familial level and at 

165
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,831
the social level.
And if you get all those things working 

166
00:09:36,831 --> 00:09:39,201
simultaneously,
then you have a sustainable enterprise 

167
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,250
and it's predicated not so much on the,
on the,

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,280
uh,
inhibition of impulse or on the 

169
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,801
regulation of it,
but of the integration of impulses into 

170
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:52,370
a,
into a pattern of being that gratifies 

171
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,390
them on a relatively permanent basis.
So,

172
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:59,391
you know,
if you want to go to university and 

173
00:09:59,391 --> 00:09:59,391
become a physician,
think there's a lot of,

174
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,890
a sacrifice of impulsive gratification 
that goes along with that.

175
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,790
But if you become a physician,
then it's a noble enterprise.

176
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,910
People support you socially and all of 
the needs that you need to have 

177
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,270
fulfilled will also be fulfilled by that
enterprise.

178
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:17,510
Well,
that's a way better model and so it's 

179
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,181
strange that the maximum freedom comes 
with the adoption of a discipline and 

180
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:24,411
then also the adoption of responsibility
that frees you up and everyone else 

181
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:26,160
around you in the long run and if you 
explain that to people,

182
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,430
especially in this day and age when they
be fed a never ending diet idiot rights 

183
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,841
and freedoms,
they're immediately on board with it 

184
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,570
because they know they know that most of
the meaning that people experience in 

185
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,561
their life as a consequence of adopting 
responsibility so they're starving for 

186
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:43,710
that.
Our idea to be articulated

187
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,290
opens up a whole can of very,
very interesting issue.

188
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:49,830
So this try and pick a couple of,
but the do.

189
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,880
It's evident to me,
and I'm enormously encouraged by this 

190
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,061
because I'm passionate Australia and I'd
want this country to be the sort of 

191
00:10:59,061 --> 00:11:01,260
place that offers opportunities of the 
sort that I had when I was young.

192
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,950
I've had my opportunities.
When I look at my kids' generation,

193
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,420
what's going to be there for them if we 
keep feeding the sort of scene grew in 

194
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:15,030
reality,
the people turning out in vast numbers.

195
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,750
Every one of your talks in Australia's 
been oversubscribed massively.

196
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,740
It tells you that I kind of get those 
mortar,

197
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,850
this no know being told,
oh yeah,

198
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,310
they know

199
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,560
well.
It's one of the things that's so 

200
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,560
interesting about dealing with 
archetypal themes.

201
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,470
You know archetypal themes are 
archetipal because they actually speak 

202
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,720
of the structure of human experience.
That's why they last,

203
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,040
and so it's human nature and human 
experience has a pattern.

204
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,420
You don't have the capacity to do 
articulate that pattern as an individual

205
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,660
in part because your life is too short.
You just can't figure it out,

206
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,020
but the,
the ancient representations of those 

207
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,811
patterns are everywhere around you and 
you know some of them at the image you 

208
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,450
caught onto them automatically you,
you,

209
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,220
you fall into them.
If you go to a movie,

210
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:05,221
for example,
because movies always expressed 

211
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:05,290
archetipal themes.
If you hear them articulate it,

212
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,910
you think,
I knew that.

213
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,010
I knew that.
I just don't know how to say it.

214
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,080
That's,
that's the platonic idea of,

215
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:11,950
of,
um,

216
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,310
of,
of learning as remembering your soul 

217
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:17,740
already knows,
but it doesn't have the words.

218
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,720
And so when people talk to me about 
watching my lectures,

219
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,260
let's say they say they basically say 
one of two things.

220
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,390
If it's,
if it's not just a simple thank you.

221
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,290
They say one of two things.
A third of them say quarter for them,

222
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:37,030
say we're not listened to you talk.
It's as if you're telling me things that

223
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:38,590
I already know.
It's like,

224
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,390
yeah,
well that's exactly right because that's

225
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:45,391
what archetypal stories are there.
The description of what you already 

226
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:45,880
know,
but that can be articulated.

227
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:50,881
And then who you are and how you see 
yourself and the way you described 

228
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:53,650
yourself are all become the same thing.
So that's wonderful.

229
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:55,480
Then you're not at odds with yourself,
you know,

230
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,970
and then you have,
then you're a functioning unity and that

231
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,730
makes you much stronger and more 
indomitable than you would otherwise be.

232
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,620
And then the other thing that people 
say,

233
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,270
and this is more like three quarters of 
them,

234
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,900
is that they say,
I was in a very dark place.

235
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,130
I was addicted.
I was.

236
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:11,290
I was drinking too much.
I had a fragment,

237
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,440
good relationship with my fiance and I 
wasn't getting married.

238
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,870
Things weren't going very well with my 
family,

239
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,910
my relationship with my father.
It was damaged.

240
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,700
I didn't have any ame.
I was wasting my time.

241
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,550
Some variant of that,
some combination of those.

242
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,080
And they said,
well,

243
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,180
I've been watching your lectures.
I've decided to establish a purpose.

244
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,770
I'm trying to tell the truth and things 
are way better and I've.

245
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,890
And so let's say I've done maybe eight 
or nine large scale public talks in the 

246
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,760
last two months.
So that's probably 20,000

247
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:47,761
people and about half of them,
a third to half of them estate 

248
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,310
afterwards to talk to me.
So that's about 7,000

249
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:53,311
people who have said that to me.
And then people stop me on the street 

250
00:13:53,311 --> 00:13:53,770
all the time and tell me exactly that 
story,

251
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:54,970
which is just wonderful.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Like you can't imagine how good it is to
be able to go to places you've never 

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,871
been.
And to have people start people on the 

254
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:03,871
streets spontaneously and say,
look,

255
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,010
my life is way better than it was.
It's like,

256
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,440
it's so good.
And so,

257
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,850
and I've got like,
I don't know,

258
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,910
35,000
letters from people since last August.

259
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:14,650
It's more than that.
I can't keep track of them.

260
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:19,651
And it's exactly the same thing,
like three quarter a quarter of them 

261
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:19,651
say,
well,

262
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,010
you've given me the words to say what I 
already knew was true.

263
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,740
And thank you for that.
I can see that in the audience.

264
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:26,260
It's so interesting because I can lay 
out a story.

265
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,810
People go like this and say they're 
doing that all the time.

266
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,650
It's like the lights are going on and 
that's a really wild.

267
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:36,670
There's almost nothing better than that 
to watch lights go on when you're 

268
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:36,670
talking to people.

269
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,170
It's like that's just absolutely 
fantastic.

270
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,800
But to get this response from people.
My father,

271
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,510
I haven't.
My father's about 80,

272
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,110
80 is 83,
I think 81.

273
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,420
He's 81.
And uh,

274
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,880
I put it in charge of going through my 
viewer email,

275
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,860
which is an overwhelming job,
but now we've had discussions about this

276
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:02,861
constantly.
He's overwhelmed by the fact that so 

277
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:02,861
many people are writing and saying the 
same thing.

278
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:03,380
It's like,
well,

279
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:06,860
I have a purpose in my life actually 
matters.

280
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:11,861
I finally realized that and I'm putting 
it into practice and I'm bearing up 

281
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:13,730
under the heaviest load I can imagine.
And it's really helping.

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,880
It's like God.
And that's tens of thousands of 

283
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:18,880
responses now.
So it's,

284
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,310
it's.
You couldn't hope for anything better 

285
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,490
than that.
There's zero harm in it,

286
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,520
right?
It's just people putting their lives 

287
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,111
together,
they're not mucking about with other 

288
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:32,111
people and are trying to make broad 
scale.

289
00:15:32,111 --> 00:15:33,950
Social transformation is about which 
they have no idea.

290
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:38,570
They're trying to make their immediate 
environment better and it's working.

291
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,700
It's like great.
Great.

292
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,390
You say the zero harm,
I'd say as a former legislator,

293
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:49,391
that there's an enormous amount of good 
in a country is only the sum total of 

294
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:52,901
the people that make it up.
To the extent that they put together a 

295
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:56,030
resilient contribute.
Don't have to ask others to help them.

296
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,710
The stronger the nation,
the society and rapidly like.

297
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,711
I mean,
I think I was thinking the other day 

298
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:06,670
because I'm a journalist asked me why 
the audience by people are responding so

299
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,050
positively to what I'm saying.
The young men for example,

300
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,400
and I thought,
why?

301
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:10,940
Why?
Yeah,

302
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:15,941
that's a good question.
So that's what I'm actually on their 

303
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,731
side.
I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy 

304
00:16:18,731 --> 00:16:22,181
that they're not wasting their lives.
I'm really sad to see that people are 

305
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,300
disenchanted denialists and depressed 
and anxious and aimless and and perverse

306
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,430
and vengeful and,
and all of those things.

307
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:33,431
It's terrible.
And then to see people question whether 

308
00:16:33,431 --> 00:16:35,440
that's necessary and then to start to 
rise out of that.

309
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:36,820
It's like,
it's so fun.

310
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:40,630
Like last night I was at after my talk,
so overwhelming.

311
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,560
I don't usually think about these 
things,

312
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:52,561
but I was,
I was after my talk last night and so 

313
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:53,120
all these people line up and you know,
they have their 15,

314
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,270
15 seconds with me and they're kind of 
tentative.

315
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,790
They're excited and attentitive when 
they come up to talk to me and then they

316
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:58,300
have,
you know,

317
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,170
15 seconds of time to tell me something.
I'm really listening to them and they're

318
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,070
hesitant about whether or not to share 
the good news about their life,

319
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,960
you know,
and I think it's often because

320
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,130
when people share good news about their 
life,

321
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:15,880
people don't necessarily respond 
positively,

322
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
you know,
they don't give encouragement and people

323
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:22,510
need so little encouragement.
It's just unbelievable.

324
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,540
And so there comes something good and I 
think that's so good.

325
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,470
You know,
if somebody says,

326
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,510
oh,
I'm getting along better with my father,

327
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:33,511
I haven't seen him for 10 years and now 
we get along great and that,

328
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,580
the power of that,
you can't overstate the power of that 

329
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,220
for individuals to get their life 
together.

330
00:17:39,221 --> 00:17:44,221
They individuals and unbelievably 
powerful force and every single person 

331
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:48,840
who gets their act together a little bit
has the capacity to spread that around 

332
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:48,840
them.
It's,

333
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:54,310
it's a chain reaction and so it's a 
lovely thing to see and that's 

334
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,570
fantastic.

335
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,880
My observation of atheists would be they
don't live like atheists.

336
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,970
They don't live as though they really 
believe they just a cosmic accident and 

337
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:05,820
there's no purpose well eater,
most of them,

338
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,780
the best of them.
I have a lot of respect for the atheists

339
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,820
generally because they've generally 
thought a lot more about this situation 

340
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,630
and struggled with it more than the 
complacent fundamentalists,

341
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,180
you know,
who wallpaper over their doubts with,

342
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,670
with,
with overstatements about their belief.

343
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:28,671
The atheists,
you know the word Isaac means our 

344
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:31,941
Israel.
The word Israel means he who struggles 

345
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:31,941
with God.
It's like,

346
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,301
well,
it's not obvious that it's not the 

347
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:35,301
atheists,
you know,

348
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:36,210
they're struggling away.
It's like they're obsessed with it even,

349
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,450
and so they have God.
We're on their mind than the typical 

350
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,830
person who's a believer.
And so it it.

351
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,090
It's interesting too because there's 
been this little community develop 

352
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,610
around my biblical lectures in 
particular of people who call themselves

353
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,220
Christian atheists,
which I think is quite remarkable.

354
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,610
So if I lay out the rationale for the 
Christian ethic,

355
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:57,490
which is something like pick up your 
damn cross and struggle uphill,

356
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,700
which is a really good message,
they think,

357
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,260
oh yeah,
well that makes a lot of sense.

358
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:01,650
It's like,
well,

359
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,600
I don't need the metaphysical baggage.
It's like,

360
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,500
well maybe you do and maybe you don't,
but even to pick up the,

361
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,760
the,
the practical utility of that idea,

362
00:19:11,761 --> 00:19:13,020
which is overwhelming.
That's a,

363
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,500
that's an excellent start.
So I was going to follow on that then.

364
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,540
So it strikes me that a lot of young 
people,

365
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,970
and I think this is enormously do their 
credit and goes to the heart.

366
00:19:20,971 --> 00:19:25,950
I think of what you're saying.
They told that morality is relative.

367
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,160
They don't live that way,
are looking for truth,

368
00:19:29,161 --> 00:19:29,940
aren't they?
Well,

369
00:19:29,941 --> 00:19:31,860
if you live that way,
everyone hates you.

370
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,690
You know?
But that's the grade that.

371
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,650
Oh yes,
yes.

372
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:39,651
But that's a good example of how you,
who you are can be out of sync with how 

373
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:42,990
you represent yourself.
It's like I was walking with,

374
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,300
I was walking through these ideas with 
the audience last night.

375
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:45,990
It's like,
well,

376
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:48,420
how do we treat each other when things 
work,

377
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,130
you know,
and how do you treat yourself?

378
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:50,940
Well,
first of all,

379
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,940
you have to treat yourself like you 
matter because if you don't,

380
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:57,070
then you don't take care of yourself and
you become vengeful and,

381
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,700
and cruel and you,
you take,

382
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,850
you take it out on people around you and
you're not a positive force.

383
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,010
None of that's good.
So you suffer more.

384
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:10,011
And so does everyone around you.
And there's a malevolence that enters 

385
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:10,011
into it.
None of that's good.

386
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:12,270
So that's what happens if you don't 
treat yourself like you matter.

387
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:17,450
And then what?
What happens if you don't treat other 

388
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,450
people like they matter?

389
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:17,450
Well,
you lie to them,

390
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,050
you cheat them,
you steal you,

391
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,960
you enter into impulsive relationships 
with them.

392
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,450
They can't trust you,
that doesn't go anywhere.

393
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:25,440
They don't like you,
you,

394
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,270
you end up alone at best.
And maybe like incarcerated at worst,

395
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,680
like that doesn't work.
And so you watched the people around you

396
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:39,681
who thrive regardless of what they say.
They act out the proposition that 

397
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:44,090
everyone matters.
And then you have a functional society 

398
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,090
and I think,
okay,

399
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,430
well if,
if,

400
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,280
if when you act out the proposition that
everyone matters,

401
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:53,281
you have a functional society,
maybe that's evidence that that 

402
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:53,281
proposition is true.
It's like,

403
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:54,850
I think it's,
I think it's true.

404
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,470
I think the idea that the individual has
a spark of divinity within him or her,

405
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:03,160
I think there isn't a more true way of 
saying that.

406
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,410
And if you act that out,
well this is,

407
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,870
goes back to the idea that you brought 
up about potential,

408
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,930
which is also something I've discussed 
with my audience is a lot.

409
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,040
It's like we don't act like we live in a
material reality.

410
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,420
We act like we face a landscape of 
potential,

411
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,040
an external landscape of potential 
within internal reservoir of potential.

412
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,950
That's how we act.
And then we call each other out on it.

413
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,230
We say things like,
well,

414
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:31,360
you're not living up to your potential 
in persons go.

415
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,290
So yeah.
Well I know.

416
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,950
It's like,
well,

417
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,050
what do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?

418
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,930
What do you mean there's more to you 
than meets the eye?

419
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,780
Even though it's not measurable,
it's not tangible,

420
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,840
it's just possibility,
but everyone accepts that as though 

421
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,631
that's a reality and we all act as if we
all act as if we make choices about what

422
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,110
reality to bring into,
be it we,

423
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,850
we,
we,

424
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,810
we punish ourselves for our moral errors
and other people as well.

425
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,110
We act out this,
this ethic that puts us each at the 

426
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,191
center of being as active participants 
in the world that we want to bring 

427
00:22:05,191 --> 00:22:06,250
forward.
Everyone acts that way and if we don't,

428
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,190
then things go to hell instantly.
So it's like,

429
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:10,180
well,
what do we believe?

430
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,520
This is the argument I've had with 
people like Sam Harris,

431
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,870
the atheist types.
It's like,

432
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:15,010
yeah,
you think you're atheist,

433
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:16,360
man.
It's like you're Christian.

434
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,050
Judeo Christian,
let's say to the court,

435
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,880
you just don't understand it.
You just don't realize it and it's 

436
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:24,880
understandable,
but it's not helpful.

437
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,620
This idea that you put forward have a 
spark of divinity in every human being,

438
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,470
surely lies at the heart of the miracle 
of western freedom.

439
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,880
The idea that every individual has worth
and dignity and standing.

440
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,960
It's the idea that killed slavery.
Slavery is a human rights movement of 

441
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,561
all times so successful that it 
obliterated the idea that it was I had 

442
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,260
to keep slaves,
let alone change the law.

443
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,590
It changed the way the world full even 
though there are evil,

444
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,070
evil people who still keep slides and 
he's a rub.

445
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,050
It was plainly laid by people of 
profound Christian faith.

446
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:04,900
There's no other way of putting it.
Anyone who honestly,

447
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,410
honestly and truthfully it looks at the 
history of that period,

448
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:13,411
can't get away from it,
but because it doesn't suit the modern 

449
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:13,810
lifts narrative,
it's airbrushed out.

450
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,170
Doesn't.
That in itself says something profound 

451
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,500
about our willingness to try and distort
truth,

452
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,260
to suit our object?
Say what?

453
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,010
What?
What it,

454
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,300
what it speaks of.
You know,

455
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:25,720
it's,
it's,

456
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,900
it's hard.
It's like the,

457
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:28,690
the white washing of what happened in 
the,

458
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:33,750
in the,
in the Soviet states now in the 

459
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,121
Communist states in the 20th century.
I mean anybody who goes through that 

460
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:38,020
literature with any degree of care comes
away.

461
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,150
Traumatized,
right?

462
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,740
Shellshocked.
It's just,

463
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:42,890
it's,
it's,

464
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:46,490
it's everything the Nazis did on a 
larger scale.

465
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,790
It's horrifying,
and yet I see with my students do 60 

466
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,450
million people who dared to disagree 
died.

467
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,650
Oh,
at minimum it was in their own culture.

468
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,240
There was something in their own society
don't know way in.

469
00:23:57,241 --> 00:24:02,241
In the Soviet Union,
the estimates range from 20 to $60 

470
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,840
million and in Mao's China,
the estimates are as much as $100,

471
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:06,800
million or a kids taught this in school.
Not at all.

472
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,780
Universities are very.

473
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,050
I say this before preference slumping.
The modern fight in it seems to me in 

474
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:20,450
many ways is between what might be 
called freedom and fed them for fairness

475
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,740
and equality.
Equality sounds terrific.

476
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,840
Yep.
But we've actually seen what happens in 

477
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,730
societies where they set a quality up as
the ultimate goal.

478
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:34,060
I became terrible place.
What does that happen?

479
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,810
It sounds.
Yeah.

480
00:24:35,811 --> 00:24:36,260
Well,
that's.

481
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:41,350
I think that's also part of the 
whitewashing is we can't understand how 

482
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:45,350
one of our primary moral intuitions,
which might be fairness,

483
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:50,351
let's say,
can transform itself into something so 

484
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,460
utterly murderous when it's played out 
on a large political stage,

485
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,710
and I think because we don't understand 
that,

486
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,140
I mean look,
there's reasons to be on the left.

487
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,730
There are temperamental reasons first,
so a lot of your political preference is

488
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,500
influenced,
let's say,

489
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,560
by your temperament and a lot of your 
temperament is influenced by biological 

490
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,160
factors,
so there are temperamental reasons to be

491
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:10,670
on the left.

492
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,820
People who are on the left tend to be 
higher and creativity and lowering 

493
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:15,820
conscientiousness for,
for example.

494
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,790
Those are the two best predictors,
but there's also practical reasons to be

495
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,880
on the left and one of the practical 
reasons are that human societies which 

496
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,580
tend to be hierarchical,
like all animal societies are almost all

497
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:33,581
animal societies producing inequality as
they go about their business and 

498
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,350
inequality is actually quite painful.
No one likes it.

499
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
Nobody,
no rich capitalist walks down a busy 

500
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,891
urban street and sees a starving 
homeless person who's clearly mentally 

501
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:49,781
ill suffering madly.
And thanks that evening that inequality 

502
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,500
is okay.
No one thinks that no one's for poverty,

503
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,170
right?
And so we have this moral intuition that

504
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,200
would be better if the downtrodden were 
lifted up and it's difficult to 

505
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,380
discriminate between that and then and 
any quality narrative.

506
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,110
And so I think part of the reason that 
we can't face the,

507
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,490
the lesson of the 20th century is 
because it's the left that mostly has to

508
00:26:09,891 --> 00:26:13,910
face the lesson and they don't know how 
to reconcile their deep intuitions about

509
00:26:13,911 --> 00:26:18,911
the injustice of inequality with the 
fact that when you put that doctrine in 

510
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,320
at work,
into into operation as a political tool,

511
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,380
you instantly stack up millions of 
corpses.

512
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,940
We don't know what to do with that,
and so we just avoid it and that's well.

513
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:32,540
Then of course we risk replicating it,
which is not good.

514
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,560
That's not a good tactical move.
That's a problem.

515
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,820
If we don't learn from history,
we're destined to repeat it.

516
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,620
I entirely accept and some of those 
strategies might be surprised by this.

517
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:44,010
I say I can't understand that

518
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,480
lifting perspective.
I think I can.

519
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:50,481
I can understand the nobility of wanting
to ensure that everyone is respected as 

520
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:53,130
a full member of the of the human 
family,

521
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,340
all of our culture and our society,
but this is where it gets tricky and 

522
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,490
that's where I think many young people 
are starting to wake up.

523
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:02,280
They're being sold a pop.
Do you have that expression in Canada?

524
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,560
No.
Soda Pop.

525
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,780
The Dod is not a sound idea that many of
the things that sound attractive don't 

526
00:27:11,401 --> 00:27:16,401
necessarily work,
so perhaps we need to be arguing the 

527
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:20,181
case for freedom and fairness,
which will produce at least a high 

528
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:26,481
degree of equality of opportunity rather
than arguing for equality,

529
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,950
which history tells us tends to severely
eroded freedom.

530
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,070
It's a harder sale because,
but it's easy to appeal to you

531
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,210
passionate immediately thoughtlessly,
and since that's such an instantaneously

532
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,730
positive moral virtue and you don't need
sophisticated argumentation to buttress 

533
00:27:47,921 --> 00:27:50,140
it,
it's a lot more difficult to make a cold

534
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:55,310
analytical case that the proposition 
freedom first,

535
00:27:55,421 --> 00:27:59,320
let's say freedom and responsibility 
first lifts the bottom up better.

536
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,290
It's a cold argument and it requires

537
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,150
rationality to parse through,
so it's a harder sale.

538
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:06,130
I would argue that it's not just 
rationality,

539
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:11,131
it's history.
If you bring rationality and honesty to 

540
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:11,550
the study of history,
I think,

541
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,500
I think the,
the,

542
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,360
the,
the case is actually quite compelling.

543
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,100
I think it is too.
I think it's open and shot.

544
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,310
I think it's,
it's.

545
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:22,410
Well,
there's a book that I've just been 

546
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,410
reading that I would recommend,
um,

547
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:22,520
by a man named [inaudible],
Walter Shadelle,

548
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,130
and he wrote a book called the great 
leveler,

549
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,280
which I really like.
It's an empirical analysis of 

550
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,711
inequality.
And he had his research questions were 

551
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:32,711
something like,
um,

552
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,100
well,
what,

553
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,250
what is the phenomena of inequality to 
what can you attribute it and what,

554
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,750
if anything,
can we do to ameliorate it?

555
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,470
Okay.
So the first answer is something akin to

556
00:28:45,471 --> 00:28:48,380
what I wrote in the first rule in my 12 
rules for life,

557
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:49,130
which is,
well,

558
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:54,131
you can't lay hierarchy and inequality 
at the feet of western civilization or 

559
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:55,850
capitalism.
We're done with that argument.

560
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,910
That's wrong.
Animal societies are hierarchical and 

561
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:04,901
they produce on equal distributions and 
there's evidence for that in the 

562
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,470
biological realm.
Going back a third of a billion years,

563
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,560
and that's happened for so long that 
your nervous system has primarily 

564
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,910
adapted to it,
so it's a deep reality and blaming it on

565
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:14,840
capitalism.
It's like,

566
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,090
no,
inequality's a big problem.

567
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,700
It's way worse than mark's thought.
Okay,

568
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,820
fine.
And people tend to stack up at zero.

569
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,360
That's a bad thing because it 
destabilizes your society to have people

570
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:31,361
who are so far down in the underclass 
that they have nothing to lose by 

571
00:29:31,361 --> 00:29:35,680
flipping the game.
That's about idea and it drives male on 

572
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,550
male homicide as well in social science.
Evidence for that as clear.

573
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:43,150
Right?
So we want to ameliorate inequality to 

574
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,281
some degree because we want people to 
stack up at zero and d stabilize the 

575
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:47,140
society and we don't want young men in 
particular to become violent.

576
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,900
Fine.
So then shadelle takes another tack.

577
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:54,901
It's like hit his observations.
He looked at Neolithic grave sites for 

578
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:57,990
signs of inequality and you see what 
people are buried with.

579
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,970
And in one of his cases,
there's 200 people in a grave and one of

580
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:05,971
them has 190 pounds of gold and the next
richest person has like four ounces of 

581
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:06,790
gold.
And then everyone else has none.

582
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,170
It's like.
So even in these neolithic societies and

583
00:30:09,171 --> 00:30:14,171
equality was the rule hunter gatherer 
societies or the same way except the 

584
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,640
inequality isn't material because they 
don't have a surplus.

585
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,530
Inequalities everywhere.
Okay.

586
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,870
So then shadelle asks two other 
questions.

587
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,400
One is,
well,

588
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,800
how has it generally been reduced

589
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,220
pestilence and war?
That's it.

590
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,790
So you can reduce it.
Equality if you demolish everything 

591
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:34,950
because that just brings everyone down 
to zero,

592
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,980
but the inequality is less.
And then he does an empirical analysis 

593
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,180
and asked a very interesting practical 
question,

594
00:30:42,181 --> 00:30:47,181
which is imagine that you taught it up,
the inequality coefficients of the right

595
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:52,701
wing societies,
and you did the same with the left wing 

596
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:55,521
societies.
Is there a difference between the 

597
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:55,521
inequality coefficients and you'd hope?
Yes,

598
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,231
because you'd.
You'd hope that what would happen as a 

599
00:31:00,231 --> 00:31:02,661
consequence of activity on the left 
would be that something would actually 

600
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:06,560
occur to ameliorate inequality.
He found no evidence for that 

601
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,801
whatsoever,
so the left is sensitive to the 

602
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,360
catastrophe of inequality,
let's say,

603
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,140
but their compassion oriented doctrines 
designed to ameliorate that on the 

604
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:21,150
positive side.
There's plenty of resentment on the left

605
00:31:21,151 --> 00:31:22,890
to that,
and I don't want to sweep that under the

606
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:28,160
under the rug.
They're compassionate oriented policies 

607
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,860
do not produce an improvement in the 
equal distribution of goods.

608
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,530
So it's a way bigger problem than we 
think.

609
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:39,070
So,
so,

610
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,020
and,
and putting into place these,

611
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,390
these thoughtless,
compassionate doctrines,

612
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:45,430
let's say putting them in place.
Again,

613
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:45,810
it's just gonna

614
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,840
produced exactly the same outcomes that 
were produced all through the 20th 

615
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,511
century.
We must learn again to bring the wisdom 

616
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:55,791
of the past back to the table of today,
if we're to find our way out of the 

617
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,360
malaise,
it's affecting the west,

618
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:58,650
I think,
to a better place.

619
00:31:58,651 --> 00:31:59,630
But before we do that,
yep.

620
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,530
Um,
explore that line of thinking.

621
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:06,830
Let's go back to freedom.
All of the great sages down through the 

622
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,420
age.
I think you make that point in this 

623
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,010
fascinating book of yours.
I'm a obliquely at least,

624
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,420
uh,
particularly though the founder of 

625
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Christianity,
I think would,

626
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,560
would say two

627
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,020
a person that your personal freedom is 
the thing you need to get right and 

628
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:26,000
sorted first.
It's one by one.

629
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:31,050
And I'm thinking of young Australians,
so I feel so passionately about that as 

630
00:32:31,681 --> 00:32:33,300
I say this.
Um,

631
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,350
you know,
it's very easy not to be free,

632
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,600
very easy.
Addiction,

633
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,570
fear,
anxiety,

634
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,360
depression,
all the things that act of discipline,

635
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:47,120
lack of discipline,
your whims.

636
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:52,010
Let's go back to a society which set a 
quality as its goal,

637
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:57,070
Soviet Russia,
and in the pursuit of that equality 

638
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,960
killed 60 or 70 million.
That's the estimate of those who 

639
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,860
disagreed,
who had a different view,

640
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,300
who lost their freedom of those who even
announced their own suffering because in

641
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:13,301
the Soviet Union,
if you dared to say that things weren't 

642
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:13,580
going so well for you,
then you were instantly a political,

643
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
uh,
you were,

644
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:19,901
uh,
you were political criminal for 

645
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:19,901
announcing your own suffering because of
the Utopian already arrived.

646
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:24,700
You understand?
And so if you were still suffering will 

647
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:24,700
obviously there was something wrong with
you.

648
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,790
Yeah.
So imagine a society like that where 

649
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:28,790
your own suffering becomes criminal.
It will.

650
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,720
Exactly.
Yeah.

651
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,160
But let's come to Alexander.
Uh,

652
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,610
we know a lot about what happened 
because of him and he became an 

653
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,180
incredible global figure when I was a 
young man and I read his book.

654
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:46,181
The Gulag archipelago here is as men who
describes the horrors of being a 

655
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:48,370
political prisoner because he disagrees,
he,

656
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,820
he,
he converted.

657
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,680
He was originally a supporter of 
communism.

658
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,700
He came to see how evil it was and how 
oppressive it was.

659
00:33:55,701 --> 00:34:00,701
He was imprisoned for having a different
view to the state ordained insistence 

660
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:07,210
that everything was terrific and he 
writes unbelievably that lying on his 

661
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:12,680
prison bunk one day listening to the 
gods beat up a fellow prisoner,

662
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:13,910
the screams and the yields.

663
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:19,360
He found freedom when he realized the 
dividing line between good and evil in 

664
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,770
fact,
didn't lie between capturing captive.

665
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:22,940
In fact,
the Giles,

666
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:27,941
we're captive to a system,
to a blonde ideology to an inability to 

667
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:32,800
think trustees.
So they were perpetrating the very 

668
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,200
system that imprison them,
not between Catholic and baptist.

669
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:36,830
He wrote,
not between woman and man,

670
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:41,831
not between black and white.
The dividing line between evil actually 

671
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,610
lost somewhere across every human heart 
playing the.

672
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:45,980
You believe it's incredibly important 
that we understand.

673
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,830
That comes back to what you said.
I think when it's framed,

674
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,831
we understand it.
Everyone knows that everyone knows 

675
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,430
because all they have to do is think 
about their own transgressions.

676
00:34:55,431 --> 00:35:00,431
I mean,
if you ask someone to sit for five 

677
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:00,431
minutes and think,
okay,

678
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,460
well what mistakes have you made in your
life?

679
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:05,900
It's like hod that'll come up pretty 
quickly and you can even ask people what

680
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:08,570
terrible unforgivable mistakes have you 
made in your life?

681
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,050
Like,
yeah,

682
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:10,610
yeah.
Well we know about those too.

683
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,760
It's like it's no one's no one's so 
naive,

684
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,810
you know,
unless,

685
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:19,250
unless they've really wrestled intensely
against themselves,

686
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,450
there's virtually no one so naive to not
be able to answer those questions.

687
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,190
So we know that we've done things we 
shouldn't have done and we know that 

688
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,490
we're not living up to our potential 
mean,

689
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,040
but are we doing a truth in a massive 
disservice?

690
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,190
Trying to imply

691
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,600
that there's nothing wrong with them 
now.

692
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,150
You need for guilt,
no need for Shaman.

693
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:44,000
I need to come up with evil because the 
problems,

694
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,020
the environment,
what are the things that so funny about 

695
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,381
what's happening?
The problem is that you've just got to 

696
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:51,381
fix society,
fixing institutions.

697
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:55,860
Well,
and then there'll be all this will 

698
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,220
disappear.
Psychologists have been,

699
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,910
not all psychologists obviously,
but the psychological profession is its 

700
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,300
neck deep in this,
in this pathology has been beating the 

701
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,510
self esteem drum for 50 years.
Oh No,

702
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:08,310
you're okay.
You should feel good about yourself.

703
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,230
Like you're,
you're fine the way you are.

704
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,260
It's like you think,
well that's a calming message for 

705
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,260
people.
It's like,

706
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,260
no,
it's not.

707
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:15,780
It's not at all.
And I watched my audiences.

708
00:36:15,781 --> 00:36:20,781
It's like it's full of people in the 
audience who think I'm suffering a lot 

709
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:21,210
more than I think is tenable a whole 
bunch of.

710
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:26,210
It's my fault.
My life is not in the order it should 

711
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,210
be.
I know I'm doing 50 things wrong.

712
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:26,940
It's like,
what the Hell's wrong with me?

713
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:31,941
What's wrong with the people around me?
This is really serious and some well 

714
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:32,410
meaning person comes up and says,
oh,

715
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,020
you're okay just the way you are.
It's like,

716
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,150
no one wants that message.
It's like,

717
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:37,800
no,
I'm not okay the way I am.

718
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,740
I'm not okay at all the way I am.
I know that.

719
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,450
And so you know,
when I'm,

720
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,570
when I'm speaking to,
when I'm speaking now,

721
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:46,560
I say to people,
well,

722
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,780
you're nowhere near what you could be.
That's the,

723
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,430
that's the positive message.
It's like,

724
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:51,270
yeah,
you're a mass,

725
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:53,960
but you don't have to stay that way as 
you're a master,

726
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,870
you know it.
Obviously you're suffering away like,

727
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,960
like so much you can barely tolerate it.

728
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,250
It's like,
that's okay.

729
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,700
You can do something about it.
So that's the thing that turns the 

730
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,971
lights on.
It's like you could do something about 

731
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:07,971
it.
Like,

732
00:37:07,971 --> 00:37:08,760
oh,
so they're in a freezing prisons hill in

733
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:12,060
the most appalling circumstances.
Half stuff to death.

734
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:17,430
He funds freedom in himself.
He find something positive and something

735
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:20,280
to live for by first coming to grips 
with it,

736
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,620
evil and understanding what it is a 
conundrum in.

737
00:37:22,621 --> 00:37:23,940
Then he said to like,
and,

738
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,950
and he,
he underwent the Christian process of 

739
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,900
Metanoia,
which is to go over your.

740
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,750
It's,
it's,

741
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,680
it's confession essentially.
Unrepentant wasn't mediated by religious

742
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:39,681
structure Solzhenitsyn's case,
but it was exactly the same process and 

743
00:37:39,681 --> 00:37:40,200
he knew that perfectly well.
I'm not making this up.

744
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:45,830
He said when he was in the prisons and 
decided that he was at least in part to 

745
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:50,370
blame for his own imprisonment and the 
imprisonment of everyone around him that

746
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,370
that was his fault or at least his 
response,

747
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,860
both his fault and his responsibility 
that he was going to take that on.

748
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,040
He said the first thing he did was he 
went over his life with a fine tooth 

749
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,700
comb in memory,
and his goal was,

750
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:07,701
okay,
I'm going to remember everything I did 

751
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,680
when in my life up to now where I did 
something that I knew to be wrong and 

752
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:15,570
not because of some external authority 
defining it as wrong,

753
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,820
but in relationship to his own 
conscience.

754
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:18,950
Right?
Um,

755
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,260
and then he was going to determine if 
there was some way that can be rectified

756
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,940
now to atone for it,
right.

757
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,960
To to become at one with it again,
and so that was part of the process he 

758
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,081
undertook and the concluding consequence
of that was that he wrote the Gulag 

759
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:35,220
archipelago,
which is absolutely overwhelming.

760
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,830
That blew the intellectual slats out of 
the foundation of communism permanently.

761
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,350
Right?
One solution isn't published until now.

762
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:49,351
We shouldn't be trying to gloss over.
Academia seems to be full of people who 

763
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:53,311
want to soft pedal and reinstitute this 
naive view that if we just create the 

764
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:58,510
right institutions,
everybody will behave rationally,

765
00:38:58,511 --> 00:39:00,040
will all be equal,
everything will be okay.

766
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,870
They want to reinforce it.
Won't say that,

767
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,460
but that's where they want to do.
They want to enforce it.

768
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,390
Yeah.
Well,

769
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:09,630
I think it's easy and it's only a few 
short decades since all of that 

770
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:09,630
happened.
Yeah.

771
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:09,640
Well,
are we mad?

772
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,060
Well,
we're.

773
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,350
We're characterized by inertia and 
ignorance.

774
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,040
It's not easy.
It's not easy to understand history.

775
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,890
It's especially not if you read it 
properly,

776
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,800
you know,
you read.

777
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,500
I had a client at one point who was an 
unbelievably naive person.

778
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,980
You cannot overestimate her naivete no 
matter how hard you try.

779
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,680
Her parents taught her that,
that adults were angels,

780
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,460
literally,
and she believed that in a strange sense

781
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,770
when I met her,
she was in her twenties and,

782
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,810
uh,
and she had this extraordinarily naive 

783
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:51,800
view of people and had been hurt.
And if you're very naive and you've been

784
00:39:51,801 --> 00:39:56,801
hurt by someone,
you often disintegrate because it blows 

785
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:56,801
your world apart.
That's what had happened to her.

786
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,300
And I said she had a university degree 
and I said,

787
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:00,050
well,
look,

788
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:00,980
like,
um,

789
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,400
in,
in,

790
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:02,480
in the liberal arts.
I said,

791
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:05,090
didn't you read any history?
And she said,

792
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:05,840
well,
yeah.

793
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,260
And I said,
well,

794
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,240
how did not disturb the whole adults are
angels hypothesis?

795
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:12,020
And she said,
well,

796
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,100
I read it,
but I just compartmentalize it.

797
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,780
And that gave me a key to what was wrong
with her and we successfully dealt with 

798
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,431
it.
But I had her to begin her process of 

799
00:40:24,431 --> 00:40:24,500
cure,
oddly enough,

800
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,320
because she had to understand 
malevolence because she had been touched

801
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:28,040
by it,
right?

802
00:40:28,041 --> 00:40:33,041
She had to understand it because her 
naive worldview had been shattered by 

803
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:36,611
the hand of malevolence.
I had to read a book called ordinary 

804
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:36,700
men,
um,

805
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,210
by Browning,
and

806
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,460
it's the study of these Polish 
policeman,

807
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:47,750
a German policemen who were sent to 
Poland after the Nazis had marched 

808
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,721
through Poland and they were sent to 
police Poland and they were know decent 

809
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:55,520
middleclass guys,
essentially most of whom had been hit 

810
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,310
maturity before Hitler had come to 
power.

811
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,680
So they weren't indoctrinated.
Nazis,

812
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:00,090
you know,
not,

813
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,120
not like the Nazi youth types were.
And they had to go to Poland and and be 

814
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:11,761
policemen under wartime conditions.
And they had a very humane commander and

815
00:41:12,251 --> 00:41:17,251
he told all of them that they were going
to have to do things that would be far 

816
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:18,820
more brutal in all likelihood that they 
were normally prepared to do in.

817
00:41:18,821 --> 00:41:20,830
They're in Seville,
in the role as,

818
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:22,540
as,
as non military policemen,

819
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,720
but that they could go back to their old
job if they wanted to.

820
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,930
So it wasn't top down enforcement of an 
authoritarian ethos and browning 

821
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,100
documents their transformation.

822
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:35,180
The guy next door,
you know,

823
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:38,420
the policeman next door and to people 
who were taking naked pregnant women out

824
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:43,421
into fields and shooting them in the 
back of the head and it's a brutal book 

825
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:46,900
because while these men that's like,
it just ruined the to do that to 

826
00:41:47,391 --> 00:41:52,391
themselves.
They were physically ill during the 

827
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:52,391
process of transformation,
you know,

828
00:41:52,391 --> 00:41:56,831
and,
and he does a very good job of 

829
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:58,040
documenting how an ordinary person 
transforms into a,

830
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,620
a Nazi murderer.
And I had to read that.

831
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,450
I said,
but don't you compartmentalize it?

832
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,980
This is about you,
right?

833
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,030
This isn't about someone else.
When you read history you think,

834
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:09,680
well that's about someone else.
It's like,

835
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,710
unless maybe you're a victim and you 
identify with the victims,

836
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:17,711
it's a very rare person who reads 
history and identifies with the 

837
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:19,310
perpetrators.
But unless you read history and identify

838
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:24,311
with the perpetrators,
then you don't understand history at 

839
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:24,311
all.

840
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,310
And so who wants to understand that?
And I get my students.

841
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:25,940
I said,
look,

842
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,890
I've told him this for 30 years.
Here's something you have to understand.

843
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,940
If you were in Nazi Germany,
the statistical probability is 

844
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,380
overwhelming that you would have been a 
perpetrator,

845
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,580
right?
You think you would have rescued and 

846
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:44,580
frank.
It's like,

847
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,320
think again.
Those people are very,

848
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,490
very,
very,

849
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:51,700
very rare.
They put their lives on the line to do 

850
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,671
that.
They put their family's lives on the 

851
00:42:54,671 --> 00:42:56,441
line to do that.
You think you're one of those people 

852
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:57,680
really like that.
All that means is that you know nothing.

853
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,860
You know nothing about yourself.
You know nothing about people you know 

854
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,290
nothing about politics or economics or 
history.

855
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:07,410
It's a harsh lesson by truth about 
Germany in the 19 thirties.

856
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,820
It was probably the most educated 
society,

857
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:11,860
the world,
and seen to that point in time.

858
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,170
Education alone,
cleverness in inverted commas alone,

859
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,410
intelligence alone,
civil right,

860
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:23,440
right,
right.

861
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,320
So absolutely there's no substitute for 
character.

862
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:31,860
So we don't want pascal cold about the 
cold talk to the glory and the scum to 

863
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:40,981
reach our full humanity.
It seems to me we need to understand 

864
00:43:40,981 --> 00:43:42,520
both intention now,
Carl Young,

865
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,550
the unbelievable scum that laws in terms
of our potential at the bottom of every 

866
00:43:48,461 --> 00:43:51,200
heart,
the extraordinary nobility,

867
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,500
you call it the spark of divinity,
I would say,

868
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,770
made in the image of an of a mighty 
creator.

869
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,670
You've got to hold those things in 
suspension if you're,

870
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,680
if you've defined your real humanity and
in fact have a good place is surely 

871
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,630
through the valley of darkness in the 
first place.

872
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,700
You know,
that's you think,

873
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:11,170
well,
if it's possible to be enlightened,

874
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:11,190
heightened,

875
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,230
why isn't everyone enlightened?
It's like,

876
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:15,390
well,
you don't get to paradise.

877
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:17,730
You don't get to heaven without 
Harrowing Health First.

878
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,800
Right?
And who's going to do that?

879
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,550
Like that's a terrible thing to do.
It isn't even clear that you can survive

880
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:24,550
it.
No,

881
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,340
I mean it's,
it's,

882
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:31,320
it's brutally damaging to come to terms 
with your own proclivity for malevolence

883
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,480
and so people don't do it and it's no 
wonder.

884
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,670
But,
but the funny thing is,

885
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:37,350
and this is also something that I think 
that,

886
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,170
that people have been watching,
my lectures have been attracted by,

887
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:44,040
especially the young man.
It's like until you know your,

888
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,380
until you understand that you're a 
monster,

889
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,710
until perhaps you even develop that as a
capacity.

890
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,690
You don't have the moral forced to do 
good,

891
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,930
and so not only is that dissent to begin
with,

892
00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:00,990
s s necessary to scare you straight,
right to make you understand what 

893
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,931
exactly it is that you're dealing with,
but you don't even have the strength of 

894
00:45:05,931 --> 00:45:09,231
character to be good until you 
understand just exactly what sort of 

895
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:09,231
monster you can be.

896
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:10,540
I have a rule in my book,
rule five,

897
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,060
do not let your children do anything 
that makes you dislike them.

898
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,500
It's a meditation on the monstrousness 
of parents.

899
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:22,680
It's like,
don't underestimate yourself,

900
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,550
your capability to ruin your children's 
lives.

901
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,900
You let them act in a manner that makes 
you disapprove of them.

902
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,260
You will take revenge on them in ways 
you cannot even imagine.

903
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,130
Unless you understand that you're not 
going to be careful enough as a parent 

904
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:40,260
and you're not going to set proper 
boundaries,

905
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,550
don't let your children and Noi you.
It's a very bad idea.

906
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Now you know that means that you should 
try to regulate your proclivity to be 

907
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,811
annoyed and you should try to be 
civilized and you should talk to your 

908
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,781
partner,
your wife or your husband about your 

909
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:58,320
oversensitivities and foolishness.
But having said that,

910
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,140
you need to know who the monster is and 
it's you.

911
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,680
So,
so if we're washing that wisdom out,

912
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,710
I don't want to sound condemnatory here 
are more sympathetic and concern for 

913
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:10,160
what's happening in our family homes 
and,

914
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,450
and the environment in which our kids 
are being raised.

915
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,180
And you and I,
I mean,

916
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:17,850
you're very passionate in your concern 
for those people.

917
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:22,851
So we don't want anyone to think he had.
We're trying to condemn them for the 

918
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:22,851
opposite.
Just the opposite.

919
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:23,790
But if we're watching this out of the 
system,

920
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:28,020
what then happens to our kids when they 
hit institutions,

921
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,270
schools,
colleges,

922
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,710
universities.

923
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:34,430
Well,
we're gonna.

924
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,440
Find out because increasingly the 
elementary and the school systems that 

925
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:46,341
our kids are going through from say the 
age of five to the age of 18 are 

926
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:48,620
increasingly occupied by the postmodern 
neo Marxists theologies.

927
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,020
Um,
I think we have to learn to identify 

928
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,150
what those are.
That's a start.

929
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,040
I mean there's buzzwords,
diversity,

930
00:46:56,041 --> 00:46:58,560
inclusivity,
equity,

931
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:00,020
equity,
that's a,

932
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,770
that's a no go zone.
Equity,

933
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,400
that's equality of outcome.
That's a preposterous murderous doctrine

934
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:08,910
masquerading in sheep's clothing.
Um,

935
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,250
white privilege,
systemic racism,

936
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,930
gender,
all of those.

937
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,080
None of those as individual topics 
aren't necessarily off the table,

938
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,140
you know,
and you can have an intelligent 

939
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,210
discussion about any of them except 
equity because that's just a no go zone.

940
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,640
But to see those,
those,

941
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,910
those concepts emerge as a,
as a network of meaning,

942
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,520
you know,
that you're in the presence of this,

943
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,280
this pernicious,
postmodern,

944
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,520
Neo Marxist doctrine that's 
fundamentally ideological at its core.

945
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,520
And people need to see that and they 
need to understand what that means and 

946
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,870
they need to stop it.
Now how they're going to stop it,

947
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,620
they're going to make a million 
individual decisions about that,

948
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,930
but at least they could start by 
identifying,

949
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:50,170
and I've suggested to parents in,
in Canada,

950
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:55,290
in the US,
that as soon as teachers talk to their 

951
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,830
children about diversity,
inclusivity and equity,

952
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,800
that they,
they suggest to their children that they

953
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:03,250
leave the class because they're no 
longer in the educational realm.

954
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:06,070
They're in the indoctrination realm and 
people aren't taking that.

955
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,710
I wouldn't say they're not taking that 
seriously.

956
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:10,870
It's not an easy thing to figure out and
it sounds very,

957
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:12,010
very radical to,
to,

958
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,240
to suggest,
you know,

959
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,730
encouraging your children to leave the 
class.

960
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,970
But I think we're at that point,
we wonder why our universities in our 

961
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,710
high quality courses in how freedom was 
secured by Western societies for its 

962
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:29,860
individual member,
uh,

963
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,270
people,
uh,

964
00:48:31,271 --> 00:48:36,271
and how it might be secured and how you 
secured fairness from unfairness.

965
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,030
Those sorts of things are not there.
Well,

966
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:45,031
some of it,
I think some of it has to do with what 

967
00:48:45,031 --> 00:48:45,860
we've been speaking about is that to,
to,

968
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:50,920
to address the problem squarely is 
actually quite daunting.

969
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,490
We knew the difficulties are manifold.
Inequality is real,

970
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,940
individual malevolence is real.
To constrain it inside yourself is 

971
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,960
extraordinarily daunting.
To read history as a perpetrator is 

972
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,350
traumatizing.
These are hard things,

973
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,500
and then to think through the problems 
of addressing something like inequality 

974
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:13,950
instead of reacting to it in a knee 
jerk,

975
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:18,990
compassionate manner in that and 
implement policies on that basis that 

976
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:21,910
are going to be counterproductive.
That's also extraordinarily difficult.

977
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,300
So there's difficulty is part of it,
and then I would also say,

978
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:31,200
well,
we haven't talked about the resentment 

979
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,200
that drives the discussion of 
inequality.

980
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,070
It's not all.
It's not like every one on the left is 

981
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,060
overwhelmed by compassion and that's why
all these brutal things tend to happen.

982
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:42,420
It's that they're also overwhelmed by 
the same sort of jealousy that Kayden 

983
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,441
had for Abel and the same sort of 
murderous impulses that emerge very 

984
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,290
rapidly.
As a consequence of that jealousy.

985
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,140
He has more than me.
He must be a perpetrator.

986
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,200
It's morally obligatory for me to take 
him out.

987
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:58,030
That's an easy message to sell.
I read about how the communists deep,

988
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:01,960
Deep Kula cooler heist the Russian 
countryside.

989
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,860
So imagine,
imagine Russia,

990
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,290
you're in a village,
it's 30 years,

991
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,170
something like that.
After the service have been emancipated,

992
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,290
there's a few agriculturalists who've 
managed to produce successful 

993
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:18,640
agricultural enterprises and you know,
maybe they have a couple of cows,

994
00:50:18,641 --> 00:50:23,641
they have some land,
they're able to hire a few people and 

995
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:23,641
they're raising almost all the foot.
Right?

996
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,860
And so.
And they're a minority in any village 

997
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,470
because the hyper productive successful 
are always a minority.

998
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,940
So they're minority in every village.

999
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,710
All right.
And so and,

1000
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,780
and there's people who are doing worse 
and then there's a lot of people who 

1001
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,491
aren't doing so well at all and then the
communist intellectual show up and they 

1002
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:43,700
tell the people who aren't doing so 
well,

1003
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:45,740
some of whom are just suffering because 
of life,

1004
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:50,741
but some of whom aren't doing well 
because they've never done anything 

1005
00:50:50,741 --> 00:50:51,650
productive with even a second of their 
life.

1006
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,960
And the communist intellectuals come in 
and say,

1007
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,730
you know,
those guys that are doing so much better

1008
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:56,990
than you.
Yeah,

1009
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,260
they actually stole that from you and 
you're morally obligated to go take it 

1010
00:51:03,591 --> 00:51:04,370
back.
It's like,

1011
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:05,780
Oh man,
you know,

1012
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,350
after after six cups of mead,
let's say,

1013
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:14,470
or let's say 10 or let's say 20 and I'm 
drunk out of my mind and I've got my 

1014
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:15,950
crew of buddies with me and we're all 
resentful,

1015
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:20,951
right to the core because we've wasted 
our miserable lives and now we have an 

1016
00:51:20,951 --> 00:51:24,431
opportunity to go like down the street 
to our wealthy neighbors house and to 

1017
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:26,510
rape his daughters and we can do it in 
the name of good.

1018
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:27,020
It's like,
well,

1019
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:32,021
there's a story you can market.
And that happened everywhere in the 

1020
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:32,810
Soviet Union,
and so they wiped out the Kulaks.

1021
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,470
It's like,
great.

1022
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:35,390
And then 6 million Ukrainian starve to 
death.

1023
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:36,620
Right.
Brilliant.

1024
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,770
I'm a Pharma.
Brilliant.

1025
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:39,950
Do your crime was the breadbasket of 
Europe.

1026
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:45,460
That's what it was.
Then it became a region pathetically 

1027
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,000
unable to feed itself and yet the same 
sort of world view that gave rise to 

1028
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:56,081
that.
We're now being told you use the word 

1029
00:51:56,081 --> 00:51:56,081
neo Marxist.
Uh,

1030
00:51:56,081 --> 00:52:00,520
many people in Australia use the word 
cultural Marxist have got an old friend 

1031
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:00,820
who said to me,
uh,

1032
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,480
what are you talking about,
John?

1033
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,110
And I free capitalist Australia is not 
going to let that happen here.

1034
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:13,210
Well,
Quanta's airlines took a nice step 

1035
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,101
towards that the other day and they 
adopted their language policing 

1036
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:15,230
policies.
These corporate,

1037
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:20,380
these corporations who should know far 
better let these far left fifth columns 

1038
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,671
into their organizations.
They think they're not going to pay for 

1039
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:27,401
that.
I think they're going to stop with some 

1040
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:27,401
demands for the reconstruction of 
language.

1041
00:52:27,401 --> 00:52:30,470
Not like the demands for reconstruction 
of language by the way are trivial.

1042
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,250
There may be the most important thing 
you could possibly demand,

1043
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,290
right?
I want to reshape the way you speak.

1044
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,310
I want to reshape the way you think.
It was like,

1045
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,930
oh,
that's okay.

1046
00:52:38,931 --> 00:52:40,880
As long as it doesn't interfere with the
bottom line.

1047
00:52:40,881 --> 00:52:43,040
It's like huddle interfere with the 
bottom line.

1048
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,550
You let that fifth column in.
It's a warning to corporate people.

1049
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,320
You let that fifth column in,
man,

1050
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,750
you're gonna regret it.
You're going to regret it.

1051
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,480
So.
And things can turn on a dime.

1052
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:56,180
You know,
a very well organized minority,

1053
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,980
even if the majority of poses them and,
and they do very well organized minority

1054
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:03,420
can have an unbelievably pernicious 
effect on,

1055
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:04,820
uh,
on our organization.

1056
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,850
Margaret Mead's made that point when a 
small group of people decided to change 

1057
00:53:10,181 --> 00:53:12,380
its direction that that's the way 
history works.

1058
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:17,470
Well,
that's what happened in the 

1059
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,251
universities.
It's come back to this issue of the 

1060
00:53:18,251 --> 00:53:21,050
redefining of language.
It seems to me that there are two things

1061
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:24,090
that people would want to reshape 
society and brutal ways,

1062
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,680
uh,
do.

1063
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:26,220
The first

1064
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,980
is they start the silence,
good debate.

1065
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,860
Either silence or shut it down or 
whatever.

1066
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,350
Second thing they do is they redefined 
language.

1067
00:53:34,351 --> 00:53:39,300
So it's very hard to have a debate.
So diversity actually,

1068
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:43,230
I mean there's no other way to put it in
this country is rapidly coming to mean a

1069
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:47,100
stifling conformity.
You cannot not deviate from the line.

1070
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:49,710
Uh,
and you see it with a whole lot of other

1071
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:54,711
words that are bandied around.
Equality being one of them because it's 

1072
00:53:54,841 --> 00:53:56,440
confused.
Equality of opportunities,

1073
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,850
confused with the quality of our.

1074
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,280
Well,
the initial wedge was equality of 

1075
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,300
opportunity.
And that flu and and so while.

1076
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:03,630
No,
no,

1077
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,270
it's equality of outcome.
That's equity and that's,

1078
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,360
I cannot believe how rapidly that idea,
which is the ultimate and terrible 

1079
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,951
ideas.
I can't believe how rapidly that spread 

1080
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:16,980
and how little people criticize it.
Well,

1081
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,340
that's a couple it to uninformed 
analysis.

1082
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,450
It sounds good if you're feeling 
carelessly.

1083
00:54:23,451 --> 00:54:23,530
Okay.

1084
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:28,590
Passionate.
Because you got back to the Ukrainian 

1085
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,440
example in destroying the leading edge 
farmers.

1086
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,630
You actually guaranteed misery forever.

1087
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,100
Oh,
on unbelievable.

1088
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,790
People were selling human body parts in 
the Ukraine for food.

1089
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:38,990
You know,
it was.

1090
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:44,170
If you were a mother and your children 
were starving and you went out into the 

1091
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:48,251
fields after they were harvested and you
picked up individual pieces of grain 

1092
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:52,220
that the harvesters had left and you 
didn't turn them over to the state.

1093
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,560
That was a capital offense.
Right.

1094
00:54:55,250 --> 00:55:00,250
That's,
that was the funny thing is that that 

1095
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:00,590
was in the glory days of the Russian 
revolution,

1096
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:02,540
right?
That wasn't in the 19 fifties.

1097
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:05,300
That wasn't in the 19 thirties even.
That was in the 19 twenties.

1098
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:08,210
That was right when this started and I 
think it was,

1099
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,780
I think it was Malcolm Muggeridge who 
was reporting on that for,

1100
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,480
for a UK newspaper,
whose name escapes me at the moment.

1101
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,210
He was pointing all this out and no one 
paid it.

1102
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,020
Attention,
attention towards the end of his life.

1103
00:55:20,021 --> 00:55:25,021
He warned that the west is in danger of 
eating itself out from within and I 

1104
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,651
wonder whether in fact he wasn't being 
very appreciative and you and I want to 

1105
00:55:28,651 --> 00:55:29,020
stop that happening for the sake of our 
young people,

1106
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,490
for the sake of everyone.
We went down that pathway already.

1107
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,560
We need to do that things.
History should be like science in the 

1108
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,381
sense that it ought to be objective,
but ought to be told truthfully it was 

1109
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:47,130
not to be used to secure some dominant 
groups,

1110
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:52,360
preferred version of society.

1111
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,610
Well,
this is also why.

1112
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,390
See what I've been trying to do about 
this because I've thought this through.

1113
00:55:56,391 --> 00:55:57,440
A long time ago,
I thought,

1114
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,240
well,
I don't want to.

1115
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,510
I think the group identity game ends in 
blood.

1116
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,850
It doesn't matter who plays it.
Left wingers,

1117
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:08,600
play it blood right wingers,
play it lots and lots of it,

1118
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,630
not just a little bit.
You can't play the identity politics 

1119
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:13,630
game.
Also,

1120
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,800
what do you do instead you.
You live the mythologically heroic life 

1121
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,470
as an individual.
That's the right place to work and 

1122
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,130
that's the message of the as far as I'm 
concerned,

1123
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,190
is that we figured that out.
We figured out that the collective 

1124
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,820
identity was not the pinnacle statement 
that the individual,

1125
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,980
not the collective identities have no 
value.

1126
00:56:32,981 --> 00:56:37,360
Obviously family has value and and and,
and your organizations have value,

1127
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:39,100
all of that.
That's not the issue.

1128
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:44,200
The issue is what's the paramount value?
What's the metric by which people should

1129
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:47,710
be measured and the answer is they 
should be measured as individuals,

1130
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,950
as if they have a divine soul.
It should be measured in that manner,

1131
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:53,390
but it can't be a selfish thing.
That is to say,

1132
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,740
if I recognize I have worth and dignity,
I'm obliged to recognize it.

1133
00:56:57,741 --> 00:56:58,220
So you,

1134
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:03,350
Huh?
I think you can recognize that you have 

1135
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,170
intrinsic worth and dignity without also
doing without also recognizing and then 

1136
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:10,301
others and vice versa.
I don't think that I can recognize the 

1137
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,731
worth of another person without,
without stumbling onto the idea that I 

1138
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:17,811
also have to recognize that for myself.
When did you think while everyone would 

1139
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:17,811
want that,
but what?

1140
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:22,611
People don't because you're also charged
with the responsibility of your own care

1141
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:24,740
as if you matter.
Well,

1142
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:29,741
that's a big responsibility.
Like it's a lot easier to assume that 

1143
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,220
everything is pointless.
I mean that's painful and all of that,

1144
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:32,890
but.
Well,

1145
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:35,400
you don't bear any responsibility and no
one lives that way.

1146
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,000
No,
no.

1147
00:57:36,001 --> 00:57:37,240
Well No.
Not for long.

1148
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:37,770
Not for long.

1149
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,210
Exactly.
But you know,

1150
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,430
Voltaire's biographer wasn't actually 
vegetarian,

1151
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,510
so if it was a lady hit rowdy's,
well one of the mini biographies of him 

1152
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:51,510
in the Nineteen thirties came up with 
that adage,

1153
00:57:51,511 --> 00:57:54,150
summarizing his views that I may 
disagree with you,

1154
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,910
but I'll defend to the death your right 
to say it.

1155
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,660
There's a couple of things implicit in 
that that seemed to be incredibly 

1156
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:02,700
important,
so I may disagree with you,

1157
00:58:02,701 --> 00:58:07,590
but you have dignity and standing and 
worth and a right to put your view.

1158
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,200
That's the first thing,
I'm respecting the other person or you 

1159
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,200
should crave it.
Yeah,

1160
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,480
and the second thing it implies is that 
the idea on the table that's important 

1161
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:21,891
for two reasons.
One is we need to have a debate about 

1162
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:21,891
that.
Not attack the person who put it there,

1163
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:22,860
show some respect for.
The second thing is

1164
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:27,420
only bond,
almost debate that you find the best way

1165
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:32,430
forward.
That's the thing that then that ties 

1166
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:34,791
back to the discussion we had about the 
purpose of memory and the purpose of of 

1167
00:58:34,791 --> 00:58:34,791
historical education.
It's like,

1168
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:40,160
look,
there's a rule in my book which is rule 

1169
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,401
nine,
assuming that the person that you're 

1170
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:43,401
listening to know something,
you don't,

1171
00:58:43,401 --> 00:58:47,210
well,
they do the person you're listening to 

1172
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:47,210
know some things you don't.
You can be sure of that.

1173
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,410
Now whether or not you can get to them 
is a different matter,

1174
00:58:49,411 --> 00:58:52,200
but if you do get to them,
it's a real deal for you.

1175
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,040
That's why you want to listen to the 
other person's argument says,

1176
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:57,390
because you're not everything you could 
be.

1177
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,480
You don't know the pathway forward with 
as much clarity as you could and it's 

1178
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,290
possible.
This is one of the wonderful things that

1179
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,870
I've had the privilege of experiencing 
as a clinician,

1180
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,310
you know,
because people,

1181
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:11,220
it's like I live inside a Dostoyevsky 
novel as a clinician.

1182
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:16,580
People come in and they tell me about 
their lives and I listened to them and 

1183
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,060
they tell me things that are just 
absolutely beyond belief,

1184
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:23,090
you know,
and I learn from my clients constantly 

1185
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,970
there.
They're telling me honestly about their 

1186
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:28,931
experience.
They tell me things they wouldn't tell 

1187
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:28,931
anyone else because I actually listened 
to them,

1188
00:59:28,931 --> 00:59:30,350
but part of the reason I listened is 
because I'm desperate to listen.

1189
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:34,250
It's like there's a possibility I'm 
going to do something stupid in the next

1190
00:59:34,251 --> 00:59:36,140
five years that's going to be like 
fatal.

1191
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:41,320
And there's some small possibility that 
if we have a decent discussion that 

1192
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,600
you'll tell me something that will 
eliminate some of my blindness so that I

1193
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:46,880
don't have to fall into that particular 
pitt.

1194
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,090
And if you have a good sensitivity for 
the depth of the pit,

1195
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,120
then you know you're pretty bloody 
motivated to avoid it.

1196
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,370
And so,
and that and that,

1197
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,050
that dialogue is,
it's,

1198
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,240
it's dialogic,
it's Daya Logos,

1199
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:00,500
right?
It's shared logos.

1200
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,560
It's the way that we redeem ourselves 
mutually moving forward,

1201
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:08,910
have old,
depends on having the facts on the 

1202
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:08,910
table,
especially you're able to establish them

1203
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:11,510
not distortions,
effect,

1204
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:15,680
not what you wish would be the case,
at least your best approximation of what

1205
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:19,210
you think to be true and not what you 
wish for Helen,

1206
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,810
because it never seems to be a,
if I disagree with what you say,

1207
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:28,820
Oh,
painted as hate speech or challenging to

1208
01:00:28,821 --> 01:00:33,821
my notions of diversity and 
inclusiveness on all fought to the 

1209
01:00:33,821 --> 01:00:35,240
death.
Your right to even have your say.

1210
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,730
Well that's why hate speech laws are so 
pernicious.

1211
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,980
It's like.
And that needs to be taken apart.

1212
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:44,330
First question,
is there such a thing as hate speech?

1213
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,290
Yes.
Obviously people say terrible things,

1214
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:52,220
reprehensible things,
quasi criminal things even all the time.

1215
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,040
Brutal.
And some of them cause a lot of trouble.

1216
01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,070
So the idea that there's hateful speech,
it's like,

1217
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:58,520
yeah,
okay,

1218
01:00:58,521 --> 01:00:59,990
that's self evident.
No problem.

1219
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,850
Well,
let's regulate it.

1220
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:03,830
Okay,
fair enough.

1221
01:01:03,831 --> 01:01:05,000
Because it's hateful,
you know,

1222
01:01:05,001 --> 01:01:07,520
maybe we'd rather that there wasn't any 
of it.

1223
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:09,980
Okay,
no problem.

1224
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:13,450
Who defines hate?
Well,

1225
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,260
we'll worry about that later.
It's like,

1226
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:15,890
no,
you won't.

1227
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:20,060
That's actually the problem.
Here's the answer to who defines hate?

1228
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,020
Those people that you would least want 
to have defined it.

1229
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:29,530
That will be the inevitable consequence 
of the legislation because sensible 

1230
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:29,750
people won't have anything to do with 
that.

1231
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:35,170
Like people who are power mad will 
gravitate to that domain to make an 

1232
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:41,050
ethical case to exercise their 
controlling power over the language of 

1233
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:41,840
other people know.
And I have had journalists say,

1234
01:01:41,841 --> 01:01:46,841
well,
what makes you think that you're right 

1235
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:46,841
to free speech?

1236
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:47,300
Trump's the right of someone to not be 
offended.

1237
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,630
And I think that's really the level of 
our political discourse.

1238
01:01:50,631 --> 01:01:55,631
Okay,
so we'll run a little thought 

1239
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:55,631
experiment.
So I'm talking to one person.

1240
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:56,330
I'm talking to you and the rule is I 
don't get to offend you.

1241
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,870
Okay.
Maybe we can still have a discussion 

1242
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:04,421
about something difficult,
but let's say I'm talking to 10 people 

1243
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,860
and about an important thing.
Now I have to make sure that I don't say

1244
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:11,861
anything to fight despite the fact that 
this isn't important and contentious 

1245
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:14,831
issue,
that I don't say anything that offends 

1246
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:14,831
even one of those 10 people.
Okay,

1247
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:19,571
maybe I can even manage that.
What if I'm talking to a thousand 

1248
01:02:19,571 --> 01:02:22,481
people?
There's going to be somewhat in that 

1249
01:02:22,481 --> 01:02:25,731
thousand people,
there's going to be someone who's 

1250
01:02:25,731 --> 01:02:27,771
offended at the mere fact that I exist,
so it's an impossible standard.

1251
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,610
It's like,
well,

1252
01:02:29,611 --> 01:02:31,860
you can't say anything offensive.
Okay,

1253
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:33,630
fine.
Then you can't say anything.

1254
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,570
Okay,
so what?

1255
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,150
You don't get to say anything because no
one should be offended.

1256
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,700
Well then you don't get to think,
well,

1257
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:46,701
what happens if you don't think,
well then you can't negotiate your way 

1258
01:02:46,701 --> 01:02:49,200
through the future and you fall into a 
pit and so does everyone else.

1259
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:54,800
So that's where that all ends up.
You can't say offensive things equals 

1260
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,660
you cannot negotiate your way properly 
through the future equals everyone 

1261
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,080
suffers.
Well,

1262
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,280
that's a bad.
That's a bad strategy.

1263
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:10,120
So and it's.
And it's all covered up with,

1264
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,730
well,
you know what?

1265
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:13,290
Be better if no one was ever offended.
It's like,

1266
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:18,291
well,
who thinks that you know how naive you 

1267
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,560
have to be to think that how you have to
be pathologically naive,

1268
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:23,560
which is the kind of naive that you 
could have grown out of,

1269
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,990
but you willfully refused to because you
weren't willing to see what was in front

1270
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:33,991
of your face and then you impose that 
blind naivety on everyone else because 

1271
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:38,770
you don't want to allow them to upset 
your like rosy view,

1272
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,050
your rosy view of yourself and the 
world.

1273
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:46,430
It's just there's no end to how terrible
that is.

1274
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:51,450
Yes,
so one of our very astute writers 

1275
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:54,990
recently made the comment that freedom 
of speech is the most important freedom 

1276
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:59,140
because it's the freedom by which we 
defend all about other freedoms.

1277
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:04,690
It strikes me that freedom of speech 
though is most important,

1278
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,840
not for the powerful of the elites.
It's actually for the minority groups.

1279
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:16,870
A free society surely is one that allows
those who swim against the tide and have

1280
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:21,871
a different perspective.
The right to do so without fear of mob 

1281
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,770
or state sanction.

1282
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,430
I,
I,

1283
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:31,490
you've had some personal experience 
while I gave a talk and the University 

1284
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:35,770
of British Columbia about a year ago,
it was called leftwing case for freedom 

1285
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:38,771
of speech.
It's like it's really easy to make a 

1286
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:38,771
left wing case for freedom of speech.
It's like,

1287
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:39,140
well,
that's how I dispossessed.

1288
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:42,590
How have the opportunity to make their 
suffering known,

1289
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:43,610
right?
Yeah.

1290
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,810
Clearly.
I mean it's,

1291
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:49,811
it's the fact that that argument even 
has to be made shows you how 

1292
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:54,491
pathological the radical left has become
because it's clearly the case that 

1293
01:04:54,491 --> 01:04:58,580
freedom of speech is not generally in 
the interests of the power elite,

1294
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,180
right?
Because they already have access to,

1295
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,820
to what they need to maintain their grip
on the world.

1296
01:05:04,850 --> 01:05:07,040
Let's say.
If you look at those in that manner,

1297
01:05:07,041 --> 01:05:12,041
it's the people at the bottom of the 
hierarchy who's right to expression 

1298
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,130
needs to be protected.
If you're in control of the debate,

1299
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,120
you don't need freedom of speech.

1300
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:19,580
Right,
and obviously so it's useful for the 

1301
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:23,071
dispossessed of freedom of speech issue.
And then the other issue that you wrote 

1302
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:26,860
that the writer that you described,
rope a rope,

1303
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,460
brought to the forefront,
is the idea of the hierarchy of rights.

1304
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:34,390
Now in our,
in our conception of rights in Canada,

1305
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:39,420
we're not willing to assume that any 
reit has priority over any other right 

1306
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:43,470
now,
that doesn't work out because when the 

1307
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:43,470
two rights come into conflict with one 
another,

1308
01:05:43,470 --> 01:05:47,341
which they do,
you have to adjudicate their relative 

1309
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:49,981
status.
And what's happened in Canada is that 

1310
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:50,140
equality rights keep trumping everything
else and that's not good.

1311
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:55,290
It's actually a good reason why you 
shouldn't have a bill of rights and we 

1312
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:55,300
never should have had one in my 
estimation,

1313
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,800
but whatever the freedom of speech,
you say,

1314
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:00,720
well,
speeches,

1315
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,840
the,
the right to freedom of speech is 

1316
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:05,840
central because it's the right by which 
you defend all the other rights.

1317
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,020
Well,
that's why the idea of logos in the West

1318
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:10,330
is the most sacred concept,
right?

1319
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:13,540
The cause of Christ.
Think about this psychologically,

1320
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:16,660
is Christ is the,
is the ideal of perfection.

1321
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:19,180
Now,
this is the independent of any religious

1322
01:06:19,181 --> 01:06:20,860
discussion,
any historical accuracy.

1323
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:25,861
It doesn't matter.
We're looking at this from the 

1324
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:25,861
perspective of the analysis of a myth or
story.

1325
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,990
What Christ represents is the perfect 
individual,

1326
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:30,670
whatever that is.
Now,

1327
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:35,700
you discussed endlessly what that is,
but one of the things the West has 

1328
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:36,090
settled on is the idea.
Well,

1329
01:06:36,091 --> 01:06:38,860
that is that the perfect individual 
otters,

1330
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:43,330
the truthful speech that makes potential
into habitable order,

1331
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:48,420
does that through truth.
Now it's embedded in the first few 

1332
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:48,420
sentences in,
in genesis,

1333
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:49,000
for example,
when,

1334
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:49,870
when,
when,

1335
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:54,960
when God brings the world into being so 
and and the idea that that truthful 

1336
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,950
speech that brings the world into being 
from formulas,

1337
01:06:56,951 --> 01:06:59,140
potential also characterize as each 
person.

1338
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,370
That's our,
our,

1339
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:01,470
our,
our,

1340
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,560
for our fabrication in the image of God.
That's the idea of the West.

1341
01:07:05,561 --> 01:07:10,561
It's unbelievably remarkable idea that 
perfection individual perfection is to 

1342
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,170
be found in a relationship with spoken 
truth.

1343
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:15,240
God,
that's,

1344
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,950
that's a great idea.
Well,

1345
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:22,210
it's out of that arises the observation 
that there's no,

1346
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:27,900
there's nothing more central to the 
hierarchy of rights and obligations as 

1347
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:28,090
well,
let's say.

1348
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,070
Then freedom of speech.
Yes,

1349
01:07:30,071 --> 01:07:35,071
it's absolutely central.
That's why Christ is the word made 

1350
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:38,731
flesh.
The idea is that the perfect individual 

1351
01:07:38,731 --> 01:07:38,830
is the person who's,
while who speaks truth,

1352
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:41,200
but also acts out the truth of those 
words,

1353
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,990
it's a very,
it's a,

1354
01:07:44,050 --> 01:07:49,050
it's a proposition who's merit is 
virtually self evident when you 

1355
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:50,380
understand it in that manner.
So yeah,

1356
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:53,140
I keep two,
two c assaults on freedom of speech,

1357
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:54,730
especially compelled speech.
Well,

1358
01:07:54,731 --> 01:07:56,860
that's where I drew the line in,
in my life.

1359
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,770
It was like preps that's held speech 
legislation in Canada.

1360
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:05,130
Perhaps that's why the lift so 
determined in this country to get 

1361
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,270
Christianity out of the classroom,
but to lose something of the children.

1362
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:08,980
There's no doubt.
That's why they're determined.

1363
01:08:08,981 --> 01:08:13,981
I mean people like Derrida,
I mean he called the West Fowl logo 

1364
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:13,981
centric,
right?

1365
01:08:13,981 --> 01:08:17,360
Male dominated logos centric.
It's like that is the west.

1366
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:19,940
It's a logo centric.
If you want to take the west down,

1367
01:08:19,941 --> 01:08:24,620
you remove the idea of the divine word 
from the substructure of the society,

1368
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,700
so you have to do that.
It's like,

1369
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:29,120
and this is the level at which this war 
is being fought,

1370
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:32,290
it's fundamentally a theological war.
Interesting.

1371
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,320
Like to think that,
but it is a famous Waterloo lectures 

1372
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:42,430
blaze Pat,
the inaugural Blaise Pascal lecture in 

1373
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:43,910
1978.
I'm Malcolm Muggeridge,

1374
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:47,320
said the waste was in danger of eating 
itself out from within.

1375
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,680
And he spoke at great length about this 
attempt to,

1376
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:57,270
um,
about how the West was abandoned in 

1377
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:00,641
Christianity and it'll become a very 
empty and soulless and financially 

1378
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:03,050
bankrupt places a result.
But it wouldn't be the end.

1379
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:08,440
He said,
despite the attempts to kill it in 

1380
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:10,991
places like communist China and Russia,
there will always be people who will 

1381
01:09:11,571 --> 01:09:14,720
fight through to the truth.
Of course,

1382
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:17,480
we can see now three decades own 
whatever,

1383
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,550
that he was absolutely right,
closer to four decades.

1384
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,050
And he was right.
Well,

1385
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,420
you know,
that Christianity is spreading faster in

1386
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:28,421
communist China than it did in Rome 
during its most rapid period of 

1387
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:29,180
expansion in terms of proportion of 
people transforming.

1388
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,270
So Christianity is spreading incredibly 
quickly in China,

1389
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,610
which is who would have guessed that,
right?

1390
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:35,080
I mean,
that's,

1391
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,770
that's,
that just makes you,

1392
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,830
makes you shake your head.
Tell us a little more about your Chilean

1393
01:09:39,831 --> 01:09:40,360
experience.

1394
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:42,440
I mean Canada and Australia culturally 
in many ways,

1395
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:47,441
very like if it can happen in in Canada,
presumably he's coming here.

1396
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,070
Oh,
it's how it's going to happen here.

1397
01:09:49,071 --> 01:09:54,071
I think it's absolutely inevitable.
It's not that big a move from where 

1398
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:59,081
you're already at and the fact that 
while the quantas airline thing is a 

1399
01:09:59,081 --> 01:09:59,600
really good example,
the fact that these things are happening

1400
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:04,601
and that corporations aren't standing up
in outrage against the introduction of 

1401
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:08,501
ideas like equity.
It's like you guys are all primed for 

1402
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:08,501
this.
Why not compelled speech?

1403
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,730
Especially if it's done for the best of 
all possible reasons.

1404
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:14,420
I was accused of denying the identities 
of the oppressed.

1405
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,470
It's like,
well,

1406
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,020
for me that wasn't the issue at all at 
all.

1407
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,800
You know?
She was,

1408
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,420
no,
look,

1409
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:23,720
I'm not an advocate of hate speech laws 
for the reasons I've already described.

1410
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:25,310
It's like who's going to define hate?

1411
01:10:25,610 --> 01:10:28,940
Not In the people you want to define it.
For sure.

1412
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:31,400
That's what's going to happen.
That's bad enough,

1413
01:10:31,790 --> 01:10:33,380
but then to say,
well,

1414
01:10:33,381 --> 01:10:38,180
I have to use the language of my 
detestable radical leftists,

1415
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,230
leftists photos.
Let's say that's not happening,

1416
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:43,730
so,
and that's what I said,

1417
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:48,731
so you go videos,
some of the most wonderful Australians 

1418
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:50,420
on our corporate leaders and you know,
the generous philanthropic,

1419
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,880
they thoughtful they're contributors to 
the public debate,

1420
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,580
but I'd have to say far too many of them
seem,

1421
01:10:55,910 --> 01:11:00,910
I'll use the expression piggy ignorant 
of the reality that they are playing 

1422
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:04,211
with.
They're playing with cultural forces 

1423
01:11:04,211 --> 01:11:07,360
that will destroy the very activities 
that they would hold up as being central

1424
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:13,361
to our wealth and prosperity.
Those cultural forces are playing with 

1425
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:13,361
them.

1426
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:19,820
Oh yes.
So those are astute people can't 

1427
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:22,191
realize,
don't see there being toyed with there 

1428
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:22,191
being toyed with,
with,

1429
01:11:22,191 --> 01:11:24,300
with,
with demonic forces in a sense.

1430
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,580
And again,
I mean that in a psychological sense,

1431
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,720
Carl Jung said,
people don't have ideas.

1432
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:36,530
Ideas have people just like you would 
think about that for about five years.

1433
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,730
You know,
like the,

1434
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:43,310
if you take the typical student radical 
out of their demonstration and you have 

1435
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:45,570
a chat with them one on one,
you find out that,

1436
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,420
you know,
they're the daughter of the guy down the

1437
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:50,490
street that you wave to,
you know,

1438
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:55,610
while she was growing up and that 80 
percent of her is sensible person,

1439
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:00,920
you know,
and 10 percent is resentful and 10 

1440
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:03,390
percent is ideologically possessed 
partly because of the machinations of or

1441
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:08,450
idiot professors and so she's okay,
but if you get 10 of her together and 

1442
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:14,391
each of them are 10 percent possessed,
then you have the whole devil in the 

1443
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:14,391
room.

1444
01:12:14,391 --> 01:12:15,570
Right.
And that thing has a will.

1445
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:20,990
It has a historical will and you better 
not be thinking you're running the show,

1446
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:27,080
especially if you're ignorant of the 
process and the corporate types who are 

1447
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:30,801
letting the radical left fifth column 
into their midst and mostly through 

1448
01:12:30,801 --> 01:12:33,150
their human resources,
their human resources departments,

1449
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,000
which would,
should probably just be shut down.

1450
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:40,240
They have no idea what they're missing,
what they should watch,

1451
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:45,290
what happens to google.
I'll have to say I've been pretty 

1452
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:48,231
stunned by two or three of the senior 
chairman in this country who have said 

1453
01:12:48,231 --> 01:12:51,771
to me or said to friends of mine in the 
context of recent politically correct 

1454
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:56,261
the bites here,
that they'd been startled themselves by 

1455
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:59,961
wall.
The companies underneath of them have 

1456
01:12:59,961 --> 01:13:03,531
said [inaudible],
which raises some interesting questions 

1457
01:13:03,531 --> 01:13:05,040
about they need to get up to speed.
They're not startled enough.

1458
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:07,250
So I've watched.

1459
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,300
I've seen many people have sent me the 
sorts of training programs,

1460
01:13:10,301 --> 01:13:13,740
but the diversity consultants are 
foisting on the corporate world.

1461
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,270
I mean it's,
it's,

1462
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,440
it's as if a woman's studies program has
been placed in the midst of the 

1463
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:20,850
corporate environment.
It's the.

1464
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,410
It's not only,
it's not only the academic left,

1465
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,820
let's say,
made,

1466
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,760
made manifest in,
in a powerpoint presentation.

1467
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:33,140
It's the worst elements of the activist.
Academically.

1468
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:38,330
The most appalling parts of the 
university are making themselves 

1469
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:41,721
manifest in the corporate world at an 
amazing rate and the corporations are 

1470
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:43,050
guilty partly because,
well,

1471
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:48,110
partly because of inequality.
I would say they're guilty and they 

1472
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,961
wanted wallpaper over there.
Bad Conscience with with some hand 

1473
01:13:50,961 --> 01:13:52,380
waving to to the equality pushers.
It's like,

1474
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:56,490
well,
play with that at your peril.

1475
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:00,090
So it's a very bad idea.
Diversity,

1476
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,410
inclusivity,
equity.

1477
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:04,230
That's a bad game if you're going to be 
burned,

1478
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,030
if you play it and in ways you can't 
imagine.

1479
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:08,370
So great.
Already.

1480
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,100
Freedom Fan was respectful.
Debate

1481
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,840
a lot.
That's right.

1482
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:16,940
Responsibility,
justice,

1483
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:22,080
that is a good one.
Let's circle back to young people 

1484
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,980
because the future is going to belong to
them before we know it.

1485
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:29,700
A remarkable and very insightful and 
engaging human being.

1486
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:38,330
Jonathan Heit is perhaps a lad in 
example,

1487
01:14:38,531 --> 01:14:43,000
of somebody who's seen from a left 
perspective himself had dangerous all of

1488
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:48,001
his ears on how we're endangering young 
people by not being honest with them,

1489
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:54,720
not encouraging them to,
to explore what they instinctively feel 

1490
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:58,921
needs to be explored going back to our 
earlier topic and when leaving them 

1491
01:14:58,921 --> 01:15:03,391
without the resilience that they going 
to need to confirm if you like a free 

1492
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,300
and prosperous society.
And,

1493
01:15:08,301 --> 01:15:09,240
uh,
I had a Christian,

1494
01:15:09,241 --> 01:15:12,400
he run relating to this,
which I'd just like to read,

1495
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:15,430
uh,
in his piece,

1496
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:20,490
the coddling of the American mind,
Jonathan Heit outlines why millennials 

1497
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:24,901
today are so fragile and lacking 
resilience in life and in relationships 

1498
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:31,130
in university courses in the workplace,
and what has led to this overwhelming 

1499
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:34,210
push to be protected from anything 
difficult or uncomfortable or offensive.

1500
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:39,040
And he calls it the flight to safety.
And I think you've used that expression,

1501
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:45,190
um,
he outlines the core reason for this 

1502
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,941
fragility of mind and emotion.
He says it stems firstly from 

1503
01:15:47,941 --> 01:15:49,300
overfunctioning and over protective 
parents.

1504
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:54,870
Then schools,
now Richard's into our university just 

1505
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:55,120
because more people than ever go to 
universities in the waste.

1506
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:00,360
So they formed a much bigger bulk in our
community afterwards and it leaves them 

1507
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,220
tragically unprepared and unarmed for 
life and relationships.

1508
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:08,990
Would you comment on.
I think it's good to take a step back 

1509
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:11,590
from that and think about it in the 
broadest possible terms.

1510
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:16,330
There is definitely an epidemic of 
overprotective parenting,

1511
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:21,370
but it's useful to ask why.
And my suspicions are,

1512
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:24,370
is that this is driven by very 
fundamental,

1513
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:30,480
biological and cultural phenomena that 
aren't generally considered in 

1514
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:30,480
relationship to this issue.

1515
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,380
We don't have very many children.
We don't have

1516
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:37,720
12,
you know,

1517
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,650
six of who die.

1518
01:16:40,990 --> 01:16:43,150
We have one or two

1519
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,310
and that makes them very precious,
right?

1520
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,040
We're unwilling to take risks with them 
and no wonder.

1521
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:52,580
And then we also have the much later in 
life.

1522
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,490
And so like if you have a kid when 
you're 18,

1523
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:57,500
you're still a kid,
you know,

1524
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,200
you're gonna go out and have your life,
right?

1525
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:04,760
Because you're so while you're in the,
in the height of your exploratory,

1526
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:10,780
you're,
you're in the height of the exploratory 

1527
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:10,780
part of your life.

1528
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:13,280
You're not going to overprotect your kid
because you're still a kid.

1529
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:18,910
But if you're 40 and you have one child,
it's like all your eggs are in one 

1530
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,930
basket.
And the probability that you're going to

1531
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:24,620
take undue risks with that precious 
person is very,

1532
01:17:24,621 --> 01:17:26,870
very low.
Now obviously there's some advantages to

1533
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:31,871
that because great,
you would devote resources to your 

1534
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:31,871
child,
you know,

1535
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:34,961
and foster their development.
But the downside is that you have every 

1536
01:17:34,961 --> 01:17:39,341
motivation to hover and maybe you're 
also extraordinarily desperate as a 

1537
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:44,171
mother to maintain that bond with your 
child because you struggled so long to 

1538
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:47,030
achieve it.
It's highly,

1539
01:17:47,031 --> 01:17:50,210
highly valuable.
You can't take a risk well.

1540
01:17:50,211 --> 01:17:52,670
So these.
So what we might say,

1541
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:57,671
well perhaps over protective parenting 
is a secondary and unintended 

1542
01:17:57,671 --> 01:18:00,911
consequence of the birth control pill.
And the fact that people now have 

1543
01:18:00,911 --> 01:18:01,970
children later in life could easily be,
you know,

1544
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:03,140
if you have six kids,
it's like,

1545
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:03,440
what are you gonna?

1546
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,110
Do a helicopter parent them?
It's like,

1547
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:07,700
no,
you're so tired.

1548
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:10,940
You can't even get off the couch.
If you have six kids and they're.

1549
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:12,290
They outnumber you,
right?

1550
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:17,291
They're raising each other.
They're competing and they're taking 

1551
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:17,291
each other down a peg.
They're not.

1552
01:18:17,291 --> 01:18:21,490
There's no overprotection there,
but with a single child landscape or 

1553
01:18:21,711 --> 01:18:25,400
dual child landscape,
mostly a single child landscape.

1554
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:30,401
Then you're going to overprotect and 
then that ethos starts to permeate the 

1555
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:35,111
schools and it starts to permeate the 
higher education institutions as those 

1556
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:37,700
children mature.
And then that all reinforces it.

1557
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:43,030
Not Good.
It's not obvious what to do about it 

1558
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,221
either,
because if it is driven by demographics 

1559
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:45,221
in that,
in that sense,

1560
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:45,830
it's a much more intractable problem 
that we think.

1561
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:49,220
So.
I did some of that in 12 rules for life,

1562
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:49,700
you know,
I said,

1563
01:18:49,701 --> 01:18:54,701
look,
what you have to understand is that 

1564
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:54,701
you're a danger to your children no 
matter what.

1565
01:18:54,701 --> 01:18:59,680
Right?
You can let them go out into the world 

1566
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:01,940
and be hurt or you can overprotect them 
and hurt them that way.

1567
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,530
So you,
here's your choice.

1568
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:08,630
You can make your children competent and
courageous or you can make them safe,

1569
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,690
but you can't make them safe because 
life isn't safe.

1570
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,890
So if you sacrifice their courage and 
competence on the altar of safety,

1571
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:20,060
then you disarmed them completely and 
all they can do is pray to be protected.

1572
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:24,890
That's so in the very act of trying to 
do the right thing by them.

1573
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:29,220
Although often with a selfish motive,
right off roading,

1574
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:34,930
we scrip why the tools and the 
equipment,

1575
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:38,780
the understanding they really need to 
make life work.

1576
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:39,740
Oh,
that's the.

1577
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,910
That's the diploma mother,
right?

1578
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:43,520
That was Freud's great discovery of the 
dark mother.

1579
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:47,240
The dark mother is the person.
She's the witch in Hansel and Gretel.

1580
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:51,050
Gingerbread house.
Lost Children.

1581
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,490
Too.
Good to be true.

1582
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,740
It's like a house of candy.
Wow.

1583
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,610
Who could want anything better?
What lives inside the House of Candy,

1584
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:02,180
the which that wants to fatten you up 
and eat you.

1585
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,840
Right.
A cautionary tale about over protective 

1586
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,410
parents,
over protective mothers about the over 

1587
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:12,270
protective feminine.
It's like the psychoanalysts.

1588
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:17,271
They were so smart,
said the good mother necessarily fails 

1589
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:19,170
at such a brilliant phrase.
It's like you can't.

1590
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:23,640
As you,
as your child matures,

1591
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:25,830
you have to fail more and more as a 
mother,

1592
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:27,690
right.
Until by the time you're 30,

1593
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:30,450
you're your child's 30,
let's say 25 for that matter.

1594
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:34,740
You're not their mother anymore.
I mean obviously you are,

1595
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:38,340
but the relationship has hit something 
like quasi peer status,

1596
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:43,400
not entirely obviously,
but the child's independent able to 

1597
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:43,830
stand up on their own two feet and take 
on the world.

1598
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:49,110
Now we say the university student runs 
into some difficulties with study or 

1599
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:52,971
whatever.
Brings a parents in to talk to the 

1600
01:20:52,971 --> 01:20:52,971
faculty.

1601
01:20:52,971 --> 01:20:52,971
Yeah.
Or they go off in color,

1602
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,900
I mean when I went to Queens University 
a week ago and there was a lot of noise 

1603
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,650
and and horror around that,
you know,

1604
01:21:00,651 --> 01:21:05,651
that the people who were decrying my 
visit set up coloring book stations so 

1605
01:21:05,651 --> 01:21:06,980
that people could be comforted because 
you know,

1606
01:21:06,981 --> 01:21:09,740
the evil professor was coming to talk.
It's like,

1607
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:14,860
and you know,
as a clinician and height knows this as 

1608
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:14,860
well,
and all the clinicians worth their salt.

1609
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:14,860
No,
this.

1610
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:19,990
The worst thing you can do for someone 
who's anxious is overprotect them.

1611
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:26,290
It makes them worse.
The clinical literature on that is 

1612
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:28,691
crystal clear.
What you do for people who are hyper 

1613
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:31,481
anxious is gradually expose them with 
their voluntary consent to increasingly 

1614
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:38,081
threatening situations that cures them.
It's exactly the opposite of what all 

1615
01:21:38,081 --> 01:21:41,630
the mental health professionals so and I
use that term extraordinarily lightly,

1616
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:45,980
are trying to do to produce safe spaces 
on the university campus.

1617
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:51,320
Like if as safe as a space needs to be 
defined as safe,

1618
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:54,020
you can be sure that's the one thing.
It is not.

1619
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,350
Jordan,
this has been fascinating.

1620
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:00,170
Let me pay you a compliment.
In some ways,

1621
01:22:00,171 --> 01:22:05,171
I think the most valuable thing you can 
do for us is to model the courage to 

1622
01:22:05,571 --> 01:22:08,360
speak your mind.
You do it forcefully,

1623
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:13,780
you do it courageously,
you do it compassionately because the 

1624
01:22:13,780 --> 01:22:17,951
reality is you only have to spend a bit 
of time with you to realize that you 

1625
01:22:17,951 --> 01:22:22,181
actually care,
especially about our young people and 

1626
01:22:22,181 --> 01:22:25,571
what they're experiencing and especially
for our young men because we know boys 

1627
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:30,670
model themselves,
all men who they respect you.

1628
01:22:33,201 --> 01:22:34,580
They are a great job of modeling

1629
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,440
in the face of,
well,

1630
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,830
there's something I like to say maybe in
closing about courage.

1631
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:43,340
People say that to me and you know,
I don't think it's exactly right.

1632
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:45,620
There's A.
There's a line in the old testament.

1633
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:49,070
The fear of God is the beginning of 
wisdom and I think it's more like that.

1634
01:22:49,071 --> 01:22:54,071
It's not that I'm courageous,
it's that I'm afraid of the right 

1635
01:22:54,071 --> 01:22:55,050
things.
So when I made my videos,

1636
01:22:55,051 --> 01:22:56,930
it wasn't like that didn't make me 
nervous,

1637
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:02,620
but I was less nervous about going back 
to bed and not saying what I had to say 

1638
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:05,530
that I was about making the videos 
because I know where this is going,

1639
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:10,870
I don't want to go there.
And so it's not so much courage.

1640
01:23:10,871 --> 01:23:13,380
It's that it's a matter of uh,
it's,

1641
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:18,570
it's,
it's less risky to say something than to

1642
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:21,670
remain silent when you know,
there's something to be said.

1643
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,880
I know that to be the case.
And so lots of times in life it's like 

1644
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,170
there's no pathway forward that's going 
to shield you from risk.

1645
01:23:29,171 --> 01:23:31,930
You get to pick this risk or you get to 
pick this risk.

1646
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,380
And I think I picked the lesser risk and
that might be wise,

1647
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:37,900
but I'm not so sure it's courageous.
Well,

1648
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,090
I think it's admirable.
Let's leave it on that basis.

1649
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:42,160
Alright,
thank you.

1650
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,010
Thank you very much for the 
conversation.
