1
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:21,863
Dear a Dr. Harris,
please forgive me and this goes for 

2
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,500
whatever audience this video might 
attract for reading this,

3
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,503
but I need to make this quick and 
coherent and this is the fastest way of 

4
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:38,770
doing so.
I want you to address some of the issues

5
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:42,010
that I believe made our discussion both 
more trying and less valuable.

6
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:42,844
That might've been a problem that many 
of the people who now listened to it 

7
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:47,554
rightly identify.
I think that our discussion would 

8
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:52,414
perhaps would be more productive if we 
started from the realization that we're 

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:00,570
both trying to address the same problem.
What is the relationship between science

10
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:01,564
and ethics?

11
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,263
Okay,

12
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,203
you see,
ethics is nested inside scientific 

13
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:06,824
realism.
Now obviously that's a contentious 

14
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,380
claim,
which is not the same as it being wrong,

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,900
but the fact that it's contentious re 
David Hume and his problem with deriving

16
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,560
an art from an is means that there is a 
real problem there.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,230
I see scientific rate realism is nested 
inside Darwinian competition,

18
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,260
at least potentially,
not necessarily.

19
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,094
I could be wrong,
but I am trying to address the real 

20
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:35,514
problem
and I think the fact that you're 

21
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,004
addressing the science slash ethics 
problem indicates that you see that 

22
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,780
there's a real problem there too.

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,080
Okay.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,380
I also think we only got to the problems
with my formulation,

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,470
not the problems with your solution.
For example,

26
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,663
the problem with measuring wellbeing,
you consider the enhancement of 

27
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,740
wellbeing,
the proper and of ethics.

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,173
However,
the psychological measures of wellbeing 

29
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,250
currently used are almost only trait 
extroversion minus trait neuroticism.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,993
That's happiness minus sadness.
Well that's how well being is currently 

31
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,490
defined.
Well,

32
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:18,450
that proposition is faulty in every way.
It's a big problem.

33
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,050
It's a measurement problem.
It's a scientific realism problem.

34
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,300
You might say,
well,

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,940
we need better measures of wellbeing,
and I would say,

36
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:27,774
well exactly,
and those will have to be nested inside 

37
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:34,230
the Darwinian conundrum.
How should we act in the world?

38
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,463
Here's an answer individually so that 
the family thrives at the family level 

39
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,644
so that society thrives at the societal 
level so that the ecosystem thrives and 

40
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,520
and not just today,
tomorrow,

41
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,430
next week,
next year and across time.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,073
That's the problem.
The developmental psychologist John 

43
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,733
Piaget was trying to address when he 
studied the moral development of 

44
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,584
children.
Piaget was interested in solving the 

45
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,510
problem of the relationship between 
science and ethics,

46
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,344
and he looked how he looked at how 
ethics in children emerged and 

47
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,530
transformed into adulthood.
That's what drove his entire life.

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,610
He was trying to formulate a scientific 
solution to the problem and ethics,

49
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,890
and I've drawn a lot of my thinking from
that.

50
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,700
Okay,

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
now I'm going to jump to a level of 
analysis,

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,773
and when I do so,
it will make many think I've gone off 

53
00:03:28,761 --> 00:03:33,380
the rails of this argument.
I ask for your indulgence.

54
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:36,500
While I tried to put things together 
that have not yet been put together,

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,513
this means that I have to present many 
ideas simultaneously as if looking at a 

56
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:45,800
picture or as if describing a picture,
which is how these ideas have frequently

57
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:46,634
been represented.
The individual who acts in this 

58
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,630
equilibrated manner is the mythological 
hero.

59
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,890
It's the mythological hero who confronts
the attention,

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,873
the unknown,
with a tension and intent to 

61
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:04,550
communicate.
It's the archetypal hero who obtains the

62
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:07,880
gold from the eternal dragon,
the dragon of chaos.

63
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,253
That's an evolved representation of the 
predatory but promising domain beyond 

64
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:16,130
the safety of the tree or the campfire.

65
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,403
Okay.

66
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,370
It's the archetypal hero who distributes
the goal that he,

67
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,220
that he obtains from the dragon to the 
community.

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,593
It's him who rescues the youthful virgin
from the predatory reptile that Saint 

69
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,880
George,
it's the oldest story.

70
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,714
We know it's in the Enuma Elish,
the Mesopotamian creation myth upon 

71
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,830
which the opening lines of genesis are 
founded.

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,290
Can't you see an evolutionary 
relationship

73
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,830
that's the archetypal hero.
That's first a way of behaving.

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,893
Second,
it's a representation of that way of 

75
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,980
behaving.
Third,

76
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:54,814
it's a way of organizing society itself 
around that action and representation 

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,063
forth.
It's that society that then selects 

78
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,243
through masculine competition for the 
best contender to that representation 

79
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,213
and finally,
it's what is selected for by women who 

80
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,400
peel off the top of the masculine 
competition.

81
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,353
Women outsource the impossible cognitive
task of mate selection to the male 

82
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:21,454
dominance hierarchy.
Hero emerges at the top of the 

83
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,730
competition.
He gets all the girls.

84
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,463
It's that what's it's that which is 
selected for and he human females 

85
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,860
perform part of the selection process 
there.

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,713
Mother Nature,
the selection apparatus that choosy 

87
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:42,160
maters it.
Female chimps or not.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,570
Okay.

89
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,403
The archetype will hero might be 
regarded as a super meme in Richard 

90
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,143
Dawkins terminology,
it's been around so long that we have 

91
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:53,564
adapted biologically to its existence 
just as we have in every way to the 

92
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,450
presence of the 300 million year old 
dominance hierarchy,

93
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,030
which is more permanent,
more real,

94
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,864
even from a strictly realist perspective
than such evanescent phenomena as 

95
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,050
amphibians,
reptiles and mammals.

96
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,790
It's even older than trees.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,630
Okay.

98
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,463
The closer you are to that article hero,
the more likely you are at least as a 

99
00:06:20,551 --> 00:06:21,384
male to when the dominance hierarchy 
contest that makes you attractive to 

100
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:25,704
women.

101
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,070
Okay.

102
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,880
If Richard Dawkins who formulated the 
idea of the meme was wiser,

103
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,080
he would have been Carl Young.
An archetype is the ultimate meme.

104
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,400
Okay.

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,950
In my opinion,
we need to have a real conversation.

106
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,680
Not An argument.
It's not that I think you're wrong,

107
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,530
it's that I think that there's a real 
problem here,

108
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,260
which we both recognize and are both 
trying to solve.

109
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,000
If none of this makes even the least bit
of sense,

110
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,100
if it doesn't at least peak your 
curiosity,

111
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,950
if you can't see that we're obsessed by 
the same problem,

112
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,100
then we won't be able to talk and that 
would be a shame.

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,400
You're very sharp and precise,
but I think in patterns somebody said,

114
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,604
listening to us was like the right 
hemisphere of a single brain talking to 

115
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,710
the left.
That's a good metaphor.

116
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,533
There wouldn't be so many people trying 
to get us to talk if we didn't have 

117
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:17,774
something to discuss.
The relationship between science and 

118
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,044
ethics is vitally important.
If we had a real conversation and no 

119
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,910
fault is employed on your part,
we might be able to further the solution

120
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:33,911
to the problem.
Thanks for listening and watching.
